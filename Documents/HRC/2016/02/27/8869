<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
6/27, and constitutes the second annual report submitted to the Council since the current 
Special Rapporteur, Raquel Rolnik, assumed her functions on 1 April 2008.1 It focuses on 
the impact of sporting mega-events on the realization of the right to adequate housing. In 
the first part, the Special Rapporteur discusses the positive and negative legacies of the 
Olympic Games and World Football Cup on host cities and host countries, from the point 
of view of the right to adequate housing. In the second part, she outlines the relevant 
international human rights framework and obligations. The third contains an overview of 
the procedures and regulations of these events relevant to the right to housing. Lastly, the 
Special Rapporteur presents some preliminary recommendations to protect the right to 
adequate housing in all stages of the mega-event process, from the initial bid phase through 
to the planning and preparation phases and the staging of the event to the post-event legacy. 
The report draws on information provided by a range of sources, including the reports of 
previous mandate holders and the findings of a workshop organized in June 2007 by the 
Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions with the participation of the previous mandate 
holder, Miloon Kothari, as well as remarks on earlier drafts from the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mega-events and their impact on city transformation 
</b></p>
<p>2. Until the 1930s, the Olympic Games and other international sporting events left few 
traces on the urban landscape. In 1932, the city of Los Angeles used the games as an 
opportunity to uplift the local economy, and built the first Olympic Village with 
characteristics of permanent housing.2 After the Second World War, the Olympic 
movement gathered unprecedented force, attracting Government support under the 
framework of sport as a social goal, which included the construction of public sports 
infrastructure and promotion of sports activities. In the 1970s, the combination of staging 
international sporting events and processes of urban transformation became more evident, 
with a policy of building sports infrastructure in central areas as a strategy for urban 
renewal in city centres.3 
</p>
<p>3. In 1980, the International Olympic Committee adopted a philosophy of progressive 
incorporation of the private sector in the promotion of the Games. In the 1990s, organizing 
mega-events as a component of cities&#8217; strategic planning, with a view to repositioning them 
in a globalized economy, became the hegemonic practice. Staging international games as an 
economic development strategy, which includes urban infrastructure renewal and real estate 
investments, became the contemporary approach by cities and states to mega-events.4 
</p>

<p>4. The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona signalled this new approach. The Olympic 
Games were used as a resource to implement a double agenda: modernizing infrastructure 
and promoting a new public image of the city by building innovative international 
architecture.5 Both elements are present, with more or less intensity, in contemporary 
relations between sport mega-events and their host cities, causing a great impact on the 
social and economic development of the city.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Mega-events and their impact on the right to adequate 
housing 
</b></p>
<p>5. Mega-events can be an opportunity to potentially enhance the right to adequate 
housing. The redevelopment processes undertaken in preparation of mega-events can 
promote infrastructural and environmental improvements for the host cities. This includes 
the enhancement of mobility, the cleansing of contaminated areas, the development of 
waste management and sanitation, the provision of social and cultural infrastructure, and 
the construction of new dwellings, or the rehabilitation of the existing ones, that may 
increase the availability of housing stock in host cities. 
</p>
<p>6. The impact of mega-events on the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing for all 
is, however, less clear. Numerous past experiences have shown that redevelopment projects 
adopted in preparation for the games often result in extensive human rights violations, 
particularly of the right to adequate housing. Allegations of mass forced evictions and 
displacement for infrastructural development and city renewal, reduced affordability of 
housing as a result of gentrification, sweeping operations against the homeless, and 
criminalization and discrimination of marginalized groups are frequent features in cities 
staging the events. The impact of these practices is mainly endured by the most 
disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society, such as low-income populations, ethnic 
minorities, migrants, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and marginalized groups (such as 
street vendors and sex workers).  
</p>
<p><b> A. A positive housing legacy 
</b></p>
<p>7. The staging of mega-events commonly serves as a catalyst for the initiation and 
implementation of housing development plans in host cities. Greater flows of public and 
private investment are allocated to the construction industry once a city has been designated 
to host the events. Thus, host cities normally experience unprecedented construction 
activities that translate into greater availability of jobs and housing stock. Given the number 
of dwellings needed to accommodate large numbers of visitors, the city is faced with large-
scale redevelopment and urbanization. Urban development also often includes public plans 
for urban renewal, generally the &#8220;beautification&#8221; and &#8220;upgrading&#8221; of certain areas. Both 
central and peripheral areas of host cities are subject to transformation. Once the event is 
finished, the new dwellings may be available for the local residents, who will find their city 
transformed.  
</p>
<p>8. Examples of post-event use of venues for local housing include (a) in Moscow, the 
1980 Olympic Games marked the culmination of a policy of construction of social housing 
with the transformation of the Olympic Village into 18 apartment blocks of 16 floors; (b) in

Identity in the Age of Globalization</i>, Proceedings of the Second International Conference of CSAAR, 
Tunis, pp. 577&#8211;588, 2005.  </p>


<p>Athens, the Olympic Village constructed for the 2004 Olympic Games resulted in 3,000 
new units of subsidized housing that benefited 10,000 residents;6 (c) in London, half of the 
2,800 units in the Olympic Village are to become affordable housing after the Games, while 
current plans for the Olympic Park site are for around 10,000 new homes, around 35 per 
cent to be affordable housing.7 
</p>
<p>9. The staging of mega-events usually entails the redevelopment of public transit 
networks and transport systems, environmental upgrading and the increased availability of 
cultural venues, sport facilities and public open spaces for city dwellers. All these 
investments, if designed with an inclusionary perspective, benefiting the majority, can have 
a positive impact on the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>10. To offer diverse and good-quality alternatives for circulation during the mega-event 
and incorporating them into the mobility strategies of the cities, most host cities build new 
highways and city ring roads, recuperate downtown streets, enhance railroad networks, 
expand underground and tramway systems, and enlarge airports or build new ones. 
Depending on the nature of these interventions, they can ameliorate housing conditions, 
providing more access for residents to economic, social and cultural opportunities. 
</p>
<p>11. Examples of infrastructural improvement include (a) in Barcelona, a new airport and 
a city ring road were built in preparation for the 1992 Olympic Games; (b) in Athens, a new 
tramway and a city ring road were constructed and the metro system was expanded in 
preparation for the 2004 Olympic Games; and (c) in Beijing, a new airport, new train and 
metro railways and two ring roads were built for the 2008 Olympics.8  
</p>
<p>12. Environmental concerns are also a big component of the preparation for hosting a 
sporting mega-event. This became more evident in the aftermath of the 2000 Olympic 
Games in Sydney. Pressured by environmental organizations and new parameters 
underlined by the International Olympic Committee, the organizing committee incorporated 
environmental concerns into the organization of the event. Since then, local host authorities 
include environmental strategies into their planning and take the opportunity to improve 
waste management facilities, reorganize garbage collection, clean streets and contaminated 
areas, build public parks and other green initiatives. They also embark in more complex 
campaigns, often resuming long-overdue plans for environmental upgrading, such as 
cleaning up polluted rivers and lakes, renovating or extending the sewage system, 
introducing systems to manage air pollution, upgrading systems for energy production 
(natural gas pipelines, dams, electric networks) and relocating polluting industries.  
</p>
<p>13. Examples of environmental upgrading include (a) in Tokyo, three sewage treatment 
plants were constructed in the run-up to the 1964 Olympic Games; (b) in Seoul, the 
polluted Hang River was cleaned and new systems to handle air pollution and collect 
garbage were created in preparation for the Olympics; and (c) in Beijing, 640 km of sewage 
pipes were renovated and two natural gas pipelines created in the run-up to the 2008 
games.9 
</p>
<p>14. Hosting Olympic and football events has positive implications for the availability of 
sports facilities for the local population once the event concludes. A range of stadiums, 
training centres, sports fields and other amenities are constructed during this period to 
respond to the demands of the events. Social activities are also significantly enhanced by 
the development of new and improved cultural venues, designed to provide additional

<p>attractions for the visiting public. The arrangements for the events also often increase the 
number of open public spaces, green and recreational areas. In addition to the sport 
facilities built to host the games and afterwards made available to the public, examples of 
increased availability of cultural and sports facilities include (a) in Seoul, new cultural 
houses were built before the Olympic Games; (b) in Barcelona, theatres, museums and art 
galleries were renovated in preparation for the Games; and (c) in Athens, archaeological 
sites underwent preservation work in the run-up to the Olympics.10 
</p>
<p><b> B. A negative housing legacy 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the period between the designation of the host city and the staging of the event, 
cities normally undergo a series of transformations that not only affect their urban 
infrastructure, but also bring about economic, social and demographic changes that have 
long-term consequences for the local population. While analysis of the impact of these 
events usually focuses on the economic benefits for the host city, less attention goes into 
evaluating the effect on the lives of the residents, especially the most disadvantaged sectors 
of society. Regrettably, the legacy of hallmark events on the situation of these people has 
been far from positive. The alleged economic benefits of staging the games are not spread 
evenly throughout the local population. Instead, old disparities appear to be exacerbated as 
the processes of regeneration and beautification of the city usually focus on areas mostly 
populated by poor and vulnerable groups. The lasting consequences of mega-events often 
include disquieting patterns, as described in the section below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Evictions 
</b></p>
<p>16. Displacement and forced evictions are common features of preparations for mega-
events. The heightened demand for space to construct sports venues, accommodation and 
roads is channelled through urban redevelopment projects that often require the demolition 
of existing dwellings and the opening of space for new construction. The importance given 
to the creation of a new international image for the cities, as an integral part of the 
preparations for the games, often implies the removal of signs of poverty and 
underdevelopment through reurbanization projects that prioritize city beautification over 
the needs of local residents. As public authorities use the organization of mega-events as a 
catalyst for the regeneration of their city, residents of the affected areas may face mass 
displacement, forced evictions and the demolition of their homes. Displacement may also 
result from the measures taken by local authorities to quickly remove unsightly slums from 
areas exposed to visitors, even without being framed within larger redevelopment projects. 
</p>
<p>17. In most cases, alternatives to evictions are not sufficiently explored, displacement is 
not accompanied by prior consultation with the affected communities, and adequate 
compensation or alternative housing is not provided to victims. In addition, evictions 
almost never allow the return of former dwellers to newly built homes. Indeed, owners, 
tenants and squatters are often subjected to pressure by public authorities or private 
developers to leave the area, their rights are seldom recognized, and they receive no 
guarantees of return to the redevelopment site. In many occasions, evictions are carried out 
in a context of violence, harassment and assaults against the inhabitants. Time constraints 
are usually cited as the reason for disruptive and violent evictions and disregard for the 
rights of affected communities.  
</p>
<p>18. Examples of evictions due to the construction of sporting venues, accommodation 
for visitors and infrastructure improvements include: (a) in Seoul, 15 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>  
 10 Ibid. </p>


<p>population was forcibly evicted and 48,000 buildings were demolished in preparation for 
the 1988 Olympic Games;11 (b) in Barcelona, 200 families were evicted to make way for 
the construction of new city ring roads prior to the 1992 Olympic Games;12 (c) in Beijing, 
nine projects related to venue construction, covering over one million square meters, 
involved relocation of residents;13 allegations of mass evictions were reported, sometimes 
conducted by unidentified men, in the middle of the night and without prior warning, and 
with residents and housing activists often subject to repression, harassment and arbitrary 
detention;14 (d) in New Delhi, 35,000 families were evicted from public lands in preparation 
for the 2010 Commonwealth Games;15 (e) in South Africa, the N2 Gateway housing project 
involving the construction of rental housing for the 2010 World Cup entailed the removal 
of over 20,000 residents from the Joe Slovo informal settlement, and local residents were 
moved to impoverished areas at the edge of the city;16and (f) in London, the Compulsory 
Purchase Order, issued in preparation for the 2012 Olympic Games, and that grants powers 
to local authorities to assemble land required for major regeneration projects, forces 
residents to leave Olympic districts.17 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Indirect displacement due to gentrification 
</b></p>
<p>19. Although not directly a consequence of the construction of facilities to host the 
games or the urbanization projects aimed at improving the image of the host city, mass 
displacement may also result from indirect processes, such as gentrification and escalating 
housing costs. Gentrification can be triggered by the redevelopment projects undertaken in 
preparation for the events. Once involved in regeneration processes, underdeveloped 
neighbourhoods attract high-income earners, who start moving into the area. The sudden 
interest of real estate investors in areas previously considered of low market value raises 
property and rental prices. This has an impact on affordability for local residents, and often 
results in their de facto expulsion from the area. In particular, tenants who have no means to 
rent the new premises are forced to resettle in other regions, and often receive no 
compensation, alternative housing or financial aid. Property owners are sometimes included 
in joint development programmes with private developers, which ensures them access to 
the new residences; in other cases, they are forced to sell and leave the area either as a 
result of increased costs or of intimidation from construction companies.  
</p>
<p>20. Consequently, gentrification and escalating prices have the effect of forcing out low-
income communities in favour of middle- and upper-class residents. The community thus 
suffers a major change in its demographic composition. While middle- and high- income 
populations move into former poor areas and find housing increasingly available, former 
residents are pushed to the outskirts of the city, losing their communal ties and enduring 
further impoverishment owing to the reduction of employment and schooling opportunities, 
as well as the increase in their commuting costs.

<p>21. Examples of displacement due to gentrification and escalating housing costs include 
(a) in Seoul, apartment prices increased by 20.4 per cent in the first eight months of 1988, 
and land prices soared by 27 per cent in 1988, the steepest rise since 1978; 18 (b) in 
Barcelona, the increase in house pricing during the five-year period surrounding the Games 
was 131 per cent, while in the rest of the country prices increased by 83 per cent19; in 1993, 
a year after the Olympics, house prices only rose by 2 per cent;20 (c) in Atlanta, around 
15,000 low-income residents were forced out of the city as the annual rent increase rose 
from 0.4 per cent in 1991 to 7.9 per cent in 1996 in preparation for the 1996 Olympic 
Games; 21 (d) in Sydney, the increase in house pricing during the five-year period before the 
Games was 50 per cent while in the rest of the country prices increased by 39 per cent;22 (e) 
in Beijing, around 1.5 million people were displaced from their homes to allow for urban 
renewal in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games,23 (f) in London, property prices in the 
areas surrounding the Olympic site increased by 1.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent after the 
announcement that the city had won the bid, while in the rest of the city prices were down 
by 0.2 per cent.24 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Reduction in the availability of social and low-cost housing 
</b></p>
<p>22. The impact of redevelopment and beautification processes on housing accessibility 
and affordability is even greater when it affects neighbourhoods containing low income 
dwellings and social housing. Frequently located in poor areas of the city, social housing 
provides local residents with a low-cost housing opportunity, sometimes subsidized by the 
State. However, redevelopment projects executed in preparation for mega-events, for the 
most part undertaken in underdeveloped neighbourhoods, tend to target social housing 
dwellings in their demolition plans. Given the fact that many housing projects are State-
owned, redevelopment projects tend to demolish them to open space for new developments. 
The availability of low-cost housing is thus dramatically reduced rendering these groups 
even more vulnerable to violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>23. Examples of decreased availability of social housing include (a) in Atlanta, 1,200 
social housing units for the poor were destroyed in preparation for the Olympic Games; 25 
(b) in Sydney, reports suggest that around 6,000 people were made homeless in the run-up 
to the Olympics;26 (c) in Vancouver, more than 1,400 low-income housing units were lost 
in connection to real estate speculation generated by the 2010 Winter Olympic Games;27 (d) 
in South Africa, the Minister for Housing noted that plans to build hundreds of thousands of 
new low-cost homes could be affected by shifting budget demands in the run-up to the 2010 
World Cup (A/HRC/7/16/Add.3, para. 69); (e) in London, the Clays Lane State, a historic 
social housing on the Olympic Park site where around 400 people lived, was demolished.

<p>According to the London Development Agency, the site did not meet the Government&#8217;s 
Decent Homes Standard.28  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Impact on informal settlements 
</b></p>
<p>24. The situation of people living in informal settlements is of particular concern in the 
context of preparations for mega-events. As a symbol of poverty and underdevelopment, 
these buildings are normally seen as ruining the image that the city intends to promote 
staging the Games. Regarded as unsightly and lacking security of tenure, informal 
settlements are the first to be demolished when a mega-event is to be staged in a city. The 
areas where these settlements are located are frequently used either to build sporting venues 
and accommodation facilities for visitors or to develop new dwellings for local residents. In 
many cases, informal settlements are displaced to build new infrastructure such as roads, 
highways and railways, or because they do not fit into the new urban landscape. Local 
governments usually fail to compensate adequately, or offer alternative adequate housing 
to, the displaced residents of informal settlements. Entire communities are forced to 
relocate, generally to the outskirts of the city or to rural areas, where they find no means of 
subsistence, few employment opportunities or little access to informal markets, and where 
they find themselves removed from communal ties. Residents of informal settlements often 
include ethnic minorities, migrants, low-income populations and other disadvantaged 
groups.  
</p>
<p>25. Examples of the impact of mega-events in informal settlements include (a) in Dallas, 
200 to 300 people were evicted from shanty towns in preparation for the 1994 Football 
World Cup;29(b) in South Africa, the Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of 
Slums Act was adopted with a view to eliminate slums and put homeless shack dwellers in 
transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup;30 (c) in Rio de Janeiro, the <i>Vila do 
Autodromo</i> and other several informal settlements are under threat of eviction owing to the 
construction of venues for the 2016 Olympic Games.31 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Criminalization of homeless persons and informal activities 
</b></p>
<p>26. The situation of homeless people also deteriorates in the context of mega-events. 
Shortly before the events are staged, some local authorities take measures to remove 
homeless people from areas exposed to visitors. The homeless are sometimes offered 
incentives to leave these areas, but in most cases they are subject to forced removal and 
relocation during the events. Specific legislation is introduced, criminalizing acts such as 
sleeping in the street and begging. Similarly, street vendors and sex workers are targeted by 
laws that forbid them to carry out their activities in the city while the event is taking place. 
There are reported cases in which camps or large facilities have been used to accommodate 
homeless people and other &#8220;unsightly&#8221; groups during the duration of an event. In this 
context, some observers have highlighted a disquieting trend in host cities to introduce a 
&#8220;rationale of exception&#8221; in the management of public life in preparation for the event, 
where restrictions of rights and standards of due process are allowed, if considered 
necessary, to ensure the realization of the event.32 In addition, as displacement increases 
and the availability of social housing, informal settlements and temporary residences 
decreases, the number of homeless persons may grow.

<p>27. Examples of the criminalization of homeless persons and marginalized activities 
include (a) in Seoul, beautification efforts for the 1988 Olympic Games included the 
detention of homeless people in facilities outside the city;33 in preparation for the 2002 
Football World Cup, local authorities in Seoul created a list of places where homeless 
persons were banned;34 (b) in Barcelona, the homeless were removed outside the city 
during the staging of the games;35 (c) in Atlanta, homelessness and related activities were 
made illegal and over 9,000 citations were issued against homeless people.36  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Disproportionate impact on groups particularly vulnerable to discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>28. The negative legacy of mega-events is particularly felt by the most disadvantaged 
sectors of society. These groups are disproportionately affected by trends such as forced 
evictions, displacements, decreased availability of social housing, reduced affordability of 
housing, homelessness, dislocation from existing community and social networks, 
restriction of civil liberties and criminalization of homelessness and marginalized activities. 
Displacement and forced evictions due to beautification and gentrification tend to affect 
low-income populations, ethnic minorities, migrants and the elderly, who are forced to 
leave their homes and relocate in areas far from the centre of the city. Likewise, policies 
and special laws adopted to &#8220;cleanse&#8221; the city result in the removal of homeless persons, 
beggars, street vendors, sex workers and other marginalized groups from central areas and 
their relocation into special sites or outside the city. 
</p>
<p>29. Examples of the disproportionate impact on groups particularly vulnerable to 
discrimination include (a) in Athens, Roma communities were the main target of 
displacement;37 (b) in Atlanta, displacement was predominantly experienced by African-
Americans;38 (c) in Sydney, aboriginal communities were displaced from areas close to the 
Olympic sites in an effort to beautify the city;39 (d) in Beijing; most victims of evictions 
were migrant workers;40 (e) in Vancouver, the city is funding private security guards to 
remove homeless persons and beggars from commercial areas (A/HRC/10/7/Add.3 para. 
87). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Tensions surrounding mega-events: mobilization and negotiations 
</b></p>
<p>30. In many cases, affected communities and interest groups perceive that the initial 
proposal from the authorities for the organization of a mega-event may encompass 
violations of the right to adequate housing, such as the forced eviction of local residents, the 
criminalization of homelessness and other similar practices. In response, the affected 
population and social organizations mobilize to resist the proposal and demand its 
reformulation. In some cases, social resistance has resulted in negotiations with the 
concerned parties, the adoption of a different strategy and a redefined plan that incorporates 
the demands of the affected population and aims at protecting the rights of the local 
population.

<p>31. Examples of social mobilization and renegotiation in the organization of mega-
events include (a) in preparation for the 1996 Olympic Games in Athens, the authorities 
planned to demolish a housing complex facing one of the most prominent Olympic routes, 
but, because of the strong resistance of the local residents and housing activists, the 
buildings were not demolished;41 (b) in the run-up to the 2007 Pan-American Games in Rio 
de Janeiro, the Comite Social do PAN intervened before local authorities to request the 
redirection of several plans for the event, including to prevent the eviction of the <i>Vila do 
Autodromo</i>; 42 (c) in 2002, responding to the official plans for the 2010 Olympic Games in 
Vancouver, the Impact of the Olympics on Community Coalition advocated for a 
referendum on the Games and made a number of recommendations to the Vancouver 2010 
Bid Corporation, which eventually led to the commitment of the authorities to community 
benefits from the Games and the Inner-City Inclusive Commitment statement, promises 
incorporated into the bid documents for 2010.43 
</p>
<p><b> IV. International human rights framework applicable to mega-
events 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection from forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>32. Forced evictions are prima facie incompatible with the requirements of the 
International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and can only be justified 
in the most exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with the relevant principles of 
international law.44 The obligation of States to refrain from forced evictions applies in all 
circumstances, including in the context of mega-events. States must at all times ensure that 
the law is enforced against its agents or third parties who carry out forced evictions45 and 
provide everyone with security of tenure and legal protection against forced evictions.46 The 
basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement, drafted 
by the previous mandate holder, provide further guidance.47  
</p>
<p>33. Where evictions are justified, they must be carried out in strict compliance with the 
relevant provisions of international human rights law and in accordance with general 
principles of reasonableness and proportionality. Particularly, the following procedural 
protections should be applied: (a) an opportunity for genuine consultation with those 
affected; (b) adequate and reasonable notice to be given to all affected persons prior to the 
scheduled date of eviction; (c) information on the proposed evictions and, where applicable, 
on the alternative purpose for which the land or housing is to be used, to be made available 
in reasonable time to all those affected; (d) especially where groups of people are involved, 
Government officials or their representatives to be present during an eviction; (e) all

<p>persons carrying out the eviction to be properly identified; (f) evictions not to take place in 
particularly bad weather or at night unless the affected persons consent otherwise; (g) 
provision of legal remedies; and (h) provision, where possible, of legal aid to persons who 
are in need of it to seek redress from the courts.48 Even when evictions are justified and 
practiced according to the appropriate procedural protections, they should not result in 
individuals being rendered homeless, and the State must take all appropriate measures, to 
the maximum of its available resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, 
resettlement or access to productive land is available.49  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to participate in decision-making and local communities 
</b></p>
<p>34. In the context of mega-events, the right to participation and information of local 
communities becomes paramount. The events involve and affect the population residing in 
the host city, particularly those living in redevelopment areas and game sites. Public 
housing strategies should &#8220;reflect extensive genuine consultation with, and participation by, 
all of those affected.&#8221;50 Furthermore, prior to any evictions, all feasible alternatives must be 
explored in consultation with the affected persons, with a view to avoiding the need to use 
force.51 Information concerning the alternative purpose for which the land or housing is to 
be used is also required, as is genuine consideration of the alternatives proposed by the 
affected population.  
</p>
<p>35. In keeping with the basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions 
and displacement, development processes and urban planning should fulfil the following 
requirements: (a) appropriate notice given to all potentially affected persons that eviction is 
being considered and that there will be public hearings on the proposed plans and 
alternatives; (b) effective dissemination by the authorities of relevant information given in 
advance, including land records and proposed comprehensive resettlement plans 
specifically addressing efforts to protect vulnerable groups; (c) a reasonable time period for 
public review of, comment on, and/or objection to the proposed plan; (d) opportunities and 
efforts to facilitate the provision of legal, technical and other advice to affected persons 
about their rights and options; and (e) the holding of public hearings providing affected 
persons and their advocates with an opportunity to challenge the eviction decision and/or to 
present alternative proposals and to articulate their demands and development priorities 
(E/CN.4/2006/41, appendix, para. 37).  
</p>
<p><b> V. Procedures and regulations of the Olympic Games and the 
Football World Cup and their relationship with the right to 
adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>36. As the two major sporting events in the world, the Olympic Games and the FIFA 
World Cup have the power to influence and set examples for other events, whether related 
to sports, culture or other fields. This analysis would also apply to other major events. 
</p>
<p>37. Although the Olympic Games and the World Cup are commensurable in terms of 
dimension and public attraction, it should be noted that the Olympic Games are staged in 
one city, while the World Cup involves multiple cities in one or even several countries.

<p>When the event is focused in one city, the pressure and demands upon its residents are more 
significant. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The Olympic Movement and the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Olympic Games are the biggest sporting event in the world. Games are held 
every two years, alternating between summer and winter Olympic Games. The Olympic 
movement links all organizations and individuals who agree to be guided by the Olympic 
Charter, in force since 7 July 2007, and who recognize the Movement&#8217;s ultimate governing 
body, the International Olympic Committee.  
</p>
<p>39. The Olympic Charter regulates the organization of the Olympic Movement and the 
celebration of the Olympic Games. It codifies the &#8220;fundamental principles of Olympism&#8221; 
and has binding force on all members of the Movement. Fundamental principle 2 of the 
2007 version of the Charter notes that the &#8220;goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service 
of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society 
concerned with the preservation of human dignity.&#8221; The Charter also establishes the 
principle of non-discrimination (principle 5), endorses sustainable development and 
promotes the idea of leaving a positive legacy from the Olympic Games for the host city 
and the host country. In addition, the Olympic parties are bound by a code of ethics, which 
restates the obligation to respect the principles of dignity of the individual and non-
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>40. In 1999, the International Olympic Committee adopted the Olympic Movement 
Agenda 21 &#8220;Sport for sustainable development&#8221;, which, among other purposes, aims to 
combat social exclusion and promote sports infrastructure that are better suited to social 
needs.52 Agenda 21 pays particular attention to the fate of minorities and the most 
disadvantaged members of society. Moreover, it endorses the fight against poverty and the 
integration of disadvantaged social groups, as well as the adoption of development policies 
and practices. Agenda 21 also supports the promotion of a viable model for human 
settlements. It requires that sports infrastructures be harmoniously integrated into the local 
context, and that new constructions boost local housing strategies and integrate the poorest 
members of society. The greater involvement of the local population in the Olympic 
preparations through proper regulations and procedures is also encouraged.  
</p>
<p>41. The normative framework of the Olympic Movement has certain provisions 
pertaining to human rights. The right to adequate housing is not directly addressed in the 
Olympic Charter, but in Agenda 21, which is only a declaratory instrument; hence, the 
provisions are not readily enforceable. To ensure that the practices of the institution are in 
conformity with housing rights and standards, it is important that they be addressed clearly 
in binding norms.  
</p>
<p><b> B. FIFA and the right to adequate housing  
</b></p>
<p>42. Founded in 1904, the F&#233;d&#233;ration internationale de football association (FIFA) is 
responsible for the organization and governance of football's major international 
tournaments, most notably the FIFA World Cup. FIFA is ruled by its statutes, updated in 
June 2009, which provide the basic instrument for world football and sets out the 
functioning of the institution. The statutes are also accompanied by regulations governing 
</p>
<p>  
 52 Agenda 21 was adopted in conformity with the Agenda 21 of United Nations Conference on 
</p>
<p>Environment and Development. </p>


<p>their application. In 2004, the FIFA Executive Committee approved a code of ethics, which 
was subsequently amended in 2006. The code of ethics requests all FIFA officials to 
comply with the principles and objectives of FIFA. The supreme body of FIFA is its 
Congress, which elects the President and the Executive Committee. The FIFA Ethics 
Committee is its third judicial organ, alongside the Disciplinary Committee and the Appeals 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>43. The core values of FIFA are defined as authenticity, unity, performance and 
integrity. Among the general provisions of its statutes, FIFA incorporated a policy of &#8220;non-
discrimination and stance against racism&#8221;, as well as the promotion of friendly relations in 
&#8220;society for humanitarian objectives&#8221;. In 2005, the FIFA Congress introduced a new pillar 
to the institution&#8217;s mission, summarized now as: &#8220;Develop the game, touch the world, and 
build a better future&#8221;. Understanding football as an &#8220;integrated part of society&#8221;, FIFA has a 
duty &#8220;to spearhead a concrete and positive contribution to sustainable development through 
football&#8221;. FIFA has also decided to play a socially responsible role and has committed itself 
to making a major contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.53 
</p>
<p>44. Overall, despite these recent commitments, it is difficult to find in FIFA procedures 
and regulations any standards to help the institution and its members integrate a human 
rights approach to its daily activities. Although the changes in the FIFA mission are 
commendable, it is necessary to translate them into practice. It is particularly important that 
international standards on the right to adequate housing be introduced in the procedures and 
regulations involved in the organization of the FIFA World Cup. This could be a first step 
towards the realization of a new mission for the federation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Bidding and selection processes 
</b></p>
<p>45. The bidding or selection process is the first stage in the preparation for a mega-
event. It is also a key moment to introduce the necessary standards to ensure that the 
protection of human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing, will be endorsed by 
all relevant stakeholders and guaranteed throughout the organization of the event. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. International Olympic Committee 
</b></p>
<p>46. The procedures of the International Olympic Committee concerning the bidding and 
selection process are bound by the Olympic Charter and the code of ethics. In addition, the 
&#8220;Rules of Conduct applicable to all Cities wishing to organize the Olympic Games&#8221; (2007) 
are enforceable as soon as a city submits its application. 
</p>
<p>47. The bidding and selection process of the Committee is a fairly structured and 
formalized procedure with a number of stages, institutions and requirements involved. The 
stages include the selection of an applicant city at the national level, the procedure of 
acceptance of international candidatures, the candidature procedure and the selection of the 
host city. Once a city has been selected as host, it enters a host city contract outlining the 
rights and obligations of each party. The Committee can withdraw the bid of a city and 
revoke the permission of a host city to organize the Olympics. The Ethics Commission may 
also investigate complaints of infringement of the code of ethics. In addition, the 
Committee does not enter into agreements with organizations that do not comply with 
Olympic Movement principles. These procedures serve as an accountability and 
enforcement mechanism that can be used to ensure that the candidate or host cities comply 
with their commitments, Olympic principles and international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>  
 53 &#8220;Football for Hope&#8221;, FIFA, Zurich, 2004, pp.8&#8211;9. </p>


<p>48. The requirements for the applicant and candidate cities are considerable. Firstly, 
applicant cities must submit letters of guarantee that the Games will comply with the 
Olympic Charter, and a short questionnaire with an overview of their planning project. 
Secondly, as part of the candidature procedure, they must submit a detailed candidature 
questionnaire pertaining to a range of issues (including plans for the development and use 
of sporting and accommodation venues, and binding international legal obligations 
affecting the organization of the event). Thirdly, they must undertake and submit an 
independent opinion poll concerning popular support for the Olympic project. Since 2008, a 
positive trend concerning housing has been introduced to the process, as cities are required 
to explain the post-Olympic use of new accommodation. The 2016 Candidature Procedure 
and Questionnaire54 request information on the requirements for land acquisition and 
displacements, and their conformity with international standards. Similarly, the basic 
principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement are made 
available to future host cities55. The commitments made at the candidature stage are binding 
for the candidate city if selected as host city.56  
</p>
<p>49. Overall, the International Olympic Committee has developed a fairly structured and 
institutionalized mechanism for the bidding process and selection of host cities. In addition, 
the transparency of these procedures facilitates social accountability. Thus, the bidding and 
selection process offers many opportunities for addressing the right to adequate housing at 
an early stage; indeed, the 2016 questionnaire incorporates a few housing concerns. No 
information suggests, however, similar practices in other procedures, such as in letters of 
guarantee or host city contracts. Likewise, the Rules of Conduct applicable to all Cities 
wishing to organize the Olympic Games do not encompass requirements in this regard. To 
guarantee compliance with the principles of Olympism and with the commitments adopted 
in Agenda 21, it is important that housing concerns be adequately tackled in all stages of 
the Committee&#8217;s bidding process.  
</p>
<p>50. Between 2006 and 2007, the previous Special Rapporteur, maintained a fruitful 
engagement with the Committee, through exchange of correspondence and meetings with 
representatives of the organization. At meetings in 2007, they addressed the impact of the 
Olympic Games on the realization of the right to adequate housing and measures to prevent 
violations. The Committee also collaborated in the preparation of the present report, 
providing comments and useful information.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. FIFA 
</b></p>
<p>51. Information concerning the selection process of countries to host the FIFA World 
Cup is not readily available to the general public. The Special Rapporteur unsuccessfully 
approached FIFA authorities to request information concerning the procedures and 
regulations involving the organization of the World Cup. From 2006, the previous Special 
Rapporteur, has sought out FIFA to engage in a dialogue in this respect. Since her 
appointment in May 2008, the current Special Rapporteur has renewed that invitation on 
several opportunities; however, no response from the organization, or comments to the 
present report, have been forthcoming. Given the lack of transparency and accountability of 
any relevant procedures, it is difficult to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing 
methods and mechanisms, and to identify the good and bad practices of the institution with 
regard to selection procedures.

<p>52. Despite the lack of official information in this regard, the public announcement for 
the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups and the bid registration and 
rules of conduct applicable to those events offer some insights into the process. According 
to the announcement, future host countries will be expected to ensure that efforts are made 
to achieve positive change in keeping with the FIFA philosophy: &#8220;for the game, for the 
world&#8221;. 57 The announcement also describes procedures leading to the selection of the host 
countries for 2018 and 2022. At different stages of the candidature, applicant member 
associations must complete and submit to FIFA an expression of interest form, a bid 
registration form, a bidding agreement, a bid book, a hosting agreement and other 
documents. In view of the bid proposals received by FIFA, its Executive Committee will 
appoint the host member associations of the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups.58  
</p>
<p>53. According to the bid registration form and the rules of conduct, integrity is essential 
to the bidding process; and applicant member associations must comply with the FIFA code 
of ethics. In addition, FIFA can request the Ethics Committee to conduct an evaluation of 
the bidding process in relation to the rules of conduct. Although this provides a normative 
framework and accountability tool for the 2018 and 2022 bid, the Rules of Conduct remain 
an ad hoc directive applicable to this particular bid, while the framework for future bids 
remains unclear. Moreover, no housing regulations or requisites are incorporated in the 
code of ethics, the bid registration form, or the rules of conduct. Nonetheless, the code of 
ethics requests all FIFA officials to refrain from any conduct that could be harmful to its 
principles and aims. 
</p>
<p>54. The process for the 2018 and 2022 football World Cups offers a number of 
opportunities to incorporate housing concerns into the early stages of the preparation for the 
Cup. Indeed, the bid book requested from applicant member associations provides an 
opportunity to request detailed information concerning the expected impact of the event on 
the housing sector.  
</p>
<p>55. The Technical Recommendations and Requirements for Football Stadiums (2007) 
address certain housing concerns. Organizers are asked to bear in mind that proximity to 
existing residential areas is the most sensitive issue in the development of a new stadium 
and, if possible, should be avoided. In addition, they are asked to establish early contact and 
consultation with local community representatives concerning the location and design of 
the stadiums, to ensure that the stadiums are integrated into the community and enhance the 
life of local residents. Although these recommendations are of great importance for the 
protection of the right to adequate housing of the local population, it is important that they 
be included in the bidding requirements for candidate countries as well as in bidding and 
hosting agreements, so as to guarantee their effective implementation. 
</p>
<p>56. Overall, FIFA procedures lack information accessible to the general public. 
Transparency and accountability are crucial to guarantee that the event will not undermine, 
but enhance, the human rights of local populations. In addition, although FIFA regularly 
issues rules of conduct applicable to each bidding process, there is no normative framework 
applicable to all bids. Guidelines for all bidding procedures must be adopted by FIFA. As 
no housing concerns have been introduced to the FIFA bidding process, there seem to be no 
means to assess and ensure candidates&#8217; compliance with the right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur hopes that a constructive dialogue with FIFA regarding 
these issues can be established in the near future.

<p><b> D. Role of candidate cities and countries in the bidding process: positive 
and negative practices 
</b></p>
<p>58. During the bidding process, authorities of candidate cities and countries expose their 
strategy for the organization of the event and make commitments to the International 
Olympic Committee or FIFA, the local population and the international community as a 
whole. Housing concerns and commitments, however, are often neglected in the planning 
and bidding process, which can lead to violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>59. States have the duty to respect, protect and fulfil the right to adequate housing. 
States neglect their duties when in planning and bidding to host events they fail to respect 
existing access to housing, to regulate and monitor actions by State agents and third parties, 
to grant adequate legal and institutional protections, to investigate and prosecute abusers or 
to provide redress to victims. 
</p>
<p>60. In recent years, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA bidding processes 
have resulted in some good and bad practices from candidate cities with regard to housing. 
Focusing on the events to be held in coming years, it is important to trace back the housing 
commitments of the bid proposals and evaluate compliance.  
</p>
<p>61. London&#8217;s bid book for the 2012 Olympic Games encompassed an environmental 
impact assessment with socio-economic aspects, but no attention was paid to, or 
independent impact assessment conducted on, the housing impact of the event, nor was an 
explicit commitment to respect human rights included in the proposal. Nonetheless, the 
London bid entails a commitment to limit the construction of new venues to a minimum to 
avoid disrupting the existing housing stock, limiting the number of possible forced 
evictions. The London bid also included a commitment to devote 50 per cent of new 
dwellings to social housing.59 Official plans also indicate that 10,000 new homes, 35 per 
cent of which will be affordable housing, and several community facilities will be 
constructed in the Olympic Park to combat the historic deprivation in the area. Regardless 
of these commitments, a number of social housing units are being destroyed in connection 
with the Games, and local residents are being displaced from Olympic sites (see para. 23 
above). In some cases, however, the authorities have sought to resettle displaced 
communities; for example, the London Development Agency is building new sites to 
relocate 35 traveller families from Hackney and Newham.60 
</p>
<p>62. Some of the practices of the bidding process for the Vancouver Winter Olympic 
Games in 2010 have been considered an example of best practice. When adopting the 
Vancouver Olympic bid book, alongside the Inner-City Inclusive Agreement and the Multi-
Party Agreement, the organizers undertook to ensure that the Games would be socially and 
environmentally sustainable. These commitments included the guarantee that all people 
would benefit from the Olympics and that the most disadvantaged sectors of society would 
not be negatively affected.61 The Inner-City Inclusive Agreement encompassed the 
commitments to avoid evictions, contain house prices, ensure no one was made homeless as 
a consequence of the Olympics and that 30 per cent of new dwellings would be allocated to 
social housing. The Olympic Village in Whistler will be transformed into a residential 
neighbourhood, where most units will be price-restricted and reserved for local residents; 
250 units from the Olympic Village in Vancouver will be assigned to non-market housing; 
10 SRA hotels were acquired to stabilize low-income housing stock; $250,000 were 
allocated to the expansion of Covenant House emergency shelter and $250,000 to

<p>temporary shelter during the Games; and negotiations were sought to ensure that no social 
housing would be included in accommodation for actors.62However, reports indicate that 19 
of the 37 pledges will not be implemented. Indeed, reports indicate a notable increase in the 
number of homeless, a pledge of authorities to increase &#8220;infraction tickets&#8221; for the 
homeless, a lack of access of the homeless to essential services in restricted Olympic areas, 
the dismantling of one-room hotels providing social housing, proposals to cut funding for 
affordable housing, a lack of redress for illegal evictions, a lack of consultation with 
residents, and violations of freedom of expression and association of housing activists.63 
</p>
<p>63. The Bid Book for the 2016 R&#237;o Olympics anticipates the improvement and 
relocation of some settlements and the commitment to comply with national and 
international standards.64 Media reports refer, however, to threatened evictions in some 
settlements, with no information concerning resettlement or compensation (see also para. 
25 above). 
</p>
<p>64. In South Africa, a development agenda was put together for the bid proposal to host 
the 2010 World Cup. With a view to use the Cup as a catalyst for poverty alleviation and 
the struggle against segregation, South Africa committed to not only build or renew sport 
venues and the necessary infrastructure for the Cup, but also to initiate sport programmes in 
disadvantaged neighbourhoods, improve medical services and develop community art 
centres, among other initiatives to improve the life of the less advantaged sectors of society. 
The focus on development in the South African bid and the commitment to foster a more 
inclusive and prosper society, however, do not appear to match reality. Reports show that 
the resources allocated to the preparation of the Cup for the housing budget remain low, 
while those for sport and recreation have dramatically increased.65 
</p>
<p><b> E. Role of sponsors, partners and other corporations in mega-events  
</b></p>
<p>65. Private corporations involved in the preparation and hosting of mega-events should 
behave in compliance with the principles and values of the Olympic Movement and the 
FIFA mission. Furthermore, human rights standards offer additional guidance, as do 
instruments focusing on corporate social responsibility.  
</p>
<p>66. States have the primary responsibility to protect, respect and fulfil human rights; but 
corporations must observe international human rights norms as well as the laws of the 
countries in which they operate.66 The role of the private sector should be addressed from a 
human rights perspective, including victims' access to justice and their right to 
compensation. 67 
</p>
<p>67. Local and national authorities and the organizers of the mega-event, such as the 
International Olympic Committee and FIFA, also have responsibilities concerning the role

<p>of sponsors. As part of their responsibility to protect, it is the obligation of public 
authorities to establish appropriate legal and procedural framework to guarantee that private 
entities, including sponsors, as well as those operating locally in the preparation of the 
event, do not infringe upon the right to adequate housing of the local population. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> In view of the impact of mega-events, it is essential that all relevant 
stakeholders adopt a responsible attitude concerning the impact of the Olympic 
Games, the World Football Cup and similar events on the right to adequate housing. 
Their consequences for the enjoyment of human rights must be duly considered at all 
stages of the event and by all actors involved.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations for States 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> National and local authorities should take all measures necessary to respect, 
protect and fulfil the right to adequate housing in the context of mega-events.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> As candidate cities and countries prepare their bid proposals, housing concerns 
must always be present. Host cities should include commitments to comply with the 
right to adequate housing in their candidatures, bid proposals and hosting contracts. 
To ensure that the impact of hosting the event will not lead to violations of 
fundamental rights, the bidding and planning processes need to be in compliance with 
all relevant international and national standards.  
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> In addition, the proposals should provide for:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Legal security of tenure for owners, tenants and occupants; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Protection against forced evictions, discrimination and harassment of 
local population in connection to the event, and remedy for victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Programmes for the resettlement of and compensation for the affected 
population. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Before submitting a bid proposal, State and local authorities should conduct an 
assessment of the impact that the preparations for the event will have on the right to 
adequate housing of local residents. The housing impact should also be monitored 
throughout the organization of the event. In addition, post-event audits should be 
undertaken to assess the legacy of the event in the housing sector. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>To strengthen transparency and accountability, local authorities must involve 
in their planning process, from the tendering stage, all those who will be affected by 
the preparation of the event and give genuine consideration to their views. 
Participation should also be open to civil society organizations, including those 
working in the promotion of the right to adequate housing. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>State and local authorities should refrain from forced evictions in the 
preparation for mega-events. Where evictions are justified, they should be undertaken 
in full compliance with the relevant provisions of international human rights law and 
according to the procedures underlined in general comment No. 7 and in the basic 
principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>It is important to ensure that the housing stock created as a result of the mega-
event responds to the housing needs of the host city. Priority should be given to </b></p>


<p><b>projects and investments plans that create and improve low-income housing, 
including informal settlement upgrading and regularization.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The authorities should ensure that their actions, and those of third parties 
involved in the organization of the event, contribute to the creation of a stable housing 
market. Steps can be taken to prevent speculation in housing prices and to deliver 
more affordable housing.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Urgent attention must be given to those living in distressed housing conditions 
and homeless people to ensure that their situation does not deteriorate as a result of 
mega-events.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Legislation must be enacted to guarantee that homeless people will not be 
subjected to harassment and receive appropriate support, services and 
accommodation. Guarantees may also be given to ensure that homeless people and 
other groups, such as sex workers and street vendors, will not be criminalized in 
connection to the organization of the event.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Special attention should be paid to groups particularly vulnerable to 
discrimination to ensure that the impact of hosting a mega-event does not adversely 
affect them. States must ensure respect for the principles of non-discrimination and 
gender equality.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>States should adopt a regulatory framework to ensure that the actions of 
sponsors and other private entities involved in the mega-event comply with the right 
to adequate housing. A comprehensive and formal set of criteria should be adopted 
for the selection of sponsors and partners.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Provisions pertaining to the right to adequate housing should be adopted in all 
contractual agreements with third parties involved in the organization of the event. 
States should investigate and sanction any violation of the obligations set out in the 
agreements and in international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations for the International Olympic Committee and FIFA 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>To ensure that the Olympic Games and the World Cup do not result in 
violations of the right to adequate housing, the International Olympic Committee and 
FIFA should evaluate the bid candidatures against compliance with international 
standards on the right to adequate housing and guarantee that only those in 
conformity with the standards are selected.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In addition, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA should require 
detailed information in the candidature questionnaire pertaining to housing issues, 
and demand an assessment of the housing impact of the candidature project. The 
Committee and FIFA should ask candidate associations and cities to inform about: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Strategies for monitoring the housing impact throughout the 
organization and after the event;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Procedures to investigate and sanction violations of the right to adequate 
housing and to offer redress to victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Regulations and procedures to enforce security of tenure; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Regulations and procedures to protect against forced evictions, 
discrimination and harassment against local populations in connection with the event; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Mechanisms to provide compensation and resettlement for affected 
persons.  </b></p>


<p>84. <b>In selecting the host city or association and closing an agreement with them, the 
International Olympic Committee and FIFA should incorporate housing provisions in 
the hosting agreements. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The International Olympic Committee and FIFA should ensure that their 
bidding and selection procedures are open to scrutiny by civil society. They should 
require candidates to undertake open and transparent planning and bidding processes 
involving civil society, including organizations representing the housing sector and 
affected persons. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The International Olympic Committee and FIFA should evaluate whether the 
actions of third parties envisaged in the projects of candidate cities are adequately 
regulated and do not allow deviations from housing standards.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Likewise, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA should select the 
sponsors for their events according to detailed criteria taking into account the records 
of the companies concerning corporate social responsibility and respect for 
international human rights standards. Priority should be given to corporations that 
have appropriate codes of conduct or social corporate responsibility initiatives.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In contractual agreements with sponsors, partners and private companies for 
the preparation of events, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA should 
incorporate contractual clauses that regulate the actions of these corporations in 
conformity with human rights standards, including the right to adequate housing. 
Explicit provisions should be incorporated to prevent corporations from executing 
forced evictions, harassing or intimidating local populations and discriminating 
against vulnerable groups. Finally, corporations should be held accountable and 
redress should be provided to the victims of any abuse. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The International Olympic Committee and FIFA should include reference to 
housing standards in their main normative instruments such as their charter, statutes, 
codes of ethics, or rules of conduct. They should also consider mechanisms to monitor 
and evaluate compliance with these standards by all relevant stakeholders involved in 
mega-events, investigate and sanction abuses and establish complaint procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The International Olympic Committee and FIFA should ensure that the 
institutional and legal frameworks for the bidding and selection processes address the 
right to adequate housing.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The adoption of more structured and institutionalized mechanisms for FIFA 
selection processes is highly desirable to monitor candidates&#8217; compliance with their 
obligations pertaining to housing.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>FIFA must ensure that all of its procedures and regulations concerning the 
preparation of mega-events, including the bidding and selection processes, are made 
public and easily accessible.
