<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 7/19 the Human Rights Council urged States to &#8220;take actions to prohibit the 
dissemination, including through political institutions and organizations, of racist and 
xenophobic ideas and material aimed at any religion or its followers that constitute incitement to 
racial and religious hatred, hostility or violence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. In paragraph 16 of that resolution, the Human Rights Council requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights &#8220;to report on the implementation of the present resolution 
and to submit a study compiling relevant existing legislations and jurisprudence concerning 
defamation of and contempt for religions to the Council at its ninth session&#8221;. In accordance with 
that request, the High Commissioner submits to the Council a report on the implementation of 
that resolution (A/HRC/9/7), and the present study. 
</p>
<p>3. To prepare the report and the study, on 24 April 2008, the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) sent a note verbale to Member States, regional 
organizations, national human rights institutions (NHRIs) and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), requesting information on the implementation of the resolution and on existing 
legislations and jurisprudence concerning defamation of and contempt for religions. OHCHR 
received contributions from nine Member States,<b>1</b> one regional organization (the Council of 
Europe) and five NGOs in consultative status with ECOSOC, which are summarized in 
A/HRC/9/7. Section V of the present study summarizes replies received from Member States 
regarding national legislation and jurisprudence. 
4. The study presents preliminary findings from research conducted by OHCHR on 
international, regional and national legislations and relevant jurisprudence concerning 
defamation of and contempt for religions. Information on national legislation and jurisprudence 
is limited to the replies received. 
</p>
<p>5. Section II of the study summarizes relevant provisions of international instruments and 
jurisprudence related to freedom of religion, permissible restrictions on freedom of expression 
and religion, and incitement to religious hatred and violence. Section III refers to the conclusions 
and recommendations made by Special Rapporteurs and former mandate-holders, and Section IV 
reviews regional norms and jurisprudence on freedom of thought, conscience and religion and 
freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>6. Resolution 7/19 follows a series of resolutions on defamation of religions adopted by the 
General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council. 
The common concern in these resolutions revolve around several related themes, primarily the 
stereotyping and negative portrayal of religions, in particular Islam, the association of Islam with  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Argentina, Bahrain, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mauritius 
</p>
<p>and Turkey. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>violence and terrorism in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States 
of America, the dissemination of ideas based on superiority, discriminatory laws, policies and 
practices that have targeted minority religious groups, and physical attacks on individuals and 
communities and their properties and places and symbols of worship. 
</p>
<p>7. While these resolutions make reference to &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221;, it appears that they 
often use the term in the generic sense to describe some of the above phenomena - notably 
hostile statements, unfair association with violence, stigmatization, ridicule, insults against 
religion, attacks, &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; - rather than in the strict legal sense. In this context the 
resolutions perceive defamation in conjunction with the need to combat hatred, discrimination, 
intimidation, coercion, etc. Thus, paragraphs 8 and 9 of resolution 7/19 urges States &#8220;to prohibit 
the dissemination ... of racist and xenophobic ideas and material aimed at any religion or its 
followers&#8221;, and calls on them to provide &#8220;adequate protection against acts of hatred, 
discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting from the defamation of any religion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. The notion of defamation as is known in many national legal systems is designed to protect 
individual reputation and image. In its general legal meaning, it refers to an inaccurate statement 
(oral, written) that is published through various means of communication (printed, audio-visual, 
electronic) and is intended to or actually causes harm to a person&#8217;s reputation. Some national 
laws require the additional element of negligence or malice in the making of the statement. In 
general, the sanction for defamation is a civil penalty, although some countries also recognize 
defamation as a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p>9. Some countries have blasphemy laws which envisage sanctions for profane acts (physical, 
oral, printed, audio-visual, electronic, etc.). Others have adopted specific defamation of religions, 
laws that extend the concept of defamation to protect religions and, in that sense, regard 
defamation of religions as essential to the protection of freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>10. In the framework of international human rights law, the combination of &#8220;defamation&#8221; with 
&#8220;religion&#8221; remains unclear for a variety of reasons. It is within this context that this study is 
framed around the following questions: 
</p>
<p> (a) To what extent the concept of defamation of religions can be derived from existing 
international human rights law framework; 
</p>
<p> (b) The scope of existing international human rights law related to religion - namely, the 
freedom of religion or belief, discrimination on the basis of religion and incitement to religious 
hatred and violence - and if it sufficiently addresses the phenomena with which the resolutions 
are concerned; 
</p>
<p> (c) The implications of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; to the international human rights 
framework, particularly the relationship to freedom of expression and other fundamental human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND JURISPRUDENCE 
</b></p>
<p>11. Issues related to religion are addressed in several international instruments, including the 
United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (ICERD), the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and 
the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination 
Based on Religion or Belief. 
</p>
<p>12. There is no specific treaty on issues related to religion however. Although in its 
resolution 1781 (XVII) the General Assembly in 1962 requested that a draft declaration and a 
draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance be prepared, it is only in 
1981 that the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination 
Based on Religion or Belief was adopted. This suggests the complexity of the subject and the 
lack of consensus on key issues. 
</p>
<p>13. Technically speaking, the declaration is not a binding instrument, but it is considered 
the most comprehensive elaboration of the relevant norms contained in ICCPR and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration addresses two broad themes, religious 
freedom and protection from discrimination. There is no provision regarding incitement to 
religious hatred and violence in the Declaration but this issue is covered in article 20 (2) of 
ICCPR. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>14. Freedom of religion or belief has received considerable attention since the founding of the 
United Nations. The United Nations Charter does not explicitly mention freedom of religion or 
belief, however its human rights provisions provide the normative framework.<b>2</b> Since then, many 
resolutions and the core human rights treaties have been adopted, which deal with freedom of 
religion or belief directly and indirectly.  
</p>
<p>15. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights outlines the parameters of 
freedom of religion or belief. It provides that &#8220;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and 
freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his 
religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. Article 18 of ICCPR provides that &#8220;1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief 
of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or 
private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching. 2. No 
one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or 
belief of his choice. 3. Freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such 
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or 
morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&#8221; Article 1 of the Declaration has 
similar language.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Among the purposes of the Organization, as set out in article 1 of the Charter is to &#8220;promote 
</p>
<p>and encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction 
as to ... religion&#8221;. Articles 13, 55 and 56 also deal with human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. In its article 5, ICERD provides that &#8220;States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate 
racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as 
to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment 
of &#8230; (vii) the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. The three dimensions to freedom of religion or belief as articulated in these instruments are 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In its general comment No. 22 (1993) on article 18, 
the Human Rights Committee notes that freedom of thought and freedom of conscience are 
protected equally with freedom of religion and belief. The fundamental character of these 
freedoms is reflected in the fact that this provision cannot be derogated from, even in time of 
public emergency, as stated in article 4 (2) of ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>19. In addition to the individual right to freedom of religion or belief, the ICCPR also 
stipulates in article 27 that persons belonging to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities &#8220;shall 
not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group to enjoy their own 
culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to use their own language&#8221;. In general 
comment No. 22, the Human Rights Committee points out that the prohibition of advocacy of 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, under 
article 20 (2) constitutes an important safeguard against infringements on the rights of religious 
minorities and of other religious groups to exercise the rights guaranteed by articles 18 and 27, 
and against acts of violence or persecution directed towards those groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Relations of freedom of religion to freedom of expression and other fundamental 
human rights and freedoms  
</b></p>
<p>20. Paragraph 12 of Human Rights Council resolution 7/19 states that freedom of expression is 
not unlimited. Indeed, ICCPR envisages limitations to freedom of expression, in particular 
article 19 (3) which provides that certain restrictions may be imposed on freedom of expression 
in order to protect the rights or reputations of others, national security or public order, public 
health or morals. However, in general comment No. 10 (1983) on freedom of expression, the 
Human Rights Committee underlined that restrictions may not put in jeopardy the right itself. 
The limitations must be &#8220;provided by law&#8221;, they should be imposed for one of the purposes set 
out in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of the article, and they must be justified as being &#8220;necessary&#8221; for 
one of those purposes.  
</p>
<p>21. In the case of <i>Malcolm Ross v. Canada</i> (2000) the Human Rights Committee held that the 
dismissal of a schoolteacher from his teaching position because of anti-Semitic statements that 
he published while he was working as a schoolteacher constituted a restriction covered by the 
limitation clause contained in paragraph 3 of article 19 , and therefore did not violate the author&#8217;s 
right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>22. In <i>Robert Faurisson v. France </i>(1996), the Human Rights Committee held that the 
restriction of the freedom of expression of the author and his prosecution under France&#8217;s 
1990 Gayssot Act which made it an offence to contest the existence of certain crimes against 
humanity under which Nazi leaders were convicted by the International Military Tribunal at 
Nuremberg in 1946 were permissible and necessary under article 19, paragraph 3 (a), of the 
Covenant.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Incitement to religious hatred and violence 
</b></p>
<p>23. In 2006, the High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted a report to the 
Human Rights Council on incitement to racial and religious hatred and the promotion of 
tolerance which outlines in detail the international legal framework with regard to incitement to 
religious hatred and violence (A/HRC/2/6). The report concluded that existing international and 
regional human rights instruments, primarily ICCPR, ICERD and the three regional instruments, 
indicate a broad consensus on the law relating to incitement and advocacy of racial and religious 
hatred and provide a good basis for &#8220;legal and policy responses to the problem of intolerance 
more generally, and the incitement of hatred and violence in particular&#8221; (para. 80). 
</p>
<p>24. The report points out, nevertheless, that the implementation of the relevant norms is weak, 
partly because of lack of clarity on key elements of the law such as the definition of incitement, 
hatred and hate speech. It called for further reflection on the scope of actions that a State may 
legitimately take to curb speech and on ways to strengthen implementation, concluding that 
&#8220;uniform, consistent application of the law is essential to ensure the effectiveness of international 
efforts to counter intolerance&#8221; (para. 84). 
</p>
<p>25. As the High Commissioner&#8217;s report points out, article 20 (2) of ICCPR explicitly prohibits 
any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence. This provision does not set forth a right but a limitation on other rights in 
particular freedom of expression and freedom to manifest religion or belief. During the <i>travaux 
pr&#233;paratoires</i> of the Covenant, fears were expressed that the prohibition of advocacy might be 
abused and, thus, have a detrimental impact on the right to freedom of expression (A/2929, 
para. 190).  
</p>
<p>26. In 1983, the Human Rights Committee adopted general comment No. 11 on the prohibition 
of propaganda for war and inciting national, racial and religious hatred (art. 20), in which it 
expressed the view that the &#8220;required prohibitions are fully compatible with the right of freedom 
of expression as contained in article 19, the exercise of which carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities&#8221;. It further noted that article 20 (2) is &#8220;directed against any advocacy of national, 
racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
whether such propaganda or advocacy has aims which are internal or external to the State 
concerned&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. The Committee also underlined that in order to make article 20 fully effective &#8220;there ought 
to be a law making it clear that propaganda and advocacy as described therein are contrary to 
public policy and providing for an appropriate sanction in case of violation&#8221;. Furthermore, in its 
general comment No. 22 (1993), the Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;In accordance with 
article 20, no manifestation of religion or belief may amount to propaganda for war or advocacy 
of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to hate speech, article 4 of ICERD stipulates that &#8220;States Parties condemn all 
propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race 
or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures 
designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due 
regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights 
expressly set forth in article 5 of this Convention.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>29. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948 in 
article 3 (c) lists &#8220;direct and public incitement to commit genocide&#8221; among punishable acts. This 
is also repeated in article 4, paragraph 3 (c) of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the 
Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law 
Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, article 3 (c) of the Statute of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and article 25, paragraph 3 (e) of the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b>Intersection of race and religion 
</b></p>
<p>30. The permissible limitations to freedom of expression are one of the main issues in the 
discourse on defamation of religions. In paragraph 13 of resolution 7/19, reference is made to 
general recommendation No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
which affirms that &#8220;the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority 
or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression&#8221; (para. 4). The resolution 
asserts that this is equally applicable to the question of incitement to religious hatred.  
</p>
<p>31. While having held the view that discrimination based exclusively on religious grounds did 
not explicitly fall within the scope of the Convention,<b>3</b> the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination has on numerous occasions addressed double discrimination on the 
grounds of race and religion and has stressed the &#8220;intersectionality&#8221; of racial and religious 
discrimination.<b>4</b> It has recommended that religious discrimination be prohibited, including 
against immigrant religious minorities,<b>5</b> and reminded States that they should &#8220;ensure that all 
persons enjoy their right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, without any 
discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, in accordance with 
article 5 (d) of the Convention&#8221;.<b>6</b>

</b>  <i>P.S.N. v. Denmark</i>, <i>A.W.R.A.P. v. Denmark</i> (CERD/C/71/D/36/2006, para. 6.3), referring to 
</p>
<p>the <i>Travaux Pr&#233;paratoires</i> of the Convention, according to which the Third Committee of the 
General Assembly had rejected a proposal to include racial discrimination and religious 
intolerance in a single instrument.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. The Committee also expressed concern about reported cases of &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; following 
the 11 September attacks and recommended that States give early consideration to the extension 
of the crime of incitement to racial hatred to cover offences motivated by religious hatred against 
immigrant communities.<b>7</b> Similarly, it recommended that the motive of religious hatred, together 
with racial or ethnic hatred, be taken into account as an aggravating circumstance in proceedings 
under the criminal law.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  REPORTS AND FINDINGS OF SPECIAL RAPPORTEURS 
</b></p>
<p>33. Reports and studies by special procedures of the Human Rights Council, and previously, of 
the Commission on Human Rights provide further insight into the normative and operational 
dimension of defamation of religions. In the framework of their mandates, through in situ visits, 
dialogue with Governments, studies and periodic reports, special procedures can help to 
articulate and clarify principles and contribute towards standard-setting. The mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, in particular, was created by the 
Commission on Human Rights in 1986 to monitor the implementation of the Declaration and to 
recommend remedial measures, as appropriate. Together with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief has made important contributions on 
relevant issues, including the state of freedom of religion, tolerance, and the scope of State 
responsibility.  
</p>
<p>34. The former Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance repeatedly reported to the Commission on Human Rights and 
Human Rights Council on the issue of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221;. In 2004, for example, he 
submitted a report to the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights in which he 
referred to anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and Islamophobia as forms of discrimination.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>35. In 2006, the Special Rapporteur on racism and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief submitted a joint report to the second session of the Human Rights Council, in 
which they noted that there are close links between the issue of defamation of religions and the 
right to freedom of expression, as well as discrimination and intolerance (A/HRC/2/3, paras. 8 
and 17).  
</p>
<p>36. They also stated that &#8220;international human rights law protects primarily individuals in the 
exercise of their freedom of religion and not religions per se&#8221; (para. 27), noting that &#8220;the right to 
freedom of religion or belief, as enshrined in relevant international legal standards, does not 
include the right to have a religion or belief that is free from criticism or ridicule&#8221; and that 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  CERD/C/63/CO/11, para. 21 (10 December 2003).

</b>  CERD/C/DEU/CO/18, para. 26 (21 August 2008). 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  E/CN.4/2005/18/Add.4, paras. 13, 15, 40, 48. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;defamation of religions may offend people and hurt their religious feelings but it does not 
necessarily or at least directly result in a violation of their rights, including their right to freedom 
of religion&#8221; (paras. 36 and 37). 
</p>
<p>37. The report further emphasized that criminalizing defamation of religions can be 
counterproductive since &#8220;rigorous protection of religions as such may create an atmosphere of 
intolerance and can give rise to fear and may even provoke the chances of a backlash&#8221; (para. 42). 
The Special Rapporteurs recommended that the Human Rights Committee consider the 
possibility of adopting complementary standards on the interrelations between freedom of 
expression, freedom of religion and non-discrimination, in particular by drafting a general 
comment on article 20 of ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>38. In his report to the sixth session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/6/6), the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance underlined that &#8220;fighting religious discrimination in general requires a strong 
focus on preventing the direct and indirect consequences of defamation of religions, including its 
role in legitimizing racist and discriminatory discourse&#8221; (para. 13).  
</p>
<p>39. On 22 April 2008, during the first substantive session of the Preparatory Committee for the 
Durban Review Conference, he suggested, inter alia, that based on his experience in reporting on 
defamation of religions, the focus of the debate on racism and religion should be shifted away 
from defamation of religions to incitement to racial and religious hatred. In his view, while 
defamation of religions is a sociological concept, incitement to racial and religious hatred is a 
legal concept that can be dealt with under international instruments; in the framework of human 
rights, incitement to racial and religious hatred is prohibited by ICCPR, ICERD and the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, and by many national constitutions. 
</p>
<p>40. In her report on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance submitted to the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief underlined that several domestic blasphemy laws &#8220;protect only the prevailing religion in 
the State concerned, or they are applied in a discriminatory sense&#8221; and are used to repress 
minorities, dissenters, atheists and non-theists (A/62/280, para. 70). She suggested that &#8220;a useful 
alternative to blasphemy laws could be to fully implement the protection of individuals against 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence according to article 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights&#8221; (para. 76). She also pointed out that in view of the huge number of religions and 
beliefs, genuine differences of opinion between their believers may arise and that &#8220;it would be 
difficult and potentially dangerous to define <i>in abstracto </i>what constitutes a &#8216;defamation of 
religion&#8217; as well as to find an impartial, independent and non-arbitrary body for adjudicating 
such cases&#8221; (para. 77). 
</p>
<p>41. In her report on a country visit (E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.2) the Special Rapporteur affirmed 
that the State has the responsibility to ensure that justice is done promptly and properly, stressing 
that &#8220;there cannot be a lasting solution without proper justice for the perpetrators and victims of 
all acts of violence on religious grounds that have occurred. A climate of impunity can only 
encourage those who plan to foment further violence&#8221; (para. 95). The State has the obligation to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;ensure the protection and security of religious groups which may be targeted and which should 
be entitled to practice their religions freely and without any obstacles, including those created by 
non-State actors&#8221; (para. 113). 
</p>
<p>42. In their first joint declaration in 1999, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the OSCE Representative on 
Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression noted that 
many countries have legislation, such as criminal defamation laws, which unduly restrict the 
right to freedom of expression. They encouraged States to review these laws and harmonize them 
in accordance with their international obligations.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>43. In their joint declaration made in 2000 they noted that the abuse of restrictive defamation 
and libel laws had reached &#8220;crisis proportions in many parts of the world&#8221;.<b>11</b> They recommended 
minimum standards that should be followed in the development of defamation laws, among 
which: (a) the repeal of criminal defamation laws in favour of civil laws should be considered, in 
accordance with relevant international standards; (b) no one should be liable under defamation 
law for the expression of an opinion; and (c) civil sanctions for defamation should not be so 
heavy as to exert a chilling effect on freedom of expression, and should be designed to restore 
the reputation harmed, not to compensate the plaintiff or to punish the defendant.  
</p>
<p>44. The joint declaration made in 2000 also endorsed the ARTICLE 19 document &#8220;Defining 
Defamation: Principles on Freedom of Expression and Protection of Reputation&#8221;, principle 2 of 
which, on the legitimate purpose of defamation laws, states that such laws cannot be justified if 
their purpose or effect is to protect the &#8220;reputation&#8221; of objects such as the State, the nation, 
religious symbols, flags or national insignia, or on grounds of public order, national security, or 
friendly relations with foreign States or Governments.<b>12</b> The three mandate-holders issued 
another joint declaration in 2002, in which they reiterated that &#8220;criminal defamation is not a 
justifiable restriction on freedom of expression; all criminal defamation laws should be abolished 
and replaced, where necessary, with appropriate civil defamation laws&#8221;.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>45. On 19 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, the 
OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of 
Expression of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights adopted a declaration 
which addressed several issues, including freedom of expression and cultural and religious 
tensions. The declaration noted that &#8220;governments should refrain from introducing legislation 
which makes it an offence simply to exacerbate social tensions. Although it is legitimate to

sufficient &#8216;hate speech&#8217; legislation&#8221;.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  REGIONAL NORMS AND JURISPRUDENCE 
</b></p>
<p>46. The main regional human rights systems contain fairly extensive norms and jurisprudence 
on freedom of religion, permissible restrictions and defamation of religions, revealing many 
similarities but also significant differences.  
</p>
<p><b>The African regional human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>47. Article 8 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights guarantees the freedom of 
conscience, the profession and free practice of religion and that &#8220;no one may, subject to law and 
order, be submitted to measures restricting the exercise of these freedoms&#8221;. With regard to 
freedom of expression, article 9 of the Charter stipulates that &#8220;every individual shall have the 
right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>48. With regard to the permissible scope of restrictions on freedom of expression, the 
Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa<b>15</b> in Principle II (Interference with 
Freedom of Expression) provides that &#8220;any restrictions on freedom of expression shall be 
provided by law, serve a legitimate interest and be necessary and in a democratic society&#8221;. 
Principle XIII (Criminal Measures) stipulates that &#8220;freedom of expression should not be 
restricted on public order or national security grounds unless there is a real risk of harm to a 
legitimate interest and there is a close causal link between the risk of harm and the expression&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>49. In 2006, at its 40th ordinary session, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights adopted a resolution on the situation of freedom of expression in Africa which 
emphasized the freedom of expression as guaranteed in article 9 of the African Charter and 
articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ICCPR, respectively, and other 
treaties, resolutions, international instruments and national constitutions. 
</p>
<p><b>The European system  
</b></p>
<p>50. Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees the right to 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion and provides that &#8220;freedom to manifest one&#8217;s 
religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are 
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public 
order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>  Res. 62(XXXII)02: Resolution on the Adoption of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom 
of Expression in Africa (2002). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. Article 10 of the Convention protects the right to freedom of expression whereby the 
exercise of these freedoms &#8220;may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or 
penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of 
national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for 
the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for 
preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority 
and impartiality of the judiciary&#8221;.  
</p><p>52. Freedom of expression, as guaranteed under article 10 of the Convention, is applicable not 
only to &#8220;information&#8221; or &#8220;ideas&#8221; which are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a 
matter of indifference, but also those which offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the 
population. At the same time, the exercise of freedom of expression also entails duties and 
responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><b>Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. Several decisions of the European Court of Human Rights underline that the limitation to 
freedom of expression under article 10 of the Convention applies to expressions that do not 
merely criticize, oppose or deny religious beliefs, but inhibit those who hold such beliefs from 
exercising their freedom of religion.  
</p>
<p>54. According to the European Court of Human Rights, the test for determining whether 
restrictions of freedom of expression are &#8220;necessary in a democratic society&#8221; is if they 
correspond to a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221;, are proportionate to the aim to be pursued (the potential 
impact of the medium of expression concerned is an important factor in the consideration of the 
proportionality of an interference), and whether the reasons justifying the interference are 
relevant and sufficient.  
</p>
<p>55. With regard to the &#8220;need&#8221; for restrictions on freedom of expression and the measures that 
should be adopted to deal therewith, the Court has held that national authorities have a certain 
margin of appreciation, which is not unlimited but goes hand in hand with the supervision by the 
Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom 
of expression as protected by article 10. 
</p>
<p>56. In <i>Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria </i>(1994), the European Court of Human Rights noted 
that &#8220;those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion, irrespective of whether 
they do so as members of a religious majority or a minority, cannot reasonably expect to be 
exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious 
beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith. However, the 
manner in which religious beliefs and doctrines are opposed or denied is a matter which may 
engage the responsibility of the State, notably its responsibility to ensure the peaceful 
enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 (art. 9) to the holders of those beliefs and 
doctrines&#8221; (para. 47). 
</p>
<p>57. The European Court held that &#8220;in seizing the film, the Austrian authorities acted to ensure 
religious peace in that region and to prevent that some people should feel the object of attacks on 
their religious beliefs in an unwarranted and offensive manner&#8221; (para. 56). The Court also held </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that provocative portrayals of objects of religious veneration &#8220;can be regarded as malicious 
violation of the spirit of tolerance, which must also be a feature of democratic society&#8221;. It 
pointed out that in the context of religious opinions and beliefs, those who exercise the right to 
freedom of expression under article 10 of the Convention have an obligation to &#8220;avoid as far as 
possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others&#8221; (paras. 47 and 49). 
</p>
<p>58. In <i>Wingrove v. United Kingdom </i>(1996), the European Court noted that the law on 
blasphemy did not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the 
United Kingdom (it protects only the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established 
Church of England), but stated that this was not the issue before the Court to rule on. The Court 
upheld the refusal to grant a certificate for the distribution of a film because it had a legitimate 
aim to protect &#8220;the rights of others&#8221;, and more specifically, to protect against seriously offensive 
attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians.  
</p>
<p>59. In &#304;<i>.A. v. Turkey</i> (2005), the European Court underlined that pluralism, tolerance and 
broadmindedness are hallmarks of a democratic society, and noted that freedom of expression 
applies not only to &#8220;information&#8221; or &#8220;ideas&#8221; that are favourably received or regarded as 
inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. It also 
noted, however, that with respect to religious belief there may be a legitimate duty to avoid 
expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and profane, hence it may be considered 
necessary to punish improper attacks on objects of religious veneration. 
60. The European Court noted that the judgements of the national organs were intended to 
provide protection against offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Muslims and that 
the measure may reasonably be held to have met a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221;. The Court ruled that 
there had been no violation of article 10 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>61. In <i>Ayd&#305;n Tatlav v. Turkey</i> (2006), on the other hand, the European Court found a violation 
of article 10 by the State. It held that a criminal conviction involving the risk of a custodial 
sentence could have the effect of discouraging authors and editors from publishing opinions 
about religion that were not conformist and could therefore impede pluralism, which was 
indispensable for the healthy development of a democratic society.  
</p>
<p>62. In <i>Giniewski v. France</i> (2006), the European Court stated that although the applicant&#8217;s 
article criticized a papal encyclical and hence the Pope&#8217;s position, the analysis it contained could 
not be extended to Christianity as a whole. The Court again found that restrictions to freedom 
were not warranted under article 10 of the European Convention because the publication in 
question was not &#8220;gratuitously offensive&#8221; or insulting, did not incite disrespect or hatred, did 
not cast doubt in any way on clearly established historical facts, and did not meet the &#8220;pressing 
social need&#8221; imperative. 
</p>
<p>63. The European Court maintained the same position in <i>Klein v. Slovakia</i> (2007) and found a 
violation of article 10 of the European Convention because the sanction was not necessary, did 
not meet pressing social need and was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  
</p>
<p>64. In summary, according to the European Court, those who choose to exercise the 
freedom to manifest their religion must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their 
religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(<i>Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria</i>). However, the cases from the European Court identify the 
following among the key factors to be taken into account in determining the permissible scope of 
limitations on hate speech grounds: provocative portrayals of objects of religious veneration &#8220;can 
be regarded as malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance, which must also be a feature of a 
democratic society&#8221;, as stated in its ruling in (<i>Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria</i>); it is a 
legitimate State objective under the Convention to protect &#8220;the rights of others&#8221; and, more 
specifically, to provide protection against seriously or gratuitously offensive attacks on matters 
regarded as sacred by a segment of the population, Christians (<i>Wingrove v. United Kingdom</i>) or 
Muslims (&#304;<i>.A. v. Turkey</i>); measures taken to protect against offensive attacks must be 
proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and meet a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221; (&#304;<i>.A. v. Turkey</i>, 
<i>Wingrove v. United Kingdom</i>); and limitations of freedom of expression should not have the 
effect of discouraging authors and editors from publishing opinions about religion that were not 
conformist, and should not impede the protection of pluralism (<i>Ayd&#305;n Tatlav v. Turkey</i>).  
</p>
<p><b>The Inter-American system 
</b></p>
<p>65. Three of the key human rights instruments in the Inter-American system have similar 
provisions relevant to the freedom of religion: the American Declaration of the Rights and 
Duties of Man of 1948; the American Convention on Human Rights &#8220;Pact of San Jos&#233;, 
Costa Rica&#8221;, and the Inter-American Declaration of Freedom of Expression. Article III of the 
American Declaration provides that &#8220;Every person has the right freely to profess a religious 
faith, and to manifest and practice it both in public and in private.&#8221; Article IV stipulates that 
&#8220;Every person has the right to freedom of investigation, of opinion, and of the expression and 
dissemination of ideas, by any medium whatsoever.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>66. Article 12 of the American Convention on Human Rights guarantees that &#8220;Everyone has 
the right to freedom of conscience and of religion. This right includes freedom to maintain or to 
change one&#8217;s religion or beliefs, and freedom to profess or disseminate one&#8217;s religion or beliefs, 
either individually or together with others, in public or in private.&#8221; It also provides that &#8220;no one 
shall be subject to restrictions that might impair his freedom to maintain or to change his religion 
or beliefs&#8221; and that &#8220;freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion and beliefs may be subject only to the 
limitations prescribed by law that are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals, 
or the rights or freedoms of others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>67. Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the right to freedom of thought and expression, 
which includes the &#8220;freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, 
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing, in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
medium of one&#8217;s choice&#8221;. The exercise of the right &#8220;shall not be subject to prior censorship but 
shall be subject to subsequent imposition of liability, which shall be expressly established by law 
to the extent necessary to ensure: 1. respect for the rights or reputations of others; or 2. the 
protection of national security, public order, or public health or morals&#8221;. Moreover, the right of 
expression may not be restricted by indirect methods or means.  
</p>
<p>68. The only exception to the prohibition of prior censorship is in article 13 (4), which 
provides that &#8220;public entertainments may be subject by law to prior censorship for the sole 
purpose of regulating access to them for the moral protection of childhood and adolescence&#8221;. 
Paragraph 5 of that article provides that &#8220;any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitements to lawless violence or to any other similar 
action against any person or group of persons on any grounds including those of race, colour, 
religion, language, or national origin shall be considered as offenses punishable by law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>69. The Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression adopted in 2000 
elaborates on the limitations set in article 13 of the Convention. Principle 5 reiterates that &#8220;prior 
censorship, direct or indirect interference in or pressure exerted upon any expression, opinion or 
information transmitted through any means of oral, written, artistic, visual or electronic 
communication must be prohibited by law&#8221;. Principle 7 further provides that &#8220;Prior conditioning 
of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or impartiality is incompatible with the right to 
freedom of expression recognized in international instruments.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Inter-American Court has stressed the prohibition of prior censorship. In 
<i>Olmedo Bustos et al. v. Chile &#8220;The Last Temptation of Christ&#8221; </i>(2001), the Court held that 
Chile had violated the right to freedom of thought and expression embodied in article 13 of the 
Inter-American Convention by blocking the showing of the film.  
</p>
<p>71. The Court noted that freedom of expression is not limited to the right to speak or write, but 
that it is also closely linked to the right to use any appropriate method to disseminate thought and 
allow it to reach the greatest number of persons. The Court stated that the exception to prior 
censorship in article 13 (4) of the Inter-American Convention is intended to regulate access for 
the moral protection of children and adolescents, limited to public entertainment. The 
impairment of the freedom of thought and expression in all other cases is inconsistent with the 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>72. With regard to the right to freedom of conscience and religion, the Court stated that the 
refusal of the authorities to screen the film did not impair or deprive anyone of their right to 
maintain, change, profess or disseminate their religion or beliefs with total freedom.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  NATIONAL LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Constitution of Argentina, in article 14, stipulates that all the inhabitants of the Nation 
are entitled to publish their ideas through the press without previous censorship and to profess 
freely their religion. Article 19 of the Constitution determines that the private actions of men 
which in no way offend public order or morality, nor injure a third party, are only reserved to 
God and are exempted from the authority of judges; no inhabitant of the Nation shall be obliged 
to perform what the law does not demand nor deprived of what it does not prohibit. Furthermore, 
article 20 guarantees that foreigners enjoy within the territory of the Nation all the civil rights of 
citizens - including, among others, practising freely their religion.  
</p>
<p>74. The Constitution of Chile guarantees freedom of conscience, manifestation of all creeds 
and the free exercise of all cults which are not opposed to morals, good customs or public order. 
Moreover, the Chilean Law of Worship (No 19.638 of October 1999) establishes the norms, in 
accordance with the constitutional provisions, applicable to churches and religious organizations. 
It institutes equal legal status for religious entities.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>75. The Constitution of Costa Rica establishes, in article 75, that the Roman Catholic and 
Apostolic Religion is the religion of the State, without preventing the free exercise of other 
forms of worship that are not opposed to universal morality and good customs. Article 28 of the 
Constitution stipulates that no one may be disturbed or persecuted for the expression of his 
opinions or for any act which does not infringe the law; private actions which do not harm the 
morals or public order, or which do not cause any damages to third parties are outside the scope 
of the law. However, clergymen or secular individuals cannot in any way engage in political 
propaganda invoking religious motives or making use of religious beliefs.  
</p>
<p>76. The Constitution of Cuba, in its article 42, prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, 
skin colour, national origin, religious beliefs and any other form of discrimination harmful to 
human dignity. Furthermore, article 55 stipulates that the State recognizes, respects and 
guarantees freedom of conscience and of religion, every citizen&#8217;s freedom to change religious 
beliefs or to not have any, and to profess, within the framework of respect for the law, the 
religious belief of his preference. Article 294 of the Cuban Penal Code envisages imprisonment 
for two years for an offence against freedom of religion committed by a public employee.  
</p>
<p>77. The Egyptian Constitution, in article 40, guarantees that all citizens are equal before the 
law and have equal public rights and duties without discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic 
origin, language, religion or creed. The Constitution also stipulates that the State shall guarantee 
freedom of belief and freedom of practice of religious rites. With regard to criminal law, 
article 160 of the Penal Code of Egypt sanctions the use of violence or threats to disrupt or 
interrupt the religious observances or celebrations of any community; the destruction, damage or 
desecration of premises dedicated to the practice of religious rites, or of symbols or other articles 
venerated by the members of a religious community or group of people; the violation or 
desecration of graves or cemeteries. Furthermore, article 161 envisages penalties for printing or 
publishing distorted versions of a holy book of any publicly practised religion, provided the text 
is intentionally deflected in a manner that alters its meaning; mimicking a religious celebration in 
a public place or community with a view to ridiculing it, or to be watched by an audience. 
</p>
<p>78. The Constitution of Mauritius in section 11 entitled &#8220;Protection of Freedom of 
Conscience&#8221; provides that except with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the 
enjoyment of his freedom of conscience that includes freedom of thought and religion, freedom 
to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and both in 
public and private, to manifest and propagate his religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice 
and observance. The Criminal Code of Mauritius contains several provisions with regard to 
freedom of conscience, among which, section 206 on outrage against public and religious 
morality and section 208 on penalties applicable to the author of outrage against religion.  
</p>
<p>79. Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code sanctions any person who attributes an act or fact to 
a person in a manner that may impugn that person&#8217;s honour, dignity or prestige. Paragraph 3 (b) 
and (c) of that article envisages penalties for committed insults because of declaring, altering or 
disseminating, his religious, political, social or philosophical beliefs, thoughts or convictions, or 
practising in accordance with the requirements and prohibitions of a religion he belongs to; or 
where the subject matter is deemed sacred to the religion the person belongs to. The Turkish 
Penal Code also sanctions persons who damage, soil buildings and associated buildings (or 
structures upon such) of a place of worship or the removable property therein (art. 153, 
paras. 1, 2). Moreover, it penalizes persons who publicly provoke hatred or hostility in one </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>section of the public against another section which has a different characteristic based on social 
class, race, religion, sect or regional difference, which creates a clear and imminent danger to 
public security; who publicly degrade the religious values of a section of the public (art. 216, 
paras. 1 and 3). Furthermore, the Law on the Establishment of Radio and Television Enterprises 
and Their Broadcast stipulates, in article 4 (d), that broadcasts shall not, in any manner, humiliate 
or insult people on grounds of language, race, colour, gender, political opinion, philosophical 
belief, religion, sect, or any such considerations.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The former High Commissioner, at the first session of the Human Rights Council, 
emphasized that &#8220;the proliferation of acts and expressions contributing to the exacerbation 
of cultural and religious tensions is producing new cleavages within and between 
communities, and has recently led to unprecedented levels of violence and destruction, on 
the ashes of which trust and tolerance must now be rebuilt. The use of harmful stereotypes 
and the perpetuation of myths that demonize, ridicule, or insult deep-rooted religious 
feelings and a profound sense of identity, must be denounced as vigorously as the right to 
champion unpopular ideas must be asserted and protected&#8221;.  
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> There are legitimate concerns about an increase in manifestations of intolerance and 
discrimination based on religion or belief as well as acts of violence, including attacks 
against places of worship, which are threatening the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Further clarity is needed with regard to the legal contours of the demarcation line 
between freedom of expression and incitement to religious hatred. In order to protect 
individuals and groups, a better understanding of the permissible limitations to freedom of 
expression in accordance with international human rights law needs to be developed. 
OHCHR will therefore organize an expert consultation entitled &#8220;Links between articles 19 
and 20 of the ICCPR: Freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221;. The expert consultation will 
be held from 2 to 3 October 2008 in Geneva and is open to the participation of observers 
such as Member States, United Nations agencies, regional organizations and NGOs.
