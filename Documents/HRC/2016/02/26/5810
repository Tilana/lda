<p><b>     Tenth Session 
</b></p>
<p><b> Resolution 10/17.  Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan due 
to the systematic and continuous violation of their fundamental and human rights by Israel since 
the Israeli military occupation of 1967, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent being 
resolution 63/99 of 5 December 2008, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had failed to 
comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw from all 
the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming once more </i>the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981 to 
impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has 
resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force in 
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, </p>
<p><i> Taking note with deep concern </i>of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied 
Territories (A/63/401), in which the Committee referred to the grave deterioration of the human 
rights situation in the occupied Syrian Golan and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli 
settlement in the occupied Arab territories and expressing regret at the constant refusal of Israel 
to cooperate with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the relevant provisions of the Charter, international law and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and the 
relevant provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the importance of the peace process, which started in Madrid on the basis of 
Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern at the halting of 
the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the basis of 
the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for the 
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Council, the most recent being Council resolution 7/30 of 28 March 2008, </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions of 
the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, in particular 
Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter alia, that the decision 
of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was 
null and void and without international legal effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind 
forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and 
emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be 
allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon </i>Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from its 
repressive measures against them and from all other practices that obstruct the enjoyment of their 
fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, some of which 
are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting 
the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan to visit 
their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra checkpoint and under 
the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and to rescind its decision to 
prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in Israeli prisons, 
some of whom have been detained for more than 23 years, and calls on Israel to treat them in 
conformity with international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Further</i> <i>calls upon</i> Israel, in this connection, to allow delegates of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of conscience and detainees in Israeli 
prisons accompanied by specialized physicians to assess the state of their physical and mental 
health and to protect their lives; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Determines </i>that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be 
taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that aim to alter the character and legal status of the 
occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and 
of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
12 August 1949, and have no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Again calls upon </i>States Members of the United Nations not to recognize any of the 
above-mentioned legislative or administrative measures; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all 
Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international and 
regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to 
disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on this matter to the Council at its 
thirteenth session; </p>
