<p>Paragraph 26 <i>should read</i> 
</p>
<p>26. Existing human rights treaties do not provide any definition of legal aid. The only 
internationally agreed definition is that contained in the United Nations Principles and 
Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, which construes the term 
&#8220;legal aid&#8221; as including &#8220;legal advice, assistance and representation for persons detained, 
arrested or imprisoned, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence and for 
victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process that is provided at no cost for those 
without sufficient means or when the interests of justice so require. Furthermore, &#8220;legal 
aid&#8221; is intended to include the concepts of legal education, access to legal information and 
</p>
<p>other services provided for persons through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and 
restorative justice processes.&#8221;8
