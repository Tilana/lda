<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Commission on the Status 
of Women resolution 39/5 of 31 March 1995, Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 1997/43 of 11 April 1997, and Human Rights Council resolution 6/30 of 
14 December 2007. A joint workplan is prepared annually by the Division for the 
Advancement of Women and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR). The workplan for 2008 is contained in document 
A/HRC/7/52-E/CN.6/2008/8. 
</p>
<p>2. Cooperation between OHCHR and the Division for the Advancement of 
Women continued in 2008 with the goal of achieving equality between women and 
men and the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s human rights. The major 
activities that were carried out jointly are outlined below, as are plans for joint 
activities for 2009. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Review of the implementation of the joint workplan for 2008 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. During the implementation of the current joint workplan, the exchange of 
information continued between OHCHR, the Office of the Special Adviser on 
Gender Issues and Advancement of Women and the Division for the Advancement 
of Women of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The Division and 
OHCHR continued to cooperate within the framework of inter-agency mechanisms, 
especially the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, under the 
leadership of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women. 
The Division and OHCHR participated in the seventh session of the Inter-Agency 
Network from 19 to 21 February 2008 in New York, contributing to discussions on 
all items on the agenda. Both entities participated in several of the task forces of the 
Inter-Agency Network, including its task force on violence against women, 
co-convened by the Division and the United Nations Population Fund. OHCHR also 
contributed to the inventory of activities of the United Nations system on violence 
against women, compiled twice yearly by the Division as part of the activities of the 
task force on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>4. Both entities continued to participate in the Inter-Agency Cooperation Group 
against Trafficking in Persons, chaired by the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, as well as in decision-making concerning grants by the United Nations Trust 
Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women. The Division and 
OHCHR also continued collaboration within the context of the Executive 
Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, specifically in the cluster on the 
advancement of women, which is co-convened by the Division for the Advancement 
of Women and the Economic Commission for Africa. Both entities also participate 
in a working group chaired by the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and 
Advancement of Women on strengthening United Nations work on gender equality 
and the empowerment of women.  
</p>
<p>5. The Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and an OHCHR staff member working with the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences participated in an expert 
group meeting in Vienna from 26 to 28 May 2008, co-organized by the Division for </p>

in legislation on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>6. The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR collaborated to 
ensure the smooth transfer as of 1 January 2008 of responsibilities for servicing the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women from the 
Department of Economic and Social Affairs to OHCHR, in accordance with the 
decision of the Secretary-General. A staff member of the Division at the General 
Service level worked with OHCHR staff to support the Committee at its fortieth 
session, in Geneva. The Division established a link to the OHCHR website, 
referring users to that site for information pertaining to the fortieth and subsequent 
sessions of the Committee.  
</p>
<p>7. The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR continued to 
support the work of human rights treaty bodies and implementation of the major 
international human rights instruments, including through exchange of information 
and dissemination of information about the human rights treaty system. The Special 
Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women and the Director of the 
Division for the Advancement of Women addressed the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 30 June 2008 during the forty-first 
session, held in New York. The Division provided inputs to documentation prepared 
by OHCHR for the Committee, and in particular to reports on ways and means of 
expediting the work of the Committee (CEDAW/C/2008/II/4 and 
CEDAW/C/2008/III/4).  
</p>
<p>8. Both the Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR continued to 
update their databases and websites. The Division continued to provide information 
on its website about developments in the area of women&#8217;s human rights, and in 
particular enhanced its website in relation to violence against women. OHCHR 
enhanced accessibility to women&#8217;s rights information by redesigning a more user- 
friendly website.  
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR and the Division for the Advancement of Women, respectively, 
convened a number of meetings, including training seminars and other capacity-
building activities, to support implementation of human rights treaties and follow-up 
to concluding observations and comments at the national level. The Division for the 
Advancement of Women continued to participate as a member of the Reference 
Group for the Action 2 global programme on strengthening United Nations support 
for the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide, convened by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>10. The Division for the Advancement of Women continued its interaction with 
special procedures mandate holders. In particular, the Division maintained contact 
and exchanged information with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences, in the follow-up to the Secretary-General&#8217;s in-depth 
study on all forms of violence against women and General Assembly resolution 
61/143 on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women.  
</p>
<p>11. Collaboration in support of intergovernmental bodies continued. In March 
2008, the Chairperson of the Commission on the Status of Women delivered a 
statement to the Human Rights Council at its seventh session. In February 2008, the 
Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
addressed the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-second session. The </p>
