<p><b>  Situation of indigenous peoples in the Russian Federation</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report follows a visit to the Russian Federation by the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, and 
examines the situation of indigenous people in the Russian Federation in light of relevant 
international human rights standards. The report is focused on those groups whose 
members number less than 50,000 and are recognized by the Russian Federation as &#8220;small-
numbered indigenous peoples&#8221; entitled to special protections, although the report notes that 
other groups with similar, historically-rooted characteristics of economic and social 
disadvantage, and whose cultures and ways of life are also threatened, are likewise in need 
of attention in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government of the Russian Federation has 
manifested a commitment to improving the living conditions of indigenous peoples and to 
advancing their cultures and participation in decision-making, in accordance with 
constitutional and other legal protections for them, having developed a comprehensive 
policy addressing indigenous peoples with a number of programme initiatives, as set forth 
in its widely circulated &#8220;Concept Paper&#8221; of 2009. Further, some regional governments 
demonstrate a remarkable level of consideration of indigenous issues in their legislative and 
development initiatives. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur observes that indigenous

</p>
<p>peoples of Russia continue to face multiple impediments to the full enjoyment of their 
human rights, especially in some regions. Further efforts are needed to ensure that the 
existing laws guaranteeing indigenous communities&#8217; rights over land and to natural 
resources are fully and consistently implemented throughout Russia and for all indigenous 
peoples; that indigenous peoples are ensured adequate political representation at the 
municipal, regional and federal levels of government; and that indigenous people&#8217;s right to 
consultation in decisions affecting them, including decisions about the industrial 
development of natural resources; and their right to determine that their legal and governing 
structures and economic priorities are fully respected. 
</p>
<p> Conscious of these challenges, the Special Rapporteur offers several 
recommendations that may serve to enhance the recognition and protection of the rights of 
the indigenous peoples in Russia in line with the Government&#8217;s commitments and 
international standards, together with the recommendation that the Government consider 
declaring its support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this report the Special Rapporteur examines the human rights situation of 
indigenous people in the Russian Federation, on the basis of research and information 
gathered, including during a visit to the Russian Federation from 4 to 16 October 2009. The 
visit followed requests by various indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations throughout the country 
and was carried out with the cooperation of the Government of the Russian Federation, 
which took the initiative to arrange almost all aspects of the agenda for the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. During his visit to the Russian Federation, the Special Rapporteur consulted with 
Government officials, indigenous peoples and their organizations, representatives of the 
United Nations and members of civil society. In Moscow, the Special Rapporteur held 
meetings with officials from the Committee on Nationalities Issues of the State Duma, the 
Committee on Northern Territories and Indigenous Peoples Issues of the Council of the 
Federation, the Ministry of Regional Development, the Department for Humanitarian 
Cooperation and Human Rights of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Civic Chamber. 
He also held consultations with the United Nations Resident Coordinator and with members 
of the United Nations country team in the Russian Federation. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur met with regional government officials in Khanty-Mansiysk, Beloyarsk, 
Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of various indigenous 
organizations at the national and regional levels, including the Russian Association of 
Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON) and several of its regional affiliates; 
L&#8217;auravetl&#8217;an Information and Education Network of Indigenous Peoples (LIENIP); the 
&#8220;Salvation of Yugra&#8221; regional association of indigenous peoples; Krasnoyarsk Regional 
Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North; and other non-governmental organizations, 
including the Krasnoyarsk branch of the Red Cross.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur conducted field trips to Kazym Village and to the 
patrimonial land of an indigenous family in the Beloyarsk Municipal District of Khanty-
Mansiysky Autonomous Region; Surinda Village and the nearby &#8220;Surindinskiy&#8221; collective 
reindeer farm in the Evenkiya Municipality of Krasnoyarsky Krai, or region,; and the 
villages of Sikachi-Alyan and Sinda in Khabarovsky Krai. During these trips he consulted 
with municipal government officials, hospital and school administrators, indigenous people, 
and members of civil society. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation to the Government of the Russian 
Federation, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Regional 
Development, to the regional governments of Khanti-Mansiysky Autonomous Region, 
Krasnoyarsky Krai, and Khabarovsky Krai; and also to indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, 
for the support they provided for the visit. The Special Rapporteur was unable to visit all of 
the places he had hoped to, although he was able to visit a number of locations across the 
vast territory of the Russian Federation. Additionally, while his meetings with a wide range 
of Government officials at the federal and regional levels were useful, he would have 
preferred to have more direct encounters with the indigenous communities. Nevertheless, 
he has endeavoured to obtain a balanced picture of the situation of indigenous peoples in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>6. By a note of 19 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur submitted to the Government a 
preliminary version of the present report and, on 6 May 2010, received comments from the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government for its comments, 
which have been taken into account in the preparation of the final version of this report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. The small-numbered indigenous peoples of Russia 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Russian Federation is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world, 
and includes over 160 distinct peoples. Russian federal legislation protects the &#8220;numerically 
small indigenous peoples&#8221; or &#8220;small-numbered indigenous peoples of Russia&#8221;, defined as 
those who live in territories traditionally inhabited by their ancestors; maintain a traditional 
way of life and economic activity; number fewer than 50,000; and identify themselves as 
separate ethnic communities.1 The official listing of the small-numbered indigenous 
peoples of the Russian Federation identifies 46 such groups.2 The size of these groups 
varies from fewer than 300 (240 Ent) to more than 40,000 (41,000 Nenet peoples).3 In total, 
these groups comprise 244,0004 people, residing within 28 constituent political-
administrative units of the Russian Federation, mainly in the North, Siberia and the Far East 
of Russia. 
</p>
<p>8. The scope of the current report is for the most part limited to those groups defined 
by the Government of the Russian Federation as small-numbered indigenous peoples, and 
from hereon in the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; in this report refers to those groups. It should 
be stressed, however, that there may be groups that share the characteristics and challenges 
of small-numbered indigenous peoples but which, because of the numerical population 
limitation, do not enjoy the corresponding recognition or legal protections. For example, the 
Altai Kezhi in the Altai Republic number more than 50,000, but share a similar history and 
way of life to those of the Altai Alengita, who are included in the official list of small-
numbered peoples. The Nogay number well over 50,000, and constitute an ethnically 
differentiated people with many problems similar to those of much smaller indigenous 
groups in the Russian Federation. Also, the Komi-Izhemtsy or Izvatas, have a traditional 
reindeer-herding and fishing way of life, but because they are considered a subgroup of the 
larger Komi national minority, do not meet the numerical criteria. Hence, much of the 
discussion and recommendations in this report regarding the situation of the small-
numbered indigenous people in the Russian Federation may also apply to some of these 
other groups. 
</p>
<p>9. Diverse peoples indigenous to the northern, Siberian, and the far eastern regions of 
territory now within the geographic boundaries of the Russian Federation inhabited these 
regions long before Tsarist Russia started exploring the territories in the 12th and 13th 
centuries. They had well-developed communities, subsistence economies and cultures, 
based on a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life, fishing, hunting, and reindeer herding. 
Even though the main Tsarist legal act on indigenous people, the 1822 &#8220;Regulation of 
Indigenous Population&#8221;, recognized the role of clan community leadership and even 
prohibited Russians from settling in the territories of indigenous people without their 
leaders&#8217; permission, indigenous communities suffered many effects of colonization, 
including military conflicts, loss of autonomy and lands, and heavy taxation. The 1917 
Revolution brought drastic changes to the relationship between the central Government and 
indigenous communities, and further affected the situation of indigenous people in Russia.  
</p>
<p>10. The rise and fall of communism carries epic historical significance for all Russians, 
but was especially traumatic to the situation of indigenous peoples. Soviet leaders were 
known to take pride in the diversity of ethnicity and culture in the Soviet Union, and the

</p>
<p>ruling party encouraged and sponsored indigenous performers and artists. Nevertheless, the 
policy of Sovietization envisioned that indigenous peoples would continue to develop the 
aesthetic features of their cultural traditions, while integrating into mainstream society in 
every other way.  
</p>
<p>11. Thus, indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional leadership structures and communities, their 
religion, customary law and traditional medicine, and their capacity for self-reliance and 
economic subsistence built up over hundreds of years were radically affected by the 
paternalistic and intrusive management and control, forced integration, and 
&#8220;collectivization&#8221; during communism. For example, reindeer farming and all other 
economic activities were transformed into Government-run enterprises; indigenous children 
were mandatorily placed in boarding schools and taught by Moscow-trained educators; and 
nomadic communities were forced to settle, leading to increased urbanization.  
</p>
<p>12. Following the fall of communism, and the abrupt transition to a market economy 
during <i>Perestroyka</i>, indigenous peoples were in a particularly vulnerable position. 
Communities experienced something of an organizational void, lacking the former structure 
imposed by the communist Government, yet unable to shape or define their new role in a 
drastically shifting political and economic atmosphere. Many indigenous communities 
suffered extreme hardship with some reaching the brink of extinction during this time, 
while unemployment, poverty and alcoholism soared. 
</p>
<p>13. Despite this, the small-numbered indigenous peoples of Russia have been able to 
preserve their unique and distinctive identities, cultures, languages and traditions. However, 
notwithstanding governmental and non-governmental efforts to improve the situation of 
indigenous peoples in the last two decades, and despite some signs of success, deep-rooted 
problems remain. According to various sources the small-numbered indigenous peoples 
generally have worse human development indicators than other population segments within 
the Russian Federation (see part IV.C.4). 
</p><p>14. Additionally, structural conditions complicate the situation of indigenous people in 
Russia. Indigenous communities are located mostly in the North, Siberia and Far East of 
Russia: a territory sparsely populated but spanning close to one million square miles and 
over 60 per cent of Russia. The huge distances that separate indigenous communities from 
each other and from metropolitan centres, harsh climate conditions, and the lack of easy 
transportation or communication create conditions of isolation, and present unique 
obstacles to indigenous peoples&#8217; social, political and economic participation in the larger 
society.  
</p>
<p>15. The North, Siberia and Far East are also the areas where most of Russia&#8217;s industrial-
grade natural resources are located. Russia is one of the world&#8217;s top exporters of oil and 
natural gas, and is understandably continuing to actively explore and develop its rich 
reserves. Often, this exploitation of natural resources happens close to or on the land 
indigenous people inhabit or use for hunting, fishing or reindeer herding. The tension 
between the competing interests of the indigenous peoples and the extractive industries is 
likely to inform the dynamics of indigenous issues in Russia for a long time in the future. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Relevant laws and programmes at the federal level 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Russian Federation is a federal, semi-presidential republic with 83 constituent 
subjects, or political-administrative units. The 1993 Federal Constitution (especially articles 
2, and 17&#8211;64) articulates a commitment to a range of specific human rights and freedoms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>With regard to indigenous peoples in particular, article 69 provides that &#8220;[t]he Russian 
Federation shall guarantee the rights of the indigenous small peoples according to the 
universally recognized principles and norms of international law and international treaties 
and agreements of the Russian Federation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>17. With respect to international law generally, article 15 (4) of the Constitution states: 
&#8220;The universally-recognized norms of international law and international treaties and 
agreements of the Russian Federation shall be a component part of its legal system. If an 
international treaty or agreement of the Russian Federation fixes other rules than those 
envisaged by law, the rules of the international agreement shall be applied.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>18. The Russian Federation voted in favour of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, and has ratified most of the core United Nations human rights treaties. Russia has 
not ratified International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989), and abstained from voting for the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (&#8220;Declaration&#8221;), although 
Government officials have stated that the Russian Federation accepts most of the provisions 
of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>19. The federal legal framework for the protection and promotion of the rights of 
indigenous peoples consists of three framework laws specifically addressing indigenous 
peoples: &#8220;On Guarantees of the Rights of Numerically-small Indigenous Peoples of the 
Russian Federation&#8221; (&#8220;On Guarantees&#8221;), passed in 1999; &#8220;On Territories of Traditional 
Nature Use of the Numerically-small Indigenous Peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far 
East of the Russian Federation&#8221; (&#8220;On Territories&#8221;), adopted in 2001; and &#8220;On General 
Principles of Organization of <i>Obshchina</i> [clan or clan-type community] of Numerically-
small Indigenous Peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation&#8221; 
(&#8220;On Obshchina&#8221;), adopted in 2000.  
20. The guarantees set out in the federal legislation include both group and individual 
rights of indigenous peoples to free-of-charge use of land and renewable natural resources 
in the territories which they have traditionally occupied and where they engage in 
traditional economic activities; the rights to establish self-government bodies in places of 
compact settlement and to form communities and other organizations; the right to reform 
their educational institutions according to their traditional way of life; the right to receive 
compensation for damage to their traditional environment due to industrial activities; the 
right to have courts consider customary law in as far as it does not contradict federal or 
regional legislation; and other entitlements. However, while the guarantees set out in these 
federal laws are substantial, there has been widespread criticism of the lack of their 
effective implementation.  
</p>
<p>21. The federal Government had provided a series of three consecutive funding 
initiatives targeting indigenous communities, starting in 1991. Nevertheless, these 
programmes were also criticized as being grossly insufficient and subject to inappropriate 
or corrupt use.  
</p>
<p>22. Perhaps in part motivated by these criticisms, in February 2009 the federal 
Government adopted a Concept Paper on the Sustainable Development of Indigenous 
Peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation (&#8220;Concept Paper&#8221;), 
thereby defining the federal policy from 2009 to 2025 for improving the socio-economic 
conditions, and for protecting the traditional environments, way of life and cultural values, 
of indigenous peoples; and specifying time frames and benchmarks for implementation. 
The policy identifies the following seven objectives: protecting the natural environment and 
traditional use of land and natural resources; developing and modernizing traditional 
commercial activities; increasing the standard of living; improving the demographic 
situation to bring it into line with the national average; improving access to educational </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14779 
</p>
<p>services taking into account specific ethnocultural needs; support for the development of 
clan communities and other forms of self-governance; and protection of cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p>23. The Concept Paper provides that &#8220;immediate measures&#8221; will be taken during the 
first stage, 2009 to 2011, to improve and harmonize legislation; providing a better 
delineation of the jurisdiction of federal, regional and local authorities; solidifying priority 
access to fishing and hunting grounds, and free-of-charge access to land areas for 
traditional use. In connection with another goal for this period, the Government has 
reported that a methodology for assessing damages to traditional use areas by industrial 
activity has already been adopted by the Ministry of Regional Development.5 This first 
implementation stage also envisions the creation of new nomadic schools, trading posts, 
and other infrastructure in areas of traditional dwelling; increasing the availability of 
medical services, and cultural and communications services; increasing the size of federal 
subsidies given to regional budgets to support reindeer husbandry and other types of stock 
breeding; the formation of a federal statistics-gathering system to monitor the condition of 
indigenous peoples, and carrying out analyses of demographic factors and indicators of the 
living standards of indigenous peoples after the 2010 census. 
</p>
<p>24. The Concept Paper is an ambitious and comprehensive document, and demonstrates 
that the federal Government is responding to many of the specific concerns raised by 
indigenous organizations and representatives. The Special Rapporteur heard expressions of 
enthusiasm about the Concept Paper from federal and regional Government officials, and 
also from some members of indigenous communities. One concern indigenous advocates 
voiced, however, was that many of the provisions are too general, which could inhibit the 
potential for speedy implementation or effective accountability. 
</p>
<p>25. Currently the federal Ministry of Regional Development provides 600 million 
roubles (about $20 million) annually, which both federal officials and indigenous 
representatives agreed is insufficient, to be distributed among Governments of the regional 
federal constituent units that apply and qualify. Funds are distributed according to the 
regions&#8217; budgetary needs in relation to the size of the regions&#8217; respective indigenous 
populations, and have to be used to further the seven goals of the Concept Paper; regional 
governments are also required to reach agreements with indigenous peoples in their 
territories on how to use federal subsidies before they can apply to receive those subsidies. 
However, the Special Rapporteur heard concerns that in some cases the opinions of 
indigenous peoples were not adequately considered; that despite the requirement that fund 
allocation decisions be made together with indigenous organizations, the money was spent 
on general problems of the municipalities that had little to do with indigenous issues, or, 
due to insufficient oversight, became subject to corruption and inappropriate uses. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Federal structure and regional legislation, policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Russian Federation is a State with a strong federalist structure of government, 
with 83 constituent units under various denominations (republics, regions, autonomous 
areas, autonomous regions, and federal cities), generally referred to comprehensively as 
&#8220;subjects of the federation&#8221;, or &#8220;federal subjects&#8221;.6 Federal law is supreme throughout 
Russia&#8217;s territory, but federal subjects enjoy significant levels of autonomy and self-
governance. Because the current federal structure in Russia is relatively young, based on 
the Federal Constitution enacted in 1993, many subtle areas of delineation of authority

<p>6
 The terms &#8220;region&#8221; and &#8220;regional government&#8221; are used in this report to refer to any of these federal 
</p>
<p>subjects and their governments. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>between the federal Government and federal subjects are still in flux, especially within the 
sphere of joint or concurrent powers, including that of indigenous issues.  
</p><p>27. The federal Government determines some general legal principles and development 
policies for indigenous people in Russia, while the regional governments implement and 
may in addition legislatively apply, specify and refine these general principles. Federal 
subjects vary significantly in their size, economic and political development, and ethnic 
composition. They also vary significantly in their approach and the degree of attention to 
indigenous issues. 
</p>
<p>28. Several regions of the Russian Federation have established well-developed and 
comprehensive legal frameworks for the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. However, 
close observers agree that most of the regions in Russia have not. Khanti-Mansiysky 
Autonomous Region is often cited as the region with the best laws, programmes and 
relationship between regional authorities and indigenous peoples. The main indigenous 
organization there, &#8220;Salvation of Yugra&#8221;, has been working with and within the regional 
government for the past 15 years to establish a relatively high level of political 
representation and to ensure legislative attention to indigenous issues. In contrast, many 
regions have only recently experienced indigenous political activism and have started to 
frame a legislative approach and policy regime towards indigenous people. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Major issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Land and resources 
</b></p>
<p>29. Indigenous peoples&#8217; ways of life, cultures and traditions in the Russian Federation, 
as elsewhere in the world, have evolved over hundreds of years through a very close 
connection to nature and land. Access to land and natural resources is essential to the ability 
of indigenous peoples to maintain and develop their distinct identities and cultures, as well 
as to develop economically. Indigenous peoples throughout Russia have engaged in and 
depended on activities such as reindeer herding, hunting and fishing in the same or adjacent 
territories for centuries, and today, as many indigenous peoples continue these activities, 
they are looking to further develop them and engage in other resource uses for the future. 
Secure land and resource tenure is one of the most basic human rights for indigenous 
peoples, as emphasized by articles 25&#8211;30 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, and it is a right grounded in general human rights principles of 
equality, property and cultural integrity incorporated into multilateral treaties to which the 
Russian Federation is a party.7 Several federal and regional laws and government 
programmes in the Russian Federation provide some protection for this right but, 
nonetheless, effective enjoyment of the right remains precarious in many if not most 
situations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Relevant legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>30. Post-Soviet Russia has been undergoing a complex and prolonged land reform, 
defining and redefining property and land relationships. According to the federal 
constitution, land and other natural resources may be under private, State, municipal or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 In particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, as made clear by the treaty-monitoring bodies that oversee 
compliance with these instruments. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-14779 
</p>
<p>other form of ownership. Most of the land and subsoil resources in Russia are currently the 
property of the State. All issues concerning ownership, use and allocation of land, mineral 
resources, water and other natural resources are jointly administered by the federal and 
regional Governments. Agricultural, forest, pasture and other land parcels are currently 
utilized by private entities primarily on a lease basis from the Government.  
</p>
<p>31. Consistent with this general framework, indigenous peoples in Russia are accorded 
rights to use the land and its renewable and common resources, while title ownership 
remains with the State. The Special Rapporteur holds the view that such use rights could be 
sufficient to comply with relevant international standards, if they are well established, 
implemented, judicially protected, and working in concert with other entitlements such as 
those of consultation and consent, compensation, environmental protection and 
development.  
</p>
<p>32. Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands and natural resources are promoted by the 
federal law &#8220;On Territories&#8221;. The law provides that the land an indigenous community 
utilizes for traditional economic activities may be granted a special legal designation of 
&#8220;territory of traditional nature use&#8221;, and be assigned to that community to use free-of-
charge for a certain renewable period of time. Once created, the indigenous people living in 
these territories are guaranteed the right to continue to occupy the land and use its 
renewable resources for traditional activities, the right to participate in decision-making 
when industrial development in the territory is considered, and the right to receive 
compensation when industrial development that interferes with their access to land or 
damages the environment occurs there. 
</p>
<p>33. However, a common criticism of the federal law &#8220;On Territories&#8221; is that no 
territories have been established directly under it, and that to date the federal law is lacking 
by-laws or procedures specifying methods for its direct implementation. In response, the 
Ministry of Regional Development reports that it is currently working on a proposal for 
amending the law &#8220;On Territories&#8221; in order to strengthen the law&#8217;s effectiveness and means 
of implementation. Additionally, the Committee on Nationalities at the State Duma is 
working on a new draft law &#8220;On the protection of the environment for traditional way of 
living and traditional nature use of indigenous small-numbered people of the Russian 
Federation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>34. Although no indigenous territories have been established under the federal law, 
regional laws have, to varying extents, within 28 regions of the Russian Federation, 
protected territories for indigenous traditional use, which are documented in an official 
federal listing.8 The regional regimes have functioned well in many cases, for example in 
the Khanti-Mansiyski Autonomous Region where there are 523 traditional use territories 
created under regional law.  
</p>
<p>35. Nevertheless, most indigenous communities across the Russian Federation still do 
not enjoy designated territories, and due to ongoing reforms to the land regime at the 
federal level, which affect regionally created territories, the status of existing territories is 
perceived as legally uncertain. For example, in the designated &#8220;regional territory of 
traditional use&#8221; in the area spanning over 17,000 hectares along the Amur River 
surrounding Sikachi-Alian village in Khabarovky Krai, indigenous residents currently 
enjoy de facto free-of-charge use of land resources and receive preferential access to fishing 
areas. However, concern was expressed to the Special Rapporteur that federal land reforms 
could have the effect of undermining these currently existing regional entitlements, and in

 Common List of Places of Traditional Lifestyles and Traditional Livelihood of Numerically Small 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Federation, N 631-p of 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>this regard the rights of indigenous peoples within the area are feared to be unstable and not 
legally defensible. 
</p>
<p>36. Compounding a lack of implementation and clarity in the legal arrangements 
intended to secure land and resource use are conflicting or inconsistent legal and regulatory 
regimes, such as the relatively new systems of auctioning hunting and fishing licences. In 
many places, including in areas already designated as areas of traditional nature use, 
indigenous peoples are subject to licensing and auctioning regimes that force them to 
auction for hunting and fishing licences in competition with non-indigenous, usually 
commercial, interests, without any priority given to traditional hunting or fishing practices. 
As a result, indigenous communities experience problems realizing their access to the 
resources they have depended on for their livelihood. There are multiple reports of 
indigenous communities that have applied for fishing grounds with no success, especially in 
Buryatia and Kamchatka.  
</p>
<p>37. Further, in some places, fishing and hunting licences are issued with quotas that are 
grossly insufficient to meet nutritional needs, and some indigenous communities are only 
able to obtain licences to fish long distances away from their villages, because licences to 
fish in their traditional fishing areas have been granted to other, often commercial, 
enterprises. Moreover, indigenous people reported difficulties with the application process 
for hunting and fishing licences, including extensive documentation and expensive expert 
report requirements. The Special Rapporteur heard numerous concerns that a newly 
adopted federal law, &#8220;On Hunting&#8221;, to take effect in 2010, does not provide for free-of-
charge hunting for indigenous peoples, although the Government has taken some steps to 
modify this: upon an official recommendation of the Civic Chamber, the Council of the 
Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation has created a working group to modify the 
law. Similarly, a working group was created within the Federal Agency for Fishery, to 
introduce proposals for modifications of the normative framework regulating fisheries. 
</p>
<p>38. Another factor affecting indigenous peoples&#8217; access to lands and natural resources 
has been the establishment of parks or nature reserves on the basis of overriding 
conservationist objectives. In some areas, such as in the Beloyarski municipality in Khanti-
Mansiyski, the establishment of State nature parks has been viewed as positive, since it has 
kept areas free from industrial development and resource extraction, while allowing 
traditional activities to continue. However, in other areas, such as the Sinda village in 
Khabarovsky Krai, specially protected nature parks have been in conflict with the interests 
of the indigenous peoples who traditionally have used resources from these areas.  
</p>
<p>39. Importantly, the federal Government seems to be taking steps to address some of the 
concerns raised regarding land use. In its Concept Paper, the Government states that &#8220;it is 
essential&#8221; for changes to be made to the Land Code and to fishing and wildlife legislation to 
include free-of-charge use of land for traditional activities, and to increase the authority of 
local governing bodies to protect the local environment. Additionally, the federal 
Government has prepared a draft law modifying the Land Code and has created a working 
group to review this law and introduce proposals for modifications consistent with 
indigenous land use guarantees.  
</p>
<p>40. In addressing indigenous land and resource issues, it is necessary to ensure an 
overall regime of access to lands and natural resources for indigenous peoples that is 
forward-looking, taking into account the evident evolving nature of indigenous cultures, 
land-use patterns and economic relationships. Existing guarantees appear to focus on 
&#8220;traditional uses&#8221; &#8212; such as subsistence or relatively small-scale reindeer herding, hunting 
and fishing &#8212; without ensuring that indigenous peoples have secure rights to use and 
develop their lands and resources for purposes beyond such uses as can easily be described 
as &#8220;traditional&#8221;, such as commercial purposes. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms that &#8220;indigenous peoples </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-14779 
</p>
<p>have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to 
development&#8221; (art. 23). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Extractive industries, dams and industrial development affecting indigenous people  
</b></p>
<p>41. The North, Siberia, and the Far East &#8212; the regions where most indigenous people in 
Russia live &#8212; are also those where most of Russia&#8217;s industrial-grade natural resources are 
located. Extensive oil and gas exploration and extractive activity is currently under way in 
the Khanti-Mansiysky Autonomous Region, the Yamal Peninsula, Sakhalin Island, and 
East Siberia, among other areas. Very often oil development occurs on, and transportation 
pipelines are built through, the areas indigenous peoples use as reindeer pastures, or as 
fishing and hunting grounds.  
</p>
<p>42. The law &#8221;On Territories&#8221; provides that where designated traditional nature use 
territories are established, oil and other industrial development may occur only after 
consultation and agreement with the indigenous communities living there. This requirement 
has given rise to many instances of agreements between oil companies and indigenous 
people, in areas where territories of traditional use are established. In at least some 
instances, if coupled with adequate governmental oversight, such agreements could 
constitute good practice in keeping with articles 28 and 32 of the Declaration, which 
provide that indigenous peoples have the right to consultation and informed consent 
regarding any development activity which affects their environment and the land they use, 
regardless of the legal status of that land. 
</p>
<p>43. The Khanti-Mansiysky Autonomous Region, where more than 60 oil companies 
operate, has adopted a regional law to regulate and standardize oil company activities in 
relation to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and practices in the region. Many heads of families 
there have entered into agreements with, and currently receive compensation from, oil 
companies which explore or extract on &#8220;territories of traditional nature use&#8221; or patrimonial 
land. The Khanti-Mansiysky regional administration has provided a model agreement and 
oversees these individual agreements; it acts as an arbiter when conflicts arise, and has 
established a legal department under its executive branch specifically for the purpose of 
representing indigenous people in court. 
</p>
<p>44. One criticism of the current practice that the Special Rapporteur heard from heads of 
families in this region is that they would like to have the opportunity to discuss and 
negotiate all terms of their agreements with oil companies, rather than being presented with 
a model and inflexible contract, preprinted and ready to sign.  
</p>
<p>45. Sakhalin Island was cited as another example of successful cooperation between oil 
companies and indigenous people. After a turbulent relationship with indigenous and 
environmental groups for several years in the early part of the decade, Sakhalin Energy, 
operator of the Sakhalin II project, signed a tripartite agreement with the regional 
administration and the regional council of representatives of the indigenous peoples on 
Sakhalin Island. Sakhalin Energy now participates in the Indigenous Minorities 
Development Plan, and since 2005 has invested US$ 300,000 in projects chosen and 
developed by indigenous people, related to assisting the health, education, research and 
preservation of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages, and the support and preservation of 
traditional culture. There are reports, however, that despite the apparent success of the 
Sakhalin agreement, there remain many problems in the relationship, including the oil 
producer&#8217;s fulfilment of its obligations under the agreement.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that in light of the scope of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
right to self-determination with regard to their economic development and the scope of their 
right to participate in decisions about industrial enterprises which affect them, a broader 
understanding of cooperation is warranted. Rather than limiting the interaction of oil </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>companies and indigenous people to discussion on compensation, both sides and 
administrators should allow for and encourage possible ownership interests and profit-
sharing in extractive industries, where indigenous communities are so inclined.  
</p>
<p>47. There are also reports of serious negative environmental impacts of extractive 
industries. For example, in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region, an area rich in natural 
gas and the site of extensive exploration, some 2,500 km&#178;, which is expected to increase to 
5,500 km&#178;, of plant cover has been completely destroyed, severely affecting reindeer-
herding activities, in which approximately half of the region&#8217;s 9,000 indigenous inhabitants 
engage. The environmental damage has occurred despite the fact that there are 25 regional 
laws allowing reindeer herders to request and participate in ethnological impact 
assessments for land development. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that hospitals, 
schools, and certain employment opportunities for indigenous people have apparently 
improved with the presence of the industrial development in this area. 
</p>
<p>48. Federal Government officials have reported that they are working on preparing a 
federal law that would require ethnological impact assessments for any industrial 
development. Indigenous advocates have noted that this law has been long awaited and is 
essential for assessing the effect of extractive and other enterprises on indigenous peoples, 
and for enabling the exercise of the right to consultation and compensation.  
</p>
<p>49. Indigenous organizations in Russia expressed deep concern about the planned large 
hydroelectric dam in the Evenkiya district of Krasnoyarsky Krai. In 2008, the Russian 
Government approved plans for the construction of the dam to be built by RusHydro (a 
more than 60 per cent government-owned company). The dam is expected to flood about 
one million hectares of forest and six villages, and require the resettlement of about 5,000 
people, including over 1,600 Evenks. The construction of the dam would result in 
significant environmental changes to the surrounding areas, including increases in the 
temperature and humidity levels, changes in biological diversity and the availability of 
plant and animal species on which Evenks have traditionally depended. The Special 
Rapporteur received reports that administrators are engaging in tactics of intimidation and 
investigation of the most vocal activists opposing this project. According to a 2009 poll, 
over 90 per cent of the residents of Evenkiya municipal district would vote against the 
construction of the dam.9 
</p>
<p>50. The project has already generated heated public debate locally and nationally and 
has gained attention internationally. In 2008, the United Nations Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged the Government of the Russian Federation to 
withdraw support for the project (see CERD/C/RUS/CO/19). There is concern that the 
project would be carried out in violation of article 18 of the Declaration, which affirms the 
right of indigenous people to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect 
their rights; and in violation of article 10 of the Declaration, which provides that &#8220;no 
relocation shall take place without free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous 
peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation&#8221;. 
</p><p>51. Federal Government officials reported taking steps to ensure that indigenous people 
from the affected communities would be consulted and that studies will be done to properly 
predict the impact of the dam on the local environment and communities. The Ministry of 
Regional Development assured the Special Rapporteur that public hearings will be held to 
discuss compensation and the negative effect of the construction, that the federal 
Government will oversee RusHydro&#8217;s consultation process with indigenous people in the

</p>
<p>region, and that the Government is committed to finding solutions to the concerns of the 
affected communities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Political participation, consultation and self-governance 
</b></p>
<p>52. Indigenous peoples have the right to participate fully in the political life of the State, 
and to participate in decision-making in matters that would affect their rights, including, but 
not limited to, the right to free, prior and informed consent in legislative and administrative 
measures that may affect them.10 Additionally, as a part of their right to self-determination, 
they have the right to self-government in matters relating to their internal affairs and the 
right to maintain and develop their own decision-making institutions.11 In the context of the 
Russian Federation, these entitlements relate to indigenous political representation at the 
federal and regional levels, and to autonomous governance at the local and community 
level.  
</p>
<p>53. Several factors, in addition to the small size of their populations, impede the ability 
of indigenous peoples in Russia to engage in effective political participation. Indigenous 
people live in remote areas, far from urban centres and from each other, without easy access 
to transportation or means of communication, and live in small, often single-family, groups. 
Additionally, the traditional indigenous leadership structures were severely damaged in the 
1940s as a result of the Soviet regime&#8217;s anti-insurgency activities and the subsequent 
totalitarian regime. Compounding these factors is that in many places negative attitudes and 
stereotypes about indigenous people appear to persist, making indigenous identity a liability 
in political processes. 
</p>
<p>54. Federal officials assured the Special Rapporteur that when federal executive bodies 
make critical decisions affecting the interests of indigenous people they seek the 
participation of indigenous representatives; they have further stated that the cooperation 
between federal governing authorities and indigenous associations is regarded as one of the 
priorities of the national policy of Russia. Consultations with indigenous peoples on 
legislation affecting them are not legally secured, however, and consist mainly of extending 
opportunities for indigenous representatives to participate in consultative working groups 
whenever such groups are created to review new legislation. 
</p>
<p>55. Currently, the policy areas that affect indigenous peoples are dealt with by various 
ministries and departments without any strategic coordination focused on indigenous issues 
or direct indigenous representative participation. Federal policy and social programmes are 
developed by the Ministry of Regional Development, fishing policies and regulations are 
developed by the Ministry of Natural Resources, while hunting is within the jurisdiction of 
the Ministry of Agriculture; further, according to close observers, most legislative processes 
occur with no consideration of, or expertise on, indigenous issues. 
</p>
<p>56. While in many parts of the Russian Federation indigenous peoples remain 
underrepresented in executive and legislative bodies, some regional governments have 
shown sensitivity to the factors affecting indigenous peoples&#8217; ability to fully participate in 
political processes at the regional level, and have attempted to facilitate and ensure such 
participation in various ways. For example, in 1996 the Khanti-Mansiysky Autonomous 
Region was the first region in the new Russian Federation, only two years after its 
formation, to formalize representation of indigenous peoples through legislation by 
statutorily creating the Assembly of Indigenous Peoples as a part of the structure of the

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>regional Duma (parliament). The region&#8217;s administration works closely under a formal 
agreement with the indigenous organization &#8220;Salvation of Yugra&#8221; (which has 22 offices 
throughout the region with over 3,000 active participants) when making any decisions 
affecting indigenous peoples. Together, they have adopted a general policy on indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights, and over 10 laws and 40 normative acts guaranteeing the rights of 
indigenous peoples to priority and free-of-charge use of land, language education, self-
organization, development of reindeer herding, and promoting the pursuit of traditional 
activities. This region is the only federal subject in the Russian Federation to have 
legislated a quota of indigenous representation at the regional Duma (3 out of 21 seats there 
are reserved for indigenous people). 
</p><p>57. Khabarovsky Krai has established an indigenous body with consultative status in the 
Governor&#8217;s office, the Regional Council of Representatives of Indigenous Peoples of the 
Governor&#8217;s Office, which was created in 2003 under the regional law &#8220;On Representation 
of Indigenous Peoples&#8221;. Each village elects representatives for its municipal council, and 
the heads of municipal councils sit on the Regional Council of Representatives of 
Indigenous Peoples, currently consisting of 15 members. All decisions of the Government 
of Khabarovsky Krai that have to do with indigenous peoples are discussed in consultation 
with the Council, and the Council can make proposals to regional and federal legislative 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>58. With regard to indigenous peoples&#8217; right to autonomous governance, the federal 
Law &#8220;On guarantees&#8221; affirms that indigenous people may set up territorial self-government 
bodies in places of compact settlement, form communities and other organizations, and 
have courts consider their customary laws provided these are not contradicted by federal or 
regional legislation. In particular, the law &#8220;On Obshchina&#8221; specifies the formation of 
&#8220;obshchina&#8221;, or clan community, &#8220;created for the goals of defending their age-old 
surroundings, and the maintenance and development of traditional ways of life, economy, 
trades and culture&#8221;. Obshchinas may group together a single family, a few families, or a 
whole village, and are entitled to receive use rights for allotments of land parcels, and 
quotas for fishing and hunting, accommodating their traditional practices. However, the 
Special Rapporteur heard concerns that in practice the obshchina system does not function 
to adequately or consistently secure indigenous self-governance in accordance with 
customary patterns of community organization and leadership, and that the activities under 
obshchina authority are limited to those considered traditional, and thus do not include 
commercial activities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Socio-economic concerns 
</b></p>
<p>59. The indigenous people of Russia continue to experience deep-rooted and complex 
socio-economic problems due largely to the disruptive management of their communities 
during communism and the crippling effects of post-communist transition to a free-market 
economy. The socio-economic indicators for indigenous peoples are dramatically inferior to 
those for other Russians (see paragraphs 66 and 74). Some improvements have been 
achieved in the last 10 years, but efforts should continue and be strengthened especially in 
the areas of job creation and economic development, education, and health care in order to 
enable the potential for vibrant and self-sufficient indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Long-term strategies for economic development 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Government&#8217;s principal policy with regard to indigenous peoples is to ensure 
the preservation of their unique cultures by supporting their traditional economic activities. 
In this connection, the Special Rapporteur observed that many Government officials with 
whom he met seemed to operate under the assumption that if indigenous people carry out </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-14779 
</p>
<p>non-traditional, mainstream economic activities, their cultures and identities, and, 
consequently, their status as protected small-numbered indigenous peoples will be 
threatened.  
</p>
<p>61. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur notes that examples in Russian and other parts 
of the world have shown that indigenous communities are able to enter into successful 
entrepreneurship that extends beyond traditional economies, without having to sacrifice 
their unique cultures. In this connection, articles 3, 20 and 23 of the Declaration state that 
indigenous peoples have the right to &#8220;freely pursue their economic, social and cultural 
development&#8221;, to maintain and develop their economic systems, and &#8220;to determine and 
develop priorities for exercising their right to development&#8221;. The right to development 
includes the right to preserve and continue traditional economic activities and the right to 
choose to develop those activities in the modern world and participate in broader spheres of 
economic life.  
</p>
<p>62. In fact, indigenous communities in Russia with whom the Special Rapporteur spoke 
expressed a strong desire to participate much more actively in economic activities that are 
not considered traditional, such as oil development or other commercial and industrial 
enterprises, or development of tourist destinations around historic sites. They view this as a 
way to ensure the economic viability of their communities without a long-term dependence 
on Government subsidies.  
</p>
<p>63. For example villagers from Surinda Village in Krasnoyarsky Krai, where about 500 
Evenks live, explained that their community cannot survive on reindeer herding alone. 
Currently the village depends on regional and federal subsidies, but the budget allocated to 
the village is largely insufficient to meet the community&#8217;s needs for new housing and 
infrastructure, inter alia. The villagers expressed the hope that in the future they would be 
able to start commercial enterprises and thereby create an independent revenue stream for 
their community and enable it to develop and thrive without long-term reliance on 
governmental support.  
</p>
<p>64. Another example is the village of Sikachi-Alian in Khabarovsky Krai, with a 
population of 312, mostly Nanai, residents, which is situated near 12,000 year-old 
petroglyphs, remnants of an ancient Nanai settlement. The village subsists primarily on 
financial assistance from the regional government, although 60 per cent of the villagers 
work in a nearby city. The officials of the village expressed an interest in developing the 
historic petroglyph site as a tourist destination, complete with tours and souvenir and 
traditional crafts gift shops, in order to enable the village to be self-sufficient economically. 
However, this is currently not possible, because all historical heritage locations are the 
property of the federal Government and not within the village&#8217;s control.  
</p>
<p>65. Some Government officials in Moscow expressed openness to the idea that 
indigenous peoples could participate actively in the mainstream economy, but stated that 
there are many obstacles to this. Because of the location of indigenous settlements, remote 
from urban centres, transportation costs for what they produce are often prohibitive or 
render production non-competitive. The Special Rapporteur hopes that Government 
officials will nevertheless develop a long-term vision of economic development in 
indigenous areas, and strive to support and encourage various models of economic 
exchange and enterprises, including support for and development of non-traditional 
economic activities.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Education 
</b></p>
<p>66. While there are many positive developments in the area of indigenous education, 
problems remain. As of 2002, 48 per cent of indigenous people in Russia had only 
elementary education and 17 per cent were illiterate, compared respectively with 8 per cent </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14779 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>and 0.5 per cent for all of Russia.12 In many communities, only between 15 and 50 per cent 
study their native language.  
</p>
<p>67. Given the remoteness of indigenous settlements, most indigenous children are taught 
in boarding schools. However, in conversations with the Special Rapporteur, teachers 
shared the view that boarding schools are not an ideal model for indigenous education since 
they uproot indigenous children, physically and culturally, from their traditional 
environments and families. Some regional governments have explored educational 
opportunities that are better suited to indigenous communities than the boarding school 
model, such as itinerant schools, which travel with reindeer herders.  
</p>
<p>68. More generally, the quality and relevance to the indigenous communities of the 
schools that serve them would be improved if those communities, especially the parents 
among them, had more control over the curriculum and administrative decisions. The 
school curriculum is determined by regional administrators who are required to follow a 
core federally defined curriculum for each grade. Indigenous children follow this 
curriculum, with an added indigenous language course. Regional administrators have some 
flexibility, and some schools try to recreate traditional rituals and teach traditional 
activities, but parents and local communities have very limited input into curriculum 
decisions. 
</p>
<p>69. Article 14 of the Declaration states that indigenous people have the right to establish 
and control their own educational institutions, teach children in their native language and 
choose the manner of education that is appropriate to their cultures and communities. While 
there may be multiple obstacles to providing education to small and remote settlements, and 
communities that practise a nomadic way of life, there should be determined efforts to 
foster a flexible educational framework, allowing for stronger control by indigenous 
communities. 
</p>
<p>70. Several non-governmental sources have pointed out that certain federal policies have 
had a negative effect on indigenous educational institutions. For example, the federal policy 
of &#8220;optimization&#8221;, which aims to consolidate certain municipal services in concert with the 
local self-government reform under the federal law &#8220;On general principles of local self-
government in Russia&#8221;13 have resulted in school closings in many small settlements. The 
Special Rapporteur heard testimony about Baklaniha village in Krasnoyarsky Krai, and a 
Shor village in the Kemerovski Region, which remain without schools due to school 
closings. Concerned individuals and NGOs argue that such school closings leave no option 
for families with children but to relocate and abandon their communities. While the extent 
of this problem is unclear, school closings should be carefully considered in light of their 
potential disparate impact on indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>71. Additionally, in recent years, on the basis of the federal law &#8220;On Education&#8221;, many 
regions have started financing schools on a per capita basis, resulting in disproportionate 
disadvantages to schools in small settlements, and the elimination of positions for school 
psychologists, social pedagogical workers, or special needs teachers. In many institutions, 
extracurricular arts, crafts and performance courses have also been eliminated, and for 
certain courses, children in first through fourth grades are taught together.

<p><b> 3. Language 
</b></p>
<p>72. Article 68 of the federal Russian Constitution guarantees the right of people to 
preserve and develop their native languages. Importantly, federal Government officials 
strongly expressed recognition of the importance of preserving and enabling further 
development of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages. The Russian Federation is currently 
discussing the possibility of ratifying the European Charter for Regional or Minority 
Languages. The Government is consulting with European partners on how the Charter 
could be adapted to the large number of indigenous languages in the Russian Federation; 
pilot programmes have been initiated in Dagestan, Altai and Mordovia. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur witnessed several successful and positive initiatives enacted 
by regional governments and educational institutions to document, preserve and teach 
native languages, but also heard accounts of endangered and dying languages. There are 
efforts to support publishing of books and textbooks in native languages, and to develop a 
methodology for teaching indigenous languages. Many institutions of higher learning and 
cultural centres have set up laboratories or departments for the study of indigenous 
languages. Even when textbooks and books in native languages are printed, however, they 
may not reach the remote settlements where the languages are used.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Health 
</b></p>
<p>74. As of 2002, the average life expectancy of indigenous people in Russia was 15 years 
less than the Russian average,14 the unemployment rate was above 50 per cent in places, 
and the suicide rate up to four times the Russian average.15 Despite some signs of improved 
heath indicators for the indigenous population over the last few years, there are still some 
alarming reports of the health situation of indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>75. In part as a result of the health situation of indigenous communities, many 
indigenous groups have experienced a drastic decline in population, and some have reached 
the brink of extinction. Even though the populations of the Nenets, Orok, Selkups, Khanty, 
Yukaghirs, Negidals, Tofalars, Itelmen, Kets, together with the overall population of 
indigenous people are slowly growing, some indigenous groups are still endangered.16 
Academic literature notes that several indigenous groups have already become extinct in 
the past century in Russia; there exists a disagreement, however, about whether certain 
groups have disappeared or are being included as subgroups under larger related ethnic 
groups. Better information should be available after the results of the forthcoming 
nationwide census to take place in October 2010, which will provide an opportunity for all 
Russians to indicate their ethnic identities.  
</p>
<p>76. The challenges in health care are largely related to the remoteness and small size of 
settlements, which affect access to and the expense of medical care. In many instances, 
regional governments provide access to health in remote areas by building medical clinics 
headed by nurse practitioners in compact settlements, and by flying in periodic shift 
medical brigades via helicopter periodically to administer routine exams, vaccinations, and 
other care. In emergency situations, telephone and satellite communication are utilized, 
medical brigades are flown to remote settlements, or patients are flown to nearby hospitals. 
However, there are many reports of villages, specifically in Kamchatka, that have not had

<p>these regular visits by medical brigades and at least one village, the very small Pareni 
village in Kamchatka, has had no access to medical care for two years.  
</p>
<p>77. Environmental contamination has significant negative impact on the health of 
indigenous people. The contamination of the river Amur, which flows from China, has been 
a major concern in Khabarovsky Krai. The pollution of the river causes a much higher than 
natural occurrence of parasites in fish, and raw fish is a main staple of food for the 
indigenous people in the region. The regional government has enacted the &#8220;Clear Water&#8221; 
and &#8220;Fresh Bread&#8221; programmes to attempt to make clean drinking water available and 
encourage consumption of grains in addition to the heavily meat-based diet of indigenous 
people, and so far the region has established water purification stations and built 22 
bakeries in compact settlements.  
</p>
<p>78. Traditional methods of healing are not rejected by the official health institutions; 
however, hospitals and medical centres are not directed to take traditional medicinal 
methods into account when prescribing medications or issuing diagnoses. Persons may be 
considered &#8220;traditional healers&#8221; if they have formal medical education, and acquire a 
licence to practise alternative medicine from the regional health department. Shamanism, 
the traditional practice of using spiritual healing methods, is studied academically, but the 
practice itself is suffering. In Evenkiya, for example, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that there are only two practising Evenki shamans left.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b><i>  General legal and policy framework 
</i></p>
<p>79. <b>The Russian Federation has taken important steps towards ensuring the 
realization of the human rights of the country&#8217;s &#8220;small-numbered indigenous 
peoples&#8221;. However, continuous and focused attention is necessary in order to 
accelerate positive developments, to ensure better implementation of existing legal 
guarantees, and to ensure that the Russian Federation&#8217;s commitment to human rights 
principles and to specific policy benchmarks are realized for all indigenous peoples 
throughout Russia</b>.  
</p>
<p>80. <b>Moreover, the federal and regional Governments should work together to 
establish optimal and harmonious legislation and policy on indigenous issues, allowing 
sufficient flexibility for regional authority without compromising federal priorities 
and guidance. Special attention should be paid to ensuring the successful 
implementation of legal guarantees at the local level for all indigenous communities, 
such as by establishing reliable ways to monitor implementation and to remedy 
breaches of the guarantees.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>The rights of ethnically distinct indigenous groups that do not meet the 
legislative criteria for designation as &#8220;small-numbered indigenous peoples&#8221;, but that 
nonetheless have characteristics similar to those within this category, should be 
protected. Consideration should be given to adapting this category, or to otherwise 
extending special protections for the benefit of such groups, in accordance with 
relevant international standards.</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The federal Government should consider declaring its support for the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, engage in a comprehensive 
review of the laws and policies of the Russian Federation to ensure their compatibility 
with the Declaration, and take further coordinated action to implement the standards 
of the Declaration within the particular context of indigenous peoples in Russia. </b></p>

</p>
<p><i>  Lands and natural resources 
</i></p>
<p>83. <b>It is essential that the State urgently bring coherence, consistency and certainty 
to the various laws that concern the rights of indigenous peoples and particularly their 
access to land and resources. In accordance with international standards, guarantees 
for indigenous land and resource rights should be legally certain; implemented fully 
and fairly for all indigenous communities; consistent between federal and regional 
frameworks; and consistent throughout various legislation dealing with property 
rights, land leases and auctions, fisheries and forestry administration, national parks 
and environmental conservation, oil development and regulation of commercial 
enterprises.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Legislated land and resource use guarantees for indigenous people should be 
able to withstand any future land reform, hunting or fishing law amendments, and 
any other new laws that affect indigenous communities. Urgent attention should be 
paid to ensuring proper modifications or revisions to the land code, the federal law on 
hunting, and other legal provisions that currently contradict or hinder indigenous 
land and resource rights. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Extractive and other industrial activities 
</i></p>
<p>85. <b>Additional federal legislation is needed to regulate the interaction between 
industrial and extractive enterprises and indigenous communities, with a special 
emphasis on the right of indigenous peoples to be effectively consulted about 
industrial activities affecting them, and the right to compensation and mitigation 
measures. The federal legislature should develop standards and models for 
consultation mechanisms between indigenous peoples and industrial and extractive 
industries, in accordance with relevant international standards, and should enact a 
requirement for ethnographic impact assessments and ensure that ecological 
resources are shared with a view towards their sustainable long-term usefulness. It is 
essential to note that indigenous peoples&#8217; right to be consulted about decisions that 
affect them should be protected whenever industrial development affects their 
communities, even when there is no established territory of traditional nature use or 
other recognized land use entitlement.</b>  
</p>
<p>86. <b>In many instances agreements have been concluded for the development of 
natural resources on or near indigenous lands, bringing some benefits to the 
indigenous peoples concerned. However, a broader understanding of cooperation is 
called for: rather than limiting the interaction between extractive industries and 
indigenous people to compensation agreements, administrators should encourage 
ownership interest and profit-sharing in extractive industries, when indigenous 
communities are so inclined. </b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The federal Government should establish reliable methods of monitoring the 
development of industrial projects, such as the Evenkia Dam, to ensure that 
indigenous people&#8217;s rights to effective consultation, compensation and mitigation 
measures are fully respected. This is especially crucial for Government-approved 
projects requiring relocation &#8211; an especially intrusive and disruptive measure, which 
should be implemented only with the free, prior, and informed consent of the 
indigenous peoples affected. It is essential that the Government authorities and the 
indigenous community in question agree together on a relocation site, that their land 
use rights are legally guaranteed, and that they receive all necessary support to be 
able to establish their new community in a manner they choose.</b>  </p>

<p><i>  Political participation and self-governance 
</i>88. <b>Generally, indigenous peoples are underrepresented in State institutions at the 
federal and regional levels. To address this, steps should be taken to strengthen and 
further develop official mechanisms to ensure that indigenous people receive adequate 
opportunity for political participation, and legislation should be enacted to ensure that 
indigenous people are consulted, in accordance with international standards, when 
legislative, policy or administrative decisions affecting them are undertaken. Federal 
and regional Governments should provide encouragement and support for the 
creation of indigenous civil society organizations to improve their participation in all 
aspects of society.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The federal and regional Governments should consider establishing indigenous 
parliamentary councils or assemblies to represent indigenous peoples and participate 
in ongoing legal and policy developments, as has already been done at least to some 
extent in some regions. Traditional leadership structures and customary law, to the 
extent that they are experiencing a revival and growth, should be effectively 
recognized in developing mechanisms to ensure indigenous participation and local 
self-governance.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>Governing institutions at every level should demonstrate a respect for 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to develop and be governed by their own customary law and 
decision-making institutions, and enable customary law to be considered by courts in 
adjudicating disputes when indigenous people or issues are involved. Legal 
protections for the effective exercise of indigenous local self-governance should be 
strengthened.</b> 
</p>
<p><i>  Economic development 
</i></p>
<p>91. <b>In light of the scope of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination with 
regard to their economic development, it is necessary to ensure an overall legal and 
policy regime that is forward looking, taking into account the evolving nature of 
indigenous cultures, land use patterns and economic relationships. A number of 
important protections for reindeer herding and other traditional economic activities 
are in place, and these should be strengthened and effectively implemented. The 
federal and regional Governments should also consider providing encouragement and 
support for indigenous entrepreneurship in economic activities not necessarily limited 
to smaller-scale traditional activities, as a way of strengthening communities and 
enabling self-governance, job creation and self-sufficiency.</b>  
</p>
<p><i>  Education and language 
</i></p>
<p>92. <b>Further efforts should be made to strengthen educational opportunities for 
indigenous people, who as a whole in Russia have higher levels of illiteracy than other 
members of the population. The federal and regional Governments should support 
indigenous peoples&#8217; efforts to establish educational institutions that best suit their 
communities. The Governments, together with indigenous peoples, should continue to 
experiment with new models of education more suited to indigenous peoples&#8217; needs 
and priorities and also continue to improve the boarding school model. Mechanisms 
should be developed to enable indigenous communities, especially parents, to have 
greater and more regular input in curriculum decisions for schools, and allow 
sufficient flexibility for parental participation in decisions regarding subjects that are 
taught, the language in which these subjects are taught and other matters.</b>  
93. <b>Reports of school closings and the negative effects of these on small indigenous 
communities should be thoroughly investigated and remedied, and any government </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> GE.10-14779 
</p>
<p><b>policies that have the effect of encouraging such closings or reduced educational 
opportunities for communities should be closely reviewed.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Several significant initiatives are in place to preserve and promote indigenous 
languages, although further efforts may be needed to address endangered or dying 
languages. Priority should be given to ensuring indigenous control over language 
preservation and development programmes.</b> 
</p>
<p><i>  Health 
</i></p>
<p>95. <b>Overall, the situation of indigenous health in Russia is precarious due to a 
number of historical factors. Government initiatives to address this situation should 
be strengthened, with mechanisms put in place to enable indigenous communities to 
participate fully in institutional decision-making regarding their health care. 
Indigenous representatives have indicated that federal and regional health-care 
programmes should ensure and provide more frequent regular medical brigades to 
visit remote areas for regular health checks and enable easier access when medical 
services are needed. The potential of new technology to provide solutions to some of 
the problems of accessing medical care should be examined and utilized. Alcoholism 
and the health consequences of environmental contamination should receive special 
attention. Both the revival of traditional medicine and the training of more indigenous 
doctors in mainstream medicine should be encouraged.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>Special attention should be paid to the well-being of women and children, and 
more data should be collected on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s specific health and social 
indicators during the next nationwide census (scheduled for 2014).</b>
