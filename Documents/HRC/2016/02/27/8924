<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation visited Costa Rica from 19 to 27 March 2009. The key themes of 
the visit were water contamination due to the lack of wastewater treatment, the significant 
disparities existing in the country with regard to access to potable water and sanitation and the 
adverse impact of productive and tourism activities on the right of affected communities to have 
access to a safe water supply. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert welcomes the significant progress made by Costa Rica in 
increasing access to water for human consumption and improved sanitation. In 2007, 99 per cent 
of the urban population and 96 per cent of the rural population had access to an improved source 
of water, while 82 per cent of the national population had access to safe drinking water. She also 
notes with satisfaction that approximately 98 per cent of the urban and rural population had 
access to a source of improved sanitation. The results achieved place Costa Rica among the most 
advanced countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region. 
</p>
<p> Costa Rica has developed a comprehensive legal and policy framework for the protection 
and promotion of access to potable water and sanitation. In particular, the independent expert 
notes with appreciation that, according to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of 
Justice, access to safe drinking water constitutes an inalienable human right that may be enforced 
in national courts. The independent expert also notes the efforts made by Costa Rica to improve 
the quality of water for human consumption and to promote an adequate management of human 
excreta and wastewater. 
</p>
<p> Despite the progress made by Costa Rica with regard to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation, several key challenges persist in these areas. The independent expert considers that 
the legal framework created by the 1946 Water Law for the management and use of water 
resources no longer takes account of the current social and economic situation of the country, 
and needs to be urgently revised and updated. The existing normative framework on water and 
sanitation is spread over a wide number of laws and regulations, and its complexity, coupled 
with the involvement of a large number of institutions and organizations in its implementation, 
raises serious doubts about the role and responsibilities of these institutions, duplication of 
responsibilities, lack of inter-agency coordination and, at times, conflicting competencies in the 
planning and development of water and sanitation policies. Effective implementation of the 
legislation and policies on water and sanitation is also hindered by the fact that several 
institutions with competencies to monitor compliance with the existing normative framework do 
not have sufficient human, technical and financial resources to carry out their monitoring 
functions effectively. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert is concerned about the serious disparities existing in some 
provinces and districts of Costa Rica with regard to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
She notes in particular that an estimated 18 per cent of the population still does not have access 
to potable water owing to lack of maintenance of existing infrastructures, inefficient 
management and operation of aqueducts, and the absence of programmes to monitor water 
quality. She also notes with concern that 63 per cent of human excreta and wastewater is directly 
disposed of in rivers and other water streams, and that only 3.5 per cent of wastewater is actually </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/24/Add.1

</p>
<p>treated before being discharged into the natural environment. Indigenous peoples and persons 
belonging to other marginalized and vulnerable groups, including persons living in poverty, 
Afro-descendants and migrant workers, often have limited or no access to potable water and 
adequate sanitation. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, the independent expert expresses her concerns about the current pattern of tourist 
and real estate development in the country, especially in the northern coastal areas, which creates 
serious social conflicts between the demand of local communities for water for human 
consumption and the economic interests of investors and real estate developers, and risks having 
long-term negative effects on the water resources of Costa Rica, as well as on the preservation of 
its natural environment. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the independent expert visited Costa Rica from 19 
to 27 March 2009. The purpose of the mission was to assess, in a spirit of cooperation and 
dialogue, how Costa Rica endeavours to implement its human rights obligations related to access 
to safe drinking water and sanitation, with a view to identifying good practices and assisting the 
Government, and other relevant actors, in their efforts to address the challenges and obstacles in 
that regard.  
</p>
<p>2. The agenda for the independent expert&#8217;s visit was arranged in close cooperation with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme in Costa Rica. The 
independent expert thanks all those involved in the preparation of her mission for their valuable 
cooperation and assistance. 
</p>
<p>3. During the visit, the independent expert met senior officials from the Ministries of Health, 
including the Vice-Minister for Health, Foreign Affairs and the Environment, Energy and 
Telecommunications, as well as representatives of different agencies with competencies in water 
management and sanitation, including the Costa Rican Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers, the 
Water Department of the National Meteorological Institute, the National Service for 
Groundwater, Irrigation and Drainage, the Regulatory Authority for Public Services, and 
municipalities, including the mayors of San Jos&#233; and Cartago. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert held discussions with various members of the Legislative 
Assembly, including the President of the Environment Commission, judges of the Constitutional 
Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Environmental Administrative Tribunal, and 
representatives of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, including the Ombudsperson. She also had the 
opportunity to meet with representatives of relevant United Nations specialized agencies and 
programmes, civil society organizations, academic institutions and the private sector. 
</p>
<p>5. During her mission, the independent expert visited several places in the provinces of 
Guanacaste, Puntarenas and Lim&#243;n. In Guanacaste, she visited the water basins of the 
Monte Alto nature reserve and Sardinal, as well as the tourist and real estate infrastructures in 
Playa del Coco and Playa Ocotal, and met with various civil society representatives. In the 
province of Puntarenas, the independent expert visited the Manuel Antonio national park, the 
poor residential area of La Pascua, as well as a school and a police station in Quepos. In the 
Lim&#243;n province, she met with civil society representatives of the community of Gu&#225;cimo and 
Siquirres to consider the alleged contamination of groundwater sources, caused in particular by 
pineapple plantations.  
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert wishes to express her gratitude to all those whom she met for their 
excellent cooperation. She was impressed and inspired by their commitment and tireless efforts 
in the defence of water. </p>

</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>7. Costa Rica is party to six of the seven core international human rights treaties,<b>1</b> some of 
which contain explicit references to safe drinking water or sanitation.<b>2</b> Other international and 
regional human rights treaties ratified by Costa Rica, while not containing explicit references, 
show that access to safe drinking water and sanitation represent a precondition for the effective 
exercise of a number of human rights, including the right to life, the prohibition of torture and 
other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to health, the right to education, 
the right to adequate housing and the right to food.  
</p>
<p>8. Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, for 
example, specifies a number of rights emanating from, and indispensable for, the realization of 
the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing. In its 
general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights observed that the use of the word &#8220;including&#8221; indicated that this catalogue of 
rights was not intended to be exhaustive, and concluded that the right to water fell within the 
category of guarantees essential for securing an adequate standard of living, since water is one of 
the most fundamental conditions for survival. The Committee noted that an adequate amount of 
safe water was &#8220;necessary to prevent death from dehydration, to reduce the risk of water-related 
disease and to provide for consumption, cooking, personal and domestic hygienic requirements&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 6 (1982) on the right to life, 
stressed that the expression &#8220;inherent right to life&#8221; could not be properly understood in a 
restrictive manner, and that the protection of that right required States to adopt positive measures 
to reduce infant mortality, to increase life expectancy and eliminate malnutrition and epidemics. 
In their concluding observations, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against 
Torture have repeatedly stressed that poor sanitation conditions constitute a violation of the right 
of persons deprived of their liberty to be treated with humanity and with respect for their 
inherent dignity. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
<b>2
</b>  Art. 14, para. 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women; art. 24, para. 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/24/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>10. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights also interpreted the right to life as including 
access to conditions that guarantee a dignified life,<b>3</b> and heard several cases concerning the State 
obligation to ensure adequate conditions of health, hygiene and sanitation for persons deprived 
of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>11. According to article 7, paragraph 1, of the Constitution, international treaties duly 
approved by the Legislative Assembly take precedence over domestic legislation. The 
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice has stated in a number of decisions that 
international human rights treaties in force in Costa Rica &#8220;not only have similar status to the 
Constitution but also, insofar as they grant greater rights or guarantees to persons, take 
precedence over the Constitution&#8221;.<b>4</b> Article 2 of the Constitutional Jurisdiction Act establishing 
the Constitutional Chamber states that the latter can apply not only the rights enshrined in the 
Constitution, but also those recognized under international law in force in Costa Rica. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Constitution of Costa Rica, adopted in 1949, is the fundamental legal instrument for 
the protection and promotion of human rights. Title V of the Constitution, which protects some 
economic, social and cultural rights, does not include any provision on access to safe drinking 
water or sanitation. Nevertheless, national courts, including the Constitutional Chamber, have, 
on a number of occasions, used article 21 of the Constitution (right to life) and article 50 (right to 
a healthy and ecologically-balanced environment) as the legal bases for the recognition of a 
fundamental right to potable water (see paragraph 31 below).  
</p>
<p>13. The Water Law (law No. 276 of 1946) establishes the main legal framework for the 
management and use of water resources in Costa Rica. The State, through the grant of 
concessions, regulates the use of public water resources by individuals and enterprises 
(arts. 18-29) in accordance with the principle that, in the event of water scarcity, water for 
domestic consumption is to be accorded the highest priority over other possible uses 
(arts. 140-142).  
</p>
<p>14. In addition to the Water Law, there are a wide number of laws and regulations on the 
protection and sustainable use of water resources, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Potable Water Law (law No. 1634 of 1953) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The General Health Law (law No. 5395 of 1973, arts. 264-277) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The General Environment Law (law No. 7574 of 1995, arts. 50-52 and 64-67) 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; The Regulation on the Quality of Potable Water (decree No. 32.327-S of 2005) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Regulation for the Evaluation and Classification of the Quality of Surface Water 
Bodies (decree No. 33.903-MINAE-S of 2007) 
</p>
<p>15. There is a general recognition in Costa Rica that the normative framework created with 
the 1946 Water Law no longer corresponds to the economic and social situation of the country. 
Since 2001, several draft laws have been prepared, but, to date, such efforts have not been 
successful. The status of the draft water law (<i>Expediente No. 14.585</i>) approved in March 2005 by 
the Environment Commission of the Legislative Assembly is unclear at present, and a new 
proposal drafted by an intersectoral commission coordinated by the Ministry of the Environment, 
which had not been made public at the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, seems to have met 
the opposition of several non-governmental organizations working on water issues.  
</p>
<p>16. The normative framework on sanitation is similarly spread over a wide number of laws and 
regulations. The General Health Law and the General Environment Law contain the main 
principles on the collection, management, treatment and disposal of human excreta and 
wastewater, as well as on the protection of water resources from contamination. In addition to 
these laws, there are several other regulations that aim at ensuring the safe treatment and disposal 
of wastewater, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A regulation on the management of sludge from septic tanks (decree No. 21297-S 
of 1992) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A regulation on the dumping and reuse of wastewater (decree No. 26042-S-MINAE 
of 1997) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A regulation on the approval and operation of wastewater treatment systems 
(decree No. 31545-S-MINAE, revised in 2005) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A regulation creating the environmental tax for dumping polluting substances in water 
(decree No. 34431-MINAE-S of 2008) 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Telecommunications has overall 
responsibility for the management of water resources. It has far-reaching functions relating to the 
supply, management, use, protection and monitoring of public water, including the power to 
grant water permits or licences for the drilling of new wells in accordance with the Water Law. 
The Ministry also has general responsibilities for the collection, management, treatment and 
disposal of human excreta, wastewater and stormwater. 
</p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Health is responsible, in accordance with the General Health Law, for 
preventing contamination of water resources, developing regulatory measures on water quality 
and for monitoring their effective implementation by water suppliers. Its responsibilities include 
monitoring the quality of safe drinking water provided by national operators. The Ministry is 
also responsible for authorizing projects concerning sewage system and wastewater treatment, as 
well as for monitoring their implementation. </p>

<p> A/HRC/12/24/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>19. The Costa Rican Institute of Aqueducts and Sewers (AyA) is an autonomous State 
institution with overall responsibility for the development and implementation of legislation and 
policies concerning the supply of safe drinking water and the collection, management, treatment 
and disposal of human excreta, wastewater and stormwater in urban areas. In addition to this 
general responsibility, it is also in charge of administering and operating directly aqueducts and 
sewage systems throughout the country (see paragraph 41 below) and is responsible for ensuring 
the continuity of water provision when other water providers are not in a position to continue 
supplying water to the population.  
</p>
<p>20. The Regulatory Authority for Public Services (ARESEP) is an autonomous institution 
responsible for the economic regulation, including fixing tariffs, of water and sanitation services 
supplied by AyA, the Administrative Associations for Aqueducts and Sewers (ASADAS) and 
private providers (the tariffs for services provided by the municipalities are fixed by the 
municipalities themselves). ARESEP also adopts technical regulations aimed at ensuring the 
efficiency and quality of services provided by the water operators, and monitors compliance with 
regulations through technical inspections.  
</p>
<p>21. The National Service for Groundwater, Irrigation and Drainage (SENARA) is a technical 
agency with a mandate to establish, manage, maintain and develop systems of irrigation and 
drainage, as well as to protect and monitor the use of surface and groundwater resources. It also 
carries out hydrological studies to assess the potential production of aquifers, and gives permits 
for the use of groundwater resources, indicating the maximum amount of water that can be 
extracted on an annual basis. Its decisions concerning the perforation of wells and the 
exploitation, maintenance and protection of groundwater resources are final and must be 
respected.  
</p>
<p>22. Over 20 other ministries and public institutions play a role in the water sector, sometimes 
with overlapping functions and responsibilities. These include the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Livestock, the Costa Rican Institute of Tourism and the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Water and sanitation policies 
</b></p>
<p>23. The definition of the principles, objectives and strategies concerning the management 
and use of water resources and the collection and treatment of wastewater falls within the 
competence of the Ministry of the Environment as the leading agency for the water sector. 
However, Costa Rica has not yet elaborated and implemented a comprehensive national 
strategy for the sustainable management and use of water resources, and water and 
sanitation policies are currently spread over a wide number of laws, regulations and policy 
documents.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>

Energ&#237;a</i>, 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/24/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>24. The Jorge Manuel Dengo Obreg&#243;n National Development Plan 2006-2010 does not 
include comprehensive policies and strategies concerning the sustainable management and use of 
water resources. The priorities, goals and actions relating to the water sector are vague and 
narrowly defined, and form part of the Government strategies concerning health and 
environmental protection. The Plan includes two strategic actions regarding water, namely the 
elaboration and implementation of a national plan for the comprehensive management of water 
resources and the adoption of a new water law. The strategy for the comprehensive management 
of water resources provides for the creation of a national water authority (<i>Direcci&#243;n Nacional del 
Recurso H&#237;drico</i>) with the task of elaborating and implementing the national plan, but progress 
towards the implementation of the strategy has been limited.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The water strategy of the Government is delineated in a more detailed fashion in executive 
decree No. 30480-MINAE of June 2002, in which the guiding principles of the national water 
policy are defined. The decree acknowledges that access to water constitutes an inalienable 
human right, and states that the management and use of water resources should be based on the 
principles of equity and inter-generational solidarity. It also recognizes that the Ministry of the 
Environment, as the leading ministry in the water sector, is responsible for the definition of the 
principles, policies and strategies concerning the management and use of water resources, which 
should be implemented in an integrated, decentralized and participatory way.  
</p>
<p>26. The national programme of potable water improvement and quality sustainability of 
potable water services for the period 2007-2015 (decree No. 33953-S-MINAE of 2007), 
implemented by AyA in conjunction with other water providers, aims at improving the quality of 
potable water by protecting surface and groundwater sources, increasing the treatment and 
disinfection of water for human consumption and preventing health risks caused by 
contaminated water. In order to monitor the quality of water, the decree establishes a national 
monitoring commission on the quality of potable water, composed of representatives of the 
Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Health, AyA and the Pan American Health 
Organization. 
</p>
<p>27. The national programme for the adequate management of wastewater in Costa Rica for the 
period 2009-2015 seeks to elaborate a comprehensive strategy for the management of domestic 
wastewater by creating an inventory of the different systems of treatment for domestic 
wastewater existing in the country and monitoring their impact on surface and groundwater. The 
aim of the programme, which is implemented by AyA in conjunction with other institutions 
having competencies in the field of sanitation, is to strengthen the protection of surface and 
groundwater by reducing contamination by wastewater. It seeks to establish a mechanism to 
monitor sewage systems and other systems for the collection, management, treatment and 
disposal of domestic wastewater, and a system for the evaluation of the risk that wastewater may 
pose to public health and the environment.

</p>
<p><b>D.  Monitoring bodies 
</b></p>
<p>28. In addition to the monitoring functions carried out by the institutions that are part of the 
water sector, other institutions have responsibilities in monitoring the effective implementation 
of Costa Rican legislation on water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>29. Within the legislative branch, such control is exercised by two auxiliary bodies of the 
Legislative Assembly, which are functionally and administratively independent of the Assembly 
in the performance of their duties: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Office of the Comptroller-General (<i>Contralor&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica</i>) 
monitors the Public Treasury. All institutions working in the field of water management and 
sanitation are subject to its oversight; 
 (b) The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office (<i>Defensor&#237;a de los habitantes</i>) has the general 
responsibility of investigating, either on own initiative or at the request of a party, 
complaints concerning alleged human rights violations by public authorities through 
administrative acts or omissions in the exercise of administrative functions. The Office has acted 
upon several complaints concerning water and sanitation, including cases concerning the 
inadequate disposal of human excreta and wastewater in Jaco and the construction of a new 
aqueduct in Sardinal. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The judiciary 
</b>30. National courts also play an important role in the protection and promotion of access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>31. The Constitutional Chamber (<i>Sala Constitucional</i>) of the Supreme Court of Justice has the 
primary function of ensuring the protection of the fundamental rights embodied in the 
Constitution or in international human rights treaties to which Costa Rica is a party.<b>7</b> Since its 
creation in 1989, the Constitutional Chamber has produced an impressive body of jurisprudence, 
and has played a leading role in safeguarding human rights at the domestic level. The 
Constitutional Chamber has stated in a number of decisions that water represents a fundamental 
right, since the realization of many rights enshrined in the Constitution and international human 
rights treaties, such as the right to health, life, healthy environment, food and adequate standard

<p>of living, depends on access to safe drinking water.<b>8</b> With regard to sanitation, the Chamber 
recently held that the inundation of dwellings in periods of heavy rainfall, caused by the 
overcharge and lack of maintenance of the sewage system, and the direct discharge of 
wastewater in rivers and other streams amounted to a violation of the constitutional rights to 
health and to a safe and ecologically-balanced environment (decisions No. 11796 
of 17 August 2007 and No. 17007 of 21 November 2007). 
</p>
<p>32. The Environmental Administrative Tribunal, established in 1995 by the General Environment Law, has exclusive jurisdiction over cases concerning alleged violations of 
environmental legislation or the legislation on the protection of natural resources (including the 
General Health Law and the Water Law) caused by any act or omission of a public or private 
entity. When the Tribunal finds that a violation has occurred, it can impose fines and 
administrative sanctions for the elimination or mitigation of the damage caused. It can also take 
interim measures of protection in accordance with the principle <i>in dubio pro natura</i>, and can 
carry out on-site visits to determine the existence of environmental damage. The decisions of the 
Tribunal cannot be appealed. A great number of cases heard by the Tribunal concern pollution of 
rivers and streams caused by real estate developments, industrial or agricultural activities (such 
as pineapple production).

<p><b>III.  WATER AND SANITATION IN COSTA RICA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Demand and availability of water 
</b></p>
<p>33. The sustainable management of water resources presupposes the realization of a national 
water balance, a diagnostic model used to evaluate the actual availability of water for human 
consumption by assessing the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater available (water 
supply) and the quantity and quality of water needed in relation to different water uses (water 
demand). To date, Costa Rica has not elaborated its national water balance, which would 
constitute the first step towards the elaboration of a national plan for the comprehensive 
management of water resources (see paragraph 24 above). 
</p>
<p>34. To date, water balances have been realized with regard to 16 of the 34 water basins of the 
country,<b>9</b> taking into account the current water demand and its possible evolution in the future. 
These studies show that, in some regions, water supply is very close to the current demand and 
that a number of aquifers present problems, such as lack of adequate infrastructures or 
wastewater treatment plants; scarce water supply during certain periods of the year; conflicts 
over different water uses, especially in coastal areas; water contamination; and vulnerability to 
climate change.<b>10</b>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Water and sanitation coverage 
</b></p>
<p>35. Costa Rica has made significant progress in recent years in expanding access to 
improved sources of water. According to the National Water Laboratory,<b>11</b> 98.3 per cent of the 
population had access to water for human consumption<b>12</b> (94.3 per cent directly in their 
dwellings) in 2007, one of the highest rates in the Latin American and Caribbean region.<b>13</b> 
Approximately 99 per cent of the urban population and 96 per cent of the rural population 
are connected to a water supply (the percentage of the urban and rural population connected 
to an improved water supply in the Latin American and Caribbean region is 97 per cent 
and 73 per cent, respectively).<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>36. Recent statistical data also show important progress with regard to the supply of safe 
drinking water,<b>15</b> with the national coverage increasing from 50 per cent in 1991 to an 
estimated 82 per cent in 2007.<b>16</b> In 2007, there were 2,259 aqueducts in Costa Rica, 1,227 of 
which provided safe drinking water to more than 3.5 million people. On the other hand, 
1,032 aqueducts supplied non-potable water to almost 700,000 people, or 16.5 per cent of the 
population. 
</p>
<p>37. Costa Rica has also made important progress in the field of sanitation; an 
estimated 98 per cent of the rural and urban population have access to improved sanitation.<b>14</b> 
In 2006, in the Latin American and Caribbean region, the proportion of the urban and rural 
population with access to improved sanitation facilities was 86 per cent and 52 per cent, 
respectively.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Septic tanks remain the most common type of sanitation system, used by 67.3 per cent of 
households. In the vast majority of cases, only human excreta is disposed of in septic tanks, 
whereas other types of wastewater, such as water used for personal hygiene, cooking or washing

</b>  In the present report, &#8220;water for human consumption&#8221; denotes water used by human beings in 
</p>
<p>their daily activities, independently of its quality. Therefore, the term should not be regarded as a 
synonym of safe drinking water. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  In 2006, the average percentage of persons with access to improved water sources in the 
Latin American and Caribbean region was 92 per cent. See UNICEF, <i>Panorama del acceso al 
agua potable y al saneamiento en Am&#233;rica Latina y el Caribe</i>, 2008.

</b></p>
<p>  In the present report, the terms &#8220;safe drinking water&#8221; and &#8220;potable water&#8221; denote water that 
meets the physical, chemical and microbiological requirements indicated in the regulation 
concerning the quality of potable water, and can therefore be drunk without endangering the 
user&#8217;s health. See article 2 of the said regulation (decree No. 32327-S of 2005).

<p>clothes, are directly discharged into rivers through the storm drains without any treatment. The 
sludge removed from septic tanks is also often disposed of in rivers and streams, and thus 
constitutes an additional source of pollution. 
</p>
<p>39. Only 28.5 per cent of the population (mostly from urban areas) are connected to the 
sewage system; in most cases, the system discharges wastewater into rivers without any 
treatment. Some 8.4 per cent of the population is connected to a sewage system and to a 
wastewater treatment plant; however, only 3.5 per cent of wastewater is actually treated before 
being discharged into rivers or other waterways, since 4.9 per cent of treatment plants do not 
actually operate. Overall, 69 per cent of existing plants in the country are idle.<b>17</b> It is therefore 
not surprising that the water basin of the R&#237;o Grande de T&#225;rcoles, in the central plateau of 
Costa Rica, is the most polluted in Central America.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>40. The remaining part of the population uses latrines or cesspools (3.4 per cent) or other 
systems (0.3 per cent), while 0.5 per cent of households do not have access to any type of 
sanitation system at all. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Water and sanitation providers 
</b></p>
<p>41. In Costa Rica, drinking water and sewerage services, including sanitation treatment, are 
supplied by a number of entities: 
</p>
<p> (a) In 2007, AyA administered and directly operated 180 aqueducts providing water 
to 46.4 per cent of the national population, mostly in urban areas. Recent statistical data show the 
important progress made by AyA with regard to the supply of safe drinking water, with the 
coverage of users receiving potable water increasing from 63.6 per cent in 1989 to 97.8 per cent 
in 2007;<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p> (b) ASADAS, which are community association groups created to supply water to their 
communities, usually in rural areas, are the main water providers in the country.<b>20</b> In 2007, 
ASADAS administered 1,827 rural aqueducts, which provided water to 26.3 per cent of the

<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  D. Mora, op. cit., p. 6. According to the National Water Laboratory, the percentage of 
population supplied with potable water by AyA decreased between 2005 (98.9 per cent) 
and 2007 (97.8 per cent). 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  In accordance with decree No. 32529-MINAE, all aqueducts in the country are subject to 
control by AyA, which can delegate their management and operation to ASADAS through a 
delegation agreement. To date, only 50 per cent of ASADAS associations have concluded such 
agreements, since they greatly limit the autonomy of ASADAS in the management of rural 
aqueducts.  </p>

</p>
<p>Costa Rican population. In terms of water quality, ASADAS only supplied safe drinking water 
to 59.8 per cent of its users (51 per cent in 1999), whereas 889 rural aqueducts continued to 
provide non-potable water to more than 472,000 people (40.2 per cent of the population supplied 
by ASADAS);<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p> (c) In 2007, municipalities administered 240 aqueducts, which supplied water to 
17.1 per cent of the national population. Municipalities made important progress with regard to 
the supply of potable water, with the coverage of users receiving safe drinking water rising from 
37 per cent in 1996 to 76.3 per cent in 2007. A total of 104 municipal aqueducts continue to 
provide non-potable water to more than 180,000 people (23.7 per cent of the population supplied 
by municipalities);  
</p>
<p> (d) The Heredia Public Services Company (ESPH S.A.) is an autonomous multi-services 
public utility constituted under private law that provides water, sewer and electricity services to 
the province of Heredia. In 2007, its 12 aqueducts supplied safe drinking water to 100 per cent of 
its clients (4.6 per cent of the national population).<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>42. Sewage systems are administered by the same entities that provide water supply. In 2003, 
only AyA, the ESPH S.A. and the Municipality of Cartago administered sanitary sewers 
connected to a wastewater treatment plant.<b>23</b> The elimination of sludge from septic tanks is 
carried out by private companies (<i>tanqueros</i>) at the expense of the owner. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Water contamination 
</b></p>
<p>43. Some 1.8 per cent of the aqueducts are connected to a water treatment plant, especially in 
urban areas, while 24.7 per cent of the aqueducts, which nonetheless cover 76 per cent of the 
population, are equipped with disinfection systems. All aqueducts are subject to occasional water 
quality controls by AyA; however, only 20.7 per cent of them, which supply 73.4 per cent of the 
population, are subject to systematic water quality control. Furthermore, water quality controls 
carried out in Costa Rica are solely bacteriological, and do not include any analysis of toxic 
substances, such as hydrocarbons or pesticides, that may be present in water.<b>24</b> Studies 
concerning the sources of water contamination show that, while faecal contamination no longer 
constitutes a serious problem in Costa Rica, pollution of surface and groundwater sources caused 
by hydrocarbons and pesticides is increasing, owing to industrial and agricultural development.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  D. Mora, op. cit., p. 7. As in the case of AyA, it is interesting to note that the percentage of 
</p>
<p>population supplied with potable water by ASADAS decreased between 2005 (65.2 per cent) 
and 2008 (59.8 per cent).

<p>44. The independent expert met with representatives of the communities of Gu&#225;cimo and 
Siquirres to consider the alleged contamination of water sources caused by general use 
herbicides, such as Bromacil and Diuri&#243;n, as well as other pesticides commonly used in 
pineapple plantations. These chemicals can easily leach through the soil and contaminate 
groundwater, and their consumption at high levels over a long period of time has been associated 
to several health problems, including various forms of cancer. Because of pesticide 
contamination, approximately 6,000 people in Siquirres were long unable to drink the water 
supplied by local aqueducts, and received water supplies on a daily basis from water carrier 
trucks.<b>26</b> At the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, some communities still received daily 
supplies of potable water from water carrier trucks. 
</p>
<p>45. In May 2008, the Ministry of Health prepared two draft executive decrees to regulate the 
use of Bromacil and Diuron, establishing a maximum admissible dose of 5 micrograms per litre 
of potable water. The regulations are yet to be adopted, and some pineapple producers continue 
to use higher doses of the pesticides up to the limit of 90 micrograms per litre for Bromacil in 
drinking water established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.<b>27</b> This 
situation is a source of great concern for local communities, and generates social conflicts 
between them and pineapple producers. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Inequalities in access to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>46. Serious disparities continue to exist in some provinces and districts of Costa Rica with 
regard to access to safe drinking water. Approximately 40.2 per cent of the population living in 
rural areas still does not have access to potable water, as compared to 2.2 per cent of the 
population living in urban areas. San Jos&#233; is the province with the greatest coverage of potable 
water (90.7 per cent), followed by Heredia (88.6 per cent) and Guanacaste (79.2 per cent); 
Alajuela (69.9 per cent), Cartago (72.4 per cent) and Puntarenas (74.4 per cent) have the most 
limited coverage.<b> </b>A study on access to safe drinking water in the 81 districts of the country 
revealed an enormous degree of inequality with regard to access in 20 districts,<b>28</b> mainly owing 
to the different quality of services provided by the AyA and ESPH S.A., on the one hand, and 
ASADAS and the municipalities, on the other. Other studies indicate the existence of a direct 
relationship between poverty and limited access to potable water.<b>29 </b> 
</p>
<p>47. Significant disparities also exist in access to sanitation, particularly with regard to 
wastewater treatment. San Jos&#233; is the province with the greatest proportion of households 
connected to the sewage system (51 per cent), followed by Heredia and Cartago (15 per cent). In 
the remaining regions, coverage is below 10 per cent.

<p>48. Indigenous peoples and people belonging to other marginalized and vulnerable groups, 
including Afro-descendants and migrant workers, often have limited or no access to potable 
water and adequate sanitation. The vast majority of indigenous peoples living in the 24 reserves 
in the country do not have access to safe drinking water or sanitation services. In its report 
submitted to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/CRI/4), 
Costa Rica acknowledged that indigenous peoples&#8217; access to safe drinking water was 
constrained, mainly by their geographical and cultural circumstances, and that, in some 
indigenous territories, minimal sanitary conditions were lacking, with the resulting problems of 
diarrhoea, parasites, malnutrition and other diseases, especially among children. Both the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD/C/CRI/CO/18) and the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/CRI/CO/4) urged Costa Rica to 
take all appropriate measures to remove the obstacles that currently prevent indigenous peoples, 
Afro-descendants and migrant workers access to basic services, including safe drinking water 
and adequate sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Tourist and real estate developments 
</b></p>
<p>49. Massive tourist and real estate developments have created serious problems, such as water 
scarcity, and generated social conflicts between demand by local communities for water for 
human consumption and the economic interests of investors and real estate developers, 
especially in the northern coastal areas of the country.  
</p>
<p>50. During her visit to Manuel Antonio, in the district of Aguirre, the independent expert 
assessed the water crisis generated by tourist and real estate developments in the area, associated 
with the growing popularity of the Manuel Antonio National Park. As a result of these 
large-scale developments, existing water resources are no longer sufficient to respond adequately 
to the growing demand for water by the hotels and tourist infrastructures in the area. For more 
than a year, these establishments received water from AyA water carrier trucks.<b>30</b> Furthermore, 
the lack of wastewater treatment plants has led to the discharge of a growing quantity of human 
excreta and wastewater into river streams and, ultimately, the sea. According to AyA, however, 
faecal contamination no longer constitutes a problem in this area, as demonstrated by the 
awarding of &#8220;Blue Flag&#8221; status to all four beaches in the national park.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>51. Similar problems have been witnessed in other rapidly developing tourist areas, such as 
Playa Tamarindo, Playa Manzanillo and Golfo del Papagayo. Owing to faecal contamination, 
Tamarindo, one of the most popular beaches on the Pacific coast, lost its &#8220;Blue Flag&#8221; status in 
November 2007, while the Ministry of Health shut down 10 establishments and issued sanitary

<p>orders against 70 other activities. At the beginning of 2008, the Ministry issued a sanitary order 
against the hotel Allegro Papagayo for the direct discharge of human excreta and wastewater into 
the Golfo de Papagayo in the region of Guanacaste.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Another example of social conflicts over water between local communities and investors 
and real estate developers is that concerning the construction of a private aqueduct to supply 
water to a number of tourism and real estate projects in Playa del Coco and Playa Hermosa, 
which, according to the residents of Sardinal, would threaten the sustainable management of the 
aquifer and negatively affect the supply of water to their communities. In January 2009, the 
Constitutional Chamber upheld the position of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, which had intervened 
on behalf of the affected communities, stating that the construction of a pipeline violated the 
constitutional rights of the residents of Sardinal because there was no technical certainty that 
sufficient water would remain for local needs. The Constitutional Chamber also stated the 
residents had a constitutional right to participate in decisions involving the pipeline.  
</p>
<p>53. In April 2009, a technical commission established by the Ministry of the Environment 
pursuant to the decision of the Constitutional Chamber issued its final report on the management 
of the Sardinal aquifer. The commission concluded that the exploitation of the Sardinal aquifer to 
supply water to the El Coco-Ocotal aqueduct did not pose any long-term risk to the supply of 
water to local communities. In its report, it concluded that a maximum of 371.75 litres 
per second (lt/s) could be extracted from the aquifer, but suggested that the exploitation should 
increase gradually, starting with a maximum of 70 lt/s for the period 2009-2010. The 
commission also suggested that, for the first two years, the affected communities, the Ministry of 
the Environment, AyA, the municipality and SENARA should closely monitor the aquifer to 
ensure its sustainable use. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  GOOD PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>54. The independent expert congratulates Costa Rica for its impressive achievements in the 
field of environmental protection. According to the Environmental Performance Index 2008, 
Costa Rica is ranked fifth in the world for protection of the environment. The expert notes that 
the progress made in the protection and management of natural resources, including the creation 
of national parks and reforestation of areas previously used for agricultural purposes, also have a 
positive impact on the protection of surface and groundwater sources. 
</p>
<p>55. Costa Rica has made significant progress in increasing access to water and improved 
sanitation. The results achieved place Costa Rica among the most advanced countries in the 
Latin American and Caribbean region. Thanks to such efforts, Costa Rica will be able to achieve 
the objectives of Millennium Development Goal 7, which aims at halving, by 2015, the 
proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic 
sanitation. 
</p>
<p>56. The independent expert notes with appreciation that, according to the jurisprudence of the 
Constitutional Chamber, access to safe drinking water constitutes an inalienable human right that 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>may be enforced in national courts. She also welcomes the fact that, in accordance with national 
legislation, the use of water for human consumption prevails over any other use, especially in 
times of water scarcity. The expert further notes the important role played by the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Office in protecting and promoting access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>57. The independent expert welcomes the adoption of legislative decree No. 8559 of 
November 2006, by which the Legislative Assembly approved the loan contract between the 
Government of Costa Rica and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation for the 
realization of the project for the improvement of the environmental situation in the metropolitan 
areas of San Jos&#233;. The implementation of this project, which was started in 2007, will increase 
the percentage of the population connected to the public sewerage system and to a wastewater 
treatment plant from 3.5 per cent in 2007 to 26.8 per cent by 2015. 
</p>
<p>58. Costa Rica has made significant efforts to improve the quality of water for human 
consumption. They include the adoption of the national programme for potable water 
improvement and quality sustainability of potable water services for the period 2007-2015, and 
the creation, in 2002, of the Seal of Quality Public Health Programme, awarded by the National 
Water Laboratory as an incentive for water providers to improve the quality of water they 
supply. 
</p>
<p>59. The independent expert welcomes the steps taken by the Government to promote better 
hygiene and sanitation conditions. In this regard, she notes the success of the Blue Flag 
Ecological Programme, which provides an incentive to hoteliers, coastal associations and 
communities, schools and colleges to protect the natural resources of Costa Rica, including its 
beaches, protected natural areas and small water basins, and to promote measures aimed at 
combating the negative effects of climate change. She also welcomes the recent adoption of the 
national programme for the adequate management of wastewater in Costa Rica for the 
period 2009-2015. 
</p>
<p>60. Lastly, the independent expert notes with satisfaction the adoption of the new regulation 
creating an environmental tax for dumping polluting substances in water, thereby establishing 
the first economic instrument for the regulation of the use of water resources. The regulation, 
which is based on the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle, applies to any person or legal entity of public or 
private nature who uses water, which is a public asset, as a means to introduce, transport or 
dispose of liquid wastes liable to provoke modifications in the physical, chemical or biological 
quality of water. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p>61. The legal framework created by the 1946 Water Law for the management and use of water 
resources no longer corresponds to the social and economic situation of the country, and needs to 
be urgently revised and updated.<b>33</b> The complexity of the existing normative framework on water 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  In 1946, when the current Water Law was adopted, the population of Costa Rica was 500,000, 
</p>
<p>mainly concentrated in San Jos&#233; and other major cities in the Central Valley. The centralized 
system for the management of water resources was thus conceived to address the needs of a 
scarce, mainly urban, population. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/24/Add.1

</p>
<p>and sanitation negatively affects its application. Furthermore, the involvement of a large number 
of institutions and organizations in its application raises serious doubts about their role and 
responsibilities, the duplication of responsibilities, the lack of inter-agency coordination and, at 
times, negative or positive conflicting competencies concerning the planning and the 
development of water and sanitation policies.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>62. To date, progress in the institutional reform of the water sector under the direction 
of the Ministry of the Environment has been limited, although the adoption of decree 
No. 30480-MINAE and the elaboration of the strategy for the integrated management of water 
resources are positive steps towards the strengthening of the water sector and the creation of 
national integrated management of water resources. 
</p>
<p>63. A number of institutions have, in addition to responsibilities concerning the development 
of legislation and policies on water and sanitation, responsibilities for the actual supply of water 
and sanitation services. AyA, for example, is the main Government agency responsible for the 
development and implementation of legislation and policies concerning water supply and 
sanitation, but also the principal operator of aqueducts and sanitary sewerage system. In the 
expert&#8217;s view, this situation creates a potential conflict of interests that could lead to inefficient 
public utility management and negatively affect the quality of services provided. 
</p>
<p>64. The implementation of legislation and policies on water and sanitation is also hindered by 
a lack of sufficient human, technical and financial resources. For example, the lack of sufficient 
personnel, the limited financial resources and the lack of laboratories to analyse water samples 
prevent the Ministry of Health and AyA from systematically monitoring the quality of water for 
human consumption. The Water Department of the Ministry of the Environment can only count 
on three geologists and one hydrologist to combat illegal water connections and drilling of wells 
throughout the whole country. Personnel shortage also affects the capacity of the Constitutional 
Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Environmental Administrative Tribunal to 
provide an effective remedy in cases of violation of obligations relating to access to safe drinking 
water and sanitation.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>65. The independent expert notes with concern that Costa Rica has not elaborated a national 
water balance. To date, this has not prevented the concession of new water permits or licences 
for the drilling of new wells, a policy that is inconsistent with the precautionary principle, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>34
</b>  In this regard, the Office of the Comptroller-General noted that although decree 
</p>
<p>No. 30480-MINAE recognized the leading role of the Ministry of the Environment in the water 
sector, it failed to identify the other institutions belonging to it and their responsibilities with 
regard to water management and sanitation. See <i>Contralor&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica</i>, op. cit., 
pp. 9-12. 
<b>35
</b></p>
<p>  The seven judges in the Constitutional Chamber, with the assistance of a number of lawyers, 
decide on around 22,000 cases every year. The Environmental Administrative Tribunal, 
comprising three judges, deals with some 900 cases a year. </p>

</p>
<p>which constitutes one of the guiding principles of Government action in the field of water 
management.<b>36</b> The absence of a national water balance also fuels social conflicts over water use, 
some of which were witnessed by the independent expert during her mission. 
</p>
<p>66. The independent expert is concerned about the serious disparities still existing in some 
provinces and districts of Costa Rica with regard to access to safe drinking water, and notes that 
an estimated 18 per cent of the national population still does not have access to safe drinking 
water owing to the lack of maintenance of existing infrastructures, inefficient management and 
operation of the aqueducts, and the absence of programmes to monitor water quality. The 
independent expert notes with concern that the number of people without access to potable water 
has increased over the last four years. 
</p>
<p>67. With regard to water providers, the independent expert notes that 23.7 per cent of the 
population supplied by municipalities and 40.2 per cent of the population supplied by ASADAS 
still do not have access to potable water. She also notes that the operation and management of 
rural aqueducts rests largely with community members, who carry out these functions 
<i>ad honorem</i>, often in addition to their full-time jobs, and do not have specialized knowledge on 
water provision services. AyA, which is responsible for overseeing the management and 
operation of rural aqueducts and for the direct management and operation of rural aqueducts 
when ASADAS cannot ensure the regularity and quality of services provided, has not been able 
to exercise effective control over the management and operation of rural aqueducts. 
</p>
<p>68. The inadequate management and operation of aqueducts also affects economic efficiency. 
Non-revenue water (&#8220;water losses&#8221;) in Costa Rica is high, as most water providers operate with 
losses amounting to over 50 per cent. This figure reflects a high level of inefficiency, 
compromises continuity of service and leads to an increased need to use groundwater sources. 
</p>
<p>69. The independent expert is concerned about the existing inequity of water prices, given that 
they are fixed by different entities, and about the fact that ARESEP has not yet established any 
mechanism to facilitate economic access (affordability) to safe drinking water for poor 
households. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to indigenous peoples, the independent expert, while acknowledging the 
efforts made by Costa Rica to improve their access to safe drinking water and adequate 
sanitation, remains concerned that the majority of indigenous peoples living in traditional 
communities continue to have no access to potable water and adequate forms of sanitation. The 
expert also notes that indigenous communities have not systematically been involved, as 
provided by the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries 
(Convention No. 169) of the International Labour Organization, in the development of strategic 
plans aimed at improving their access to water and sanitation.

<p>71. The independent expert wishes to express her concern with regard to the use of Bromacil, 
Diur&#243;n and other pesticides in agricultural plantations, in particular in pineapple plantations, 
which have been associated with various forms of cancer if consumed in large amounts over a 
long period of time. 
</p>
<p>72. While recognizing that economic development constitutes both a legitimate aspiration and 
a tool to achieve a higher quality of life for all people in the country, the independent expert 
notes with concern that the current rate of tourist and real estate development of the country is 
unsustainable, and risks having long-lasting negative effects on the water resources of 
Costa Rica and on its natural environment. She also expresses her concern at the social conflict 
originated by the construction of a pipeline to supply water to a number of tourism and 
real estate projects in Playa del Coco and Playa Hermosa, which, according to the residents of 
Sardinal, would threaten the sustainable management of the aquifer and negatively affect the 
supply of water to their communities. 
</p>
<p>73. The independent expert is deeply concerned that 63 per cent of human excreta and 
domestic wastewater is discharged directly into rivers and other water streams, and that 
only 3.5 per cent of wastewater is actually treated before being discharged into the environment. 
The expert also notes that illicit connections to the sewage system or storm drains and the 
excessive use of septic tanks also contribute to the contamination of surface and groundwater 
sources. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica move as expeditiously as 
possible towards the adoption of a new water law. Such a law should rationalize the 
existing legal framework for the management and use of water resources, currently 
dispersed throughout a large number of laws and regulations, and adapt it to the present 
economic and social situation of the country. The law should also better define the roles 
and competencies of the different institutions working in the water sector, as recommended 
below. Civil society organizations with expertise in human rights, environmental protection 
and water-related issues should be involved in the design, future implementation and 
monitoring of the law.</b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The new water law should:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Expressly recognize, in the light of the jurisprudence of the Constitutional 
Chamber, and taking into account general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water of 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that access to sufficient, safe, 
acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses 
constitutes a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for the realization of other rights 
enshrined in the International Bill of Rights, especially the right to life and the right to 
health; </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/12/24/Add.1 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Recognize that water is a limited natural resource and that its management and 
use should be based on the principles of sustainable development, equity and 
inter-generational solidarity;37 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Restate that water for personal and domestic uses should be accorded the 
highest priority over other possible uses, in particular during times of water scarcity;38 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Include appropriate mechanisms to ensure that water and water 
facilities/services are accessible to all, including the most vulnerable or marginalized 
sections of the population, in law and in fact, without discrimination on any of the 
prohibited grounds;39 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Incorporate measures to improve and monitor the quality of potable water; 
 (f) Introduce appropriate instruments to prevent and monitor the contamination of 
surface and groundwater sources, such as economic instruments, charges and taxes aimed 
at creating an incentive for polluters to limit activities that are harmful to the environment; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Elaborate, in the light of principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, mechanisms to 
raise awareness among the general public about the importance of sustainable 
management and use of water, and to facilitate the effective participation of concerned 
communities in decision-making processes that may affect them. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The independent expert also recommends that the legal regime applicable to 
ASADAS be reviewed so as to strengthen their adequate management and operation. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica undertake a comprehensive 
review of its normative framework on sanitation, as envisaged in the national programme 
for the adequate management of wastewater in Costa Rica for the period 2009-2015, with 
a view to ensuring the establishment of a coherent and comprehensive system for the 
collection, management, treatment and disposal of human excreta and wastewater. Such 
legislation should expressly recognize that access to sanitation constitutes a <i>condicio sine 
qua non </i>for the effective exercise of other rights included in international human rights 
treaties to which Costa Rica is a party, including the right to an adequate standard of living 
and the right to health. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The independent expert recommends that the Government of Costa Rica clarify the 
roles and responsibilities of the various institutions working in the water sector, with a view 
to ensuring the effective implementation of the legislation and policies relating to water and 
sanitation and avoiding duplication of responsibilities</b> <b>and conflicting competencies. The

<p><b>elaboration and implementation of a national plan for the comprehensive management of 
water resources</b> <b>would be an important step towards the rationalization and simplification 
of the water sector. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica take all appropriate steps to 
ensure the effective implementation of legislation on water and sanitation, in particular the 
laws and regulations concerning access to safe drinking water and the adequate collection, 
management, treatment and disposal of human excreta and wastewater. She recommends, 
in particular, that the capacity of national and local institutions responsible for monitoring 
and ensuring compliance with the legislation on water management and sanitation be 
strengthened through, inter alia, the allocation of appropriate human, technical and 
financial resources to those institutions. The expert also calls for the allocation of sufficient 
human and financial resources to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of 
Justice and the Environmental Administrative Tribunal, in order to ensure that any person 
whose rights or freedoms are violated have access to an effective remedy, as provided by 
article 2, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>The independent expert urges Costa Rica to strengthen the implementation of its 
national legislation and policies on the collection, management, treatment and disposal of 
human excreta and wastewater in order to prevent the contamination of rivers and other 
water streams. The national programme for the adequate management of wastewater in 
Costa Rica for the period 2009-2015 and the regulation creating the environmental tax for 
dumping polluting substances represent, in the expert&#8217;s view, important steps towards the 
achievement of this goal.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica prepare a national water 
balance, as well as water balances for the different water basins of the country, in order to 
assess the present and future availability of water for human consumption. The expert 
stresses that such an evaluation constitutes a necessary precondition for the sustainable 
management and use of the country&#8217;s water resources. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The independent expert urges the Government to take all appropriate measures to 
reduce the serious disparities still existing in some provinces and districts of Costa Rica 
with regard to access to safe drinking water. Such measures should include the effective 
implementation of the national programme of potable water improvement and quality 
sustainability of potable water services for the period 2007-2015 (decree 
No. 33953-S-MINAE of 2007) and the allocation of adequate financial and technical 
resources to ensure the maintenance or improvement of existing infrastructures and more 
efficient management and operation of rural and municipal aqueducts. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica take appropriate measures to 
ensure that water is affordable for all.40 Such measures could include the integration of a 
pro-poor component in the pricing system and the provision of targeted subsidies to 
low-income users.

</p>
<p>84. <b>The independent expert urges Costa Rica to take immediate steps to develop, in close 
consultation with the communities concerned, strategic plans aimed at providing access to 
safe drinking water and adequate sanitation to indigenous peoples living in traditional 
reserves. Such plans should take into account the customs and traditions of the 
communities concerned and specifically include capacity-building measures aimed at 
ensuring the participation of community members in the development, management and 
maintenance of aqueducts and sanitation systems.</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica adopt, as a matter of priority, 
the draft executive decrees regulating the use of Bromacil and Diur&#243;n in agricultural 
production. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The independent expert recommends that Costa Rica develop and implement 
appropriate policies to ensure the sustainable development of tourist and real estate 
activities, especially in coastal areas. In order to avoid the depletion of water sources 
currently used by local communities, the concession of new water permits or licences for 
the drilling of new wells should be made conditional upon the realization of an 
environmental impact assessment to evaluate the long-term effects that the new 
development may have on the availability and quality of water resources and, more in 
general, on the natural environment. In the light of principles 10 and 17 of the Rio 
Declaration, this assessment should be carried out by an independent authority, with the 
participation of concerned individuals and communities. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>With regard to the construction of a new pipeline in Sardinal to supply water to 
tourism and real estate projects in the nearby Playa del Coco and Playa Hermosa, the 
independent expert reminds all parties involved that, according to the Costa Rican 
legislation, water for domestic consumption is accorded the highest priority over other 
possible uses, especially in situations of water scarcity (articles 140-142 of the Water Law). 
As requested by the Constitutional Chamber, the expert calls on the Government to take 
all appropriate measures to ensure the meaningful participation of affected communities in 
monitoring the implementation of the project, with a view to ensuring the sustainable 
management and use of the Sardinal aquifer.</b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>Lastly, the independent expert considers that Costa Rica should develop, in addition 
to the existing programmes on environmental protection, such as the Blue Flag Ecological 
Programme, specific educational programmes and awareness-raising initiatives for the 
public in general aimed at promoting the preservation and sustainable use of water 
resources and the adequate management and disposal of human excreta and wastewater.
