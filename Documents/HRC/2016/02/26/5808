<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations and as elaborated in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other 
applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights 
Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly, reaffirming, inter alia, the illegality of 
the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>that Israel is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de jure to Palestinian 
and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and the Syrian 
Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of High Contracting Parties to 
the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 2001, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
(including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
constitute very serious violations of the international humanitarian law and of the human rights 
of the Palestinian people therein and undermine international efforts, including the Annapolis 
Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the Palestinian State, 
aimed at invigorating the peace process and establishing a viable, contiguous, sovereign and 
independent Palestinian State by the end of 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its attachment to the implementation by both parties of their obligations under 
the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
(S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all settlement activity,</p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Expressing its grave concern </i>about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 
settlements building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of 
international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, including plans to 
expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East Jerusalem, thus threatening the 
creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the realization 
of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuing construction, contrary to international law, by 
Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future negotiations and make the 
two-State solution physically impossible to implement and which is causing the Palestinian 
people further humanitarian hardship, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the route of the wall has been traced in such a way as to include the 
great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully with the 
relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Palestinian Territories occupied since 1967 (A/HRC/10/20), and calls upon the Government of 
Israel to cooperate with all relevant Special Rapporteurs in accordance with Council resolution 
S-9/1 to allow them fully to discharge their  mandates; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Deplores </i>the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new housing units 
for Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in and around occupied 
East Jerusalem, as they undermine the peace process and the creation of a contiguous, sovereign 
and independent Palestinian State, and are in violation of international law and Israeli pledges at 
the Annapolis Peace Conference of 27 November 2007; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of international 
law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, 
the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians and the construction of 
bypass roads, which change the physical character and demographic composition of the Arab 
occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
</p>
<p>12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that Convention; settlements are a major obstacle 
to the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, 
viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli Plan settlement construction in the vicinity of the ADAM settlements in 
the occupied West Bank, which constitutes a new settlement block; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The increasing number of newly built structures amounting in 2008 to 1,257, 
including 748 permanent buildings and 509 mobile structures, which obstructs the efforts of the 
international community to advance the Middle East Peace Process; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The implications for the final status negotiations of the announcement by Israel that 
it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would be tantamount to de facto 
annexation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and the 
restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the siege imposed on the 
Occupied Gaza Strip, which have created an extremely precarious humanitarian situation for the 
civilian population as well as impaired the economic and social rights of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) The latest Israeli plan to demolish more than 88 houses in Al-Bustan neighbourhood 
at Silwan which will be resulting in displacing more than 1,500 Palestinian residents of 
East Jerusalem;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including in 
East Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and related 
activities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> the full implementation of the Access and Movement Agreement 
of 15 November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of the Rafah and Karni crossings, which 
are crucial to the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, as well as the access of 
United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory;  
</p>
<p><i> 6. Calls upon </i>Israel to take and implement serious measures, including confiscation of 
arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts of violence by 
Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian 
civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p><i> 7.</i> <i>Demands </i>that Israel implement the recommendations regarding the settlements made 
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her report to the Commission on 
Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to the occupied Palestinian territories, 
Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114); 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal obligations, as 
mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges </i>the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process in line with the 
Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the Palestinian 
State and to implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security Council in its </p>

 <p></p>
<p>resolution 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive 
political settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, including 
resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, and other 
relevant United Nations resolutions, the principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle East, 
held in Madrid on 30 October 1991, the Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements, which will 
allow two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of this question at its thirteen session of 
March 2010.
