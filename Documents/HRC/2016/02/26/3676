</p>

<p>Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World 
</p>
<p>Summit on Sustainable Development, and recognizing that human beings are at the centre 
</p>
<p>of concerns for sustainable development and that the right to development must be fulfilled 
</p>
<p>so as to equitably meet the developmental and environmental needs of present and future 
</p>
<p>generations,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the decision to organize, in June 2012, the United Nations Conference 
</p>
<p>on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, and taking note of the invitation of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly, in its resolution 64/236 of 20 December 2009, to organizations and 
</p>
<p>bodies of the United Nations to contribute to the preparatory process for the Conference, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the challenges of climate change to development and to the progress 
</p>
<p>made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular with 
</p>
<p>regard to the goals on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, on environmental 
</p>
<p>sustainability and on health<b>,  
</b></p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that, as stated in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
</p>
<p>Climate Change, the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible 
</p>
<p>cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate 
</p>
<p>international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities 
</p>
<p>and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging also</i> that, as stated in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
</p>
<p>Climate Change, responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and 
</p>
<p>economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on 
</p>
<p>the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for 
</p>
<p>the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/10/61. </footnote> the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion on the relationship between climate change and human rights, held on 15 June 
</p>
<p>2009, at the eleventh session of the Human Rights Council, and the 2010 Social Forum, 
</p>
<p>which focused on the relationship between climate change and human rights,  </p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that climate change-related impacts have a range of implications, both 
</p>
<p>direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, including, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate housing, the right to self-determination and the right to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation, and recalling that in no case may a people be deprived of its own 
</p>
<p>means of subsistence,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing</i> <i>concern</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities around the world, the effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by 
</p>
<p>those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors 
</p>
<p>such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status and disability,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution, and 
</p>
<p>that effective international cooperation to enable the full, effective and sustained 
</p>
<p>implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions and principles of the Convention is important in order to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>support national efforts for the realization of human rights implicated by climate change-
</p>
<p>related impacts,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential 
</p>
<p>to inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate 
</p>
<p>change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> that climate change poses an immediate and far-
</p>
<p>reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has adverse implications 
</p>
<p>for the full enjoyment of human rights;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights:

</p>
<p>climate change-related actions and policies, and forging stronger interface and cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the human rights and climate change communities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To invite States and other relevant stakeholders, including academic experts,

<p> (<i>c</i>) To invite the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on

<p>science, including the assessment reports and special reports of the Intergovernmental Panel 
</p>
<p>on Climate Change; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> that the seminar will build on the previous work of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council and its mechanisms, such as the Social Forum and relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures, while taking into account the outcome of the sixteenth session of the 
</p>
<p>Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
</p>
<p>Change, held in Cancun, in 2010, and any pertinent issues arising from the seventeenth

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner:

</p>
<p>report on the above-mentioned seminar, including any recommendations stemming 
</p>
<p>therefrom, for consideration of further follow-up action;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To make available to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
</p>
