<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its decision 22/117, the Human Rights Council held a high-level panel 
discussion on the question of the death penalty on 5 March 2014, at its twenty-fifth session.  
The aim of the panel discussion was (a) the exchange of views on advances, best practices 
and challenges relating to the abolition of the death penalty and to the introduction of a 
moratorium on executions and (b) the exchange of views relating to national debates on or 
processes for the abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was chaired by Baudelaire Ndong Ella<b>,</b> President of the Human 
Rights Council, and moderated by Nicolas Niemtchinow, Permanent Representative of 
France to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva. The 
Secretary-General of the United Nations sent a video message. The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights delivered an opening statement. The panellists were: 
Valentin Djenontin-Agossou, Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Legislation of Benin; 
Khadija Rouissi, Vice-President of the National Parliament of Morocco; Kirk Bloodsworth, 
Director of Advocacy, Witness to Innocence; and Asma Jahangir, Commissioner, 
International Commission against the Death Penalty, and former Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 
3. The present summary was prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 22/117, in 
which the Council requested the Office to prepare a report on the panel discussion in the 
form of a summary. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Video message of the Secretary-General  
of the United Nations  
</b></p>
<p>4. In his video message, the Secretary-General said that, in 2007, the General 
Assembly had taken a significant step towards the abolition of capital punishment when it 
had called in resolution 62/149 for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. Since the 
adoption of that landmark resolution, the trend against capital punishment had become 
stronger and was evident in every region and across all legal systems, traditions and 
religions. Around 160 countries had either abolished the death penalty or no longer 
practised it.  
</p>
<p>5. The Secretary-General emphasized that the taking of life was too irreversible for one 
human being to inflict it on another. In countries that allowed capital punishment, there 
remained too many cases of people being put to death despite legitimate questions about 
their guilt, or in hasty circumstances in which international standards regarding due process 
were not adhered to. He also argued that the death penalty was unjust and incompatible 
with fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Secretary-General called on States that had not yet done so to ratify the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the 
abolition of the death penalty. It was his sincere hope to see many ratifications, as the 
international community would mark the Protocol&#8217;s twenty-fifth anniversary at an event to 
be held in New York later in 2014.  </p>


<p><b> III. Opening statement of the United Nations High Commissioner  
for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. In her opening statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
declared that she opposed the death penalty in all circumstances, and urged those States that 
still retained that punishment to abolish it. The High Commissioner acknowledged the 
accelerating progress made towards abolition since the adoption in 1948 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which had asserted the human right to life. She noted that 
back then, 66 years previously, only 14 countries had abolished the death penalty, the 
majority of them in South America. Eighteen years later, at the time of the adoption of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1966, there had still only been 
26 abolitionist countries. In the face of such resistance, the drafters of the Covenant had 
been able to do little more than restrict the scope of the death penalty. Nevertheless, that 
had not been meant to justify the continuing use of the death penalty. In that regard, she 
referred to article 6, paragraph 6, of the Covenant, which stated: &#8220;Nothing in this article 
shall be invoked to delay or to prevent the abolition of capital punishment by any State 
Party to the present Covenant.&#8221; She also noted that the adoption of the Covenant&#8217;s Second 
Optional Protocol in 1989 had given abolition a decisive new momentum. While 
welcoming the most recent moratoriums, the High Commissioner deplored the fact that 
approximately 20 States still continued to execute people, often in direct violation of 
international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>8. The High Commissioner outlined several reasons why the death penalty should be 
abolished. First, the death penalty was not reconcilable with human rights, starting with the 
right to life. She pointed out that many countries whose people had been the victims of the 
most heinous crimes and violations had abolished the death penalty or did not use it. Those 
countries were pursuing justice but respected the right to life, a right that could not be 
negated by the thirst for vengeance. She also noted that the death penalty was cruel, 
inhumane and degrading, either per se or as applied. Furthermore, the application of the 
death penalty often violated the right to equality and non-discrimination. The decision 
whether to sentence a convict to death or to lesser punishment was often arbitrary, 
disproportionate and devoid of predictable rational criteria. In that &#8220;judicial lottery&#8221;, the 
odds were often stacked against the poor and against minorities and other common targets 
of discrimination. The second reason why the death penalty should be abolished was its 
finality. Even the most developed, well-functioning and robust legal systems, and those 
with multiple judicial safeguards, had, in many instances, put to death individuals who 
subsequently had been proved to be innocent. A third strong reason for abolishing the death 
penalty was the lack of merit of the common assertion that it had a deterrent effect. There 
was no evidence that the death penalty deterred crime any more than other forms of 
punishment.  
</p>
<p>9. The abolition of the death penalty often came into effect after a period of difficult 
national debate. To make sure that such debates were effective, transparent and fully 
reflective of the collective will, it was vitally important that the public be provided with 
balanced information and accurate statistics that covered all aspects of the discussion on 
criminality and described various effective ways, short of the death sentence, to combat it. 
With regard to arguments that abolishing the death penalty would go against the sentiments 
of the public, the High Commissioner emphasized that human progress did not stand still, 
and that popular support for the death penalty at a given moment did not imply that such 
support would persist in the future. She referred to undisputed historical precedents where 
laws, policies and practices inconsistent with human rights standards had had the support of 
a majority of the people; but had eventually been abolished or banned. She urged all States 
that still retained the death penalty to introduce a moratorium on it as a first step. She also 
emphasized that States should go beyond simply ceasing executions. They should aim for a </p>


<p>suspension of capital punishment for all who might be, or had been, sentenced to it; 
prosecutors should no longer seek the death penalty and judges should not impose it. That 
could be done, for example, through a directive from the highest judicial body. She further 
highlighted the importance of the right to seek pardon or commutation. In that regard, she 
welcomed the recent presidential decision in Myanmar to commute all death sentences to a 
lesser punishment, and recent decisions by the Supreme Court of India to commute to life 
imprisonment the death sentences of several individuals and to introduce guidelines 
safeguarding the rights of people on death row. The High Commissioner hoped that those 
initiatives would lead to the full abolition of the death penalty in those countries. She also 
urged the Human Rights Council to continue discussing and advancing the universal 
abolition of the death penalty, and engaging States and other stakeholders in a dialogue on 
the matter. Finally, she called upon the Council to consider commissioning a 
comprehensive legal study to help facilitate the emergence of an international customary 
norm prohibiting the use of the death penalty under all circumstances.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Contributions of the panellists 
</b>10. Mr. Ndong Ella introduced the high-level panel discussion. He noted that the 
Council had convened the panel recognizing the importance for States to hold debates on 
the question of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>11. In his introductory remarks as moderator of the panel, Mr. Niemtchinow said that 
the death penalty was primarily a matter of human rights and was not a punishment 
comparable with any other punishment. The death penalty was a denial of the right to life 
and, therefore, was a violation of human rights. The high-level panel discussion was 
relevant and timely, as in a few months, during its sixty-ninth session, the General 
Assembly of the United Nations would discuss a draft resolution on renewing the call for a 
moratorium on the death penalty, with the aim of its universal abolition. The adoption by 
the General Assembly every two years of a resolution on a moratorium confirmed that the 
majority of Member States supported the establishment of a universal moratorium. Global 
awareness concerning the universal abolition of the death penalty was visible in all 
continents. He noted that the Government of France had launched a global campaign to 
abolish the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>12. Mr. Djenontin-Agossou recalled that every human being had an inherent right to life 
and no one should be deprived of that right. Benin had ratified the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, as well as other relevant instruments, such as those on the 
rights of the child and against torture; and its Constitution established that the human being 
was sacred. He recalled the international context relating to the death penalty and that, since 
2007, the General Assembly had adopted a number of resolutions calling for a moratorium 
on the execution of death sentences. In November 2008, the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights had adopted a resolution in which it had recommended that 
States parties to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights uphold the moratorium. 
He noted that, in 2012, Benin had co-sponsored and supported General Assembly 
resolution 67/176 on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>13. With regard to the abolition of the death penalty in Benin, Mr. Djenontin-Agossou 
explained that in 2004, with the approval of the President of the country and with the 
support of civil society organizations, the Human Rights Unit of the Ministry of Justice, 
Human Rights and Legislation had established an advisory body to advance the abolition of 
the death penalty. The Advisory Body had investigated various issues regarding the use of 
the death penalty. Subsequently, the Government of Benin had announced at various 
international forums that it would abolish the death penalty. For instance, during the 
universal periodic review by the Human Rights Council held in 2008, Benin had committed </p>


<p>itself to continuing its efforts to completely abolish the death penalty and to considering 
ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. In August 2011, the National Assembly of Benin had voted to abolish the death 
penalty; and in July 2012, Benin had acceded to the Second Optional Protocol. In 
December 2012, the National Assembly had repealed the death penalty provisions 
contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure. Currently, the Assembly was carrying out a 
revision of the Penal Code to remove all the death penalty provisions.  
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Djenontin-Agossou also said that in July 2014 Benin would be organizing the 
first African conference on a universal moratorium on the use of the death penalty and its 
abolition. He invited States to work towards abolition, noting that the death penalty did not 
constitute an effective solution for eradicating criminality, was not compatible with the 
right to life and posed unacceptable risks of judicial error. 
</p><p>15. Ms. Khadija Rouissi said that there was growing consensus for the abolition of the 
death sentence in many States in the Middle East and North Africa. However, only five 
countries out of 19 in the region had a de facto moratorium, and the region had the highest 
level of executions per capita. In addition, a large number of death row prisoners in the 
region were facing torture and other inhuman and cruel punishment, even in countries that 
maintained de facto moratoriums on the use of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the situation in Morocco, Ms. Rouissi said that, while no execution 
had been carried out since 1993, judges continued to impose the death penalty. In 2005, the 
Equity and Reconciliation Commission had been established in Morocco in order to 
investigate past gross human rights violations. The Commission had recommended, inter 
alia, that the death penalty be abolished in Morocco. Subsequently, that recommendation 
had received the approval of the Head of State. A new Constitution, adopted in 2011, 
enshrined the right to life and gave an important place to human rights. Ms. Rouissi also 
informed the panel that a network of parliamentarians who were against the death penalty 
was putting forward legislative proposals towards abolition and would continue to work 
towards the adoption of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. That network was campaigning to support the forthcoming 
General Assembly resolution on a moratorium and to improve the conditions of death row 
prisoners. A similar network of parliamentarians had been established in Jordan. Such 
networks should be established in other parts of the region in order to advance the abolition 
of the death penalty. The death penalty was the most institutionalized attack on the right to 
life and abolition constituted a prelude to any serious penal reform.  
</p>
<p>17. Mr. Bloodsworth said that the capital punishment system of the United States of 
America was ineffective, wrong and did not work. He knew that from first-hand 
experience: he was the first person in the United States to have been exonerated from a 
capital conviction through DNA testing.<b> </b>He had spent 8 years, 10 months and 19 days in 
prison, including two years on death row, for a crime he had not committed. In 1984, he 
had been arrested for the murder of a young girl in the State of Maryland. Because of the 
shocking character of the crime, the police had been understandably eager to find the young 
girl&#8217;s killer and ease the community&#8217;s fear. When the police department had found two 
boys who had seen the suspect, the officers had drafted a composite sketch of the man they 
were looking for. Despite the fact that he did not fit any of the characteristics as described 
by the two boys, an anonymous caller had suggested his name to the police department. In a 
police line-up, he had been identified as the last man to be seen with the victim. Everybody 
in the State of Maryland had believed he was guilty. Five persons had positively identified 
him. Two juries had said they had the right man. In the end, that identification was proved 
wrong. Referring to his own experience, Mr. Bloodsworth emphasized that eyewitness 
misidentification was widely recognized as one of the leading causes of wrongful 
conviction in the United States. Since 1989, DNA evidence had been used to exonerate </p>


<p>over 300 individuals. Approximately 75 per cent of those cases had involved inaccurate or 
faulty eyewitness identification.  
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Bloodsworth discussed other faulty procedures that played a role in wrongful 
conviction, including the interview process, witness examination, the jury system and 
physical evidence in criminal cases. He described his ordeal at the Maryland State 
Penitentiary, where he had lived in a cell in which he could only take three steps from the 
back wall to the front door; and which was directly under the gas chamber where 
executions took place. Mr. Bloodsworth told of his efforts to have the death penalty 
abolished in the United States and to campaign for important reforms to the criminal justice 
system, such as the Innocence Protection Act of 2003, which included post-conviction 
DNA testing provisions and ensured the availability of federal funds to states for DNA 
testing of prisoners who claimed their innocence. In 2012 the State of Maryland had 
become the eighteenth state to repeal the death penalty in the United States. He emphasized 
that it was the message of innocence that had made that abolition possible.  
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Jahangir discussed the position with regard to the use of the death penalty in 
Asia. She informed the panel that Asia presented a challenge to the death penalty 
abolitionist movement. The vast majority of executions were carried out in Asia and 
thousands were under sentence of death there. In 2013, at least 10 countries in Asia had 
reportedly carried out executions. Because of the secrecy of the death penalty in several 
countries, the exact number of executions was difficult to obtain. A lack of transparency 
left the people in those countries without information and prevented debates around that 
important issue. She emphasized that, in many countries in the region, the death penalty 
was often imposed after a grossly unfair trial. Even when trials respected international 
standards of fairness, the risk of innocent people being executed could never be fully 
eliminated. That was especially worrying, as many criminal legal systems in retentionist 
countries in Asia were not strong enough to ensure justice and yet retained that irreversible 
punishment. She noted that crime rates might be reduced by the introduction of better 
training, human rights education, including for police officers and lawyers, measures to 
eradicate poverty and programmes to improve general educational attainment, among other 
measures. She stated that there was no convincing evidence that the death penalty deterred 
crimes more effectively than other punishments. She also expressed concern that a 
disproportionate number of individuals on death row in retentionist countries in Asia were 
from marginalized sections of society.  
</p>
<p>20. Ms. Jahangir discussed the situation of non-citizens, who were disproportionately 
affected by the use of the death penalty in the Asian region. Hundreds of migrant workers 
from supplying nations in Asia were facing the death penalty in other countries. That had 
led countries which still retained capital punishment, such as India, Indonesia, Pakistan and 
Sri Lanka, to work through diplomatic and other channels to ensure the release of their 
nationals abroad who were under sentences of death. With regard to positive developments 
in Asia, Ms. Jahangir said that some Asian countries, including Bhutan, Cambodia, Nepal, 
the Philippines and Timor-Leste, had abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Brunei 
Darussalam, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, the 
Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand had not carried out executions for several years. 
In Pakistan, the current administration continued to apply a de facto moratorium on the 
death penalty that had been in place since 2008, except for the execution of a soldier in 
</p><p>2012. She also said that some Asian countries had taken positive steps, including official 
announcements of a presidential pardon or commutation and court rulings that indicated a 
gradual reduction in the scope of capital punishment. Some States were currently studying 
the possibility of abolishing the death penalty. In October 2013, during its second universal 
periodic review, China had announced that it was reducing the application of the death 
penalty by taking a series of important measures, including reducing the number of capital 
crimes, strengthening the role of defence lawyers, ensuring that suspects in capital cases </p>


<p>were represented by a lawyer, and excluding the use of confessions extracted through 
torture. In Singapore, courts were currently provided with the discretion not to impose the 
death penalty for certain categories of offence, such as drug trafficking offences and some 
homicide offences. That had followed the adoption by the Parliament in November 2012 of 
legislative amendments abolishing the mandatory imposition of the death penalty under 
certain circumstances. Ms. Jahangir also emphasized that every country in Asia that still 
retained the death penalty would adopt its own particular path to end the practice. Leaders, 
parliaments, judges, civil society organizations, the media and academic institutions had to 
be convinced of the need for the abolition of capital punishment.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Summary of the interactive discussion 
</b>21. During the interactive discussion, representatives of the following countries and 
organizations spoke: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil (on behalf of the Portuguese-
speaking countries), China, the Council of Europe, the European Union, France, Indonesia, 
Ireland, Italy, Kuwait (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council), Mexico, Mongolia, 
Morocco, Namibia, New Zealand, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore (on 
behalf of a group of 26 countries), Slovenia, Spain, the Sudan and Switzerland (on behalf of 
44 countries). Statements by the following delegations were not delivered owing to lack of 
time: Albania, Algeria, Belarus, Chile, Cuba, Germany, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Portugal, the 
Republic of Moldova and Turkey.  
</p>
<p>22. Representatives of the following non-governmental organizations also spoke: 
Amnesty International, Harm Reduction International (on behalf of Reprieve, Human 
Rights Watch and the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty), International Federation 
of Human Rights Leagues, International Organization for the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, Penal Reform International and Verein Suedwind 
Entwicklungspolitik. 
</p>
<p>23. Delegates welcomed the convening and organization of the high-level panel 
discussion. They viewed the panel as a useful platform for discussing good practices and 
sharing experiences relating to the abolition of the death penalty and to the introduction of a 
moratorium on executions.  
</p>
<p><b> A. General remarks on the use of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>24. A large number of delegations expressed their opposition to the death penalty and 
firmly supported its universal abolition. In that regard, they welcomed the developments 
noted in the Secretary-General&#8217;s most recent report on the question of the death penalty 
(A/HRC/24/18) suggesting that the trend towards abolition was continuing. Some 
delegations stated that there was a clear trend towards its elimination. They were convinced 
that the question of the death penalty was about human rights and that justice that killed 
was not justice. They further highlighted that the strong link between the death penalty and 
human rights was acknowledged even in the constitutions of some retentionist countries, 
which stated that no person should be deprived of the right to life except in execution of a 
sentence.  
</p>
<p>25. Some States emphasized that the death penalty violated the right to life, the basis of 
all rights, and that it undermined the right to dignity inherent to all human beings. Some 
expressed concerns that the imposition of the death penalty constituted torture, as recently 
stated by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, and that it was an inhumane form of punishment, constituting a serious 
violation of human rights. It was pointed out that that was clearly the case for brutal </p>


<p>methods of execution, such as stoning and decapitation, which inflicted unbearable pain. 
More common execution techniques, such as electrocution or shooting, might well 
constitute inhuman or degrading treatment and therefore be in contravention of 
international law. It was also underlined that the margin of error in the application of the 
death penalty was too large.  
</p>
<p>26. Some delegations emphasized that the death penalty was not only morally wrong, 
but was also an ineffective deterrent. They also stated that there must not be any impunity 
for crimes, but that there was no clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of the death 
penalty in combating impunity. They observed that the death penalty had never been 
proved to be a more effective deterrent than other forms of punishment. Justice and fairness 
were never advanced by the taking of a human life. In that context, it was also observed that 
the leaders of several States which had recently abolished or introduced a moratorium on 
the death penalty had cited, among the reasons for their decision, the absence of credible 
evidence that the death penalty deterred crime. It was further emphasized that the 
application of the death penalty was irreversible and irreparable, and that a State did not 
need to take lives in order to defend itself. 
</p>
<p>27. Some delegations stated that the death penalty had no place in democratic societies,  
They stressed that building a society free from the death penalty should be at the core of all 
judicial actions, and that application of the death penalty did not repair the harm done to 
victims and their families. They also stated that the abolition of the death penalty 
contributed to the progressive strengthening of human rights around the world. Some 
delegations discussed how the abolition of the death penalty contributed to State-building 
efforts. For example, in Ireland, the moratorium on the use of the death penalty had 
remained in place until abolition in 1991, even in the face of grave threats to the State and 
the people; that refuted the claim that the death penalty was needed in the fight against 
terrorism. In Rwanda, the abolition of the death penalty had been a step forward in the 
reconciliation process. 
</p>
<p>28. A group of States, in a joint statement,1 expressed the view that the simplistic 
approach of characterizing the death penalty as a human rights issue in the context of the 
right to life of the convicted prisoner was deeply flawed and controversial. The group 
considered that the death penalty was first and foremost an issue of the criminal justice 
system and an important deterring element vis-&#224;-vis the most serious crimes. Some 
delegations stated that capital punishment was a sensitive issue since countries had different 
opinions because of varying cultural and intellectual frameworks and the absence of 
international agreement on the subject. A few retentionist States observed that the purpose 
of the use of the death penalty was not revenge, but to ensure retribution and provide justice 
to victims. Some stated that the retention of the death penalty was a prudent choice made in 
accordance with international law and the people&#8217;s demand for justice. They also 
mentioned the existence of strict controls over the application of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Implementation of international human rights standards 
and safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>29. Several delegations emphasized that States that continued to apply the death penalty 
must guarantee the protection that was set out in international instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. In that regard, some delegations highlighted the fact that article 6, paragraph 2, of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
<b> </b>See A/HRC/25/G/16 for the full text of the joint statement. </p>


<p>the Covenant required that States that continued to apply the death penalty should impose 
that sentence only for the most serious crimes.  
</p>
<p>30. Several delegations expressed concern with regard to the imposition of the death 
penalty in violation of international human rights standards. In particular, they expressed 
concern with regard to: the application of the death penalty in an arbitrary manner and in 
secrecy; the mandatory nature of the death penalty in some States; the inhuman and 
degrading detention conditions of death row prisoners; the use of unregulated substances in 
the formulae of lethal injections; public executions; the increase in the number of 
executions in certain countries; the expansion of the range of categories of crime to which 
the death penalty could apply; the use of the death penalty against children, persons with 
disabilities and other vulnerable groups; the resumption of executions after decades of a de 
facto moratorium; and withdrawal from international safeguards aimed at preventing 
miscarriages of justice. Some delegations also highlighted the need to discuss the 
difficulties and other related issues regarding executions, including social and economic 
implications of such punishment. They urged States to acknowledge the negative impact on 
children of their parents being sentenced to death or executed. 
</p>
<p>31. Several delegations expressed concern that a number of countries continued to apply 
the death penalty at an alarming rate. For instance, it was noted that, since the beginning of 
2014, 155 people, including several minors, had reportedly been executed in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. However, only 84 of those executions had been officially confirmed. It 
was also noted that the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to apply the death penalty for 
crimes, including drug-related crimes and sexual offences, that did not meet the criteria of 
&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. In Iraq, 170 people had reportedly been executed in 2013, making 
the country one of the top three executors in the world. The majority of those executions 
had reportedly been carried out under the pretext of fighting terrorism, on the basis of the 
2005 anti-terrorism law, which provided capital punishment for a multitude of unclear 
crimes.  
</p>
<p>32. Several delegations expressed concern that some retentionist States had expanded 
the categories of crime for which the death penalty might, or in some cases must, apply, and 
that several States did not restrict the use of the death penalty to the most serious crimes. In 
particular, in some countries the majority of death sentences handed down and executions 
carried out were for drug-related offences. It was also emphasized that international aid and 
United Nations assistance for drug enforcement in those countries lent legitimacy to the use 
of the death penalty for drug-related offences. It had been demonstrated that, since 2008, 
international assistance had contributed to the arrest, prosecution and subsequent sentencing 
to death of named drug suspects; the United Nations agency concerned had been called 
upon to take responsibility for its actions, but no real changes had been noticed. It was 
further noted, however, that donors had begun taking notice and had reportedly removed 
funding from drug enforcement programmes in certain cases. It was recommended that 
much needed funding be redirected to other efforts in those countries, and that donors 
freeze all financial support pending an investigation into how funding had been spent and 
until after the establishment of clear mechanisms for risk assessment and accountability. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the detention conditions of death row prisoners, it was noted that, 
whereas they were entitled to the same basic treatment as other categories of prisoners, in 
reality their detention conditions were frequently worse. They usually experienced: 
restrictions or total bans on visits from and correspondence with lawyers and family 
members; small cell size; lack of proper food; extreme temperatures; lack of ventilation; 
cells infested with insects; inactivity and inadequate time outside cells; isolation for long 
and indeterminate periods; and violence from other prisoners and prison officials. It was 
also emphasized that some or all of those conditions could contribute to the &#8220;death row 
phenomenon&#8221; that had been found to constitute inhuman and degrading punishment and </p>


<p>which resulted from spending long periods of time in restrictive conditions while awaiting 
death. Such problems remained when States had put in place a moratorium on the death 
penalty or had abolished the death penalty, unless the sentences of those convicted prior to 
abolition had been commuted. It was also emphasized that detention conditions should be 
based on individual risk assessments, sentences handed down before abolition should be 
commuted. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Abolition processes: national experiences and lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>34. Several delegations shared their national experiences and lessons learned regarding 
the abolition process. For instance, Namibia had abolished the death penalty in 1990. 
Article 6 of its Constitution provided: &#8220;The right to life shall be respected and protected. No 
executions shall take place in Namibia.&#8221; That provision was non-derogable.  
</p>
<p>35. In Ireland, a de facto moratorium had been in place from 1954 until 1990. The 
movement towards abolition had coincided in large part with the conflict in Northern 
Ireland. The death penalty had been abolished in 1990. In 2001, a proposal to amend the 
Constitution of Ireland to prohibit the death penalty had been supported by 62 per cent of 
the votes cast.  
</p>
<p>36. Rwanda had abolished the death penalty in 2008, 14 years after the 1994 genocide 
that had claimed the lives of over one million people. It had by no means been an easy task: 
the pain and desire for justice felt by the families of genocide victims and survivors were 
understandable and could not be ignored. The Rwandan people had taken the view that the 
death penalty could never serve as an instrument of justice, even in the case of the most 
heinous crimes imaginable. It was emphasized that the abolition of the death penalty had 
proved to be a significant step forward in the process of reconciliation in Rwanda.  
</p>
<p>37. In France, after heated debates, abolition had been achieved in 1981 owing to the 
political courage of a few men. Three decades later, experience in France showed that the 
abolition of the death penalty had no bearing on crime rates and abolition had become part 
of the French heritage. The key lessons of the French experience were: the abolition process 
must be preceded by awareness-raising; key political figures must have the courage and 
determination to defend their ideas; and the focus should be on fundamental collective 
political gains.  
</p>
<p>38. In 1988, Kyrgyzstan had introduced a moratorium on executions. Since its 
independence, it had opted for the gradual elimination of the death penalty. The term of the 
moratorium was extended in 2005 until full abolition by legislation. Eventually, the death 
penalty was abolished under the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic in 2006.  
</p>
<p>39. Some delegations shared with the panel their ongoing efforts towards full abolition 
of the death penalty. For instance, in Mongolia, a moratorium on the death penalty had been 
declared by the President in 2010. That had been followed by accession to the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mongolia 
was currently undertaking step-by-step measures to abolish the death penalty both in law 
and in practice by introducing amendments to existing legislation. The current draft law on 
crimes proposed life imprisonment as the harshest punishment, a penalty which was open 
for reconsideration after 20 years of imprisonment. Morocco had been a de facto 
abolitionist country and had engaged in a fruitful national dialogue on whether or not to 
maintain the death penalty in domestic legislation. Morocco had adopted a policy of 
transparency regarding the death penalty and was committed to continuing the debate on 
the issue.  
</p>
<p>40. Some retentionist countries discussed domestic processes for restricting the use of 
the death penalty. For instance, China had adopted a policy of gradual abolition of the death </p>


<p>penalty. In 2011, it had abolished the death penalty for 15 crimes; and the death penalty 
was not applied to (a) children who committed crimes below the age of 18, (b) pregnant 
women and (c) elderly people aged 75 years and above. In Indonesia, the issue of the death 
penalty had been the subject of a robust national debate among various groups. The issue 
had undergone a judicial review by the Constitutional Court in 2007. In line with article 6 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Indonesia strived to ensure that 
strong safeguards were in place.  
</p>
<p>41. Some delegations highlighted the importance of the establishment of a moratorium 
on the use of the death penalty while national debates on abolition were ongoing. A 
moratorium on executions gave the authorities the opportunity to: review death penalty 
legislation; ensure that domestic law complied with international human rights law, 
especially regarding the duty to ensure a fair trial; review claims of wrongful conviction; 
engage in an informed debate with experts and the public; and realize that the death penalty 
was not a special deterrent to crime. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Importance of public debate, awareness and exchange of information  
</b></p>
<p>42. It was noted that the majority of retentionist countries justified the use of the death 
penalty on the basis of their domestic public opinion. In that context, supporting the 
remarks of several panellists, several delegations highlighted the fact that capital 
punishment had been abolished in their countries following debates and exchanges of ideas 
that had resulted in slow changes in mentalities. It was emphasized that, in the absence of 
objective information, the public might be reluctant to accept and support abolition efforts. 
It was therefore of paramount importance that countries that still applied the death penalty 
ensured that studies and statistics regarding its use were made publicly available, so that 
public discussion and evaluation of its use could be promoted and a moratorium 
established. The public should not be deprived of objective and transparent information on 
the issue and its effects on society. 
</p>
<p>43. Some delegations emphasized the need for continued education on and public 
awareness of the importance of the abolition of the death penalty. They highlighted the fact 
that, in abolitionist countries, there was a constant need to spell out why the death penalty 
ran contrary to the right to life and to human dignity. Vigilance was required, since some 
political parties even in abolitionist States had put the restoration of the death penalty on 
their programmes. Such developments clearly marked the need for long-term action against 
the death penalty and for efforts to transmit valuable experience, training and assistance to 
third countries in carrying out public debates and swaying public opinion.  
</p>
<p>44. Some delegations said that if the history of the abolition of the death penalty in their 
countries had taught them anything, it was that the path towards abolition was long and 
hard. The death penalty was not abolished or repealed overnight. Abolition became a reality 
only as a result of increasing public awareness and constant collective efforts. In that 
regard, the importance of informed debate and the fluid exchange of ideas was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>45. Some delegations pointed out that national debates on the abolition of the death 
penalty were currently under way in their countries. For example, there were ongoing active 
debates in Indonesia on the use of the death penalty. In Sierra Leone, which had had a 
moratorium since 1998, a regional conference had been organized early in 2014 to address 
the question of the death penalty. The current constitutional review process in Sierra Leone 
also provided an opportunity to debate the issue.  
</p>
<p>46. It was emphasized that there was a need to reach out to the judiciary to make sure it 
understood the true implications of sentencing decisions, and the lack of evidence that the 
death penalty had a deterrent effect in comparison with other non-lethal punishments. </p>


<p><b> E. Regional, multilateral and intergovernmental efforts to advance 
the abolition of the death penalty  
</b></p>
<p>47. Several delegations highlighted the importance of regional and multilateral 
organizations&#8217; efforts to advance the abolition of the death penalty, and expressed their 
readiness to enhance such international cooperation towards abolition. In particular, it was 
emphasized that countries in the same region had closer historical, social and cultural ties. 
For that reason, initiatives taken at the regional and multilateral levels were more likely to 
be accepted and understood by countries in the same geographical area. Delegates provided 
examples of such regional and multilateral efforts.  
</p>
<p>48. It was recalled that the European Union held a strong and principled position against 
the death penalty. Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 
provided that no one should be condemned to the death penalty, or executed. The abolition 
of the death penalty was also a main objective of the European Union external human rights 
policy, as outlined in the European Guidelines on the Death Penalty, adopted in 1998 and 
revised in April 2013. The EU commitments for the universal abolition of the death penalty 
included: targeted campaigns on the death penalty and intensive engagement with 
retentionist countries; and active contribution, together with broad interregional groups of 
States, to the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of resolutions on a 
moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Since 2007, the European Union had also 
provided financial support to civil society organizations for actions and projects aimed at 
promoting restrictions in the use of the death penalty, and its abolition, or the establishment 
of a moratorium. The European Union had also adopted rules prohibiting trade in goods 
used to carry out executions, as well as technical assistance related to such goods.  
</p>
<p>49. It was noted that the Council of Europe had made abolition of the death penalty a 
prerequisite for membership. As a result, in the previous 16 years, no death sentences had 
been carried out in its 47 member States. Instruments adopted by the Council on the 
abolition of the death penalty included Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on 
Human Rights, which prohibited the death penalty in times of peace, and Protocol No. 13, 
which prohibited it in all circumstances. Furthermore, in 2013, a joint call for the abolition 
of the death penalty had been launched in Strasbourg, France, by 42 member States2 of the 
Council on the occasion of the World Day against the Death Penalty, in which they 
reiterated that the abolition of the death penalty in many African, American and Asian 
States exemplified the universal character of that fight. It also demonstrated the need for a 
strong political signal, as well as for the participation of the whole of society in those 
efforts. Furthermore, some delegations noted that the European Court of Human Rights had 
acted as a catalyst for that regional trend. Recently, the Court had ruled that exposure to the 
fear of execution was as much a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights as 
execution itself.  
</p>
<p>50. It was stated that the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was firmly 
convinced that the abolition of the death penalty decisively contributed to the reinforcement 
of security and the continuous development and consolidation of human rights. In 2003, the 
Council of Ministers of the Community had adopted a resolution on human rights and the 
abolition of the death penalty which expressed the commitment of the Community and its 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech 
</p>
<p>Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, 
Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine and the  
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (later joined by two more States). </p>


<p>members to deploying every effort towards the universal abolition of the death penalty and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. That commitment had been 
renewed in 2013 through the adoption of a resolution on the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the Community.  
</p>
<p>51. It was highlighted that, since the adoption of resolution 42 by the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in 1999, a number of African States had 
continued to advocate a moratorium on the death penalty through their support for the 
Commission&#8217;s Working Group on Death Penalty and Extra-Judicial, Summary or Arbitrary 
Killings in Africa and General Assembly resolution 67/176 on a moratorium on the use of 
the death penalty, and through calls for ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In that context, discussions had begun 
towards the development of an additional protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the abolition of the death penalty in Africa.  
</p>
<p><i>52. </i>The importance of the International Commission against the Death Penalty was also 
highlighted. The establishment of the Commission in 2010 had been a multilateral initiative 
led by Spain. Its cross-regional composition and the international prestige of its members 
were of great value to the campaign for worldwide abolition. In particular, members could 
speak directly to the authorities of States that were facing challenges in the abolition of the 
death penalty<i>.</i> The Commission was currently supported by 18 countries representing all 
regions of the world.  </p>
<p> <b>F. Ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. Several delegations stressed the importance of the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty, and called for its ratification. As of March 2014, the Protocol had been ratified by 
78 States. It was emphasized that increased ratification of or accession to that Protocol was 
needed to advance the universal abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion  
</b>54. <b>In their concluding remarks, the panellists emphasized that the international 
community had a responsibility to move universal abolition of the death penalty 
forward. Discussions on the death penalty should continue at both the national and 
international levels. Such discussions should include voices from all parts of society, 
including the innocent people who had suffered wrongful convictions. Experiences of 
national, regional and international abolition efforts should also be shared. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>States should intensify the campaign to sensitize all actors at every level, 
including the policy and grass-roots levels, so that more countries would support 
universal abolition. In that regard, commissioning research and studies on the 
prohibition of the use of the death penalty as a customary norm and on the human 
rights impact of the use of the death penalty could be considered. More transparent 
debates between States were also needed, in close cooperation with civil society and 
other actors, including parliamentarians. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>States that had not yet abolished the death penalty should introduce 
moratoriums on executions with the aim of abolishing them. Those States which still 
continued to implement the death penalty must ensure the protection of the human 
rights of those facing the death penalty, pursuant to the relevant international norms 
and standards.  </b></p>


<p>57. <b>Supporting the views of States, regional organizations and non-governmental 
organizations, the panellists recommended that States and all other stakeholders must 
redouble their efforts to secure an increased number of ratifications of the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming 
at the abolition of the death penalty, which was the only international instrument that 
prohibited executions and provided an essential legal framework for securing the 
worldwide abolition of the death penalty.
