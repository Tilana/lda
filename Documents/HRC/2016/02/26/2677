</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,

Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders, of 18 June 
2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council resolution 19/2 of 22 March 2012 on 
promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that it is the responsibility of each State to ensure the full enjoyment of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms of its entire population, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism 
complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human 
rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, as applicable,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the announcement made by the Government of Sri Lanka that elections 
to the Provincial Council in the Northern Province will be held in September 2013,  
</p>

 &#61482; Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming</i> <i>and</i> <i>acknowledging</i> the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka 
in rebuilding infrastructure, demining, and resettling the majority of internally displaced

reconciliation and the resumption of livelihoods, and stressing the importance of the full 
participation of local populations, including representatives of civil society and minorities, 
in these efforts,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of 
Sri Lanka and its findings and recommendations, and acknowledging its possible 
contribution to the process of national reconciliation in Sri Lanka,

the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of the Government of Sri Lanka and its

</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the national plan of action does not adequately address all of the findings

institutions, reach a political settlement on the devolution of power to the provinces, promote 
and protect the right of freedom of expression for all and enact rule of law reforms,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> <i>with concern</i> that the national plan of action and the Commission&#8217;s report do 
not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> at the continuing reports of violations of human rights in Sri 
Lanka, including enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture and violations of 
the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, as well as 
intimidation of and reprisals against human rights defenders, members of civil society and 
journalists, threats to judicial independence and the rule of law, and discrimination on the 
basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Calling upon </i>the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfil its public commitments, 
including on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the 
full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>appreciation</i> for the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka in

transitional justice; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Encourages </i>the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations 
made in the report of the Office of the High Commissioner, and also calls upon the 
Government to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of 
violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as 
applicable; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reiterates its call</i> upon the Government of Sri Lanka to implement 
effectively the constructive recommendations made in the report of the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission, and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant 
legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure 
justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Encourages </i>the Government of Sri Lanka to cooperate with special procedures
