<p><b> Communications received</b> 
</p>
<p> By letter dated 20 October 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
sent on 31 July 2006 by the Special Rapporteur with the independent expert on minority 
issues. The Government reported that the district of Fatih was a historical residential place 
with many samples of listed civil architecture. Natural disasters and lack of proper care 
threaten the cultural and historical objects in this area. Other structures in this area had 
fallen into disrepair and decline and the negative socio-economic effects of the increase in 
urbanization hindered the renewal of buildings. In the aftermath of the 1999 earthquake, 
the local authorities decided to take necessary measures for this area, which is located in an 
earthquake zone. In 2005, the entry into force of the &#8220;Law on the Protection by Renewal 
and Use through Survival of Historical and Cultural Immovable Objects which Are 
Eroded&#8221; (No. 5366) allowed municipalities to restore and reconstruct structures in the 
registered protected areas facing risk of extinction or erosion, in accordance with urban 
development; to preserve and renew historical and cultural immovable properties in such 
areas and to take appropriate measures against natural-disaster risks. In accordance with 
this law, several districts of Istanbul, including Fatih, were declared &#8220;renewal areas&#8221; by the 
Council of Ministers. Physical and socio-economic conditions of the people living in these 
areas have been taken into account and the overall objective of improving their living 
conditions has been defined, regardless of their ethnic identity. The place referred to as 
&#8220;Sulukule&#8221; comprises four blocks in Neslisah neighbourhood. The area of the project 
extends to cover 12 blocks, including Hatice Sultan neighbourhood. The boundaries of the 
renewal area have been delimited solely on the basis of the protection perimeter of the city 
wall, after an assessment of physical and social needs had been carried out. The project 
was finalized by a protocol signed on 8 June 2006 and revised on 13 July 2006 by the 
housing development administration, the municipality of Fatih and the Metropolitan 
Municipality of Istanbul. The Government reported that Law No. 5366 and its 
implementing regulations ensure public participation and consultation of local 
communities and rights-holders who live in the renewal areas, through regular meetings. 
During the renewal project for Hatice Sultan and Neslisah neighbourhoods, active 
participation and consultations with local rights-holders have been ensured. At all stages of 
the project, information has been shared with all the local rights-holders. The project was 
developed giving due consideration to the opinions expressed by rights-holders in 
consultative meetings held between June and July 2006. A new housing project has been 
also designed for the rights-holders and tenants living in Hatice Sultan and Neslisah 
neighbourhoods. Houses to be built in these areas will be primarily offered to the 
rights-holders. Tenants would also have the right to acquire social residences to be built in 
other parts of Istanbul. In July 2005, social research was carried out showing that all 
rights-holders had the title deeds and other documents necessary to prove their ownership. 
According to the result of the survey carried out over 348 plots of land, it was established 
that out of a total of 571 houses, 42 were being used for commercial purposes, and 529 for </p>

</p>
<p>residential purposes of which 303 were tenants. In November 2005, another survey of the 
buildings and their characteristics was completed. The preparation of alternative projects 
began at the end of October 2005 and it is expected to be completed in the near future. The 
prices of new houses to be built in these areas are affordable and the conditions for their 
payment are convenient. The prices of lands determined by the commission of experts for 
the purpose of deduction have been reflected on the prices of the new houses.

<p><b> Observations 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply. He hopes that continued 
dialogue will result in a resolution of the human rights situation being faced by the affected 
communities. The Special Rapporteur continues to monitor the situation with interest.
