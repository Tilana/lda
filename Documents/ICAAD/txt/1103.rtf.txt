The applicant above name filed an application for bail.

2.      
The applicant submits following grounds for bail:

State has a strong case;
b)      
Offence is serious;

The applicant has another case at the Magistrates Court for annoying a person.

4.      
I consider section 3(1) of the Bail Act and it states as follows:

"Every accused person has a right to be released on bail unless it is not in the interests of justice that bail should be granted."

5.      
Considering the nature of the offence and the submission by the Applicant and the state I am in agreement with the Applicant that he is entitled for bail under section 3 of the Bail Act.

Available materials before the court does not warrant to treat the Applicant as a flight risk or threat to the society, therefore I inclined to release the applicant on bail.
