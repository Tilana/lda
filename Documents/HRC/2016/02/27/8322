<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Commission on the Status 
of Women resolutions 38/2 of 18 March 1994 (see E/1994/27, chap. I.C) and 39/5 of 
31 March 1995 (see E/1995/26, chap. I.C), Commission on Human Rights resolution 
1997/43 of 11 April 1997 (see E/1997/23, chap. II.A) and Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/30 of 14 December 2007 (see A/63/53, chap. I.A). On the basis of those 
resolutions, a joint workplan has been prepared annually.  
</p>
<p>2. The establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), by the General Assembly has provided the 
opportunity for greater coordination among the entities of the United Nations 
system on gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment, including between UN-
Women and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
UN-Women has made progress in developing a coordination strategy which builds 
on existing United Nations mechanisms across the United Nations system. In 2011, 
the Office of the High Commissioner, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, provided inputs during the development of the 
UN-Women strategic plan 2011-2013, which was endorsed by the Executive Board 
of UN-Women in June 2011. Cooperation between UN-Women and the Office of the 
High Commissioner has intensified and plans are under way to strengthen 
collaboration within a mutually agreed broad strategic framework. The major areas 
of cooperation where activities were carried out jointly by UN-Women and the 
Office of the High Commissioner in 2011 are outlined below, as are plans for 
cooperation in 2012. Some of the activities highlighted are ongoing activities and 
others represent new initiatives. The list of joint activities is not intended to be 
exhaustive. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Review of cooperation in 2011 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b> A. Inter-agency mechanisms and initiatives 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner continued to cooperate 
within the framework of inter-agency mechanisms. Both entities participated in the 
tenth session of the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, held in 
New York from 16 to 18 February 2011. Both entities participated in the work of 
several of the task forces of the Inter-Agency Network, including its Inter-Agency 
Task Force on Violence against Women, as well as the Inter-Agency Task Force on 
Women, Peace and Security, which has been converted into a Standing Committee 
chaired by UN-Women. The Office of the High Commissioner contributed to the 
inventory of activities of the United Nations system on violence against women, 
compiled by UN-Women in February 2011, an undertaking that was among the 
activities of the Task Force on Violence against Women. Activities undertaken by 
the Standing Committee on Women, Peace and Security of the Inter-Agency 
Network on Women and Gender Equality included work on indicators and on the 
development of a strategic framework to guide the United Nations in its 
implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). The Office of the High 
Commissioner and UN-Women are also working together in the development of 
terms of reference for yet another task force of the Inter-Agency Network, one to be </p>

E/CN.6/2012/12 </b> 
 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>focused on women&#8217;s access to justice, so as to ensure system-wide coherence on the 
issue. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner participated in the 
United Nations Development Group task team on aid effectiveness. As tasked by the 
Policy Committee, UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner are 
cooperating in developing a guidance note on reparations for conflict-related sexual 
violence and in this regard, have initiated a study, whose findings will be released in 
early 2012.  
</p>
<p>4. Both entities continued to participate in the Human Rights Mechanism of the 
United Nations Development Group as well as in the United Nations Rule of Law 
Coordination and Resource Group, with a view, in particular, to ensuring that United 
Nations system guidance on country programming processes advances women&#8217;s 
human rights and gender equality. Both entities are also members of the Inter-
Agency Cooperation Group against Trafficking in Persons, chaired in 2011 by the 
Office of the High Commissioner. Both entities also participated in the work of the 
Global Migration Group, which organized a Symposium on Migration and Youth: 
Harnessing Opportunities for Development, on 17 and 18 May 2011 in New York in 
connection with the General Assembly Informal Thematic Debate on International 
Migration and Development, held on 19 May 2011. The Office of the High 
Commissioner participated in the consultation for Europe-based entities on the 
System-wide Action Plan (SWAP), a United Nations global initiative on gender 
equality and women&#8217;s empowerment, held in Geneva on 16 and 17 September 2011, 
and coordinated by UN-Women. Following the consultation, the Office of the High 
Commissioner decided to be one of the pilot testers of the draft SWAP between 
December 2011 and January 2012. Such testing will be part of the pilot review 
process, preparatory to the draft&#8217;s submission to the United Nations System Chief 
Executives Board for Coordination scheduled for April 2012.  
</p>
<p>5. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner are both active members 
of United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict and have cooperated 
in the development of the United Nations system monitoring, analysis and reporting 
arrangements. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner co-organized a 
panel discussion in May 2011 in New York on securing justice for women in post-
conflict States, which brought together a wide range of United Nations experts, 
representatives of Member States, academics and national and international 
non-governmental organizations for a richly rewarding discussion on the issue. The 
Office of the High Commissioner also participated in the evaluation of projects and 
decision-making within the context of the provision of grants by the United Nations 
Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, which is 
managed by UN-Women on behalf of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>6. In June 2011, the Office of the High Commissioner and UN-Women, along 
with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), issued a joint inter-
agency statement on preventing gender-biased sex selection. The statement 
reaffirms the commitment of United Nations organizations to encouraging and 
supporting efforts by States, international and national organizations, civil society 
and communities to uphold the rights of girls and women and to address the 
multiple manifestations of gender discrimination, including the problem of 
imbalanced sex ratios caused by sex selection. It highlights the public-health and 
human rights dimensions and implications of the problem and provides 
recommendations on how best to take effective action.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Human rights treaty bodies  
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>7. In its capacity as supporter of the work of human rights treaty bodies, the 
Office of the High Commissioner facilitates inputs from UN-Women, including 
through exchange and dissemination of information on the human rights treaty 
system. The Chair and members of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women met with the Executive Director of UN-Women in 
February 2011 to discuss issues of common concern and ways to establish an 
effective framework for future collaboration and coordination, with a view to 
increasing awareness of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women,1 and furthering progress in achieving gender 
equality and ensuring women&#8217;s rights. In this regard, both the Committee and 
UN-Women have appointed focal points to consider practical ways to further their 
cooperation.  
</p>
<p>8. UN-Women has provided technical and other support to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women in its work on elaborating a general 
recommendation on the protection of women in conflict and post-conflict situations 
and worked in collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner on 
organizing the general discussion of the Committee on the topic during the 
Committee&#8217;s forty-ninth session in July 2011. The Deputy Executive Director, 
Intergovernmental Support and Strategic Partnerships Bureau, of UN-Women, 
delivered an opening address at the general discussion.  
</p>
<p>9. The Deputy Executive Director also addressed the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women during its forty-ninth session. At the 
same session, UN-Women, in collaboration with the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS), conducted a lunchtime briefing on the gender-equality dimensions of 
HIV/AIDS, in furtherance of the joint mandate of UN-Women and UNDP, under the 
UNAIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action for Women, Girls, Gender 
Equality and HIV, to provide support to countries in reporting on how the HIV 
epidemic is affecting women and girls, and in implementing the Committee&#8217;s 
concluding observations. Further, UN-Women briefed the Committee on its 2011 
publication entitled &#8220;Progress of the world&#8217;s women 2011-2012: in pursuit of 
justice&#8221;. UN-Women regularly invites experts from the Committee to participate in 
expert group meetings and side events convened in conjunction with 
intergovernmental processes. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights special procedures 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>10. UN-Women continued its interaction with special procedures mandate holders, 
which are supported by the Office of the High Commissioner. Moreover, 
UN-Women is collaborating closely with the newly established Working Group on 
discrimination against women in law and in practice. The Executive Director of 
UN-Women held a meeting with some members of the Working Group in June 2011 
and two representatives of UN-Women participated in the second session of the 
Working Group, held in October 2011. UN-Women maintained contact and 
interaction with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and

<p>consequences, including with regard to her upcoming thematic report on &#8220;due 
diligence&#8221;. The Executive Director of UN-Women met with the Special Rapporteur 
in March 2011. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner, along with 
UNFPA, were also represented at an expert group meeting on the topic of gender-
motivated killings of women, convened by the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women in New York in October 2011. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, supported 
by the Office of the High Commissioner, held a number of exchanges of information 
with UN-Women during the period of preparation of her 2011 thematic reports to 
the Human Rights Council and General Assembly, which focused on some aspects 
of the multifaceted relationship between gender and the judiciary, within the broader 
context of the administration of justice. UN-Women continued to exchange 
information with other special procedures mandate-holders in relation to each 
other&#8217;s activities, including during country visits of special rapporteurs supported by 
the Office of the High Commissioner and its regional and country field presences, 
one such visit being that of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, to Thailand in August 2011. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation at the country level 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>12. Both UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner continued to 
participate in the activities of United Nations country teams, with the goal of 
promoting equality between women and men and the realization of women&#8217;s human 
rights, including in joint programmes on human rights and on gender equality, 
&#8220;Delivering as one&#8221; programmes, human rights and gender theme groups and a 
range of task forces and other groups established at the national level. In particular, 
UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner continued to support 
implementation of the major international human rights instruments, including 
through advocacy for legal and policy reforms and institutional support to national 
machineries for gender equality and human rights departments. 
</p>
<p>13. For example, the United Nations Gender Thematic Group in Cameroon, of 
which both entities are members, organized International Women&#8217;s Day events 
including a march in the capital and seminars at two universities, and supported 
various Government ministries in building their capacity in the area of women&#8217;s 
human rights. The two entities are also cooperating to address gender-based 
violence in Senegal and to strengthen women&#8217;s access to justice in Mali. In Senegal, 
for instance, UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner, together with 
civil society organizations, are organizing a series of activities in the context of the 
16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence campaign. In Honduras and Panama, 
UN-Women is working together with the Office of the High Commissioner on issues 
involving women of African descent and indigenous women through training and 
capacity development activities as well as in providing guidance on the preparation 
of communications to special procedures mandate-holders. UN-Women and the 
Office of the High Commissioner are also participating as members of the Global 
Migration Group (GMG) in carrying out a four-country pilot project devised to 
implement the guidance provided by the Global Migration Group publication 
entitled <i>Mainstreaming Migration into Development Planning: A Handbook for </i></p>

</b></p>
<p><i>Policy-makers and Practitioners</i>2 in Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali and the Republic of 
Moldova. 
</p>
<p>14. In Cairo in October 2011, UN-Women, the Office of the High Commissioner 
and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) co-organized 
the Forum for Young Women and Men in the Arab Uprising: Agents of Democratic 
Change. The Executive Director of UN-Women and the Chief of the Rule of Law, 
Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch of the Office of the High Commissioner 
participated in this meeting, which aimed at developing a forward-looking agenda 
for promoting women&#8217;s active participation in the transitional processes in the 
region, with a focus on the legislative, economic, social and leadership issues 
involved and on identifying priority needs in capacity-building as they affect young 
women and men as agents of change. In November 2011, UN-Women and the Office 
of the High Commissioner jointly organized a meeting in Uganda on issues of 
justice and amnesty for conflict-related crimes in order to foster more in-depth 
consultations on the forthcoming renewal of the amnesty bill with communities and, 
in particular, affected women. 
</p>
<p>15. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner provide support to 
countries in implementing their obligations under the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women through regional and country offices 
and in close coordination with the United Nations country teams. This encompasses 
a range of activities, including training and capacity-building workshops and other 
support for preparation of country reports. As examples in this regard, there have 
been workshops in Peru, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Sierra 
Leone, and consultations in Kosovo and elsewhere, aimed at strengthening 
engagement of Governments and other stakeholders in reporting on the 
implementation of the Convention. UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner have provided support to countries in preparing for the constructive 
dialogue with the Committee, including sponsorship of Government officials of 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and Zimbabwe as observers at the forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions of 
the Committee in July and October 2011, as well as support through &#8220;mock 
sessions&#8221;, in Oman, for example. UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner have also provided support in the area of follow-up to concluding 
observations, including to the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in the preparation 
of its follow-up report. There has also been training associated with the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women.3 UN-Women often organizes workshops and training sessions 
specifically on the Convention, and regularly invites members of the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to participate. Training sessions 
organized by the Office of the High Commissioner on Convention implementation 
are frequently held within training sessions with a broader focus, on treaty body 
reporting. For example, a training workshop on reporting to the human rights treaty 
bodies held in the Gambia focused, inter alia, on the drafting of the Common Core 
Document, as well as the periodic report to the Committee. UN-Women and the 
Office of the High Commissioner have also cooperated in providing support to 
countries, for example, Pakistan and Thailand, in preparing or following up on the 
universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council.

<p>16. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner support the integration 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and other human rights treaties and commitments into national 
constitutional, and legislative and policy frameworks. They support Governments, 
parliamentarians and women&#8217;s organizations in undertaking initiatives focused on 
introducing laws and policies or strengthening them so as to ensure that they are 
gender-sensitive. UN-Women supports, for example, the revision of the marriage 
law and adoption of a gender-equality law in Indonesia; the review of proposed draft 
laws from a Convention perspective in Viet Nam; the development of laws on 
gender-based violence in Guinea-Bissau and on domestic work in Paraguay, with a 
view to broadening the rights of women domestic workers; and the drafting of laws 
in the context of the Legal Commission for the Equity of Women in Colombia. 
Offices of the Office of the High Commissioner, in coordination with United 
Nations country teams, also advocate for legal reforms aimed at eliminating 
discrimination against women and guaranteeing equality in accordance with 
international human rights standards, for example, in the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia with respect to the draft law on gender equality, in Afghanistan with 
respect especially to family and personal status laws, and in Uganda and 
Timor-Leste with respect to laws on women&#8217;s access to land. UN-Women and the 
Office of the High Commissioner have also worked together in supporting the 
Human Rights Commission in Zimbabwe, for instance, by jointly organizing a 
workshop on gender equality and women&#8217;s rights for the Commission, which 
included the participation of a member of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>17. In the area of reparations, UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner are cooperating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 
piloting of a community reparations programme as a follow-up to the high-level 
panel on sexual violence in that country, which was convened by the Office of the 
High Commissioner in 2010. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner 
are also collaborating on gender-sensitive reparations programmes in other 
countries, for example, Uganda and Nepal. The Office of the High Commissioner, as 
a co-lead entity of the Team of Experts on sexual violence in conflict established 
under Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), benefited from its cooperation with 
UN-Women during the Team&#8217;s deployment to Liberia in April 2011 and South Sudan 
in June 2011. During both missions, UN-Women provided briefings and advice 
which facilitated the Team&#8217;s work on the ground. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> E. Intergovernmental bodies 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>18. Collaboration in support of intergovernmental bodies continued. The Chair of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, addressed the 
Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-fifth session in February 2011. The 
Executive Director of UN-Women addressed the Human Rights Council at its 
full-day discussion on women&#8217;s rights held in June 2011. In September 2011, the 
UN-Women Focal Point for Women in the United Nations System participated in a 
panel discussion on gender integration at the Human Rights Council. In October 
2011, the UN-Women Deputy Executive Director, Intergovernmental Support and 
Strategic Partnerships Bureau, the Chair of the Committee on the Elimination of </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2012/12
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>9 </b>11-63199 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, addressed the Third Committee of the General 
Assembly during the introduction of the agenda item on advancement of women. 
UN-Women has provided its expertise on the issue of gender-based violence in 
support of the secretariats of several commissions of inquiry lead by the Office of 
the High Commissioner. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner are 
now exploring avenues for more systematic and sustainable cooperation on behalf of 
commissions of inquiry so as to ensure dedicated gender expertise in line with the 
report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (S/2011/598). At 
the regional level, UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner, together 
with UNICEF, supported the work of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women 
and Children, through capacity-building activities, such as a study tour in January 
2011 to Geneva and Strasbourg, which provided exposure to the work of 
international and regional human rights mechanisms of the United Nations and the 
Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>19. The Office of the High Commissioner provided inputs to the report of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of and assistance to Palestinian women 
(E/CN.6/2011/6), which was submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women 
at its fifty-fifth session. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner 
continued to support the implementation of global commitments on women and 
peace and security, including those contained in Security Council resolutions 
1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010). The Office of 
the High Commissioner contributed to the above-mentioned report of the 
Secretary-General on women and peace and security which was considered by the 
Council in October 2011. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Information dissemination and development of tools 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>20. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner continued to update 
their databases and websites. As regards violence against women, the UN-Women 
website includes a Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence against Women and 
Girls (www.endvawnow.org), which provides leading expert guidance, good 
practices and tools in support of country efforts to implement policies, laws and 
programmes designed to operationalize and implement international human rights 
standards. The UN-Women website continues to include the database of the 
Secretary-General on violence against women and work of intergovernmental bodies 
on violence against women, including the Human Rights Council, and its resolutions 
on the elimination of discrimination against women, the elimination of violence 
against women, and trafficking in persons, especially women and children; the work 
of the special procedures mandate-holders; the universal periodic review; and 
reports of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Human Rights Council. In 
June 2011, UN-Women issued the &#8220;Handbook for national action plans on violence 
against women&#8221;, which resulted from an expert group meeting held in Port of Spain, 
Trinidad and Tobago, in September 2010, in which a representative of the Office of 
the High Commissioner participated. The Handbook presents a model framework

</p>
<p><b> III. Joint workplan for 2012 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>21. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will continue to 
cooperate in the promotion of gender equality and the realization of women&#8217;s human 
rights. They will continue to cooperate within the framework of inter-agency 
mechanisms, including the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality 
and the Global Migration Group, among others. UN-Women and the Office of the 
High Commissioner will continue their work on creating gender-sensitive guidance 
on reparations for conflict-related sexual violence. The Office of the High 
Commissioner and UN-Women will also continue working together to follow up on 
the recommendations of treaty bodies, mandates of special procedures and the 
universal periodic review as these relate to women&#8217;s human rights.  
</p>
<p>22. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner are also planning to 
collaborate in the creation of guidance on gender-responsive transitional justice 
mechanisms, as mandated by the Policy Committee in the context of the seven-point 
action plan to promote gender-responsive peacebuilding. Both entities will continue 
to cooperate, with a view to ensuring that United Nations system guidance on 
country programming advances women&#8217;s human rights, for example, through 
participation in the United Nations Development Group&#8217;s Human Rights 
Mechanism. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will cooperate 
and exchange information in support of the work of human rights treaty bodies and 
enhanced mainstreaming of gender perspectives into their work. UN-Women will, in 
particular, continue to support the work of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, including in relation to the elaboration of its general 
recommendation on the protection of women&#8217;s human rights in conflict and post-
conflict situations, among others. UN-Women and its partners will present a briefing 
to the Committee on the gender-equality dimensions of HIV and AIDS during its 
fifty-first session. In addition, UN-Women, together with UNDP and UNAIDS, have 
established a Task Force which will work closely with the Committee in identifying 
practical measures to be taken to strengthen their relationship, including in terms of 
follow-up and implementation of the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations related 
to the gender dimensions of HIV and AIDS.  
</p>
<p>23. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will participate in the 
United Nations country teams, joint programmes, theme groups and other forums at 
the country and regional levels, with a view to promoting equality between women 
and men and the realization of women&#8217;s human rights, and supporting 
implementation of the major international human rights instruments. UN-Women 
and the Office of the High Commissioner will continue to engage in a wide range of 
activities aimed at supporting countries in implementing their obligations under the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
including support for reporting provided, for example, to several countries in the 
South-East Asia region, whose reports are soon to be considered by the Committee.

<p>UN-Women, in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner will support 
follow-up to the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations and the implementation of 
the Convention and other human rights treaties and commitments, through the 
development and reform of constitutional, and legislative and policy frameworks. 
As mentioned above, cooperation between UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner will continue in the area of reparations for conflict-related sexual 
violence. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, the two entities 
will continue their work aimed at delivering reparations benefits to different 
communities, as a step leading towards the development of a national reparations 
programme. The two entities will ensure that truth commissions, commissions of 
inquiry and accountability mechanisms for violations of international law have the 
gender expertise necessary to fulfil their mandates through a coordinated approach. 
The Office of the High Commissioner, as a co-lead entity of the team of experts 
created pursuant to Security Council resolution 1888 (2009), will continue to 
cooperate with UN-Women in its field missions and will explore avenues for 
enhanced collaboration in the near future. Their collaboration in the field of gender 
integration will be strengthened within the framework of the System-wide Action 
Plan on gender equality and empowerment of women (SWAP) for which the Office 
of the High Commissioner has agreed to serve as a pilot during the initial phase of 
its development.  
</p>
<p>24. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will continue to pursue 
joint capacity development initiatives on improving States&#8217; responses to violence 
against women, on intersectional discrimination and on the enjoyment of social, 
economic and cultural rights, in follow-up to the universal periodic review and 
reports by thematic special procedures. In El Salvador and the Dominican Republic, 
for example, UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will advance 
regional initiatives designed to deepen the understanding of evolving forms of 
violence against women, to identify and document responses from the justice 
systems on such violence, and to design tools and methodological guides for 
investigating violence against women and combating impunity. The Office of the 
High Commissioner will continue to strengthen cooperation with UN-Women on 
joint activities designed to facilitate, implement and promote the Secretary-
General&#8217;s campaign &#8220;UNiTE to End Violence against Women&#8221;. Further, the Office 
of the High Commissioner will continue to work closely with UN-Women and the 
United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against 
Women, including on facilitating the Programme Appraisal Committee&#8217;s vision to 
strengthen reference to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Violence 
against Women and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, in the project review process.  
</p>
<p>25. In the context of the review of rule of law in peacebuilding, the Office of the 
High Commissioner will cooperate with UN-Women and other United Nations 
entities on the development of a guidance note for system-wide use on gender and 
the rule of law, a process led by UN-Women. UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner will continue and strengthen their cooperation in relation to women&#8217;s 
access to justice, including in connection with the proposed establishment of a task 
force on women&#8217;s access to justice of the Inter-agency Network on Women and 
Gender Equality, and on ensuring that a gender perspective is mainstreamed into all 
transitional justice measures supported by the United Nations. </p>

</b></p>
<p>26. Collaboration in support of intergovernmental bodies will continue. 
UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will seek input and provide 
comments for reports to be submitted to intergovernmental bodies, and exchange 
information and cooperate on follow-up to any actions taken by the Commission on 
the Status of Women or the Human Rights Council. UN-Women and the Office of 
the High Commissioner will exchange information and seek to collaborate in 
assisting the Human Rights Council in integrating gender perspectives in its work, 
including with respect to the universal periodic review process and the work of the 
special procedures; and, more generally, UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner will continue to support the Chair of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, in respect of participation in 
the sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women. UN-Women, in 
coordination with the Office of the High Commissioner, will also aim to facilitate 
the participation of the Working Group on discrimination against women in law and 
in practice in the sessions of the Commission. UN-Women will continue its 
interaction and collaboration with the special procedures mandate-holders, including 
the Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice, the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences. UN-Women 
will continue its support in connection with the preparation of the 2013 thematic 
report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women on States&#8217; responsibility 
regarding due diligence in relation to violence against women. UN-Women looks 
forward to working with the new mandate-holder, the Special Rapporteur on Truth, 
Justice and Reparation, to ensure women&#8217;s access to comprehensive justice for 
conflict-related crimes. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner will 
update and develop their databases, websites and knowledge tools in relation to 
women&#8217;s human rights. At the regional level, UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner will continue to cooperate closely, together with UNICEF and UNDP, 
on providing support to the ASEAN Commission for the Promotion and Protection 
of the Rights of Women and Children and the ASEAN Intergovernmental 
Commission on Human Rights and their secretariats.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations for new and strengthened modalities for 
cooperation between UN-Women and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>27. A joint workplan has been prepared annually on the basis of resolutions on 
mainstreaming women&#8217;s human rights (Commission on the Status of Women 
resolutions 38/2 (1994) and 39/5 (1995)) and on integrating the human rights of 
women throughout the United Nations system (Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 1997/43 (1997) and Human Rights Council resolution 6/30 (2007)). 
These resolutions emphasize the importance of coordination and cooperation in 
respect of women&#8217;s human rights, and the integration of women&#8217;s rights and a 
gender perspective throughout the work of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>28. The decision of the General Assembly, in its resolution 64/289, to establish 
UN-Women brought into being a new entity with unique mandates which span 
intergovernmental and normative support and inter-agency, policy and operational 
work and include country, regional and global programming, strategic partnership </p>

<p>and advocacy. UN-Women has made progress in developing a coordination strategy 
for strengthening leadership, coordination and accountability on gender equality and 
women&#8217;s empowerment and support to gender mainstreaming across the United 
Nations system. Women&#8217;s rights are at the centre of all efforts of UN-Women. The 
rights of women are also consistently highlighted in the thematic priorities of the 
Strategic Management Plan of the Office of the High Commissioner. UN-Women 
and the Office of the High Commissioner are firmly committed to working together 
towards the realization of women&#8217;s human rights and towards ensuring that 
commitments on gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into global 
action. UN-Women and the Office of the High Commissioner intend to deepen their 
cooperation in the future. Towards this end, UN-Women and the Office of the High 
Commissioner intend, in the coming months, to discuss different types of modalities 
that can be utilized to place this cooperation on a solid foundation, including, 
possibly, the conclusion of an exchange of letters, which may be used to exhibit all 
of the dimensions of their partnership and set clear priorities for future cooperation. 
The Commission on the Status of Women and the Human Rights Council will be 
informed of developments in this regard.
