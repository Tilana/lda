<p>The Special Rapporteur examines the general political background of the conflict 
and analyses the national legislative framework. He discusses the importance of a strict 
definition of the concept of terrorism so that it is not overly expansive in scope and notes 
with concern a number of inconsistencies between the Counter-Terrorism Act and the 
guarantee of respect for the principle of legality and the right to due process. He also 
expresses serious concern at the excessive use of force by the police (Carabineros) and the 
investigative police in the context of searches or raids in Mapuche communities and at the 
lack of accountability for such violations. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur concludes that the situation in the Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o 
regions is extremely volatile, with the frequency and gravity of the violent confrontations 
intensifying over the past three years. He urges the Government of Chile to give the matter 
the priority it deserves and makes a number of key recommendations in the framework of a 
comprehensive and integrated national strategy for addressing the Mapuche question.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 15/15, 19/19 and 22/8, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism conducted an official visit to Chile from 17 to 30 July 2013 at 
the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to gather information and engage in a dialogue on the 
content and application of the Counter-Terrorism Act (No. 18,314), and compliance with 
the rule of law and the protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>3. During the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur had productive meetings with 
the Minister of Justice; the Vice-Minister of Interior and Public Security and a 
representative of the Ministry&#8217;s human rights programme; the Director General for 
Multilateral Affairs and the Director for Human Rights of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 
as well as a regional representative of the Ministry of Social Development. He also met 
with the National Prosecutor (Attorney General) and the Chief Prosecutors responsible for 
regions VIII and IX of the country. He further met with the National Chief of the Public 
Defender&#8217;s Office and the Chiefs responsible for the regions of Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o; with 
representatives of the Legal Assistance Corporation and the National Indigenous 
Development Corporation (CONADI); and with the Director of the human rights unit of the 
Prison Service. Members of the judiciary with whom the Special Rapporteur held meetings 
included the President of the Supreme Court and the magistrate responsible for 
coordination of human rights matters, and the President of the Constitutional Court.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with various representatives of the 
Carabineros, including the Director General, the Chief of the Department for Human 
Rights, the Chief Inspector General responsible for regions VIII, IX and XIV, and the Chief 
Officers of regions VIII and IX. He further met with the National Chief of human rights 
crimes of the investigative police and with the Regional Chief of the investigative police of 
Araucan&#237;a. During a visit to the National Parliament, the Special Rapporteur met with the 
Presidents of the Committees on Human Rights, Nationality and Citizenship and on 
Constitution, Law, Justice and Regulation of the Senate; with the President of the 
Committee on Human Rights, Nationality and Citizenship of the Chamber of Deputies; and 
with individual deputies. In addition, he met with the Director and representatives of the 
National Human Rights Institution.  
</p>
<p>5. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur also met with lawyers, academics, 
representatives of the Church, including the Archbishop of Temuco, associations of victims 
of rural violence, private-sector representatives, and civil society organizations, including 
NGOs. Furthermore, he met with a significant number of representatives of different Lof 
(Mapuche communities or territorial units).  
</p><p>6. The Special Rapporteur conducted visits to three detention facilities, notably the 
Temuco City prison, the Angol prison and the El Manzano prison in Concepci&#243;n which all 
house detainees for offences connected with the Mapuche protests, both those convicted 
and those awaiting trial. He met privately with a number of Mapuche detainees.  
</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur consulted with relevant United Nations 
agencies, including the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
Caribbean. He would like to thank the United Nations system, in particular the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Regional Office for South America, 
in Santiago for providing valuable support throughout his visit.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Chile for the invitation and the 
constructive and cooperative way in which all Government representatives approached the 
visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context of the visit 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General political background 
</b></p>
<p>9. The focus of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country visit has been upon the use of 
counter-terrorism legislation in connection with protests by Mapuche activists aimed at 
reclaiming their ancestral lands and asserting their right to collective recognition as an 
indigenous people and respect for their culture and traditions. In 2003, the then Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples stated that charges for offences in other 
contexts (&#8220;terrorist threat&#8221;, &#8220;criminal association&#8221;) should not be applied to acts related to 
the social struggle for land and legitimate indigenous complaints (E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.3, 
para. 70).  
</p><p>10. Mapuche land protests have typically been characterized by land occupations, as 
well as arson and other forms of physical attack directed at agricultural, logging and 
industrial property associated with the commercial settlement of Mapuche territory. In 
recent years, however, the scale, frequency and intensity of those incidents has increased, 
partly owing to the slow rate of progress in the State&#8217;s scheme for repatriating Mapuche 
territory.  
</p>
<p>11. The present situation of indigenous peoples in Chile is the outcome of a long history 
of marginalization, discrimination and exclusion, mostly linked to various oppressive forms 
of exploitation and plundering of their land and resources that date back to the sixteenth 
century and continue to this day (E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.3, para. 8). The current problems 
facing indigenous peoples cannot be understood without reference to the history of their 
relations with Chilean society (ibid.). The Special Rapporteur went into greater detail on 
that issue in his end of visit statement.1  
</p>
<p>12. The largest indigenous group is the Mapuche people, which is concentrated in the 
south in the Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o regions and is subdivided into various indigenous 
territorial groups. A sizeable contingent of Mapuche people also lives in relative poverty in 
the metropolitan area of Santiago.  
</p>
<p>13. Through his meetings with the representatives of Mapuche communities, the Special 
Rapporteur learned that the Mapuche religion and culture is premised upon their 
relationship with their natural environment and the principle of respect for all living things. 
The occupation and commercial exploitation of their ancestral land, with the adverse 
environmental consequences that go with intensive commercial land usage, is thus viewed 
by sections of the Mapuche as an attack on their essential values and even on their very 
right to exist.  
</p>
<p>14. Since the first occupation of Mapuche territory at the end of the nineteenth century, 
the State of Chile has progressively encroached upon Mapuche ancestral lands. That 
encroachment continued largely unabated through the sale of ancestral lands to commercial 
interests, often at less than their full value. The point has now been reached at which the 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>surviving Mapuche rural communities have been driven into pockets of relatively 
unproductive land in often isolated areas of the Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o regions. Their 
communities are typically impoverished and surrounded by commercial farming, logging 
and other economic activities, which they regard as exploiting the natural resources of their 
land. It is a source of great resentment among the Mapuche that those activities are 
performed on their ancestral territory, within sight of the communities that have been 
dispossessed. The Special Rapporteur has visited some of these communities and seen for 
himself the impoverished conditions of life in which many of the rural Mapuche are forced 
to live. 
</p>
<p>15. The historical debt owed by the State of Chile to the Mapuche people is described in 
the report of the Historical Truth and New Deal Commission issued in October 2008. 
However, while that report recommended the expropriation of Mapuche land from the 
settler community (with compensation) and its repatriation to the Mapuche, the State has so 
far rejected that proposal. Instead, it has established a regional programme aimed at 
repurchasing relatively small tracts of land from the settler communities, together with 
limited regional grants intended to enable Mapuche communities to make effective use of 
the land. Until 2010, the repatriation progress, which has been administered by CONADI, 
was slow, arbitrary and viewed as largely ineffective by the Mapuche. This was due in part 
to poor administration by CONADI, combined with land speculation by members of the 
settler community, which had the effect of pushing up the purchase price per hectare, and 
thereby delaying the process of repatriation.  
</p>
<p>16. Over the past two years, CONADI has instituted a number of measures aimed at 
speeding up the land repatriation process and has succeeded in stabilizing the market value 
of the land. According to information received, the total budget for CONADI has increased 
from US$ 124 million in 2010 to US$ 181 million in 2013. Regarding production 
development, in 2011, 26,300 families benefited from the Indigenous Territorial 
Development Programme of the National Institute for Agricultural Development. In 
previous years, that programme had only covered 3,000 families (CERD/C/CHL/19-21, 
paras. 200&#8211;202). However, during a meeting with the Special Rapporteur, representatives 
of CONADI acknowledged that the central budget available for that purpose was grossly 
insufficient, and that with the current budget it would take several decades before even the 
earmarked lands could be returned. That assessment has subsequently been contested by the 
Government of Chile, which has estimated the duration of process of return of earmarked 
lands at approximately six years.  
</p>
<p>17. Another issue of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur is the lack of 
constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples, despite the international obligations of 
Chile. In that respect, he notes recent reform initiatives, but observes that organizations 
representing indigenous peoples have criticized those initiatives for being designed without 
their prior consultation or participation.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur has taken due note of the various initiatives taken by the 
Government of Chile to enhance the participation and consultation of indigenous peoples 
(see CCPR/C/CHL/6, paras. 144&#8211;147). These include the establishment by CONADI of a 
unit for work on International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) 
concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries and the launch on 8 
March 2011 of the Consultation on Indigenous Institutions with the objective of addressing 
three major subject areas.2 The consultation process was subsequently suspended following 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 These subject areas include: (a) the establishment of a consultation and participation procedure, 
</p>
<p>including the rules on participation in the Environmental Impact Assessment System; (b) the draft 
 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p>requests to that effect by representatives of indigenous community leaders and a number of 
politicians. The Special Rapporteur understands that the decision to suspend the process 
was primarily based on the need to initially focus on the setting up of mechanisms and 
procedures for indigenous consultation and he is encouraged by the recent adoption of new 
regulations for such consultation (see A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/1, paras. 48&#8211;60).  
</p><p>19. Notwithstanding those developments, the Special Rapporteur concurs with the 
concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at the 
slow pace of progress towards the establishment of an effective mechanism for consultation 
with indigenous peoples and for the promotion of their participation in accordance with 
international instruments (CERD/C/CHL/CO/19-21, para. 12).  
20. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to draw attention to the absence of political 
consensus on whether Mapuche land protests can or should be stigmatized as terrorism. The 
Special Rapporteur met with elected political representatives from the Government and 
opposition with a close interest in that issue. It is clear that political opinion in Chile is 
deeply divided on the use of the anti-terrorism legislation against the Mapuche, and that 
such polarization has impeded progress towards a consistent and principled application of 
the law. One point of view is that the anti-terrorism legislation should be strengthened and 
more frequently applied and legislation has been proposed to that effect. 
</p>
<p>21. The opposing view is that anti-terrorism legislation has no role to play at all in 
connection with the Mapuche question; that Mapuche protests have not taken the form of 
recognizable terrorism; that the use of the anti-terrorism legislation in connection with 
Mapuche land protests is counterproductive to the promotion of a peaceful resolution to the 
Mapuche question; and that, at its worst, it amounts to a form of labelling aimed at 
delegitimizing the underlying cause of the Mapuche people. That view was endorsed, to 
varying degrees, by elected politicians from the Government and the opposition who are 
most closely associated with constituencies in the Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o regions, and are 
therefore closer to the problem.  
</p>
<p>22. The only point on which all were agreed is that the current application of the anti-
terrorism law is unsatisfactory and inconsistent. The Special Rapporteur did not encounter 
any interlocutor (apart from the public prosecutors) who expressed satisfaction with the 
present state of affairs. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges identified 
</b></p>
<p>23. Chile is a signatory to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy 
unanimously adopted by Member States on 8 September 2006 in General Assembly 
resolution 60/288, and most recently reaffirmed by the General Assembly in June 2012 in 
its resolution 66/282. The Strategy is a global instrument to enhance national, regional and 
international efforts to counter terrorism where all Member States have agreed to a common 
strategic approach to fight terrorism. The Strategy is not limited to sending the clear 
message that terrorism is unacceptable in all its forms and manifestation. It is also aimed at 
taking practical steps individually and collectively to prevent and combat it.3 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>constitutional amendment recognizing indigenous peoples; and (c) the establishment of an indigenous 
development agency and a council of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 Information on the Strategy is available from www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/action.html.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The first pillar of the Strategy requires all States to devote the necessary efforts to 
address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and violent extremism. The core 
philosophy underlying that pillar is that the spread of violent extremism cannot be 
effectively countered by law enforcement measures alone. Indeed, the collective experience 
of the Member States is that excessive and discriminatory law enforcement aggravates the 
threat of violent extremism and is counterproductive. In accordance with the first pillar, 
States must address not only the manifestations of social and political violence, but also its 
root causes. All Member States of the United Nations, including Chile, have reached a 
consensus to the effect that the conditions conducive to the spread of politically motivated 
violence and extremism include long-running regional disputes, such as land disputes, poor 
governance, violations of human rights, legal discrimination and political, economic and 
educational exclusion. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur notes that all of these factors are present in the conditions 
underlying the Mapuche land protests. Historical grievances, once recognized, must be 
effectively and promptly addressed. Where State policy raises expectations that then remain 
unfulfilled due to lack of resources and poor administration by public officials, there is an 
ever-present risk that the protests will escalate to the level of widespread public disorder. 
Political and economic exclusion of the kind still experienced by the Mapuche people is a 
recognized cause of violent extremism. The responsibility for addressing those issues rests 
squarely with the State. Since the restoration of democracy in Chile, no Government of 
either political hue has given the issue the priority it deserves. The Special Rapporteur 
underlines that the State of Chile has a duty to promote a peaceful and just solution to the 
Mapuche questions. This is a duty which the Government owes not just to the Mapuche, but 
also to the settler communities in the rural areas of Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o, to the law 
enforcement officials in those regions upon whom the State relies to keep the peace and to 
the wider community in those regions who are entitled to expect the State to discharge its 
public administration obligations effectively and without discrimination, so as to maintain 
the principles underlying representative democracy.  
</p>
<p>26. As already noted, the scale, frequency and intensity of the Mapuche protests have 
increased in recent years. There have been increasingly frequent attacks on members of the 
Carabineros who have in the past been perceived by sections of the Mapuche community to 
be partisan, and to have operated as an instrument of State repression. At least one member 
of the Carabineros has been killed and many more have been the victims of potentially fatal 
attacks. Particularly disturbing was the death, in January 2013, of the couple Werner 
Luchsinger and Vivian Mackay during an arson attack on their farm. The attack followed a 
series of previous non-fatal attacks on property belonging to members of their extended 
family, which has been engaged in large-scale commercial farming in the region for many 
years.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur notes that the settler community is also deeply dissatisfied 
with the political strategy that has so far been pursued by the State of Chile in its efforts to 
resolve the Mapuche question. During meetings with organizations representing victims of 
rural violence, small landowners complained forcefully that insufficient compensation had 
been set aside to enable them to resettle elsewhere in Chile under conditions comparable to 
those under which they had previously lived and worked. Others, including representatives 
of commercial interests in the region, complained that the lack of political will within 
central Government to seek and deliver a lasting solution to the problem left their 
communities and their enterprises unprotected. During the entirety of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, none of the stakeholders in the Araucan&#237;a and Biob&#237;o regions expressed 
satisfaction with the efforts made by central Government to address the issue. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur assesses the situation in Araucan&#237;a and the surrounding 
areas to be volatile, and liable to spread into a full-blown regional conflict unless urgent </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>action is taken to address not only the manifestations of the violence, but also its root 
causes. All interlocutors familiar with the situation agreed that, while those perpetrating 
acts of violence are currently few in number, the degree of tacit sympathy for their actions 
is potentially much more widespread among Mapuche communities. In the opinion of the 
Special Rapporteur, the risk of escalation is very real and it is imperative that the State of 
Chile take urgent action to address the situation before it veers out of control. At the same 
time, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that indigenous persons and peoples should always 
ensure that their statements and demonstrations take a peaceful form and respect the human 
rights of others. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights and other international obligations 
</b></p>
<p>29. Chile is a State party to the core human rights treaties and it cooperates regularly 
with the international human rights treaty bodies, including through the timely submission 
of reports, endeavouring to put their recommendations into practice, and bringing domestic 
legislation into line with international instruments. It has also acted on the 
recommendations and judgements of the inter-American human rights bodies (see 
A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/1, paras. 15&#8211;17). 
</p><p>30. The political will of the Government to effectively counter terrorism is visible in the 
number of international anti-terrorism instruments to which Chile is a State party. To date, 
the Government is a State party to 14 of the 16 international anti-terrorism instruments.  
</p>
<p>31. In 2008, Chile ratified ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries, so that in compliance with international standards, the 
Government has to open an indigenous participation and consultation process (see 
A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/1, para. 58).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National legislative framework  
</b></p>
<p>32. In 1993, Chile adopted the Indigenous Peoples Act (Act No. 19,253), which sets out 
the rights of the indigenous peoples, establishes their own public institutional framework 
and promotes the implementation of public policies on the restitution and protection of land 
and water, the development of production and the affirmation of their cultural and 
educational values. The Act established CONADI, which is to put the provisions of the Act 
into practice and is a decentralized public body with its own resources responsible for 
promoting, coordinating and implementing action by the State to encourage the full 
development of indigenous individuals and communities (A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/1, para. 48 
and 49). In 2012, Chile adopted Act No. 20,609, which establishes measures to combat 
discrimination (the Anti-Discrimination Act). 
</p><p>33. The general law governing the fight against terrorism in Chile, Act No. 18.3144 
(commonly known as the &#8220;Counter-Terrorism Act&#8221;), was enacted on 17 May 1984, by the 
military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, with the clear purpose of severely 
penalizing any rebellion against the regime.  
</p>
<p>34. The law has been significantly amended in 1991, 2002, 2003, 2010 and 2011. The 
2002 reform attributed investigative and persecutory competencies to the Public

</p>
<p>Prosecution Service (Ministerio P&#250;blico), following the criminal justice reform undertaken 
by Chile in 2000.  
</p>
<p>35. The 2010 revision of the law was the result of a hunger strike undertaken in July of 
that year by 34 Mapuche detainees being prosecuted for offences related to social protests 
under the Counter-Terrorism Act in order to draw public attention to the lack of guarantees 
of due process in their trials. Finally, a criminal court condemned four of the Mapuche 
accused in that case. Although the Counter-Terrorism Act was not invoked in their 
sentences, the trial included components of the aforementioned law, such as the use of 
anonymous witnesses&#8217; testimonies.  
</p>
<p>36. In October 2010, an agreement was reached between the Government and the 
Mapuche whereby the Government committed to &#8220;abandoning all lawsuits for terrorist 
crimes and reconsidering such actions under the rules of common criminal law&#8221;.5 
Nonetheless, the Government and the Public Prosecution Service has continued to 
implement the law in such cases by invoking it or using the procedural advantages it grants 
at the investigative stage.6  
</p>
<p>37. As part of the agreement, the Government also committed to continue promoting, 
through the National Congress, reforms to the Military Justice Code so that civilians are 
tried before the ordinary courts, thus avoiding a double court case, and bringing it into line 
with the principle of due process. To that end, Congress received a legislative initiative 
from the Government in October 2013 and passed a law that partially modified the Military 
Criminal Court&#8217;s jurisdiction by excluding civilians and children (Act No. 20,477).7  
</p><p>38. Alongside the Government&#8217;s commitment to dropping the cases relating to terrorist 
crimes referred to earlier, Act No. 20,4678 was published in the Official Bulletin on 8 
October 2010 and introduced amendments to the Counter-Terrorism Act (No. 18,314). 
These included repealing a statutory presumption of terrorist intent applicable in certain

and removing accused juveniles from the scope of the legislation.9 It also appears to have 
resulted in the provisional release of a significant number of accused pending trial.

second and third paragraph to article 1 clearly forbidding the application of the law to

</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Definition of a terrorist crime 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur concurs with his predecessor that domestic counter-
terrorism provisions should, in the absence of a comprehensive international definition of 
the crime of terrorism, adhere to the three-step cumulative characterization according to 
which an act, in order to be classified as terrorist, must have been:  
</p>
<p>(a) Committed against members of the general population, or segments of it, 
with the intention of causing death or serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages; 
</p>
<p>(b) Committed for the purpose of provoking a state of terror, intimidating a 
population, or compelling a Government or international organization to do or abstain from 
doing any act;  
</p>
<p>(c) Corresponding to all elements of a serious crime as defined by the law.11  
</p><p>41. That approach is also reflected in Security Council resolution 1566 (2004), which 
provides further guidance for what crimes can be defined as terrorist ones under item (c), 
by referring to existing international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.  
</p>
<p>42. In addition, any law proscribing terrorism must adhere to the principle of legality 
enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, be 
applicable to counter-terrorism alone and comply with the principle of non-discrimination 
(A/HRC/10/3/Add.2, para. 6; see also A/HRC/16/51, paras. 26&#8211;28).  
</p><p>43. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the definition of terrorism under Chilean 
legislation is very broad and depends upon proving the commission of a substantive 
criminal offence (such as arson) coupled with the necessary intent to instil fear in the 
population and thereby to influence government policy. In that regard, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, upon specific 
analysis of the amendment in relation to terrorist behaviour, concluded that &#8220;legislation of 
the likes of Law 18,314 contradict the principle of legality&#8221;.12 The Commission further 
concluded that &#8220;although the Chilean Congress has passed a new law, the legal 
amendments to date have not brought about a substantial change in the classification of 
what constitutes terrorist behaviour, which would ensure its compatibility with the principle 
of legality enshrined in&#8230; the American Convention&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the 2010 amendment does not 
define the protected legal right and maintains a reference to rights and behaviours already 
foreseen and protected by ordinary criminal law, including the crime of arson in an 
uninhabited place. He concurs with the statement of the Commission that: &#8220;by allowing 
interpretation of terrorism to include behaviour that exclusively violates property, 
ambiguities and confusion arise as to what the State deems a terrorist offence to be&#8221;.14

<p>45. It should be noted that at the time of the writing of the present report, the case of

</p>
<p>rights put forward by the Inter-American Commission, concerns equality and non-
discrimination in the application of the counter-terrorism legislation.  
</p>
<p>46. While this form of definition is not unique to Chile, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that it leaves a broad discretion to the prosecutor which can lead to 
unforeseeable and arbitrary application, and is therefore open to potential abuse. The 
Special Rapporteur took it upon himself to consider how this legislation had in fact been 
applied.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Application of the counter-terrorism legislation 
</b></p>
<p>47. Prior to his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of the commitment made in 
previous years by the Government and reported to human rights bodies not to apply the 
Counter-Terrorism Act for the prosecution of individuals in cases involving Mapuche social 
movements.16 That was noted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
peoples, who, in 2009, called on the competent authorities to meet this commitment 
(A/HRC/12/34/Add.6, para. 61). 
</p><p>48. In the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur found that the anti-terrorism 
legislation had been invoked by the local public prosecutors and by the Ministry of the 
Interior and Public Security in a total of 19 emblematic cases, involving 108 individuals. 
The statistics demonstrate that Mapuche protests account for the vast majority of 
prosecutions under the anti-terrorism legislation. The remainder relate to the placement of 
bombs or explosives in the metropolitan area of Santiago in the framework of anarchist or 
anti-system movements. In addition, official statistics from the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor indicate that, in 2010 and 2011, 48 people have been charged under the Counter-
Terrorism Act, 32 of whom are related to or belong to indigenous peoples&#8217; communities.17  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur also reviewed regional statistics and found that there have 
been a total of 843 cases in Region IX (Araucan&#237;a) in relation to the Mapuche protests 
(&#8220;Conflicto Mapuche&#8221;) for the period of 2008&#8211;2012, with the majority of cases reported in 
the districts of Collipulli (548) and Temuco (104). Of the 300 cases reported in 2012, 218 
were reported in the districts of Collipulli, 32 in Angol and 20 in Temuco. According to the 
information received, only five of the 843 cases have been formalized as terrorist offences. 
With regard to Region VIII (Biob&#237;o), there have been a total number of 113 &#8220;Mapuche-
related&#8221; cases for the period from 2004 to early 2013, of which two were formalized as 
terrorist offences. Statistics indicate a total number of seven cases in Regions X (Los 
Lagos) and XVI (Los Rios) in relation to the Mapuche protests, none of which have been 
formalized as terrorist offences. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that these statistics do not include cases 
where the anti-terrorism legislation was applied at the earlier investigation stages with the 
additional procedural advantages described below and where the formal charges were later 
changed to offences under the ordinary criminal legislation.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 The Special Rapporteur notes that the newly elected President has publicly expressed her strong 
</p>
<p>commitment to the non-application of the law to indigenous peoples for social claims. See

 Public Prosecutor, Notification No. 505/2011 of 25 August 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur also notes that where a State retains a broad and subjective 
legal definition of terrorism, it is an essential minimum safeguard against abuse that there 
should be objective criteria for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and a consensus as 
to what forms of protests can properly be characterized as acts of terrorism. The Special 
Rapporteur considers that in Chile today there are no such objective criteria, and there is no 
such consensus.  
</p>
<p>52. During a series of meetings with representatives of the offices of the national and 
regional public prosecutors and the Ministry of the Interior, the Special Rapporteur has 
sought to identify any objective criteria adopted for determining which protests satisfy the 
legal definition of terrorism and which do not. The various justifications put forward have 
been subjective and lacking in legal rigour. A comparison of the cases that have been 
charged as terrorism with those which have not bears that out. It is impossible to distinguish 
any clear and consistent dividing line between cases that have been treated as common 
criminal offences (such as arson, attempted murder and firearms offences) from those in 
which the counter-terrorism legislation has been invoked, in order to aggravate the sentence 
and provide additional procedural advantages to the prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>53. In addition to the absence of objective legal criteria, there is an absence of political 
consensus as to the question whether Mapuche land protests can or should be stigmatized as 
terrorism, as described in paragraphs 20&#8211;22 above. In such a politically polarized and 
legally unsatisfactory situation, the Special Rapporteur is duty-bound to express his 
conclusions and recommendations on the question.  
</p>
<p>54. On the one hand, there can be no doubt that the anti-terrorism law has been used 
disproportionately against persons accused of crimes in connection with the Mapuche land 
protests. Central Government and public prosecutors stressed to the Special Rapporteur that 
this did not amount to stigmatizing the Mapuche people, or to characterizing Mapuche 
political protests as a whole as amounting to a campaign of terrorism, but rather involved 
the application of legal criteria to the facts, on a case-by-case basis. However, in the 
absence of any coherent and objective criteria for the invocation of the law, and in the face 
of the most obvious inconsistencies in application, it is necessary to justify the continuing 
invocation of the anti-terrorism law in such a volatile political situation. More particularly, 
given the potential that those charges have for raising the level of tension in connection 
with the Mapuche question and for antagonizing the most active sections of the Mapuche 
community, it is necessary to consider whether the invocation of the ordinary criminal law 
provides sufficient tools to maintain law and order, and to protect and vindicate the rights 
of the victims of rural violence. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Procedural shortcomings 
</b></p>
<p>55. In cases where the Counter-Terrorism Law has been invoked, it is invariably used as 
an adjunct to a substantive criminal offence which can be prosecuted under ordinary 
criminal law. If that law is invoked, the accused is subjected to a number of significant 
procedural and substantive disadvantages. They include the use of &#8220;anonymous&#8221; or 
unidentified prosecution witnesses18 and special investigative powers, comprising telephone 
tapping and interception of correspondence, such as e-mails and other communications.19

<p>18
 Act No. 18,314, arts. 15, 16, 17 and 18 (which establish the witness as &#8220;faceless&#8221; or as a witness with 
</p>
<p>a protected identity).  
 
</p>
<p>19
 Ibid, art. 14. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>56. With regard to detention, the Special Rapporteur learned that, under ordinary 
criminal law, an individual may be detained for a period of 24 hours in police custody prior 
to his or her first appearance in court (which may be extended for up to three days). 
However, in terrorist cases, that period may be (and routinely is) extended by a judge for up 
to 10 days.20 The Special Rapporteur found that the procedure for securing such detentions 
is not adversarial and the defence rarely has an opportunity to address the judge on the 
extension.  
</p>
<p>57. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard allegations that individual Mapuche 
suspects had been tortured or otherwise ill-treated during those extended periods of 
detention, in an effort to coerce them into signing a confession. While he was not in a 
position to investigate the allegations, the Special Rapporteur notes that short periods of 
police detention are intended to prevent torture and ill-treatment of suspects during 
interrogation. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that, following police detention, a person 
charged under the anti-terrorism legislation will typically have to wait six months before his 
lawyers are served with the evidence and statements in support of the charge,21 during 
which time they are seriously hampered in the preparation of a defence. This compares to a 
period of 28 days that is typical for non-terrorist crime. 
</p>
<p>59. Since the penalty for terrorist offences is significantly longer than the penalty for the 
equivalent substantive criminal offence, the likelihood of an order for release on bail 
pending trial is correspondingly diminished. Moreover, under the Constitution, there is a 
special provision applicable to terrorist offences under which any appeal against a decision 
to order detention pending trial requires unanimity of the three judges considering the 
appeal as a precondition to an order for release. If a majority of the appeal judges favour 
pretrial release, but one disagrees, the accused will remain in custody. This has led to 
complaints on behalf of Mapuche activists that many have remained in pretrial detention for 
very long periods of time. In some cases, those same persons accused have been acquitted 
of the terrorism charges at trial. 
</p>
<p>60. During his meetings with the public prosecutors, the Special Rapporteur was 
presented with the argument that the continuing use of the anti-terrorism legislation as a 
means of investigating certain Mapuche protest crimes could be justified by reference to the 
availability of special investigative methods under that legislation, as referred to in 
paragraph 55 above. On closer analysis, however, the Special Rapporteur found those 
justifications to be unconvincing.  
</p><p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes that the power to obtain authorization for the use of 
telephone and other communication intercepts is not confined to charges under the 
terrorism legislation. The more serious substantive criminal offences (such as arson 
resulting in death) may also lead to the use of that investigative technique being authorized. 
For common crimes, the use of intercepts depends upon the gravity of the offence. It must 
be inferred that the Parliament intended that such methods, which involve intrusion into 
private communications, would be available only in connection with the investigation of the 
most serious crimes. However, a comparatively less serious crime (such as arson against 
property) will attract the use of these more invasive forms of investigation if it is labelled as 
a terrorist crime. If, therefore, investigations and prosecutions were to concentrate on the 
substantive criminal act alleged, and to charge that act as a common crime, then the balance 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15 
</b></p>
<p>envisaged by the Parliament (which confines intercepts to the most serious offences) would 
be maintained and respected. 
</p>
<p>62. The other special evidential measure associated with the anti-terrorism legislation is 
the use of anonymous witnesses. That has become a source of acute contention in the 
Mapuche context and one of the main criticisms put forward by a number of national and 
international bodies. The use of anonymous witnesses places the defence at a considerable 
disadvantage during a trial since the defence counsel is unable effectively to challenge the 
credibility of the witness. The 2010 amendments affirmed the right of the accused to direct 
&#8220;questions designed to establish their credibility or qualifications and to clarify the testified 
facts, as long as the questions do not pose a risk of revealing their identity&#8221;.22  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur was informed that this provision is strictly interpreted to 
prevent any line of questioning that would expose the vulnerabilities (whether reliability or 
bias) of the witness, thus hampering the presentation of an effective defence. According to 
the information available to the Special Rapporteur, there is no provision preventing the 
court from relying on the testimony of an anonymous witness as the sole or decisive basis 
for a conviction. Perhaps most seriously, there is no specific obligation for the prosecutor to 
investigate the credibility of an anonymous witness and to disclose the products of such an 
investigation to the accused.  
</p>
<p>64. International human rights law, in particular article 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights23 protects the right to a fair and adversarial procedure in the 
trial of all criminal offences. While the use of anonymous witnesses will not automatically 
violate that right, international law requires that departures from a full and public 
adversarial procedure should be kept to an absolute minimum; that anonymity should be 
clearly and specifically justified by the need to protect the physical safety of the witness 
against reprisals; and that the resulting unfairness to the accused must be counterbalanced 
by procedural guarantees that ensure that the fairness of the proceedings is not unjustifiably 
compromised. Such counterbalances may include a rule preventing reliance on anonymous 
testimony as the sole or decisive basis for a conviction, and a specific enhanced obligation 
of investigation and disclosure to the defence of any fact tending to undermine the 
reliability or credibility of the anonymous witness. 
</p>
<p>65. None of these safeguards appear to be in place under the anti-terrorism legislation in 
Chile. There have reportedly been cases where the use of anonymous witnesses has been 
the sole or decisive basis for a conviction; and there is no specific obligation on the 
prosecutor to investigate and disclose facts undermining the witness&#8217;s credibility (beyond 
the usual principle of objectivity). There is thus an obvious risk of procedural unfairness, 
which carries with it the spectre of miscarriages of justice.  
</p><p>66. The Supreme Court has criticized the inappropriate use of anonymous witnesses in 
one Mapuche protest case in 2011, noting that the public prosecutor in that case had 
afforded benefits in exchange for testimony which rendered the witness&#8217;s evidence 
worthless. That serious criticism of the use of anonymous witnesses in such cases was 
reiterated by senior members of the judiciary during discussions with the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>67. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that the most compelling argument against 
the continued use of anonymous witnesses in connection with Mapuche protest cases is that

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>it is not in fact justified in those cases by the stated objective of protecting the safety of the 
witness. The commander of the Carabineros in Araucan&#237;a and the public prosecutors both 
in Temuco and Concepci&#243;n confirmed during meetings with the Special Rapporteur that the 
anonymity measures used in Mapuche prosecutions under the anti-terrorism legislation are 
consistently ineffective because the community is invariably able to identify the witness 
from local knowledge. This is a stark and far-reaching concession. All those concerned with 
law enforcement in the region agree that, in the absence of a full witness protection scheme 
(under which a witness and his or her family are provided with a new identity and 
relocation measures), the present arrangements are ineffective in protecting the witness.  
</p><p>68. It thus follows that the use of anonymous witnesses in the context of prosecutions of 
Mapuche accused under the anti-terrorism legislation is not achieving the stated objective 
of providing protection to the witness and his or her family. On the other hand, it is 
continuing to pose a grave impediment to the fairness of the trials for these offences. It is 
also presenting the witness and his or her family with the misleading impression that their 
identity is unknown, when in fact the reverse is usually the case. It thus undermines the 
rights of the accused without protecting the rights of the witness, and arguably even 
exposes the witness and his or her family to greater and unnecessary risk by creating the 
false impression that their identity will remain secret. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Excessive use of force by the police 
</b></p>
<p>69. Another issue of serious concern to the Special Rapporteur is the use of excessive 
force by members of the Carabineros and the investigative police forces (Polic&#237;a de 
Investigaciones), during raids or searches of Mapuche communities and the apprehension 
of suspects, together with the almost complete absence of accountability for the crimes of 
excessive violence committed against the Mapuche during the course of those searches.  
</p>
<p>70. The issue has been highlighted by a number of international and national bodies, 
including treaty bodies, special procedures, the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights and the Chilean National Human Rights Institution. Among others, the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has expressed his concern at allegations of 
abuse and violence by police officers against members of the Mapuche people, in the 
context of police searches and other police operations (A/HRC/12/34/Add.6, para. 62). The 
issue was also recently highlighted by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, which observed that the enforcement of the Counter-Terrorism Act and the 
undue and excessive use of force against members of the Mapuche people, including 
children, women and older persons, could have negative and discriminatory impacts on 
indigenous peoples that go beyond their impacts on the individuals suspected of having 
committed an offence (CERD/C/CHL/CO/19-21, para. 14; see also CEDAW/C/CHL/CO/5-
6, paras. 20 and 21). The Special Rapporteur further notes that violent situations in which 
the rights of Mapuche children have been violated have been documented by the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights, with the issuance of a public statement 
condemning the police for its disproportionate use of force.24  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur notes that the National Human Rights Institution, often 
jointly with the Public Defender&#8217;s Office, has presented a number of calls for constitutional 
guarantees of fundamental rights. In a series of habeas corpus decisions, superior courts of 
justice, including the Supreme Court and Temuco&#8217;s Court of Appeal, have returned

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>24
 Press release of 2 August 2012.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p>findings to the effect that excessive force, including the use of firearms, was deployed by 
members of the Carabineros against unarmed Mapuche civilians.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur believes that the use of excessive force by the Carabineros 
during the course of such searches was, until recently, commonplace and even systematic.25 
He has been informed of numerous instances in which wholly disproportionate numbers of 
armed special forces have entered communities, often accompanied by helicopters and 
reinforcements, and in which non-lethal firearms have been discharged not only against 
adult males but against the elderly, women, children and even infants, causing many 
injuries. He was personally informed by the Chief of the investigative police in Araucan&#237;a 
that such operations would often take place with three times as many officers as Mapuche. 
He has seen for himself photographs and videos showing the aftermath of those incidents, 
which demonstrate beyond doubt that multiple gunshot injuries requiring hospitalization 
have been inflicted in many instances. He has also seen evidence confirming the sheer 
number of discharged cartridges in some operations which leave no room for doubt as to 
the extent of the fire power that was employed.  
</p>
<p>73. The use of excessive physical force, and in particular the unjustified use of firearms, 
amounts to a criminal offence which should be duly investigated and, if found proved, 
should be punished to the full extent of the law. Needless to say, the Mapuche communities 
are equally entitled to protection by criminal law against the use of excessive violence by 
the police. 
</p>
<p>74. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur found that the most alarming feature of the 
situation was the almost complete absence of accountability for the crimes allegedly 
committed by law enforcement officials. Taking the evidence and judicial findings as a 
whole, it appears undeniable that some members of the Carabineros have in the past 
adopted a practice of using excessive and potentially lethal force during intrusions into 
Mapuche communities.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur notes that formal responsibility for investigating and 
prosecuting these crimes rests with the Military Prosecutor.26 However, despite the fact that 
many of these incidents have been reported to the Military Prosecutor, there has so far not 
been a single prosecution for the use of excessive non-fatal force by members of the 
Carabineros during the conduct of searches of Mapuche communities. Despite repeated 
requests, the Special Rapporteur was not provided with statistics in that respect. This is 
bound to reinforce a sense in these communities that the law is being applied in a 
discriminatory manner and the Special Rapporteur is reluctantly driven to the conclusion 
that the Office of the Military Prosecutor has conspicuously failed in its duty to enforce the 
law through the investigation and prosecution of those responsible. In that connection, the 
Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the jurisdiction of military tribunals should be 
limited solely to military personnel charged exclusively with military offences.27  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
 In its &#8220;Report on Police Violence Against the Mapuche People 2009&#8211;2013&#8221; (2013), the Observatorio 
</p>
<p>Ciudadano has documented 70 cases in which both the Carabineros and the investigative police have 
used excessive force against persons belonging to the Mapuche people.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>26
 Act No. 20477 of 30 December 2010 amending the jurisdiction of military tribunals excluded 
</p>
<p>civilians and minors from military jurisdiction. However, the military justice system has maintained 
its exclusive jurisdiction as regards crimes committed by the Carabineros in accordance with article 5, 
paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Military Code. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 The Special Rapporteur notes with interest that two bills are currently being considered by the

<p>76. The Special Rapporteur visited the community of Juan Catrilaf II, which special 
forces of the Carabineros entered in October 2009 in pursuit of a single unarmed individual. 
Despite the fact that the resistance met from other members of the community was 
unarmed, the special forces discharged numerous firearms into the community that injured 
19 people, including three women and a nine-month-old baby, who were struck with plastic 
bullets. Many of the victims were hospitalized; independent records of their injuries and 
treatment are available for investigation.28  
</p>
<p>77. Despite the gravity of that incident, the Special Rapporteur was disturbed to discover 
that neither the Commander of the Carabineros in Araucan&#237;a nor the Temuco Public 
Prosecutor seemed aware of it, and neither appeared to consider that it was part of their 
responsibility to make themselves aware of it. The Special Rapporteur considers that this 
amounts to a serious institutional failure and points to two possible conclusions. Either the 
incident, grave though it was, was so commonplace in the region that it did not merit being 
brought to the attention of the head of the Carabineros and the public prosecutor, 
notwithstanding the fact that the individual whose arrest was being pursued remains to this 
day the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings; or there has been a serious and systematic 
failure of institutional communication and responsibility. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
Special Rapporteur considers that the public prosecutor is under a duty in every case to 
fully inform himself of the circumstances surrounding any search or arrest leading to 
criminal proceedings for which he is responsible.  
</p>
<p>78. However, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the only cases in which 
criminal proceedings have so far been brought against members of the Carabineros relate to 
three fatal shooting incidents in which Mapuche activists lost their lives, notably Alex 
Lemun Saavedra, Mat&#237;as Catrileo Quezada and Jaime Mendoza Coll&#237;o. The most recent of 
those cases is still proceeding through the courts, and it would not be appropriate for the 
Special Rapporteur to comment on a case while it remains under judicial consideration. 
However, in one of the other two instances, the Carabinero involved was found guilty of the 
use of excessive force resulting in the death of Mat&#237;as Catrileo Quezada. His conviction 
was upheld by the Military Court but the sentence was reduced from five years&#8217; immediate 
imprisonment to three years&#8217; deferred imprisonment, in a ruling subsequently affirmed by 
the Supreme Court. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed to discover that the officer 
remained as a serving member of the Carabineros throughout the proceedings, and even 
after the final confirmation of his conviction by the Supreme Court. He was only dismissed 
some time later as the result of administrative intervention.  
</p>
<p>79. In his preliminary end-of-visit statement,29 the Special Rapporteur welcomed a 
number of recent initiatives by the central Carabineros to bring about a significant change 
in the relationship between their officers and the Mapuche communities, including a review 
of their practices and procedures to ensure that they are in line with international human 
rights law. Such initiatives include the establishment of a specialized unit known as the 
Human Rights Department within the Carabineros, the mandate given to senior officers 
from Santiago to investigate the causes of the apparent breakdown in the relationship 
between the Carabineros and Mapuche, and a number of human rights training programmes

<p>and processes aimed at reducing conflict and building trust, in particular the comprehensive 
pilot strategy of patrols dedicated to ethnic communities (PACE). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Conditions of detention  
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur conducted visits to three detention facilities, notably the 
Temuco City prison, the Angol prison and the El Manzano prison in Concepci&#243;n, which all 
house detainees from Mapuche communities, both those convicted and those still awaiting 
trial for offences connected with the Mapuche protests in the region of Araucan&#237;a. He had 
the opportunity to discuss the challenges faced by staff and inmates and met privately with 
a number of Mapuche detainees. The Special Rapporteur is extremely grateful to the Prison 
Service for the constructive and helpful way in which they facilitated his visits to those 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>81. The Ministry of Justice informed the Special Rapporteur that special regimes are in 
place in all custodial institutions that house prisoners associated with the Mapuche conflict, 
and that their cultural rights and social customs are accommodated to the greatest extent 
possible, consistent with the maintenance of good order and discipline within the 
institutions. The Special Rapporteur was able to meet with all the prisoners in those 
institutions who were detained in connection with the land protests and to see their 
conditions of detention. He found that adaptations had been made at each institution in an 
effort to accommodate the special needs of that category of prisoner. He had lengthy 
discussions with a number of inmates, including Celestino C&#243;rdova Tr&#225;nsito who at the 
time was facing trial in connection with the incident that led to the death of the Luchsinger-
Mackay couple,30 and with the community leader Hector Llaitul Carrillanca.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that one aspect that needs to be urgently 
addressed by the Ministry of Justice is the provision of facilities for Mapuche detainees to 
serve their sentences close to the communities from which they come. At the time of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, most of those who are awaiting trial were housed in Angol 
prison, where access for their families and communities is relatively easy. However four 
convicted prisoners were housed in Concepci&#243;n, where such access is much more difficult. 
If those who are sentenced to imprisonment are to be able to reintegrate peacefully into 
their communities after they are released, then they need to be able to maintain 
relationships during their incarceration. Moreover, any sustainable long-term resolution 
needs to be capable of bringing all parties into the dialogue, including those who have been 
at the forefront of the Mapuche protests.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the cooperation extended by the 
Government of Chile. He notes that Chile has repeatedly made commitments to 
uphold human rights in the context of counter-terrorism, including by ratifying many 
international instruments related to human rights and terrorism (see para. 30 above). 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30
 The Special Rapporteur notes that Celestino C&#243;rdova Tr&#225;nsito was sentenced to 18 years&#8217; 
</p>
<p>imprisonment on 28 February 2014 for arson and murder and that the Court did not find evidence that 
a terrorist crime had been committed.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>The Special Rapporteur regards these commitments, together with the invitation 
extended to him and the subsequent dialogue, as significant steps on the way to 
fulfilling international human rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note of the progress made by the State of Chile 
towards recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples in the country, including the 
ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries, and the constitutional reform initiatives relating to 
indigenous matters. He also takes note of the development of plans and proposals in 
response to the recommendations of the former and present Special Rapporteurs on 
the rights of indigenous peoples, especially in the area of assistance policies.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that, despite the positive aspects 
introduced by Act No. 20,467 to the Counter-Terrorism Act (No. 18,314), parts of that 
legislation are still not in compliance with international human rights norms and a 
number of inconsistencies exist between the law and the guarantee of respect for the 
principle of legality and the right to due process. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
the use of anti-terrorism legislation against Mapuche land protestors is part of the 
problem, and not part of the solution. It has become counterproductive to a peaceful 
resolution of the Mapuche question and should cease.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>With regard to the numerous allegations concerning excessive use of force by 
the Carabineros and the investigative police in the context of searches or raids in 
Mapuche communities, the Special Rapporteur stresses that continuing impunity is 
not an option. A comprehensive and integrated national strategy for addressing the 
Mapuche question must include the adoption of adequate measures and machinery 
for investigating and prosecuting past crimes committed against the Mapuche 
communities. Accountability for those past violations is an essential part of any 
strategy for rebuilding trust and improving community relations.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur concludes that the situation in the Araucan&#237;a and 
Biob&#237;o regions is extremely volatile. The frequency and gravity of the violent 
confrontations in the region has been intensifying over the past three years. In the 
absence of prompt and effective action at the national level, it could very quickly 
escalate into widespread disorder and violence. There is an urgent need to give the 
matter the priority it demands. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following 
recommendations to the Government of Chile. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Chile to adopt a national 
strategy aimed at comprehensively addressing the Mapuche question within a defined 
and relatively short time frame. Such a strategy should include the Constitutional 
recognition of the right of the Mapuche to exist as an indigenous people within the 
State of Chile, together with the creation by the incoming Government of an 
adequately staffed and funded ministry for indigenous affairs.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the responsibility for devising and 
implementing the national strategy be devolved to a partnership between Government 
and a newly established national consultative commission. The commission should 
include representatives of the major political parties, the relevant interest groups (the 
Mapuche, small and larger rural landowners, commercial interests and the victims of 
rural violence), and the National Institute of Human Rights. Mapuche representation 
on the Commission must reflect the widest possible spectrum of Mapuche community </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>interests. Specialist international and regional expertise may assist the Commission to 
build a consensus on the key challenges and their possible solutions.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that this Commission be mandated to 
develop recommendations for implementation by the public authorities in the 
following areas: consultation and cooperation, the rights to land and territory, 
development of natural resources and policies on conflicts connected with claims to 
Mapuche lands, including the application of the Counter-Terrorism Act.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>As part of such an integrated national strategy, the Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government of Chile to prioritize and accelerate the process of land repatriation 
or restitution, including by allocating the necessary budgetary resources in order to 
achieve current repatriation targets within a short and defined timescale.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that all provisions establishing terrorist 
crimes in the Counter-Terrorism Act adhere strictly to the principle of legality. Any 
criminalization of terrorist activity must be formulated in explicit and precise terms 
that enable the individual to regulate his or her behaviour. In particular, the 
definitions of terrorist crimes should be confined exclusively to activities that entail or 
are directly related to the use of deadly or serious violence against civilians.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur also urges the State of Chile to ensure that no further 
arrests of Mapuche land protestors should take place in reliance on the anti-terrorism 
legislation; no further charges of Mapuche land protestors should be brought under 
the anti-terrorism legislation; that the existing charges pending against Mapuche land 
protestors who currently face prosecution under the anti-terrorism legislation should 
be reviewed, and prosecutions for common criminal law offences be substituted; and 
that a mechanism should be introduced enabling a review of the convictions and 
sentences imposed on past Mapuche land protestors under the anti-terrorism 
legislation to bring their situation into line with the change of policy recommended by 
the Special Rapporteur. Those who have been convicted in trials relying on the 
testimony of anonymous witnesses should be given the right to have their convictions 
reviewed and, where appropriate, a retrial ordered, which would take place under the 
provisions of ordinary criminal law, without recourse to anonymous testimony. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the competent authorities to investigate 
complaints of abuse and violence against indigenous peoples committed by police 
officers, to prosecute and punish those responsible for such acts and to provide 
compensation to the victims or their family members. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur calls upon the competent authorities to take the necessary measures to 
prevent such acts.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>In that respect, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the jurisdiction of 
military tribunals be limited solely to military personnel charged exclusively with 
military offences. He urges the Government of Chile to create a new civilian 
investigation body with the function of inquiring into crimes of excessive use of force 
and violence committed against Mapuche communities by members of the 
Carabineros and the investigative police. Such a body should be institutionally 
independent of both forces, should have the power to investigate and to require the 
initiation and prosecution of criminal and disciplinary proceedings. It should also 
have power to inquire into the failure of the Office of the Military Prosecutor to 
secure accountability in the many cases of excessive violence for which it has so far 
failed to take any effective action. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur further recommends that the Government of Chile, 
through the Ministry of Justice, ensure the provision of facilities for Mapuche 
detainees to serve their sentences close to their communities. The Special Rapporteur 
is of the view that this would facilitate their peaceful reintegration into their 
communities after they are released.</b>
