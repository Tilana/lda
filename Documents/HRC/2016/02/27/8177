<p> Since the &#8220;Rose Revolution&#8221;, Georgia has experienced a remarkable period of 
reforms in many areas of public life. The Special Rapporteur considers, however, that these 
improvements should not be taken for granted. A climate of fear and intimidation against 
members of opposition political parties and civil society could seriously threaten this path. 
In the light of the 2012 parliamentary and 2013 presidential elections, more efforts to 
ensure protection of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association should be 
made.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association, Maina Kiai, undertook an official mission to Georgia from 6 to 13 February 
2012, at the invitation of the Government. The visit was carried out pursuant to his mandate 
to assess compliance with international standards on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association, and to paragraph 5 (<i>f</i>) of Human Rights Council resolution 
15/21, in which the Council mandated the Special Rapporteur to report on violations, 
wherever they occur, and to draw the attention of the Council and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to situations of particularly serious concern. 
</p>
<p>2. Georgia has extended a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate 
holders. In this context, the mission was planned following a joint urgent appeal addressed 
to the Government of Georgia on 20 June 2011 regarding allegations of disproportionate 
use of force by law enforcement authorities to disperse a demonstration held on 26 May 
</p><p>2011. The Special Rapporteur had been keen to visit other regions in Georgia; there was, 
however, insufficient time to adequately prepare a visit to the breakaway regions of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Special Rapporteur would like to visit them in the future, 
in the framework of a follow-up visit.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited the cities of Tbilisi, Kutaisi and Batumi. In Tbilisi, 
the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister and the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs; 
the Deputy Chairperson of the Constitutional Court; the Deputy Minister for Corrections 
and Legal Assistance; the Head of the Legal Department of the Municipality of Tbilisi; the 
Minister and the Deputy Minister for Labour, Health and Social Affairs; the First Deputy 
Chairperson, the Chairperson of International Relations Committee and the First Deputy 
Chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliament of Georgia; the Head of the 
International Relations Department of the Ministry of Defense; the Vice-President of the 
Supreme Court and the Chairperson of the Chamber of Administrative Cases; the First 
Deputy Chief Prosecutor and the Head of the International Law Department of the Ministry 
of Justice; the First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs; the Secretary and the Deputy 
Secretary of the National Security Council; the Public Defender of Georgia; and the Deputy 
Head of the Justice Department of the Office of the Public Defender. The Special 
Rapporteur also met with representatives of the United Nations country team and of 
diplomatic missions. In Kutaisi, he met with the Deputy Governor of Imereti and the Head 
of Patrol Police of Imereti region. In Batumi, he met with the Chairperson of the 
Government of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara and the Deputy Head of Patrol Police 
of Adjara.  
</p>
<p>4. In each city, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of political parties, 
non-governmental organizations and labour unions.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
for having facilitated the meetings with Government representatives.  
</p>
<p>6.  A special note of appreciation is to be directed to the Public Defender and his 
Office for the invaluable support offered during the mission. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur also expresses his appreciation to the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator and, most notably, deep gratitude to the presence of the Office of the 
High Commissioner (OHCHR) in Georgia for their excellent and invaluable support during 
the preparation and conduct of the official visit. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur believes that the effective enjoyment of the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association is of particular importance in Georgia. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>This is relevant considering the way that the current Government was formed. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that his visit was also timely given the number of legislative 
amendments adopted in late December 2011 that may have a direct impact on the 
enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. In the view of 
the Special Rapporteur, the country is at a critical point where it can take further steps to 
improve on its record or take the country backwards in terms of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur took into due consideration the views of the authorities of 
Georgia and the recent history of the country when drafting the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Historical and political background 
</b></p>
<p>10. Independence was restored to Georgia in 1991. In 2003, massive protests (leading to 
what became known as the &#8220;Rose Revolution&#8221;) over fraudulent parliamentary elections, &#8211;
were held throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>11. In 2004, Mikheil Saakashvili was elected President of Georgia, a position he still 
held at the time of the official visit. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2010, the Parliament of Georgia adopted a set of constitutional reforms, which 
will come into effect in 2013. With the reforms, Georgia is modifying its current 
presidential system and moving towards a parliamentary system of government, , by 
expanding the powers of the Prime Minister and reducing the powers and prerogatives of 
the President. The President will act as &#8220;guarantor of Georgia&#8217;s unity and national 
independence&#8221;, while the Prime Minister, as the head of the executive Government, will be 
directly accountable to Parliament. While theoretically the current President, who is now 
ineligible to run again for the presidency owing to term limits, may vie to be Prime Minister 
as the head of the most popular party, these new provisions have been generally welcomed 
by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) of the 
Council of Europe.1  
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Georgia has a civil law system based on the Constitution of Georgia, the supreme 
law of the State. The Constitution contains legal safeguards for the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms. Article 6 of the Constitution clearly stipulates that 
international treaties &#8220;shall take precedence over domestic normative acts&#8221; only if they do 
</p>
<p>not contradict the Constitution.2 
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution recognizes the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association. More specifically, article 25 stipulates that &#8220;everyone, except members of the 
</p>
<p>armed forces and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, has the right to public assembly without 
arms either indoors or outdoors without prior permission&#8221;. The article also stipulates that 
this freedom may be subject to prior notification &#8220;in the case where a public assembly or 
manifestation is held on a public thoroughfare&#8221;, and that &#8220;only the authorities shall have the 
right to break up a public assembly or manifestation in case it assumes an illegal character. 
In terms of the right to association, article 26 explicitly recognizes the right of everyone &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>form and to join public associations, including trade unions&#8221; and the right &#8220;to form a

changes to the constitution of Georgia (CDL-AD (2010)028), October 2010, pp. 7 and 16.

</b></p>
<p>political party or other political association and participate in its activity in accordance with 
the Organic Law&#8221;. Article 26, paragraph 3, explicitly bans &#8220;the formation and activity of&#8230; 
public and political associations aiming at overthrowing or forcibly changing the 
constitutional structure of Georgia, infringing upon the independence and territorial 
integrity of the country or propagandising war or violence, provoking national, local, 
religious or social animosity&#8221;. In addition, the same article provides for the &#8220;suspension or 
prohibition of the activity of public or political associations&#8230; only under a court decision, 
</p>
<p>in the cases determined by the Organic Law and in accordance with a procedure prescribed 
by law&#8221;. Moreover, article 27 allows the imposition of restrictions on &#8220;the political activity 
of citizens of a foreign country and stateless persons&#8221;. Article 33 recognizes the right to 
</p>
<p>strike and, in this regard, the &#8220;procedure of exercising this right shall be determined by law. 
The law shall also establish the guarantees for the functioning of services of vital 
importance&#8221;. Lastly, article 39 guarantees &#8220;other universally recognized rights, freedoms 
</p>
<p>and guarantees of an individual and a citizen, which are not referred to herein but stem 
inherently from the principles of the Constitution&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15.  In terms of the main legislation, at the time of the visit, the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association were governed by the Law on Assembly and 
Manifestations and the Law on Political Unions of Citizens, both amended in December 
2011; the Constitutional Law on Amendments and Changes to the Constitution of Georgia; 
the Civil Code of Georgia; the Organic Law on the Suspension of Activities and Prohibition 
of Civil Society Organizations; the Law on Trade Unions; the Criminal Code; the Code on 
Administrative Offences; the Election Code; and the Labour Code. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. International legal standards 
</b></p>
<p>16.  In assessing the situation of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association in Georgia, the Special Rapporteur was guided by several international legal 
standards. The most relevant were the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
and articles 21 and 22 in particular; and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, especially with regard to article 8. Both covenants were ratified on 3 
May 1994 without reservations. 
</p>
<p>17. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action reaffirmed that all human rights 
are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interdependent.3 Owing to the nature of his 
mandate, the Special Rapporteur also paid attention to the following articles of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: article 7 (prohibition of torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment); article 9 (right to liberty and 
security of person); article 14 (right to a fair trial); article 17 (right to privacy); article 19 
(right to freedom of opinion and expression); and article 25 (right to take part in conduct of 
public affairs, and right to vote in genuine periodic elections). In the view of the mandate 
holder, these rights are complementary to the exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association insofar as they contribute to the effective enjoyment of these 
rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was also guided by other relevant international human rights 
instruments, including those of the treaty bodies and specialized agencies. More 
specifically, when drafting the present report, he observed International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection 
of the Right to Organize, ratified in 1999, and No. 98 concerning the Application of the 
</p>
<p>  
 3 A/CONF.157/23, para. 5.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Principles of the Right to Organize and to Bargain Collectively, ratified in 1993; the 
Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society 
to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms;4 general comments Nos. 25, 27, 29, 31, 32 and 34 of the Human Rights 
Committee; general comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture; the Basic Principles 
on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; and the Code of Conduct 
for Law Enforcement Officials.5 
</p>
<p><b> V. Right to freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>19. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as stipulated by the Human Rights Council 
in its resolution 15/21, defines the scope by which the mandate holder may consider issues 
involving associations. Notably, in the preamble to resolution 15/21, the Council 
recognized that the right to freedom of association was an essential component of 
democracy, providing individuals with invaluable opportunities to, inter alia, express their 
political opinions, engage in literary and artistic pursuits and other cultural, economic and 
social activities, engage in religious observances or other beliefs, form and join trade unions 
and cooperatives, and elect leaders to represent their interests and hold them accountable. 
Accordingly, the mandate holder considers that political parties, trade unions and non-
governmental organizations are all covered within the same right, and are therefore 
considered to be various forms of associations.  
</p>
<p>20. Moreover, in resolution 15/21, the Human Rights Council also recognized that 
exercising the right to freedom of association free of restrictions, subject only to the 
limitations permitted by international law, in particular international human rights law, was 
indispensable to the full enjoyment of these rights, particularly where individuals may 
espouse minority or dissenting religious or political beliefs. Article 8 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stipulates that no restrictions or 
limitations may be put in place &#8220;other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary 
in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the 
protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;. Similarly, article 22 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the right to association, including the 
right to form and join trade unions, and includes an additional restriction to protect &#8220;public 
</p>
<p>health or morals&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. Restrictions on fundamental rights must be applied in a manner that do not diminish 
nor annul the effect of the right itself. This view has been expressed by the Human Rights 
Committee on several occasions, in that &#8220;the relation between right and restriction, between 
norm and exception, must not be reversed. The laws authorizing the application of 
restrictions should use precise criteria and may not confer unfettered discretion on those 
charged with their execution&#8221;.6 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to the situation in Georgia, the Special Rapporteur recognizes the 
improvements that have taken place in the area of freedom of association since the Rose 
Revolution. These reforms have certainly enriched the space in which associations can be 
formed and operate.

 5 General Assembly resolution 34/169, annex. 
 6 See Human Rights Committee general comments Nos. 27 (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9), para. 13, and 
</p>
<p>34 (CCPR/C/GC/34), para. 21. In paragraph 6 of its general comment No. 31 
(CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add. 3), the Committee also makes reference to this point.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was particularly encouraged by the adoption, in July 2011, 
of amendments to the Civil Code allowing religious minority associations to register as 
legal entities of public law. With the entry into force of the new law, the situation of 
religious minorities in Georgia has improved considerably. Moreover, the current procedure 
for the registration of associations, including non-governmental organizations, meets 
international standards, as it is generally prompt, expeditious, easily accessible and 
inexpensive.7  
</p>
<p>24. In spite of such good reforms, however, there are concerns about the enabling 
environment for associations. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the recent adoption 
of legislative amendments to the Law on Political Unions of Citizens, together with the 
application of the existing Labour Code and Election Code, unduly restrict the free exercise 
of the right to association.  
</p>
<p>25. With regard to freedom of association, the Special Rapporteur has identified two 
broad areas of concern: an uneven political playing field, and undue obstacles for trade 
unions and their members. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Uneven political playing field  
</b></p>
<p>26. In late December 2011, the Parliament of Georgia passed amendments to the 
Organic Law on Political Unions of Citizens that could have far-reaching consequences for 
the functioning of political parties in opposition and civil society organizations. The 
mandate holder notes that these amendments are at times drafted in ambiguous language, 
and are fuelling an overall climate of distrust, while violating international human rights 
law. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to point out, however, that following his visit and 
preliminary findings on this matter, he was informed by the Government that amendments 
to the law were adopted in May 2012, after due consultations with civil society.  
</p>
<p>27. International law imposes obligations on States to respect the right of every 
individual to associate freely, irrespective of political preferences. Article 22 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Georgia is a State party, 
allows people to associate without undue restrictions. Moreover, article 25 of the Covenant 
guarantees the right of all citizens to (a) take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or 
through freely chosen representatives; and (b) to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic 
elections guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors. 
</p>
<p>28. Essentially, the above-mentioned treaty-based provisions are intended to permit fair 
political competition in societies, enabling citizens not only to openly express their political 
views, but also to give them a fair chance to change their leaders as they deem appropriate. 
To that extent, a level playing field in politics is necessary for the enjoyment of the right of 
association.  
</p>
<p>29. The above view had already been interpreted by the Human Rights Committeein 
</p><p>1996. In its general comment No. 25 on the right to participate in public affairs, voting 
rights and the right of equal access to public service, the Committee considered that the 
right to freedom of association, including the right to form and join organizations and 
associations concerned with political and public affairs, was an essential adjunct to the 
rights protected by article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
According to the Committee, political parties and membership in parties played a 
significant role in the conduct of public affairs and the election process; States should 
</p>
<p>  
 7 See A/59/401, para. 81 and A/64/226, para. 110.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>therefore ensure that, in their internal management, political parties respect the applicable 
provisions of article 25 in order to enable citizens to exercise their rights thereunder.8  
</p>
<p>30. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges very positively the simple registration 
process for associations currently in place, he is seriously concerned about a number of 
provisions in the adopted amendments and additions to the Law on Political Unions. These 
provisions relate to the extension of the restrictions on political parties to legal and physical 
persons, to the scope and responsibilities attributed to the Chamber of Control, and its 
overall impact on the country&#8217;s elections. The mandate holder notes that these amendments 
were adopted in late December 2011.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Arbitrary restrictions  
</b></p>
<p>31. When drafting the present report, the Special Rapporteur was informed that new 
amendments to the Law on Political Unions had been adopted in May 2012. In particular, 
according to this information, funding restrictions prescribed for political parties &#8220;apply to a 
</p>
<p>person, who has declared electoral goals and uses related financial and material resources to 
achieve this goal&#8221;, and &#8220;restrictions to the persons apply only to activities that are related to 
the use of finances or any other material or non-material resources for political or electoral 
goals&#8221;.9 The mandate holder recognizes that there have been changes since the previous 
version of the law, adopted in December 2011.10 Owing to reporting requirements, 
however, the Special Rapporteur has not been able to verify or consult the said amendments 
with other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>32. According to the legislation amended in December 2011, funding restrictions 
prescribed for political parties also apply to (a) legal persons who are connected, directly or 
indirectly, to a political party or are otherwise under the control of a political party or have 
declared political aims and objectives; (b) legal persons who, by means of representatives 
or through the assistance of other persons, encourage voters to support or abstain from 
supporting any political power; and (c) persons who have declared political aims and 
objectives, those connected to them, as well as persons in business relations with them, who 
have political and electoral aims or conduct activities that affect the expression of the 
citizens of Georgia in elections, plebiscites and referendums, these activities being 
conducted with the aim of avoiding obligations prescribed by the law. Moreover, the same 
applies if a &#8220;legal person is connected, directly or indirectly, to a political party if its 
</p>
<p>expenditures are related, directly or indirectly, to the activity and goals of a political 
party&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>33. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 261 of the law, as amended in December 2011, extends 
the restrictions on political party funding to any individual or organization in Georgia. 
More concretely, these restrictions disproportionately apply to any organization in Georgia 
with &#8220;connections&#8221; to parties either directly or indirectly; that may have made political 
declarations with specific goals and objectives; have encouraged or discouraged voting in 
elections; or have spent funds on issues that may be seen as related to a political party, 
either directly or indirectly. Moreover, restrictions also concern any individual in Georgia

<p>with political convictions, including people &#8220;connected to them&#8221; and in &#8220;business relations 
</p>
<p>with them&#8221;, aiming at putting them into practice, or conduct activities that can influence the 
will of voters at any given time, including activities that may aim at challenging these 
provisions.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur is concerned with the fact that article 261 may seriously 
deter non-governmental organizations and civil society in general from freely conducting 
human rights activities on the ground. In the view of the mandate holder, the work of some 
of these organizations is political by definition and constitutes a crucial component of a free 
and democratic society. In addition, there is a high risk of targeting ordinary individuals for 
simply having expressed political opinions in public or in private. If found to be in violation 
of these ambiguous provisions, any individual, business company or legal entity could be 
subject to restrictions on property, funds and finance that would otherwise be applied to 
political parties.  
</p>
<p>35. Indeed, the legislation provides for restrictions on any individual or association or 
business company in Georgia for political reasons, which may involve, inter alia, limits to 
property ownership; a ban on accepting international financial and material contributions 
from physical and legal persons and non-profit legal persons, except for training purposes 
or other public arrangements; contributions, except explicitly permitted otherwise, from 
public institutions with a State share of more than 10 per cent; anonymous donations; a ban 
on receiveing credits or loans from any natural or legal person, except for election 
campaigns if specifically registered for such a purpose; a limit to the annual overall amount 
of spending and expenses of up to 0.2 per cent of GDP for the previous year; the same total 
amount of GDP for parties united in a block; a maximum of 10 per cent of such a share of 
GDP for expert/consultation services; gifts for holiday celebrations of a maximum of 5,000 
lari a year; a maximum of 60,000 lari in donations a year per person; or an annual amount 
of 1,200 lari in membership fees a year per person. 
</p>
<p>36. Paragraph 3 of article 261 contains an apparent safeguard provision to protect the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to participate in the conduct of 
public affairs by stipulating that &#8220;the restrictions listed in the present article may not be 
used against the freedom of expression and civic engagement&#8221;. This may appear to suggest 
that the effective application of paragraph 3 would seem sufficient to annul the negative 
effect of the provisions in the two preceding paragraphs. The mere declaration of political 
and electoral aims, goals or objectives should not, however, be deemed sufficient proof of 
illicit party financing. Moreover, the law does not clarify what electoral &#8220;goals&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;objectives&#8221; imply in practice, which could certainly lead to abusive interpretations. In this 
context, the fear of being subjected to such restrictions may act as a deterrent for 
individuals, non-governmental organizations, trade unions, private companies and other 
legal entities, and facilitate self-censorship. As a consequence, it may act in violation of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to participate in the conduct of public 
affairs, and the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.  
</p>
<p>37. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that most amendments to the 
Law on Political Unions were motivated to prevent Bidzina Ivanishvili, the wealthiest 
individual in Georgia, from financing associations or otherwise taking part in the conduct 
of public affairs in Georgia through means other than by a political party. This would 
suggest that the recent amendments were motivated by a desire to control the political 
activities of a specific individual rather than for objective and sustainable reasons. </p>

<p>38. Limiting political party financing is a legitimate endeavour. The Special Rapporteur 
shares the view of the Human Rights Committee that &#8220;reasonable limitations on campaign 
expenditure may be justified where this is necessary to ensure that the free choice of voters 
is not undermined or the democratic process distorted by the disproportionate expenditure 
on behalf of any candidate or party&#8221;.12 However, in the case of the amendments to the Law 
on Political Unions, the extent to which the law could affect anyone in Georgia appears to 
be unreasonably large. International law entitles non-governmental organizations and any 
legal entity and every individual to support any candidate or political persuasion of their 
choice without hindrance, subject to campaign finance laws. It is recalled that laws crafted 
for such subjective purposes often have the effect of violating human rights and are often 
unsustainable within changing circumstances of life. 
</p>
<p>39. The mandate holder takes note of the 2011 joint opinion of the Venice Commission 
and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe in terms of limiting and restricting the property and 
funding of political parties to avoid &#8220;big business&#8221; and illicit donations from &#8220;purchasing&#8230; 
</p>
<p>political influence&#8221;.13 However, he is cognizant of the fact that a significant number of 
amendments were introduced at a later stage by the Georgian legislature following the 
adoption of the joint opinion.14  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Chamber of Control 
</b></p>
<p>40. Article 34 of the new Law on Political Unions expands the prerogatives of the 
Chamber of Control to &#8220;monitor the legality and transparency of political party funding&#8221;. In 
</p>
<p>addition, a new unit to monitor party finances was established in early January 2012. Grave 
concern is expressed that with the new legislation, the Chamber of Control, a de facto organ 
of the Executive, may, among other things, conduct audits of financial activities, request 
information on finances, including on the origins of transferred or received property, or 
ensure transparency of funding for any citizen or legal person in Georgia. This would give 
the Chamber of Control extraordinary discretional authority to inspect the state of financial 
accounts of any person or organization. Such authority can be exercised, without clear 
criteria and for its own reasons, without explanation. The Special Rapporteur is of the view 
that any monitoring authority of campaign finances should be transparent, impartial and 
independent &#8211; and beseen to be so &#8211; in its constitutive authority and in fact. 
</p>
<p>41. During the conduct of the visit, there were instances where non-governmental 
organizations had been requested to submit financial declarations for scrutiny under the 
above-mentioned law, in circumstances that were not transparent. Other allegations were 
received from private individuals, including activists, human rights defenders and members 
of trade unions, on similar grounds. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
the Chamber of Control had used standardized questions to interrogate individuals, 
allegedly requesting information on their political activity, whether they had distributed 
documents from the &#8220;Georgian Dream&#8221;, whether they had been collecting signatures for

</b></p>
<p>Mr. Ivanishvili&#8217;s citizenship, and whether a financial contribution had been received for 
that purpose (see paragraph 48 below).  
</p>
<p>42. Due consideration was taken of the arguments made by senior Government officials 
that no organization would be held accountable unless decisions had been based on 
evidence and there were &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221; to believe that active support was being 
given to a political party. Government officials argued that the Chamber of Control was 
under considerable scrutiny and that monitoring would not target opinions, but rather 
activities potentially covering up illicit financing. The Chamber of Control was also 
presented as an independent institution without executive, legislative or judicial powers that 
does not interfere with business activities, freedom of expression, private property or civil 
society. Similarly, more transparency and greater role of courts against Chamber decisions 
were also envisaged. 
</p>
<p>43. In practice, however, if the Chamber of Control has a suspicion of an illicit activity, 
whether well- or ill-founded, ambiguous provisions in the Law on Political Unions can 
empower it to interfere with business relations, compromise freedom of opinion or 
expression, violate the right to property and privacy, and hamper the work of civil society. 
At the time of the visit, there was no mechanism in place that could mitigate potential abuse 
by the Chamber of Control. In theory, human rights violations may be subject to a judicial 
remedy. However, while physical and legal persons may pursue such legal remedies, the 
perceived lack of independence of the judiciary in court proceedings could lead activists 
and human rights defenders to self-censor.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was, however, informed that guidelines for the 
implementation of the law were being drafted by the Chamber of Control.15 While genuine 
consultations with civil society are most encouraged, it is still incumbent on the 
Government to seriously consider reviewing the above-mentioned legal provisions.  
</p>
<p>45. While drafting the present report, the Special Rapporteur was informed that a high-
profile hearing with civil society on political party financing had been held in Parliament. 
An agreement was reached on a package of amendments that should, inter alia, specify 
which legal persons fall under such restrictions, reduce fines imposed by the State audit 
agency, establish rules of procedure for the Chamber of Control, apply no restrictions to 
non-election campaigning associations that support the capacity-building of political 
parties, and mandate an additional role for courts. According to the Government, 
amendments to the Law on Political Unions were adopted in May 2012. The mandate 
holder encourages the Government to continue with these efforts to ensure even greater 
protection of fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Genuine competitive elections 
</b></p>
<p>46. A significant number of allegations were received regarding unequal access to State 
resources for election campaigning. In 2008, the OSCE Election Observation Mission in 
Georgia concluded that, while the campaign for the extraordinary presidential election was 
overshadowed by widespread allegations of intimidation of and pressure on, inter alia, 
public-sector employees and opposition activists, &#8220;the distinction between State activities 
and the campaign of the ruling United National Movement &#8230; was blurred&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>  
 15 Following the visit, the Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that, in March 2012, 
</p>
<p>consultations with non-governmental organizations were organized on the drafting of the guidelines 
and that the final document was expected to be finalized in June 2012. 
</p>
<p> 16 OSCE Election Observation Mission final report, Warsaw, 4 March 2008, p. 1.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>47. According to the information received, the ability to distinguish between the ruling 
political party and the State has deteriorated. The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
technical restrictions had been applied to ensure better access to public resources during 
election campaigning, including an obligation for entry and mid-level public sector 
employees to use their own private arrangements to campaign for elections. He appreciates 
the implicit recognition by the Government that such measures only partially address the 
problem of lack of equal access to resources. In the light of the parliamentary and 
presidential elections, to be held in October 2012 and in 2013 respectively, greater effort in 
this regard is essential to guarantee genuine competitive elections in accordance with 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>48. In addition, a significant number of allegations were received regarding acts of 
harassment and intimidation, as well as of illicit surveillance, of persons believed to be 
opposition members or supporters, or those who try to challenge the Government. Since 
similar allegations were also registered during the electoral period of 2008, the authorities 
are urged to increase efforts to respond to such cases and to take appropriate remedial 
action.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur believes that restrictions on campaign finance should not 
contradict the principle of genuinely free, fair and competitive elections, and that a greater 
effort to separate the activities of the State and the ruling party is necessary to guarantee a 
level playing field.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Undue obstacles for trade unions and their members 
</b></p>
<p>50. When establishing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur in its resolution 15/21, the 
Human Rights Council specified that the mandate holder should undertake his or her 
activities such that the mandate would not include those matters of specific competence of 
ILO and its specialized supervisory mechanisms and procedures with respect to employers&#8217; 
and workers&#8217; rights to freedom of association, with a view to avoiding any duplication.  
</p>
<p>51. The mandate holder is cautious of the fact that matters relating to workers&#8217; activities 
and trade unions fall into the specific area of work of ILO, and he could therefore duplicate 
existing efforts.He is, however, mindful that avoiding duplication should not mean 
disregarding the matter altogether. To the extent that the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association provide &#8220;individuals with invaluable opportunities to&#8230;. form 
</p>
<p>and join trade unions and cooperatives&#8221;,17 the Special Rapporteur aims to contribute to and 
promote the work of ILO in this regard and, where possible, to complement it.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the important contribution of ILO with regard to 
labour matters in Georgia. In particular, he has taken into consideration the 
recommendations made to the Government of Georgia in 2010 by the ILO Committee of 
Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations,18 in particular with 
those concerning the implementation of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 and the need to 
consider revising the Labour Code.19

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14  
</b></p>
<p>53. International human rights law places significant importance on labour unions. In 
particular, article 8 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
recognizes the right of everyone &#8220;to form trade unions and join the trade union of his 
choice, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, for the promotion and 
protection of his economic and social interests&#8221;, and &#8220;the right of trade unions to function 
</p>
<p>freely&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur also notes with interest the establishment of the Tripartite 
Social Partnership Commission by decree in November 2009 and a tripartite working group 
to assess whether the national labour legislation is in line with the findings of the ILO 
Committee of Experts.20 He notes that a national tripartite structure has been established 
with a mandate to address the concerns of social partners in Georgia.21  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Right of unions and their members to function freely 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur considers that labour unions operate in a difficult political 
environment. He identified an apparent inconsistency between the right to join and form 
trade unions and the right to strike, as enshrined under article 26 and 33 of the Constitution 
and the current labour legislation, in particular the Labour Code. 
</p>
<p>56. A significant number of allegations were received regarding collective dismissals of 
public and private sector employees for supporting opposition parties. The mandate holder 
acknowledges that numerous allegations of anti-union dismissals were examined by the 
ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.22 In this connection, during the visit a 
correlation seemed to emerge with regard to the allegations of collective dismissals and the 
existing restrictions on physical and legal persons concerning the financing of political 
parties. 
</p>
<p>57. Indeed, recent allegations of anti-union dismissals in the education sector were 
received apparently connected to the support of some teachers for the &#8220;Georgian Dream&#8221; 
political alliance. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the allegations of 
harassment and intimidation of workers belonging to or who have expressed sympathy or 
desire to join labour unions.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to form and join unions for the defence of economic and social interests 
</b></p>
<p>58. Current labour laws provide for relatively easy dismissal of workers. The Labour 
Code stipulates in article 5(8) that &#8220;the employer is not required to substantiate his/her 
</p>
<p>decision for not recruiting an applicant&#8221;. Moreover, articles 37 (d) and 38 (3) stipulate, 
respectively, that a labour contract may be terminated for a &#8220;derangement&#8221;, and that such 
termination may be &#8220;at the initiative of the employer&#8221; as long as &#8220;the employee&#8230; [is] given 
at least one month of pay, unless otherwise envisaged by the contract&#8221;.23  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur considers that the above-mentioned flexibility in the legal 
regime can inhibit the freedom to form, organize and operate trade unions, as employers, 
whether private or public, have almost unfettered discretion and could easily find excuses

<p>to fire workers who try to form and operate trade unions, which they may not want. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur echoes the recommendations of the Committee of Experts 
with regard to the Labour Code in the hope that &#8220;the necessary measures to revise sections 
</p>
<p>5 (8), 37(d) and 38 (3) of the Labour Code will soon be taken so as to ensure that the 
Labour Code provides for an adequate protection against anti-union discrimination&#8221;.24 
</p>
<p>60. The mandate holder views the current situation as a matter of serious concern, in 
particular with regard to the support of union members for the political parties that they 
might wish to endorse. Trade unions have the right to make political choices for candidates 
and parties that can further their interests without running the risk of falling under the 
restrictions of the recent amendments against &#8220;relations with political parties&#8221;. The 
effective protection of individuals against unlawful termination of labour contracts in 
Georgia requires measures other than justjudicial remedies.  
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Right to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>61. The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are closely 
interrelated and mutually reinforcing, given than, in order to organize a peaceful assembly, 
some form of organization, either de facto or de jure, is often required. For this reason, the 
specific international human rights standards that apply in the case of freedom of 
association &#8211; as well as to other basic freedoms (like those referred to in paragraphs 19 to 
21 above) also affect peaceful assemblies.  
</p>
<p>62. In this regard, it is important to reiterate that restrictions to the above freedoms 
should not be derailed by undue obstacles to the enjoyment of essential rights.25 In 
paragraph 4 of its resolution 15/21, the Human Rights Council recalled that, in accordance 
with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the exercise of the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association may be subject to certain restrictions. The Special 
Rapporteur frames its application with the understanding that their free and unhindered 
enjoyment is an essential component for democracy, especially &#8220;where individuals may 
</p>
<p>espouse minority or dissenting religious or political beliefs&#8221;.26 
</p>
<p>63. Even though a notification period of five days is required by law in the event that an 
assembly blocks transport movement or is held on a road, the mandate holder takes note 
that peaceful assemblies are normally conducted in Georgia without prior authorization. 
Given the way the current Government was formed, and in view of the elections scheduled 
for 2012 and 2013, there is an expectation that the rights of peaceful assembly and of 
association will be respected. 
</p>
<p>64.  In late December 2011, as part of the package of reforms, amendments to the Law 
on Assembly and Manifestations were passed by Parliament, ending an extended period of 
negotiations launched in 2009. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that, in spite of 
some improvements, certainproblematic provisions remaining in the law restrict freedom of 
assembly. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur validated claims made by representatives of civil society 
that restrictions on peaceful assemblies had been applied &#8211; or attempts had been made to

</b></p>
<p>apply them &#8211; in law and in practice to prevent citizens from expressing their views through 
peaceful protest.  
</p>
<p>66. At the end of his official visit, the mandate holder assessed the situation in terms of 
the enjoyment of the right to peaceful assembly. His assessment was based on two broad 
areas: a policy pattern that selectively restricts some peaceful assemblies, and the events of 
26 May 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Restricting peaceful assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>67. There is a consensus among the Government, civil society, academia and the 
international presence in Georgia with regard to the manner in which assemblies are 
perceived. In November 2007, mass demonstrations were held in front of Parliament. It was 
the first time that massive rallies had been held since 2003, when mass peaceful assemblies 
led to the ousting of then President Eduard Shevardnadze.  
</p>
<p>68. While it is not the intention of the Special Rapporteur to establish the facts 
surrounding the events prior to and after November 2007, it remains evident that a 
restrictive pattern emerged with regard to some peaceful protests that appear to have a real 
potential to challenge the authorities. The mandate holder recognizes the country&#8217;s fragile 
transition to democracy and the security risks that inherently exist in this process. However, 
the constant blaming of an &#8220;external hostile power&#8221; do not validate the fact that citizens 
may have specific and particular grievances that they wish to express in this form, which is 
often a measure of frustration. 
</p>
<p>69. The policy pattern of restricting peaceful assemblies was enshrined in 2009 at the 
legislative level by means of significant amendments to the Law on Assembly. The changes 
to the law seriously limited the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.27 
However, in a spirit of cooperation, the Government of Georgia engaged in a number of 
revisions to the 2009 version of the law with the Venice Commission. 
</p>
<p>70. The predisposition to improve the legislation in accordance with international 
standards must be recognized. In particular, in March 2010 the Government of Georgia, 
based on preliminary comments by two members of the Venice Commission,28 redrafted 
some of the 2009 amendments to the law, which were then subject to an interim opinion by 
the Venice Commission the same month.29 Meanwhile, in September 2010, a complaint was 
lodged to the Constitutional Court on some provisions within the law. In April 2011, the 
Court found unconstitutional several provisions within the 2009 Law on Assembly and the 
Code on Administrative Offences.30 In July 2011, the Government of Georgia reviewed the 
amendments to the Law on Assembly based on the opinions of the Venice Commission and

<p>the Constitutional Court ruling. Thereafter, the Government requested a new opinion by the 
Venice Commission, which was made public in October 2011.  
</p>
<p>71. The mandate holder would like to join the Venice Commission in welcoming the 
positive changes introduced in the July 2011 version,31 introducing, for instance, the 
principles of proportionality, legality and democratic society in the law; for adding the 
principle of &#8220;clear, direct and present danger&#8221; for violence before prohibiting assemblies; 
</p>
<p>for repealing some blanket restrictions on peaceful assemblies; and for the new protection 
safeguards for journalists. In any event, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the 
December 2011 version of the law coincided with the later version sent to the Venice 
Commission in July 2011.He would therefore like to reiterate the concerns already 
expressed by the Venice Commission and the Public Defender of Georgia with regard to 
some of the provisions of the law.32  
</p>
<p>72. Most notably, article 2.1 of the Law on Assembly (July 2011) prohibits employees 
of the armed forces, armed law enforcement bodies, paramilitary and special facilities from 
exercising the right to peaceful assembly without distinguishing whether the assembly is 
connected to their official responsibilities and without separating periods of non-official 
duty. Article 5.3 restricts &#8220;citizens of other countries&#8221; and those below 18 years of age from 
</p>
<p>organizing peaceful assemblies. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this provision 
does not contemplate the right of migrants and minors with regard to peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p>73. Moreover, article 8 of the Law on Assembly requires the organizer to notify the 
assembly &#8220;at least five days prior to a scheduled date of the event&#8221;, therefore restricting the 
</p>
<p>possibility for holding spontaneous assemblies. The Special Rapporteur welcomes, 
however, the fact that the Government has lifted the ban on assemblies within a 20-metre 
perimeter from the entrance of some buildings, such as the Parliament, the presidential 
administration buildings and courts. He considers, however, that article 9 of the law 
maintains an excessive restriction and a blanket ban on any assembly within 20 metres of 
the entrance to some other buildings (such as the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, temporary detention 
facilities or all police stations); prohibits blocking railways, highways or entrances of 
buildings without clarifying what constitutes such an &#8220;entrance&#8221;; and entitles administrative 
</p>
<p>bodies and courts to impose &#8220;restrictions&#8221; within the 20-metre perimeter without clarifying 
their prerogatives.  
</p>
<p>74. Of further concern, despite theimprovements, which must be recognized, is article 
11.2 (e), which prohibits participants from &#8220;deliberately hindering the transport 
movement&#8221;, and article 111, which bans the blocking of transport movement &#8220;unless 
necessary owing to the large number of people&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur considers this 
restriction still excessive, considering that peaceful assemblies continuously block traffic as 
part of the protest and that this should only be restricted if such a blockage is prolonged 
unreasonably. In this regard, article 112 contains a restriction on any peaceful assembly that 
affects the normal functioning of those who &#8220;live, work, shop, trade and carry on business&#8221; 
as &#8220;these persons shall not be interrupted in carrying out their activities&#8221;. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur appreciates that reasonable alternatives can be offered and that such &#8220;normal

<p>functioning&#8221; can be interrupted if it is &#8220;for a short period of time&#8221;; however, further 
clarification on what actually constitutes a &#8220;short period of time&#8221; is clearly required. Lastly, 
the mandate holder appreciates that the previous obligation to end assemblies 
&#8220;immediately&#8221; in the event of &#8220;mass violation&#8221; has been substituted, in article 13, by a rule 
whereby organizers have 15 minutes to appeal for the break-up of the assembly. In fact, a 
longer period should be contemplated to expect &#8220;a reasonable effort&#8221; from the organizer to 
disperse assemblies, especially in view of preventing law enforcement officials from 
resorting to the use of force.33 
</p>
<p><b> B. The events of 26 May 2011 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur held extensive discussions on the events of 26 May 2011 
with representatives of the Government, civil society and the international community. He 
regrets to report that there were stark differences in the narratives of what actually 
happened on that night.  
</p>
<p>76. The events were the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.34 A 
response from the Government was received on 7 July 2011. 
</p>
<p>77. In the aftermath of a peaceful demonstration, held at Rustaveli Avenue on 25 May 
2011, to demand the resignation of the President, another protest was held in front of 
Parliament. It is alleged that some protesters called for the disruption of the Independence 
Day celebrations that were expected to take place the following day, on 26 May 2011. After 
midnight, events quickly deteriorated into a serious episode of violence, leading to the 
death of four people, including one police officer. A significant number of protesters and 
police officers were injured, and approximately 160 people were detained. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur does not intend to establish the facts regarding these events. 
He understands that the Ministry of Internal Affairs considers that violence was sporadic, 
and also notes the assessment of several senior Government officials that the police 
response was by and large proportionate to the threat perceived. He also notes the 
justification of the Ministry, in particular that police barricades were being removed; there 
was a general failure in police communications; disproportionate force was due to a lack of 
proper training; and that the early movement of police units to the north from Freedom 
Square interspersed the assembly to other areas. Other accounts suggest, however, that the 
reaction of the Government was intentionally disproportional. Indeed, while the Minstry of 
Internal Affairs attributed this to a lack of training, there are credible allegations that there 
were repeated beatings after the protest was dispersed and that protesters were chased by 
the police and thoroughly beaten up. It was in fact alleged that the police tactics employed 
to disperse the assembly on the night of 26 May were similar to those employed in 
November 2007,when protesters were also enclosed inside a perimeter and their exit 
obstructed. This has raised the suspicion of many stakeholders that the intention was not so 
much to disperse protesters as to punish and spread fear.  
</p>
<p>  
 33 See OSCE/Venice Commission Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly, second edition, para. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the efforts made by the Minstry of Internal 
Affairs to take remedial action and correct its mistakes in managing assemblies, in 
particular its treatment of protesters and journalists. He acknowledges that, according to the 
Ministry, the number of punishments for police misconduct increased considerably between 
2009 and 2011, and that an inquiry was launched inside the Ministry on police misconduct 
following the events of 26 May, resulting in disciplinary measures. Furthermore, he 
welcomes the Ministry&#8217;s previous engagement with the OSCE Strategic Police Matters Unit 
on police-related assistance and advice. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur warmly 
welcomes the predisposition of the Ministry to seriously consider implementing the 
OSCE/Venice Commission Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly.33 
</p>
<p>80. Another issue of serious concern connected to events of 26 May 2011 is the 
deliberate recourse to administrative detention of up to 90 days for protesters and activists, 
without adequate procedural safeguards. The Special Rapporteur fully aligns himself with 
the concerns raised by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention after its official visit to 
the country.35 He is alarmed by the frequency of the use of this form of detention for 
dealing with protesters. With regard to the protests of 26 May 2011, the mandate holder 
was informed that this form of detention was used for most, if not all, cases of detention. 
He was also informed about ongoing plans to extend the period of police custody from 12 
to 24 hours in the revised Code of Administrative Offences, which indicates that the 
authorities may intend to make the legislation even more restrictive. In this regard, the 
mandate holder received credible allegations pointing to a serious lack of judicial 
guarantees. He confirmed that police testimonies are given more weight than any other 
testimony, that judges have a tendency to disregard clear evidence presented on behalf of 
the defendant, including photographs and video footage, and that courts frequently rely 
solely on police testimonies for sentencing. Under these conditions, the same police 
detaining a protester or an activist are the ones whose testimony is given preference before 
a court proceeding. This suggests that there is a generalized presumption of guilt against 
activists and protesters, as opposed to the general presumption of innocence recognized 
under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>81. Considering the increasing number of allegations of acts of violence and ill-
treatment by law enforcement officials against protesters, these measures deter activists on 
the ground willing to express dissent through peaceful assembly. Indeed, the mandate 
holder considers that such measures against protesters appear to violate article 2.1 of the 
Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, according to which each State party is to take effective legislative, 
administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its 
jurisdiction. In its general comment No. 2, the Committee against Torture declared that 
&#8220;States parties are obligated to eliminate any legal or other obstacles that impede the 
</p>
<p>eradication of torture and ill-treatment, and to take positive effective measures to ensure 
that such conduct and any recurrences thereof are effectively prevented&#8221;.36 In addition, 
these measures also appear to contravene article 9.1 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights insofar as &#8220;no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention&#8221;, 
and the right to a fair trial, as enshrined in article 14 of the same Covenant.  
</p>
<p>82. The events of 26 May 2011 require a new, independent and transparent 
investigation. To be credible, it should involve all stakeholders, &#8211; including opposition 
leaders, civil society representatives, the Government and representatives from the 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20  
</b></p>
<p>international presence &#8211; to ensure that all views and perspectives are taken into account and 
that there is accountability for the clear excessive use of force. In absence of that, the 
perception of impunity and dissatisfaction towards the Government will prevail. 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur views very positively the ambitious and action-oriented 
reform programme implemented since the Rose Revolution. The programme quickly 
</b></p>
<p><b>resulted in improvements in many aspects of public life, in particularly by 
</b></p>
<p><b>significantly improving personal security of the population and reducing the crime 
</b></p>
<p><b>rate. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue along this path 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to intensify its efforts to ensure effective promotion and protection of the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In this context, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that the Law on 
Political Unions of Citizens could be used as an excuse to target persons in Georgia for 
</b></p>
<p><b>political reasons through the Chamber of Control. Given that article 261, as amended 
</b></p>
<p><b>in December 2011, violates basic rights and freedoms guaranteed in international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights instruments, urgent measures are required to prevent such violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>from occurring. The Special Rapporteur commends the fact that, subsequent to his 
</b></p>
<p><b>visit, new amendments were adopted in May 2012 to modify some of the said 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions. Owing to reporting requirements, however, the mandate holder has not 
</b></p>
<p><b>been able to verify nor consult on the amendments with other relevant stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur is very concerned at the lack of a conducive 
environment in Georgia allowing political parties to operate as equals. Stark 
</b></p>
<p><b>differences with regard to resource allocation were observed in law and in practice, 
</b></p>
<p><b>leading the mandate holder to conclude that the right to freedom of association for 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties is being consistently violated. Unless remedial action is taken, citizens 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Georgia will not be able to effectively elect leaders to represent their interests and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to hold them accountable.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Under international law, trade unions and their members have a right to 
support any political party of their choice. The significant number of allegations 
</b></p>
<p><b>received of collective dismissals for having supported political parties requires urgent 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention by the Government and ILO.  
</b></p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the Government&#8217;s predisposition to 
<b>cooperate with the Council of Euroe with regard to the Law on Assembly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Manifestations. Nonetheless, serious shortcomings continue to exist after the Venice 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission published its final opinion on the matter. Action is therefore needed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the right to freedom of peaceful assembly is adequately respected and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>any restrictions are exceptional and within what is permissible under international 
</b></p>
<p><b>law.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Serious disagreements regarding the events of 26 May 2011 between protesters 
and the police reveal an urgent need to establish the facts. After extensive interviews 
</b></p>
<p><b>and consideration of significant documentation on the matter, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>is of the view that the Government may have had the intention to use force against 
</b></p>
<p><b>opposition leaders and protesters.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the above-mentioned issues could 
favour a climate of fear and of intimidation of activists, human rights defenders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of trade unions and opposition political parties. Moreover, laws specifically </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>aiming to control the activities of one specific person have resulted in a climate of 
</b></p>
<p><b>uncertainty and cannot be justified for every Georgian citizen. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>With regard to the right to freedom of association, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government of Georgia: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Seriously consider repealing paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 26
1
 of the Law 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Political Unions of Citizens of December 2011. Physical and legal persons should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>granted the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs, as well as the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of opinion and expression without undue restrictions. The Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also ensure that alternative measures are sought and applied to prevent illicit 
</b></p>
<p><b>political party financing;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Seriously consider reviewing the prerogatives of the Chamber of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Control, in particular of the new unit responsible for monitoring financing related to 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties, in particular, with regard to the need to substantiate its decisions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the obligation to obtain a judicial instruction before taking any action in the event of 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasonable doubt when an illicit activity is suspected, and to ensure that it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent, independent and accountable, and seen to be so in law and fact; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that civil society is systematically consulted before any legislative 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiative is adopted. Civil society participation could, for instance, be institutionalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>rather than made available on an ad hoc basis;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Increase efforts to ensure that all political parties, including opposition 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties, have genuine, equitable and adequate access to State resources for election 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaigning. It is especially crucial that the line between the ruling party and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>State be clearly defined in order to create a level playing field; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Increase efforts to implement the recommendations of the Venice 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission and OSCE of December 2011 on the draft Election Code;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Increase efforts to ensure full implementation of the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>laid out in the reports of the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conventions and Recommendations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) In the above connection, seriously consider signing and ratifying the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter of the Council of Europe 
</b></p>
<p><b>Providing for a System of Collective Complaints. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>With regard to peaceful assembly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the Government of Georgia: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Seriously consider amending those provisions in the Law on Assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Manifestations that unduly violate the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, the above-mentioned provisions in articles 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 111, 112 and 13;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure full implementation of the recommendations made by the Public 
</b></p>
<p><b>Defender and the Venice Commission on the Law on Assembly and Manifestations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In national legislation, increase efforts to ensure a general presumption 
</b></p>
<p><b>in favour of holding assemblies; the OSCE/Venice Commission Guidelines on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Freedom of Peaceful Assembly may serve as a useful tool in such efforts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Continue efforts to avoid the use of force to disperse lawful and peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assemblies; in the case of peaceful but unlawful assemblies, ensure that force is only </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22  
</b></p>
<p><b>employed as a last resort; and that alternative measures are consistently sought to 
</b></p>
<p><b>disperse assemblies, in compliance with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the Code of Conduct for Law 
</b></p>
<p><b>Enforcement Officials; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Seriously consider establishing an independent commission to 
</b></p>
<p><b>thoroughly investigate the events of 26 May 2011, in an inclusive, transparent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>participatory manner, and with the involvement of all stakeholders, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>opposition political parties, non-governmental organizations, trade unions, activists, 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders and members of civil society; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure full implementation of the recommendations made by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its report,</b>37<b> in particular those contained 
</b></p>
<p><b>in paragraph 98, subparagraphs (b) to (e) and (h) to (q);  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) In accordance with the recommendation made by the Working Group on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Arbitrary Detention and contained in paragraph 98 (l) of the above-mentioned 
</b></p>
<p><b>report,</b>37<b> ensure the principle of equality of arms, right to defence and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>presumption of innocence of all citizens, including protesters, and discontinue the 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice of relying primarily on the testimony of the police when adjudicating cases;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure full implementation of article 2.1 of the Convention against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that civil society actively engage in the 
monitoring of assemblies, cases where activists and protesters are brought before 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts, and cases where persons are brought before the Chamber of Control.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the resources available for the 
OHCHR presence in the South Caucasus be increased to allow it to conduct activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>related to the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the representatives of the 
international presence in Georgia continue to support the work of civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Public Defender and his 
office continue its important and remarkable efforts in the promotion and protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.
