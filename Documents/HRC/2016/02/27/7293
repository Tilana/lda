<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants conducted a visit to Malta 
</p>
<p>from 6 to 10 December 2014. He held consultations with officials of the Government of 
</p>
<p>Malta, migrants and representatives of civil society organizations and international 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>Malta must develop programmes to cope with the unprecedented number of 
</p>
<p>migrants and asylum seekers arriving by boat. The Special Rapporteur recommends that 
</p>
<p>such programmes should offer immediate assistance, legal safeguards, and alternatives to 
</p>
<p>detention, as well as integration programmes for migrants and asylum seekers who arrive 
</p>
<p>irregularly. The European Union member States must collectively provide technical, 
</p>
<p>financial and human resources to support front-line States such as Malta in developing 
</p>
<p>comprehensive, rights-based migration policy.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 6 to 10 December 2014, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants conducted an official visit to Malta. The visit was undertaken in follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2012 year-long study on the management of the external borders of 
</p>
<p>the European Union. Following his study, the Special Rapporteur reaffirmed the importance 
</p>
<p>of addressing irregular border crossings, recalling that it was in the context of such 
</p>
<p>crossings that the most egregious human rights abuses appear to take place (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/46, para. 20). The increased numbers of migrant crossings and deaths in the 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean Sea and the response by European Union member States prompted the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur to revisit the issue of European Union border management. In addition, 
</p>
<p>in September 2014 the Human Rights Council, through presidential statement 27/3, 
</p>
<p>requested the Special Rapporteur, among others, to pay particular attention to the protection 
</p>
<p>of migrants at sea. Consequently, the present report is focused on external border control, 
</p>
<p>and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the broader human rights situation of all 
</p>
<p>migrants in Malta. The report should be read in conjunction with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>reports on Italy (A/HRC/29/46/Add.2) and the European Union (A/HRC/29/46).  
</p>
<p>2. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Valletta, where he was able to 
</p>
<p>meet with representatives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for Home 
</p>
<p>Affairs and National Security, the Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry for Family and Social Solidarity, the Ministry for Social Dialogue, Consumer 
</p>
<p>Affairs and Civil Liberties and the Department of Industrial and Employment Relations. He 
</p>
<p>also met with representatives from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Refugees (UNHCR) and from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and 
</p>
<p>many irregular migrants and asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with irregular migrants and refugees in the Hal Safi 
</p>
<p>detention centre and the Santa Venera open centre for unaccompanied minors, and with 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers in Balzan and Marsa. He also consulted with numerous civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, lawyers and academics working in the field of migration.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere appreciation to the Government of 
</p>
<p>Malta for the support provided throughout the visit. He further thanks UNHCR for its 
</p>
<p>excellent support and assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background on Malta and migration: a brief overview  
</b></p>
<p>5. Irregular migrants who arrive in Malta, having fled their home countries, have 
</p>
<p>usually spent time in Libya or Egypt, where some were subjected to arbitrary arrests, 
</p>
<p>indefinite immigration detention, torture, ill-treatment and racism.  
</p>
<p>6. The boat trips that follow these hardships are perilous, involving basic, often 
</p>
<p>unseaworthy vessels with limited navigation systems and insufficient food, water and fuel. 
</p>
<p>Migrants have reported being subjected to physical violence at the hands of smugglers, and 
</p>
<p>women have described being victims of sexual violence during the boat journey. The 
</p>
<p>crossing from Libya to Malta takes, on average, 1 to 3 days but can take significantly 
</p>
<p>longer, depending on the boat and weather conditions. Many boats capsize or go into 
</p>
<p>distress. In 2014, UNHCR reported that over 3,000 people had died or gone missing while 
</p>
<p>attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.  
</p>
<p>7. A large number of arrivals have been Syrians and Eritreans. This suggests that 
</p>
<p>ongoing situations of violence and insecurity and economic hardship are the key drivers of 
</p>
<p>migration using the central Mediterranean route. Another factor is the &#8220;sealing&#8221; of land </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>borders, such as those in Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. For many irregular migrants, their 
</p>
<p>only option is to make the dangerous sea journey to Italy or Malta.  
</p>
<p>8. All irregular migrants who arrive in Malta are mandatorily detained. In practice this 
</p>
<p>approach has little deterrent effect, given that migrants often cannot control their 
</p>
<p>destination. Some who arrive in Malta do not necessarily want to stop there. In many cases, 
</p>
<p>migrants are on boats without navigation systems and may wish to move on to mainland 
</p>
<p>Europe.  
</p>
<p>9. According to UNHCR, over 560 people arrived in Malta in 2014. About 30 per cent 
</p>
<p>of arrivals declared themselves to be children, and many of those were unaccompanied. 
</p>
<p>Malta received relatively few migrants, owing to the Italian search and rescue operation 
</p>
<p>Mare Nostrum, which rescued many migrants at sea and disembarked them in Italy. 
</p>
<p>However, with the phasing out of Mare Nostrum, Malta is likely to see a considerable 
</p>
<p>increase in arrivals in 2015. Given the profile of the majority of migrants and asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers arriving in Malta and the persistence of key push and pull factors, migration is not 
</p>
<p>likely to decrease in the near future.  
</p>
<p>10. According to UNHCR, European Union member States received on average 3.5 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants during the period 2010&#8211;2014. Cyprus, Hungary and 
</p>
<p>Malta received, on average, more asylum seekers per 1,000 inhabitants than the European 
</p>
<p>Union member States did as a whole. When comparing the number of asylum seekers to the 
</p>
<p>size of the national population, between 2010 and 2014 Sweden received, on average, the 
</p>
<p>highest number of asylum seekers compared to its national population; Malta ranked 
</p>
<p>second.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework on migration and 
border management 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. At the time of the visit, Malta was party to seven of the nine core international 
</p>
<p>human rights treaties. In March 2015 it ratified the International Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It has not signed or ratified the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
</p>
<p>Members of Their Families. It has yet to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
</p>
<p>procedure.  
</p>
<p>12. Malta has also ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>against Transnational Organized Crime; the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by 
</p>
<p>Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime; and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 
</p>
<p>Protocol. It has not signed the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 
</p>
<p>or the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.  
</p>
<p>13. Malta has signed the fundamental conventions of the International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization (ILO).1 It has not signed the ILO Migration for Employment Convention 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29); Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105); 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>(Revised), 1949 (No. 97) or the ILO Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1975 (No. 143).  
</p>
<p>14. Malta has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which 
</p>
<p>establishes the structure of maritime territory and the rights and obligations of States. It has 
</p>
<p>acceded to the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, which establishes 
</p>
<p>State duties in relation to establishing search and rescue services, and to the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, which builds on the norms that provide that States 
</p>
<p>and other actors have an explicit duty to assist those in distress at sea.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional framework  
</b></p>
<p>15. As member of the European Union and the Council of Europe, Malta is part of a 
</p>
<p>regional system on migration and is subject to the jurisdiction of a number of additional 
</p>
<p>legal instruments.  
</p>
<p>16. The European Union acquis on migration and asylum is applicable to Malta as a 
</p>
<p>European Union member State, and Malta has transposed many relevant European Union 
</p>
<p>directives into national legislation. Malta is also party to the Schengen Agreement, which 
</p>
<p>provided for the strengthening of external border controls and eliminated internal border 
</p>
<p>controls. Furthermore, as a European Union member State, Malta has an obligation to 
</p>
<p>respect the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when implementing 
</p>
<p>European Union law.  
</p>
<p>17. Malta joined the Council of Europe in 1965 and is party to the European Social 
</p>
<p>Charter. It has not signed the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers.  
</p>
<p>18. Malta is also party to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Freedoms and as such is under the jurisdiction of the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. The Court has issued a number of rulings on the human rights of migrants 
</p>
<p>with regard to Malta. In 2013, the Court in <i>Musa </i>v.<i> Malta</i> ruled that the 17-month 
</p>
<p>administrative detention of the applicant pending his asylum application and following its 
</p>
<p>determination was arbitrary and in breach of article 5 (1) of the Convention. The Court 
</p>
<p>further held that Maltese authorities had breached the applicant&#8217;s right to an effective and 
</p>
<p>speedy remedy to challenge the lawfulness of his detention under article 5 (4).  
</p>
<p>19. The Court has also ruled on cases challenging the Dublin regulations. Most recently, 
</p>
<p>in <i>Sharifi and Others </i>v.<i> Italy and Greece</i>, the Court clarified its position, stating that the 
</p>
<p>Dublin system, which serves to determine which European Union member State is 
</p>
<p>responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the European Union 
</p>
<p>member States by a third-country national, must be applied in a manner compatible with the 
</p>
<p>Convention: no form of collective and indiscriminate returns can be justified by reference 
</p>
<p>to that system, and it is for the State carrying out the return to ensure that the destination 
</p>
<p>country offers sufficient guarantees in the application of its asylum policy to prevent the 
</p>
<p>person concerned from being removed to his country of origin without an assessment of the 
</p>
<p>risks faced. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87); Right to 
</p>
<p>Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98); Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 
</p>
<p>(No. 100); Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111); Minimum Age 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1973 (No. 138); Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. National legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. Malta has a number of immigration regulations and standards that incorporate 
</p>
<p>international and regional standards into national law. The most significant pieces of 
</p>
<p>legislation are the Refugees Act of 2000 and the Immigration Act of 1970, discussed below.  
</p>
<p>21. The Immigration Act forms the legal basis for the country&#8217;s policy of mandatory 
</p>
<p>detention in relation to irregular migrants. Under article 10, persons refused entry to the 
</p>
<p>country may be placed temporarily on land or shore and detained until their departure. 
</p>
<p>These people are considered not to have formally entered the country. Article 14 builds 
</p>
<p>upon this provision setting out mandatory pre-removal detention.  
</p>
<p>22. The Common Standards and Procedures for Returning Illegally Staying Third-
</p>
<p>Country Nationals Regulations of 2011 transpose Directive No. 2008/115/EC of the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union into national law. Together 
</p>
<p>with the Immigration Act, the Regulations govern the country&#8217;s system of rights and 
</p>
<p>procedures for expulsion and detention of undocumented third-country nationals.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Refugees Act defines a refugee, sets process expectations, establishes a right of 
</p>
<p>refugees to legal aid on the same basis as Maltese citizens and provides for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Office of the Refugee Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Board.  
</p>
<p>24. The Procedural Standards in Examining Applications for Refugee Status 
</p>
<p>Regulations established by Legal Notice 243 of 2008, as amended by Legal Notice 161 of 
</p>
<p>2014, outlines the processes and procedures for assessing the protection claims of asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers. These guidelines fall within the framework set by the Refugees Act.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>25. Subsidiary legislation 420.06 of 22 November 2005 transposes into national law 
</p>
<p>Council of the European Union Directive 2003/9/EC, which lays down minimum standards 
</p>
<p>for the reception of asylum seekers in member States.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National institutions and policies 
</b></p>
<p>26. A number of Government departments and agencies, discussed below, have a role in 
</p>
<p>developing and implementing the migration policies of Malta and related issues. 
</p>
<p>27. The Ministry for Home Affairs and National Security is responsible for the overall 
</p>
<p>development of immigration and asylum policies. It coordinates operations in relation to 
</p>
<p>irregular migration and asylum and manages a number of other agencies relevant to 
</p>
<p>migration in its portfolio, including the Central Visa Unit, which issues visas, and the 
</p>
<p>armed forces.  
</p>
<p>28. The Ministry for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties is 
</p>
<p>responsible for the integration of migrants into Maltese communities. The inclusion of 
</p>
<p>integration of migrants in the portfolio of the Ministry is a new development following the 
</p>
<p>general elections in 2013 and the growing prominence of migration issues. 
</p>
<p>29. The Ministry for Education and Employment is responsible for all issues relating to 
</p>
<p>labour market issues and migrants. It also implements a policy that allows for certain 
</p>
<p>categories of migrants to apply for an exemption from the payment of tuition fees in State 
</p>
<p>educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>30. The Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government is responsible for ensuring 
</p>
<p>the full implementation of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and legal aid. 
</p>
<p>31. According to article 13 (3) of the Refugees Act, unaccompanied minors under the 
</p>
<p>age of 18 are protected with a care order under the Children and Young Persons (Care </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Orders) Act. This gives the Minister for Family and Social Solidarity responsibility for care 
</p>
<p>and custody and ensures, through an advisory board set-up, that a care plan for each minor 
</p>
<p>is prepared, and that unaccompanied minors are protected and cared for on a psychosocial 
</p>
<p>level. Unaccompanied minors are also provided with temporary humanitarian protection 
</p>
<p>until the age of 18. A legal guardian is appointed for the purpose of the asylum 
</p>
<p>determination interview. 
</p>
<p>32. The following bodies are under the Ministry for Home Affairs and National 
</p>
<p>Security: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers was established by subsidiary 
</p>
<p>legislation 217.11 of 2009 to implement the national policy relating to the welfare of 
</p>
<p>refugees.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Children and Young Persons Advisory Board assesses the conditions of 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied minors and reports to the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum 
</p>
<p>Seekers. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Detention Services agency supports border control by providing detention 
</p>
<p>accommodation for irregular migrants while their claims to stay are considered or 
</p>
<p>their removal is facilitated. Its mandate includes overseeing the operation of all 
</p>
<p>closed accommodation centres, providing secure but humane accommodation for 
</p>
<p>detained persons and maintaining a safe and secure environment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Board of Visitors for Detained Persons was established by subsidiary legislation 
</p>
<p>217.08. The Board monitors the treatment of detainees and acts as the national 
</p>
<p>preventive mechanism for the prevention of torture under the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
</p>
<p>or Punishment.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Police Special Branch, Immigration Section, is responsible for the 
</p>
<p>apprehension, investigation, identification and removal of illegally staying 
</p>
<p>foreigners, and also has a role to play in border control, having officers at entry 
</p>
<p>points, including airports and at ports and terminals in Valletta, Msida, Mgarr and 
</p>
<p>Gozo. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Armed Forces of Malta conduct air and maritime border surveillance and play a 
</p>
<p>key role in coordinating and undertaking search and rescue operations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Office of the Refugee Commissioner was established by the Refugees Act. It is 
</p>
<p>responsible for the enforcement of Dublin procedures and the determination of 
</p>
<p>asylum and other protection visas in the first instance.  
</p>
<p>33. There are two appeal boards: one for asylum seekers and another for migrants, the 
</p>
<p>mandates for which are set out in subsidiary legislation 420.04 of 15 February 2005, 
</p>
<p>entitled &#8220;Refugee Appeals Board (Chambers) Rules&#8221; and subsidiary legislation 420.06. The 
</p>
<p>boards review appeals to decisions on refugee and migration status.  
</p>
<p>34. The Refugees Appeals Board has a low appeal rate; 96.4 per cent of applications are 
</p>
<p>rejected at the time of submission. The Refugee Appeals Board (Chambers) Rules governs 
</p>
<p>the procedures of the Board.  
</p>
<p>35. A migrant detainee can currently challenge the duration but not the reasonableness 
</p>
<p>of detention before the Immigration Appeals Board, in accordance with the Immigration 
</p>
<p>Act. However, planned amendments to article 25A (10) of the Immigration Act would 
</p>
<p>allow for a challenge against the issuance of a detention order. The hearings before the 
</p>
<p>Immigration Appeals Board are conducted in a similar manner to those held before the 
</p>
<p>national courts. Individuals may be assisted by a lawyer, evidence is heard by the Board 
</p>
<p>and submissions are made by the parties. The appellant is also given the opportunity to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>make oral or written submissions. It should also be noted that the members of the Board are 
</p>
<p>part-time and enjoy security of tenure, with a view to ensuring the independence of the 
</p>
<p>Board.  
</p>
<p><b> D. European Union influence on national laws, policies and institutions in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the sphere of migration management and border control 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Schengen system 
</b></p>
<p>36. Malta implemented the Schengen acquis in 2007, making the country a key point of 
</p>
<p>entry into the European Union Schengen area. Membership in the Schengen area puts 
</p>
<p>pressure on Malta to focus on the security-related aspects of irregular migration rather than 
</p>
<p>the human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p>37. Under the Schengen system, any irregular migrant who is registered in Malta will be 
</p>
<p>returned to Malta, even if they move to another country within the European Union. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur observes that, for undocumented and irregular migrants, this can create 
</p>
<p>a situation where irregular migrants become stuck in Malta; in particular those without 
</p>
<p>documents often become trapped in Malta, as they are unable to travel to other countries 
</p>
<p>within the European Union or safely return home. 
</p>
<p>38. There are a number of European Union directives on reception of, asylum for and 
</p>
<p>detention of migrants within member countries. The most prominent of those are discussed 
</p>
<p>below.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Dublin III regulation 
</b></p>
<p>39. Following heavy criticism of the Dublin II regulation, including the greater pressure 
</p>
<p>it put on front-line European Union member States, Regulation No. 604/2013 of the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union (the Dublin III regulation) 
</p>
<p>came into force on 1 January 2014. The new regulation provides enhanced safeguards for 
</p>
<p>applicants for international protection in Europe, including a provision that stipulates that, 
</p>
<p>while waiting for a decision on his or her appeal, a person has the right to remain in the 
</p>
<p>country (a suspensive right of appeal), and a clause designed to prevent breaches of human 
</p>
<p>rights whereby, a State is not permitted to transfer a person to another European Union 
</p>
<p>member State if there is a risk that he or she would be subjected to inhuman and degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment in that member States. This means that States will be obliged to undertake their 
</p>
<p>own assessment of the situation rather than continue to apply the Dublin regulations on 
</p>
<p>returning migrants, unless the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice take a decision to the contrary.  
</p>
<p>40. The Dublin III regulation introduces an early warning mechanism, which is aimed at 
</p>
<p>making it easier to detect problems in a member State&#8217;s asylum system so that the European 
</p>
<p>Union Commission and the European Asylum Support Office can provide early assistance 
</p>
<p>before the situation degenerates. The regulation contains an emphasis on respect for family 
</p>
<p>life, including provisions to ensure that transfers under Dublin III facilitate family unity as 
</p>
<p>much as possible. It also widens the definition of the family to benefit unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>minors, who can now be reunited with grandparents, uncles or aunts living in a European 
</p>
<p>Union member State. Additionally, during personal interviews, officials are required to 
</p>
<p>inform applicants that they may provide information about family members in other 
</p>
<p>European Union member States, which will be taken into account in the determination as to 
</p>
<p>which State is responsible. The Dublin III regulation also provides for the production of a 
</p>
<p>common information leaflet on Dublin and a specific leaflet for unaccompanied minors.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>41. Despite the improvements within the Dublin system, the Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned about a number of issues relating to how these regulations affect the human 
</p>
<p>rights of migrants in Malta.  
</p>
<p>42. A key feature of the Dublin system is that, under Regulation No. 603/2013 of the 
</p>
<p>European Union, migrants entering the European Union are fingerprinted to ensure that 
</p>
<p>their asylum claim is processed in the correct member State in accordance with the system. 
</p>
<p>If migrants attempt to enter another European Union member State, they are returned to 
</p>
<p>where it has been deemed their application should be made &#8212; usually the first country of 
</p>
<p>entry. Migrants often do not want to have their fingerprints taken because, as discussed 
</p>
<p>above, they have plans to travel to other countries in Europe.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur learned that irregular migrants who arrive by boat to Malta 
</p>
<p>sometimes refuse to be fingerprinted, making it difficult for border guards to effectively 
</p>
<p>and systematically implement the Dublin system, especially when large groups refuse to be 
</p>
<p>fingerprinted and photographed. There have been instances when a degree of force has been 
</p>
<p>used. The Special Rapporteur observed that Malta should refrain from using any form of 
</p>
<p>physical force against migrants who have not committed any crime, when implementing 
</p>
<p>identification mechanisms, such as fingerprinting. Migrants are reluctant to comply with the 
</p>
<p>identification mechanisms because of the consequences attached to such identification, in 
</p>
<p>particular the inability to move beyond the European country responsible for their entry and 
</p>
<p>the prohibition on claiming asylum in the country of their choice. This is especially true as 
</p>
<p>some European Union member States have made little use of the family reunification 
</p>
<p>clause, the humanitarian clause and the sovereignty clause, which could enhance the 
</p>
<p>mobility of migrants throughout Europe.  
</p>
<p>44. Additionally, the Dublin Unit is understaffed and cannot deal efficiently with Dublin 
</p>
<p>cases or be effective in making the most of provisions such as those of family reunification. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the Dublin system remains a challenge for 
</p>
<p>the Government because, despite Malta&#8217;s small size as compared to other European Union 
</p>
<p>member States, the country remains responsible for all those who arrive on its shores by 
</p>
<p>boat. The Special Rapporteur observes that the Dublin system places extensive 
</p>
<p>responsibility for migration control on front-line states such as Malta which have limited 
</p>
<p>financial, technical and human resources to implement its procedures, especially at a time 
</p>
<p>when irregular migration is at its highest.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur observes that, in effect, the Dublin logic is already buckling, 
</p>
<p>with the realization that the return of migrants to the front-line countries of Europe 
</p>
<p>constitutes a punishment for both the migrant and the front-line countries to which they 
</p>
<p>return: it is unsustainable in the long term. Instead of ineffective prohibitions, repressive 
</p>
<p>policies and lengthy procedures, Europe must deploy incentives for migrants to use legal 
</p>
<p>procedures, including for family reunification, and ensure the mobility of those migrants 
</p>
<p>throughout the common European territory, thus allowing them to live where they will find 
</p>
<p>the best employment opportunities and integration conditions, as is already the case for 
</p>
<p>European citizens.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Directive 2008/115/EC  
</b></p>
<p>46. Directive No. 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the 
</p>
<p>European Union covers, inter alia, the obligation to return irregular migrants, their 
</p>
<p>treatment during expulsion proceedings, entry bans, procedural rights and the grounds and 
</p>
<p>conditions for detention. It notably sets the maximum detention period for irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants at 18 months. The Directive includes provisions that encourage European Union 
</p>
<p>member States to explore alternatives to detention. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Directive 2003/9/EC  
</b></p>
<p>47. Council of the European Union Directive 2003/9/EC establishes minimum standards 
</p>
<p>for the reception of asylum seekers and harmonizes conditions provided across European 
</p>
<p>Union member States. It provides guarantees to asylum seekers, including: accommodation, 
</p>
<p>food and clothing, in kind or in the form of a financial allowance; family unity; medical and 
</p>
<p>psychological care; access to the education system for minor children and language courses 
</p>
<p>to enable them to attend ordinary school; and rehabilitation programmes and post-traumatic 
</p>
<p>counselling for victims of torture or violence. It also imposes on European Union member 
</p>
<p>States a duty to inform asylum seekers of their rights and to allow for freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement within the country.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Border management 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rescue at sea 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Armed Forces of Malta coordinate all search and rescue operations in the Malta 
</p>
<p>search and rescue region. This support varies from timely information sharing to the 
</p>
<p>availability of aerial or naval assets. In addition, Italy has a search and rescue helicopter 
</p>
<p>based and operating from Malta as part of the Italian military support mission in Malta. 
</p>
<p>Malta also has formal search and rescue cooperation agreements with Greece, Italy, Libya 
</p>
<p>and the United States of America, namely, the United States Navy and the United States 
</p>
<p>Coast Guard forces in the Mediterranean. Malta also liaises with Tunisia, on an informal 
</p>
<p>operational level, on search and rescue issues.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the considerable impact of migration on 
</p>
<p>the human and technical resources of the Armed Forces. Individuals spend extended hours 
</p>
<p>on duty and at a much higher level of readiness than was the case in the past. The effect on 
</p>
<p>the vessels operated by the Armed Forces has also been considerable, insofar as routine 
</p>
<p>maintenance activities have to be conducted in compressed timelines and sometimes 
</p>
<p>deferred owing to operational commitments.  
</p>
<p>50. Malta faces many challenges with regard to search and rescue, such as: having a vast 
</p>
<p>search and rescue area relative to its size; overlap with the search and rescue zone of Italy, 
</p>
<p>causing confusion regarding responsibilities and tension with Italy related to interfaces 
</p>
<p>between their two search and rescue systems; a lack of support from other European Union 
</p>
<p>member States in tackling the pressures within its search and rescue zone; inadequate 
</p>
<p>management of the search and rescue zones by countries of origin, such as Libya; and 
</p>
<p>confusion about where people rescued at sea should disembark. Reportedly, Malta has 
</p>
<p>sometimes been unable to respond effectively to distress calls or has not allowed rescued 
</p>
<p>migrants to disembark on Maltese territory. However, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
</p>
<p>the extreme vulnerability of migrants at sea, and underlines the importance of Malta 
</p>
<p>upholding its obligations under international law in relation to search and rescue.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur learned that the Armed Forces has updated its search and 
</p>
<p>rescue software and programmes and has increased its training and its aerial and naval 
</p>
<p>assets through projects co-financed by the European Union, which help in conducting 
</p>
<p>rescue operations.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Merchant vessels  
</b></p>
<p>52. Private vessels cooperate with the Government and sometimes carry out the search 
</p>
<p>and rescue. This is at their own financial cost, which can create disincentives to participate. 
</p>
<p>In February 2015, the International Maritime Organization underlined that the support </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>provided to search and rescue operations by merchant vessels should remain exceptional, 
</p>
<p>and that States should shoulder the main responsibility of fielding sufficient search and 
</p>
<p>rescue capacity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Migrant Offshore Aid Station  
</b></p>
<p>53. In April 2014, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station was established by private 
</p>
<p>individuals as a response to the increasing numbers of deaths at sea. It is based in Malta and 
</p>
<p>assists Rescue Coordination Centres in the Mediterranean to conduct search and rescue 
</p>
<p>operations. In 2014, the Station saved 3,000 people. It is currently working with M&#233;decins 
</p>
<p>sans frontiers-Amsterdam to provide humanitarian support to people rescued. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation on border management 
</b></p>
<p>54. The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the 
</p>
<p>External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) supports Malta 
</p>
<p>in managing its external borders and helps strengthen the country&#8217;s search and rescue 
</p>
<p>capacity through the provision of air assets and other vessels to enable the country to more 
</p>
<p>easily carry out rescue operations safely at sea. Regulation 656/2014 of the European 
</p>
<p>Parliament and of the Council on surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of 
</p>
<p>operational cooperation coordinated by FRONTEX was adopted in 2014, aimed at 
</p>
<p>resolving confusion arising from diverging national interpretations of international 
</p>
<p>provisions on maritime surveillance. The Regulation sets out clear rules for FRONTEX 
</p>
<p>joint operations at sea, including with respect to the interception of vessels during joint 
</p>
<p>operations at sea, search and rescue situations and the disembarkation of intercepted or 
</p>
<p>rescued migrants. The Special Rapporteur received conflicting information as to whether 
</p>
<p>the regulation has actually been able to resolve confusion and incoherence in search and 
</p>
<p>rescue systems.  
</p>
<p><b>  Operation Triton  
</b></p>
<p>55. In November 2014, the FRONTEX Joint Operation Triton was formed in order to 
</p>
<p>take over from the Italian operation Mare Nostrum. Joint Operation Triton covers the 
</p>
<p>search and rescue zones of Italy and Malta with the support of the countries&#8217; naval assets. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Bilateral agreements 
</b></p>
<p>56. Malta has readmission agreements with Albania and Montenegro, as well as with 
</p>
<p>Kosovo. It has memorandums of understanding on migration matters with the Governments 
</p>
<p>of Burkina Faso, Gambia and Nigeria, which allow for Malta to return nationals of those 
</p>
<p>countries.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur was informed that these agreements all have specific articles 
</p>
<p>dedicated to guarantees for the human rights of migrants. However, he remains concerned 
</p>
<p>about the lack of monitoring of the implementation of such agreements. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Resettlement programmes  
</b></p>
<p>58. A number of countries both within and outside the European Union have offered 
</p>
<p>assistance to Malta in managing the needs of those who have been granted asylum or 
</p>
<p>subsidiary protection. While people&#8217;s experiences of resettlement programmes are reported 
</p>
<p>to be positive, the number of places are limited and it is unclear what criteria is used for 
</p>
<p>selection.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 1. EUREMA  
</b></p>
<p>59. In 2009, in order to release the pressure put on Malta by the Dublin system, the 
</p>
<p>European Union member States and other European countries began a pilot resettlement 
</p>
<p>project (EUREMA) to transfer recognized refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary 
</p>
<p>protection from Malta to the countries that had volunteered to assist. The programme was 
</p>
<p>renewed in April 2011 and 15 countries pledged to resettle 356 people. 
</p>
<p>60. People wishing to benefit from the EUREMA project first undergo a pre-screening 
</p>
<p>process with UNHCR, then they are assessed by a panel, set up by the countries providing 
</p>
<p>support, for referral. If an applicant is formally referred, he or she is interviewed by 
</p>
<p>representatives of missions sent from the expected destination country. If applicants are 
</p>
<p>successful, funding is provided to support resettlement.2  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Refugee programme of the United States of America 
</b></p>
<p>61. Since 2008, the United States has had a resettlement agreement with Malta that is 
</p>
<p>run by IOM and UNHCR; the country has taken more than 2,000 people who were granted 
</p>
<p>protection status in Malta. Many asylum seekers would prefer to obtain subsidiary 
</p>
<p>protection rather than refugee status, so as to improve their chances for gaining access to 
</p>
<p>this resettlement programme (people with subsidiary protection are given priority as they 
</p>
<p>have no access to family reunification or citizenship in Malta). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Returns 
</b></p>
<p>62. There were 71 forced returns in 2013, and 92 in 2014. The Board of Visitors for 
</p>
<p>Detained Persons reportedly monitors forced returns during the pre-departure and departure 
</p>
<p>stages to ensure the escorts adhere to the procedures. However, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>stresses that an independent body should conduct monitoring. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur received information that constraints on government 
</p>
<p>capacity to forcibly return rejected asylum seekers leads to their being kept in detention 
</p>
<p>facilities for 18 months before being released into society without sufficient support in the 
</p>
<p>form of social protection. Their lack of a long-term visa exacerbates difficulties finding 
</p>
<p>work and they are left living in fear of being forcibly returned or are vulnerable to abuse 
</p>
<p>and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur was informed that legislative amendments to the Common 
</p>
<p>Standards and Procedures for Returning Illegally Staying Third-Country Nationals 
</p>
<p>Regulations allow for a periodic review of the grounds of detention for irregular migrants 
</p>
<p>awaiting forced returns. The review is conducted either on application or ex officio by the 
</p>
<p>Principal Immigration Officer at reasonable intervals of time, which should not exceed 
</p>
<p>three months. In the case of detention periods of six months or more, the Principal 
</p>
<p>Immigration Officer is to carry out the review and notify the Refugee Appeals Board which 
</p>
<p>is to supervise and, where necessary, revise such review. The Special Rapporteur received 
</p>
<p>information questioning the effectiveness and efficiency of this procedure. It is also not 
</p>
<p>clear how forced returns are conducted, especially in cases where people are arrested while 
</p>
<p>at work or in the night and then returned.

</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Assisted voluntary return 
</b></p>
<p>65. Since 2006, migrants have systematically been offered the option for voluntary 
</p>
<p>return through projects implemented in partnership with IOM. 
</p>
<p>66. IOM visits detention centres in order to inform migrants of assisted voluntary return 
</p>
<p>opportunities. However, few take those opportunities. There were reportedly 55 assisted 
</p>
<p>voluntary returns in 2013, while in 2014, as at November, there had been 69. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that assisted voluntary return programmes are useful, although when 
</p>
<p>offered to migrants in detention they should not automatically be termed &#8220;voluntary&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>67. An initiative linking the amount of money offered to the date at which migrants 
</p>
<p>accept to be part of an assisted voluntary return programme &#8212; the more they wait, the 
</p>
<p>smaller the amount &#8212; has not been an effective incentive for migrants to use such 
</p>
<p>programmes soon after their arrival. This trial initiative should be abolished and a standard 
</p>
<p>amount for assisted voluntary return should be restored. Migrants who participate must 
</p>
<p>have a business plan in order to benefit from the funds offered; however, there is no 
</p>
<p>effective or consistent monitoring system for these programmes. 
</p>
<p>68. IOM has also repatriated unaccompanied minors after confirming that it was in their 
</p>
<p>best interests to be returned. During the visit, there were nine Egyptian unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>minors who wanted to be returned.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Detention of migrants, and reception centres 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandatory detention 
</b></p>
<p>69. All irregular migrants who arrive in Malta are detained upon arrival, with the 
</p>
<p>exception of children, following a policy decision by the Government in April 2014. The 
</p>
<p>Immigration Police collect basic biographical data of those on the boat and attempt to 
</p>
<p>identify vulnerable groups, such as young children, people with disabilities or people with 
</p>
<p>physical and mental health problems.  
</p>
<p>70. The immigration authorities in Malta systematically issue removal orders to all 
</p>
<p>irregular migrants. The removal orders issued typically refer to the lack of means to sustain 
</p>
<p>themselves or to their irregular entry. The irregular migrants are typically not informed of 
</p>
<p>the considerations leading to the removal order, or given an opportunity to present 
</p>
<p>information, documentation and/or other evidence in support of a request for a period of 
</p>
<p>voluntary departure. They are consequently held in detention for maximum period of 
</p>
<p>18 months until they are granted protection status or until they are to be removed from 
</p>
<p>Malta. Migrants can appeal to the Immigration Appeals Board only within three working 
</p>
<p>days from the date of the issuance of the order. The appeal can be done verbally or in 
</p>
<p>writing. The Board can grant the migrant provisional release from detention while it 
</p>
<p>considers the case. If the order is revoked, the migrant is released from detention. 
</p>
<p>71. As discussed above, migrants and asylum seekers are often victims of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations throughout their journey. Upon arrival in Malta, they are often traumatized by 
</p>
<p>their migratory experience &#8212; some do not even remember the details of their first few days 
</p>
<p>after arrival. They need time to rest, ponder their situation, get information, seek legal 
</p>
<p>advice, understand the system and consider their options before being asked to fill any form 
</p>
<p>which may prove a re-traumatizing process. Consequently, the requirement to fill out the 
</p>
<p>preliminary questionnaire immediately after they arrive in Malta, although useful for border 
</p>
<p>officials, might be counterproductive in meeting the protection needs for irregular migrants.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>72. Although irregular migration is not criminalized legally, the practice of mandatory 
</p>
<p>detention has the unfortunate result of portraying the migrants as dangerous criminals who 
</p>
<p>should be locked up immediately upon arrival for the safety of the wider public. There is no 
</p>
<p>evidence that any of the migrants who came to Malta over the years has ever constituted a 
</p>
<p>general public security risk. Mandatory detention consequently serves only to inspire in the 
</p>
<p>Maltese general population a feeling of fear and distrust against the migrants and asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers. This climate of fear unfortunately goes on to taint the policies and programmes put 
</p>
<p>in place by Maltese authorities and the relationship between migrants, asylum seekers and 
</p>
<p>Maltese citizens.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Types of accommodation 
</b></p>
<p>73. Hal Safi and Lyster barracks are detention centres that hold irregular migrants. Both 
</p>
<p>centres are located on military bases and subject to military jurisdiction. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned that migrants are accommodated in military barracks, and urges 
</p>
<p>the Government to develop alternatives to this type of detention.  
</p>
<p>74. Those who receive protection visas are housed in open centres, some of which are 
</p>
<p>large and can accommodate a total of 2,000 people. Others are of a more modest size, 
</p>
<p>housing about 40 people, making it easier for the integration of the migrants into society. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>75. Since Lyster was closed, the Special Rapporteur only visited Hal Safi, which can 
</p>
<p>accommodate 1,200 people. During the visit, it was accommodating only 32 male detainees 
</p>
<p>in its main facility. Many of those migrants, who had all arrived by boat, were Nigerians, 
</p>
<p>Gambians, Chadians and Ghanaians. Reportedly, the youngest was 17. In addition, there 
</p>
<p>was reportedly a Nigerian couple who had been detained for seven months in a mobile 
</p>
<p>home facility within the centre. The Special Rapporteur was unable to meet with them; he 
</p>
<p>was informed that they were sick and had been taken to hospital.  
</p>
<p>76. All migrants detained at Hal Safi had been informed of their rights and had 
</p>
<p>reportedly applied for asylum, but had been rejected without explanation; they were in 
</p>
<p>limbo, uncertain about their future. This uncertainty causes insomnia, stress and depression. 
</p>
<p>Incidences of violence, attempted suicide and self-harm have occurred when detainees 
</p>
<p>receive news of their rejection for asylum.  
</p>
<p>77. The situation of asylum seekers requiring psychiatric treatment is a growing 
</p>
<p>concern. The Special Rapporteur learned that they are sometimes placed in the same 
</p>
<p>institution as prisoners and drug users. They are handcuffed to their beds or locked in a 
</p>
<p>room, are rarely allowed to shower, and lack regular medical visits. Of even greater concern 
</p>
<p>are reports that doctors also question the extent to which their professional responsibility 
</p>
<p>extends towards irregular migrants.  
</p>
<p>78. Some detainees are released and given identity cards with the proviso that, if there is 
</p>
<p>a problem, they will be returned to the detention centre. Those still at Hal Safi hoped that 
</p>
<p>the same would happen to them. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur found that the detention centre lacked: personal space and 
</p>
<p>privacy for migrants; potable water, which forced detainees to buy drinking water; adequate 
</p>
<p>and decent-quality food; and adequate access to health care. While at Hal Safi, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur noted that television-watching is the only recreational activity available. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, detainees are allowed outside only for one hour per day, and thereby lack any </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>physical activity, despite the fact that there is an outdoor fenced space that can be used by 
</p>
<p>detainees.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the publication of the findings, also known as the 
</p>
<p>Valenzia report,3 of the independent inquiry into the death of Mamadou Kamara, a 32-year-
</p>
<p>old Malian, while in detention in Safi. He had tried to escape from a detention facility, was 
</p>
<p>severely mistreated when recaptured and died from his injuries. Two officers were charged 
</p>
<p>with murder and one for perverting the course of justice. This serves to demonstrate that all 
</p>
<p>shall be held accountable in the protection of the rights of migrants. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also looks forward to the implementation of the inquiry&#8217;s findings with regard to improving 
</p>
<p>detention conditions.  
</p>
<p>81. The Government uses open reception centres as alternatives to detention. Asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers do not receive adequate individual support and are not provided with 
</p>
<p>comprehensive information about their rights, asylum procedures, appeals and removal, nor 
</p>
<p>do they receive legal assistance. They frequently lack information about how to gain access 
</p>
<p>to social services and contact support organizations.  
</p>
<p>82. The Balzan open centre is a small facility that accommodates families. Some have 
</p>
<p>stayed there for more than 18 months. Although all are allowed to work, some are not able 
</p>
<p>to get jobs and instead receive a monthly allowance. Those who work are in the hospitality 
</p>
<p>industry and earn an average of &#8364;4.60 an hour and are required to pay taxes and insurance. 
</p>
<p>They are provided with free accommodation and access to education for their children. 
</p>
<p>Access to health care is available but sometimes limited by obstacles relating to language 
</p>
<p>and accessible information. There are no dedicated interpreters in this centre and migrants 
</p>
<p>rely on each other for translation. There are communal cooking, cleaning and sanitary 
</p>
<p>facilities.  
</p>
<p>83. The Hal Far Tent Village open centre was originally designated for single men but 
</p>
<p>now also accommodates single women and families with children. Similar nationalities are 
</p>
<p>kept together to avoid tensions. Those with refugee status and subsidiary protection get a 
</p>
<p>daily allowance of &#8364;4.60 and one meal per day. The sanitary facilities for men and women 
</p>
<p>are located side by side and are not well lit, increasing the feeling of unsafety for children 
</p>
<p>and women. There is insufficient hot water and the water is non-potable, so bottled water 
</p>
<p>for drinking must be bought, as is the norm in Malta. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Special categories of detainees 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some vulnerable persons are not subject 
</p>
<p>to detention, and may only be detained pending medical clearance. During such time, 
</p>
<p>access to health and other necessary services are made available. Furthermore, a group of 
</p>
<p>professionals known as the Care Team, comprising social workers and welfare officers, is 
</p>
<p>in place, to which persons with specific needs can be referred for individual assessment, 
</p>
<p>follow-up and interventions.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Minors 
</b></p>
<p>85. Most children who arrive with their families are quickly moved from detention 
</p>
<p>facilities to open centres. In the past, unaccompanied minors have been detained for longer 
</p>
<p>periods for age determination. While in detention, unaccompanied minors live and sleep in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The inquiry was headed by retired judge Geoffrey Valenzia. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>the same areas as adults, without any special accommodation for their young age and 
</p>
<p>without access to education. 
</p>
<p>86. Age determination is now carried out within three days of arrival. A primarily 
</p>
<p>psychosocial approach is used, with the aim of reducing the number of children subjected to 
</p>
<p>intrusive bone density procedures. The Special Rapporteur urges that full interviews with a 
</p>
<p>psychologist be conducted with a child representative present. There should be room for the 
</p>
<p>benefit of doubt, as owing to fear and uncertainty children may say that they are adults 
</p>
<p>when in actual fact they are still minors. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur notes that if there are over 500 arrivals, the systems struggle 
</p>
<p>to cope and to undertake timely age determination processes for all. In order to improve age 
</p>
<p>assessments, the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers, which conducts the 
</p>
<p>assessments, is consulting with Aditus, the Jesuit Refugee Service and UNHCR with regard 
</p>
<p>to developing other procedural safeguards, such as appeals against the age assessment 
</p>
<p>decisions. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur visited the Santa Venera open centre, which was 
</p>
<p>accommodating 12 boys, all under the age of 17. All children who arrive at the centre are 
</p>
<p>educated until the age of 16. However, the Special Rapporteur learned that some children 
</p>
<p>do not like to attend classes, since they have difficulties with the language and culture. 
</p>
<p>Some attend vocational training courses. The boys reported that the facilities did not have 
</p>
<p>potable water or sufficient food. They are allowed to go outside for defined periods and are 
</p>
<p>able to get cleaning jobs, and receive &#8364;8 per week in pocket money. They have very little 
</p>
<p>activity to occupy them and have English lessons once a week. At the time of the visit, only 
</p>
<p>two boys were going to English classes, as the others wanted to return to their countries of 
</p>
<p>origin and therefore did not want to invest in staying in Malta. They seemed scared about 
</p>
<p>their situation and uncertain about their future. At age 17, children are moved from Santa 
</p>
<p>Venera to open centres that accommodate adults. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to justice  
</b></p>
<p>89. Overall, there is a general concern among irregular migrants in detention and open 
</p>
<p>centres that some nationalities are favoured over others in relation to asylum claims. The 
</p>
<p>system by which migrants are awarded refugee status or some other subsidiary protection is 
</p>
<p>not perceived as transparent and leaves migrants frustrated and mistrustful of government 
</p>
<p>officials, as well as of international organizations and civil society organizations on 
</p>
<p>occasion. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take the measures necessary to 
</p>
<p>ensure transparency and provide substantive grounds when awarding protection or rejecting 
</p>
<p>claims and clarity about the duration of the process for acquiring protection. 
</p>
<p>90. There are a number of other issues relating to access to justice which are of concern 
</p>
<p>to the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Detention appeals 
</b></p>
<p>91. Under the Immigration Act, detention may be appealed to the Immigration Appeals 
</p>
<p>Board within three days of the issuance of the removal order, or where detention is 
</p>
<p>&#8220;unreasonable&#8221; pending an asylum application. The sittings before the Board are conducted 
</p>
<p>in a manner similar to those held before the national courts. A lawyer provided by means of 
</p>
<p>legal aid may assist individuals. Board members enjoy security of tenure, with a view to 
</p>
<p>ensuring their independence. The Board may not authorize release when the identity of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>applicant has yet to be established, for example, when the applicant does not have travel or 
</p>
<p>identification documents, as is the case of most migrants reaching Malta by boat.  
</p>
<p>92. This limited appeal system is not sufficient to meet international standards, as 
</p>
<p>recognized by the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Massoud </i>v.<i> Malta</i>, which ruled that 
</p>
<p>Malta had breached article 5.4 of the European Convention on Human Rights by not 
</p>
<p>providing adequate legal recourse to challenge detention. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Asylum appeals 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Refugee Appeals Board, the asylum 
</p>
<p>appeal mechanism, comprises five chambers. The Board members are not all trained in 
</p>
<p>immigration law or the migration policies of Malta. Some chambers are more effective than 
</p>
<p>others and there is no effective coordination among the chambers, which results in 
</p>
<p>inconsistency in procedures, process and case rulings, and the absence of development of a 
</p>
<p>coherent case law.  
</p>
<p>94. All asylum seekers whose application is being processed at first instance by the 
</p>
<p>Refugee Appeals Board have the right to have access to legal assistance at any stage of the 
</p>
<p>procedure.4 The legal aid is provided in accordance with an agreement between the 
</p>
<p>Government and the Malta Bar Association. Reportedly, however, lawyers do not necessary 
</p>
<p>have solid knowledge of asylum and immigration law and, as such, whenever possible, 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations provide assistance in legal proceedings and in some cases 
</p>
<p>may, at their own personal cost, hire private legal counsel. The Special Rapporteur stresses 
</p>
<p>that asylum seekers and their legal representatives should consistently, without prompting, 
</p>
<p>be provided with a copy of their case file in sufficient time prior to their appeal, as well as 
</p>
<p>with competent legal aid. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur received information about the exploitation, by employers in 
</p>
<p>Malta, of irregular migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, who refrain from protesting and 
</p>
<p>mobilizing due to their fear of being detected, detained and deported. Migrant workers in an 
</p>
<p>irregular situation are made to work long hours and paid less than the minimum wage in 
</p>
<p>Malta, often in the construction, tourism and caregiving industries. They have to pay taxes 
</p>
<p>but do not all share the same rights as citizens. For example, employers often give migrants 
</p>
<p>lower wages and do not provide them with required safety equipment or insurance.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur learned that government contractors and subcontractors are 
</p>
<p>prohibited from exploiting workers, including migrants. Those found exploiting workers 
</p>
<p>are blacklisted and cannot get a government contract for three years. However, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur observed that sanctions against employers are rare, and the directive of the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament and of the Council of Europe on sanctions against employers remains 
</p>
<p>unimplemented in Malta, as is the case throughout Europe.  
</p>
<p>97. There are currently 20 labour inspectors who work together with the Immigration 
</p>
<p>Police. Although labour inspectors are not empowered to check immigration papers, it is 
</p>
<p>not clear whether they conduct operations with the Immigration Police; that would be a 
</p>
<p>very bad practice, as it would not provide incentives for migrants to call labour inspectors 
</p>
<p>or health and safety inspectors when work conditions are unsafe or in violation of labour 
</p>
<p>laws. There is a need for firewalls between public service and immigration enforcement, so 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Directive 2005/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, art. 15 (1), implemented by 
</p>
<p>Maltese law through Legal Notice 243 of 2008, para. 7 (1). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>that labour inspections can be carried out without having to divulge anyone&#8217;s immigration 
</p>
<p>status. 
</p>
<p>98. Migrant workers are workers, whatever their immigration status, and should be 
</p>
<p>treated equally under labour laws. Furthermore, it is important that Malta acknowledges 
</p>
<p>that it has jobs for which it needs migrant workers, including low-wage migrants, and thus 
</p>
<p>considers opening legal channels for migrants of all skill levels to come to Malta.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Xenophobic and discriminatory acts  
</b></p>
<p>99. There are misconceptions among the general public that all migrants and asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers are criminals or diseased and are taking away jobs belonging to Maltese. Senior 
</p>
<p>government officials fuel this rhetoric publicly. There is also growing anti-Islamism and 
</p>
<p>fear. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in his discussions with the police, he was informed 
</p>
<p>that crime figures had not changed. 
</p>
<p>100. Amendments under the Criminal Code were made in order to prohibit and penalize 
</p>
<p>racially motivated crimes involving racial hatred, and the promotion of violence against 
</p>
<p>persons or groups on the grounds of, inter alia, national or ethnic origin or citizenship. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes that the anti-xenophobia and anti-discrimination laws of Malta are 
</p>
<p>rarely enforced, and that the State needs to ensure that the prohibition of such acts on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of nationality and citizenship is explicit in those laws.  
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur notes that the National Commission for the Promotion of 
</p>
<p>Equality has carried out various initiatives to counter racism and xenophobia and to raise 
</p>
<p>further awareness of equal treatment on the grounds of religion and belief as well as race 
</p>
<p>and ethnic origin. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Integration within Malta 
</b></p>
<p>102. Asylum seekers and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection have access to free 
</p>
<p>national education and health care. However, for many beneficiaries of international 
</p>
<p>protection, pursuing further education is impossible without additional financial assistance. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to offer a financial support loan scheme for 
</p>
<p>those beneficiaries pursing further education. Furthermore, extra targeted language support 
</p>
<p>would be useful for the children of asylum seekers and refugees. 
</p>
<p>103. Many migrants find it hard to integrate into Maltese society. They experience 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and racism, can be subject to discrimination in relation to recruitment, pay and 
</p>
<p>conditions within the workforce and experience uncertainty around their legal capacity to 
</p>
<p>stay. Many migrants desire to move on to other European countries, which exacerbates a 
</p>
<p>systemic view of migrants as a temporary problem and reinforces barriers to integration.  
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative of the Ministry for Social Dialogue, 
</p>
<p>Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties, which has, in collaboration with migrants, developed 
</p>
<p>a website on integration, available in seven languages. He was also informed that a new 
</p>
<p>directorate for integration will be established. It will implement a migration integration 
</p>
<p>strategy, deal with complaints concerning equal treatment and have investigative powers, 
</p>
<p>thereby enabling it to visit detention centres. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the 
</p>
<p>plans by the Ministry to establish an integration unit to address vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p>including migrants.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Migration cannot be seen only through the lens of a border security operation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially with recent arrivals, many of whom were fleeing wars, violence and conflict. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Over-reliance on border security </b>&#8212;<b> which focuses on policing, defence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminality instead of a more rights-based approach </b>&#8212;<b> only serves to give a false sense 
</b></p>
<p>of control over one&#8217;s borders.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>In 2014, as a result of Mare Nostrum, the number of migrants arriving in Malta 
</b></p>
<p><b>fell significantly because, once rescued at sea, migrants were disembarked in Italy. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, the Special Rapporteur cautions that this is likely to change, and Malta 
</b></p>
<p><b>must prepare for rising numbers of migrants. He stresses that this migration 
</b></p>
<p>phenomenon must be considered as the &#8220;new normal&#8221; for the coming years. The 
</p>
<p><b>reception of such migrants and asylum seekers should not, therefore, always be 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted in an ad hoc emergency manner. The Special Rapporteur recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes be developed to build the capacity to adequately receive and process high 
</b></p>
<p><b>numbers of migrants based on a long-term vision of migration. Such programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>should include measures to provide adequate immediate assistance, offer legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>safeguards and promote integration.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur proposes several recommendations, as detailed below.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Normative and institutional framework for the protection  
</b></p>
<p><b>of the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Implement the plans to establish a national human rights institution in 
</b></p>
<p><b>line with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles), ensuring that it is both 
</b></p>
<p><b>functionally and financially independent of the Government and vested with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authority to investigate all issues relating to human rights, including those of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants, regardless of their administrative status;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Ensure the establishment of a fully independent national preventive 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism, in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which is 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandated to visit all places where migrants may be deprived of their liberty;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Border management 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Further implement a human rights-based approach to migration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>border management, ensuring that the rights of migrants, including irregular 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants, are always the first consideration;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Ensure that readmission and cooperation agreements aimed at, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia, combating irregular migration include safeguards to fully respect the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of migrants, as well as ensure adequate protection of vulnerable migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including asylum seekers, in particular with regard to the principle of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>refoulement;</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> Establish a comprehensive mechanism for the identification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unaccompanied minors that includes not only medical exams but also a psychosocial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural approach, in order to best identify specific protection measures in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>best interests of each child;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> Fully implement the relevant provisions of Regulation 656/2014 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Parliament and of the Council for all search and rescue operations 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordinated by the Malta Rescue Coordination Centre; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> Agree on criteria to identify the place of safety where people rescued at 
</b></p>
<p><b>sea should be disembarked as a matter of urgency, to render disembarkation 
</b></p>
<p><b>predictable and quick. To this end, negotiations on a memorandum of understanding 
</b></p>
<p><b>on disembarkation should be vigorously pursued within the IMO framework.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Detention and open centres 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Change laws and policies related to the administrative detention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>irregular migrants, so that detention is decided upon on a case-by-case basis and 
</b></p>
<p><b>pursuant to clearly and exhaustively defined criteria in legislation under which 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention may be resorted to, rather than being the automatic legal consequence of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision to refuse admission of entry or a removal order;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Ensure that migrants are detained only when there is a reasonable basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>to believe that they present a danger to themselves or others or would abscond from 
</b></p>
<p><b>future proceedings, and always for the shortest time possible, and that non-custodial 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures are always considered first as alternatives to detention;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> Establish places of administrative detention outside of military facilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and expeditiously take measures to transfer the detainees to the non-military facilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Such detention centres should not be managed by military staff;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> Improve the management of government centres for irregular migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>drawing from the recommendations made in the Valenzia report, the best practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>observed in the current network of reception centres and in other facilities in Europe 
</b></p>
<p><b>and around the world, and in accordance with relevant standards espoused by 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> Strengthen contingency plans to avoid overcrowding and consequent 
</b></p>
<p><b>deterioration of conditions during peak migration periods;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> Ensure that all detained migrants have access to proper medical care, 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpreters, adequate food and clothes, hygienic conditions, adequate space to move 
</b></p>
<p><b>around and access to outdoor exercise;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> Systematically inform detained migrants in writing, in a language they 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand, of the reason for their detention, its duration, their right to have access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>a lawyer, and the right to promptly challenge their detention and to seek asylum;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(h)<b> Ensure that all migrants deprived of their liberty are able to promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and easily contact their family, consular services and a lawyer, at all times and free of 
</b></p>
<p><b>charge;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(i)<b> Develop comprehensive human rights training programmes for all staff 
</b></p>
<p><b>who work in reception centres, including training that enables them to identify 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees exhibiting mental health issues or in need of protection as victims of crime, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and improve available mental health and support services in detention, based on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle of informed consent;</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(j)<b> Ensure the independent monitoring of reception centres so that they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>all brought to the same standards;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(k)<b> End the detention of unaccompanied migrant children. Additionally, 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrant children require more culture and language support to help with integration 
</b></p>
<p><b>at school and in society, more activities outside of the shelters to occupy them when 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are not in school, and monitoring, for at least one year, to ensure an easy 
</b></p>
<p><b>transition from shelters to open centres.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Ensure full and proper access to justice for all detainees, including a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more accountable system for lodging complaints within detention and reception 
</b></p>
<p><b>centres;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Ensure that all detained persons who claim protection concerns are, 
</b></p>
<p><b>without delay, adequately informed of their right to seek asylum, have access to 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>UNHCR, lawyers and civil society organizations;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> Establish a fairer and simpler system for migrant detainees to be able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge expulsion and detention orders;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> Ensure that the appeal proceedings are based on the merits and 
</b></p>
<p><b>validation of detention;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> Provide explicit training for the Immigration Appeals Board and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Refugee Appeals Board on international human rights law and international refugee 
</b></p>
<p><b>law;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> Expedite the implementation of legislation that allows migrants to 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge effectively their detention at any time, in line with the standards laid out by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the European Court of Human Rights, through periodic review by a court of law on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the necessity and legality of detention, and ensure that these mechanisms are 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible for children and other vulnerable groups;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> Provide unaccompanied children with free, competent and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>guardianship to ensure proper decision-making in all proceedings concerning such 
</b></p>
<p><b>children, as well as free legal representation, to assist in all immigration and asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(h)<b> Guarantee fully the right to free legal assistance in expulsion, detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>and asylum procedures to all migrants and asylum seekers in primary legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>secure it in practice in all situations of detention of migrants and asylum seekers.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Provide access to basic services, such as health care, to everyone living in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Malta, regardless of their immigration status, in accordance with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Expedite the establishment of an integration unit that will focus on 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality and non-discrimination for all, including for migrants and asylum seekers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inside the Ministry for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>should initially focus on public awareness campaigns to eradicate stereotypes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination against migrants while promoting tolerance and respect for diversity </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>and on providing accurate data regarding migrants and asylum seekers and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic and social contribution to Malta;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Reinforce the public awareness campaigns through effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement of laws on prohibiting racist and xenophobic acts and on prohibiting hate 
</b></p>
<p><b>speech and racially motivated violence against migrants and asylum seekers. Ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that any such cases are prosecuted and punished, and that appropriate compensation 
</b></p>
<p><b>is awarded to the victims;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Fully implement its legislation to combat direct and indirect racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination with regard to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by 
</b></p>
<p><b>immigrants, in particular refugees and asylum seekers, including access to private 
</b></p>
<p><b>rental housing and the labour market;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Fully implement the Employer Sanctions Directive, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing comprehensive measures to penalize Maltese employers who abuse the 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability of migrants by paying them low or exploitative wages;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Avoid the criminalization of irregular migrants in language, policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice, and refrain from using incorrect terminology, </b>such as &#8220;illegal migrant&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to the European Union 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the European Union:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Ensure that European Union frameworks do not contribute to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>restriction of human rights protections of migrants in Malta;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Recognize that migrants will continue to arrive despite all efforts to stop 
</b></p>
<p><b>them, and that, at some point, repression of irregular migration is counterproductive 
</b></p>
<p><b>as it drives migrants further underground, thereby empowering smuggling rings and 
</b></p>
<p><b>creating conditions of alienation and marginalization that foster human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations, such as discrimination and violence against migrants;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> Provide financial, material and logistical assistance to Malta for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>reception and processing of migrants and asylum seekers;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> Ensure that Malta possesses a well-managed reception capacity that can 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustain the foreseeable seasonal migration peaks. A shared responsibility by all 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Union member States for reception includes some States offering part of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their reception capacity to other front-line States experiencing migration peaks;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> Establish a programme for the quick relocation of asylum seekers across 
</b></p>
<p><b>Europe, according to a distribution key and taking into account the wishes of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum seekers themselves, the possibilities of family reunification and humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>considerations that are essential to an equitable redistribution of responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>between States. If well managed, such a system would incentivize asylum seekers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>register in the first European Union country of entry. It would encourage asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>seekers not to use the evasion tactics that are now systematically employed to avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>their identification and the application of the Dublin regulations;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> Develop a common asylum policy. States should mutually recognize each 
</b></p>
<p>other&#8217;s <b>refugee status determination decisions, thus ensuring the mobility of refugees 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout the territory of the European Union. In order to gain confidence in each 
</b></p>
<p>other&#8217;s <b>refugee status determination systems, they should develop a roster of decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>makers from each European Union country, at first decision and at appeals levels, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>joint screening of asylum applications. With the help of the European Asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>Support Office and UNHCR, this would allow for the sharing of expertise, experience, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practices and lessons learned. It would also help create trust in the capacity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>each national system, through the understanding that it is grounded on a common 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge base relating to country-of-origin information, to be developed around a 
</b></p>
<p><b>common interpretation of the legal criteria for protection and to be responsive to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>same factors as considered in other systems;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> Work with States to open up more regular migration channels, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>for low-skilled workers, thus reflecting the real labour needs of the European Union, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which would lead to fewer irregular border crossings and less smuggling of migrants;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(h)<b> Ensure that the cooperation with FRONTEX takes full account of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of migrants, rather than focusing only on security-related aspects;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(i)<b> Promote the swift family reunification of unaccompanied minors with 
</b></p>
<p><b>their relatives who reside in other European Union member States, whatever their 
</b></p>
<p><b>status; </b> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(j)<b> Ensure the full implementation of responsibility sharing between 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Union member States in the management of its external borders. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular take into full account the geographical position of Malta, which renders its 
</b></p>
<p><b>coastlines particularly exposed to migration flows. This should include permitting 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum seekers the freedom of movement within the European Union and attributing 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Union support funds to the country where asylum seekers establish 
</b></p>
<p><b>themselves.</b>
