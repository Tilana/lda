<b>Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p> 
<b>Resolution 7/5.</b>  <b>Mandate of the independent expert on human rights</b> 
</p>
<p><b>and international solidarity</b> 
 
</p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Human Rights Council on the issue of the human rights and international 
</p>
<p>solidarity, including Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
</p>
<p>Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221;, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the 
</p>
<p>mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and 
</p>
<p>their annexes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the importance, in view of the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity, of the declarations and programmes of action of international 
</p>
<p>conferences such as the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in 1993, the 
</p>
<p>International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico, in

</p>
<p>held in Kobe, Japan, in 2005, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between economically developed and 
</p>
<p>developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights </p>

<p>in the international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, 
</p>
<p>according to its capacities, to make the maximum effort possible to close this gap,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as 
</p>
<p>a vital component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the 
</p>

</p>

<p>rights possible;

</p>
<p>solidarity, and suggestions to address the increasing challenges of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation; </p>

<p>(e) To work in close cooperation with all States and intergovernmental and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, as well as with other relevant actors representing the

<p>independent expert in his/her mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by 
</p>
<p>him/her and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the 
</p>
<p>independent expert to visit their countries, and to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate 
</p>
<p>effectively; 
</p>

</p>
<p>all necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfillment of the mandate 
</p>
<p>of the independent expert;
