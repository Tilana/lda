</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
examines the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Namibia on the basis of 
research and information gathered, including during a visit to the country from 20 to 28 
September 2012.  
</p>
<p> Indigenous peoples in Namibia have suffered injustices in the past that leave them 
disadvantaged, to varying degrees, in the present. Since the independence of Namibia in 
1990, the Government has made many significant achievements in rolling back some of the 
destructive legacies left by colonialism and apartheid. However, certain indigenous 
peoples&#8212;including the San, Himba (Ovahimba), Ovazemba, Ovatjimba and Ovatue 
people&#8212;are disadvantaged relative to other groups in the country and have not seen the 
promises and benefits brought by independence fulfilled for them. These groups have 
expressed strong desire for greater inclusion in decision-making at all levels, to be able to 
genuinely set their own priorities for development and to regain or strengthen rights over 
lands and natural resources, particularly lands to which they retain a cultural attachment. 
</p>
<p> Especially in recent years, the Government has entered into some innovative 
arrangements with San tribes through which they have been able to increase their control 
over management of land areas and derive some substantial benefits. In full consultation 
with the affected peoples, these kinds of innovative arrangements should be expanded and

</p>
<p>strengthened, along with greater efforts to ensure San peoples&#8217; security of land tenure, 
</p>
<p>which is still all too vulnerable. In this regard, land resettlement initiatives appear to have 
positive elements and potential. However, more needs to be done to identify adequate lands 
for resettlement and to develop land-use planning arrangements, in consultation with the 
affected San communities, as well as to provide ongoing support for the sustainable 
development of resettled communities.  
</p>
<p> Indigenous peoples in Namibia express a sense of exclusion from decision-making 
processes, at both at the local and national levels, because of their ethnic identities. 
Recognition of the traditional authorities of indigenous peoples in Namibia is an important 
step in advancing their rights to self-governance and to maintaining their distinct identities. 
The State should work to promote the recognition of legitimate authorities selected in 
accordance with traditional decision-making processes. Steps should also be redoubled to 
ensure that indigenous peoples or tribes that are ethnically distinct from the majority tribes 
are adequately represented in legislative and administrative institutions at both the district 
and national levels. 
</p>
<p> Namibia has paid a high level of attention to education since independence, and has 
established important policies regarding mother-tongue and culturally appropriate 
education. However, the Government should increase efforts to address the troubling 
educational situation of, in particular, San and Himba groups, whose members continue to 
lag behind in educational attainment relative to other groups. In addition, concerted efforts 
are needed to address the structural factors contributing to the health problems suffered by 
indigenous peoples in the country, including poverty and a lack of access to their traditional 
lands and natural resources.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
examines the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Namibia on the basis of 
research and information gathered, including during a visit to the country from 20 to 28 
September 2012. The issues addressed and recommendations made in the report concern 
culturally distinct peoples who are indigenous to Namibia and who have characteristics of 
non-dominance and marginalization similar to those of indigenous peoples in other parts of 
the world.  
</p>
<p>2. While in the capital city of Windhoek and during the course of his mission, the 
Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister, as well as with representatives of the 
Office of the Prime Minister and its Division of San Development; the Ministry of 
Environment and Tourism; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Lands and Resettlement; 
and the Ministry of Education. In addition, the Special Rapporteur met with the Human 
Rights Ombudsman, and with representatives of several non-governmental organizations 
and various agencies of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur conducted field visits to various parts of Namibia, where he 
met with representatives and members of numerous San groups, including the Ju/&#8217;hoansi 
San in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy area in Tsumkwe; the Khwe San living in the 
Bwabwata National Park in the Caprivi and Kavango regions; and the Hai//om San living in 
and around Etosha National Park. He also met with representatives of the Himba, 
Ovazemba and other indigenous peoples in Opuwo. In Windhoek, the Special Rapporteur 
met with representatives of the Rehoboth Basters and the Nama people. The Special 
Rapporteur is grateful to all the indigenous communities and representatives with whom he 
met for sharing their concerns and aspirations and for the valuable information they 
provided.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Namibia for the 
openness it demonstrated in allowing him to carry out his work freely and independently. 
He would also like to express his gratitude to representatives of indigenous peoples, non-
governmental organizations, members of civil society, and the United Nations Country 
Team in Windhoek, whose assistance in planning and carrying out of the mission was 
indispensable. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the indigenous peoples who welcomed 
him into their communities and lands and for the hospitality he received.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Indigenous peoples in Namibia 
</b></p>
<p>5. The earliest inhabitants of present-day Namibia are generally assumed to have been 
the ancestors of the San and Khoe peoples, and have been in the area for at least 1,500 to 
2,000 years &#8211; perhaps even longer. Traditionally, the San peoples of the Kalahari Desert 
region in Southern Africa were nomadic hunters and gatherers who managed limited plant, 
animal and water resources in the region within shared areas. Various Bantu-speaking 
groups, including the Owambo, Herero and Kavango started moving into the area that 
currently comprises Namibia around 500 years ago.  
</p>
<p>6. Today, Namibia has a relatively small yet multicultural population of approximately 
2.1 million people, including numerous ethnically distinct groups. The Owambo people are 
the largest group in the country, comprising about half of the total population. Overall they 
are well represented in national politics and enjoy higher levels of social and economic 
well-being than other groups. In general the Herero and Kavango peoples also maintain a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>relatively strong socioeconomic position in Namibia. Various other groups in Namibia 
experience relative marginalization, albeit in different ways and to different degrees.  
</p>
<p>7. The population of the diverse communities that make up the San peoples is currently 
estimated at between 30,000 and 36,000, or just less than 2 per cent of the total national 
population. Distinct San communities maintain their own language, traditions, customs and 
histories, with the principle San groups being the Hai//om, Khwe, !Kung, Ju/&#8217;hoansi, Naro 
and =Au//eisi, while smaller San communities include the //Anikwe, !X&#245;&#243;, |&#8217;Auni, and N|u 
(/Nu-//en). Previously, San peoples as a group were referred to as &#8220;Bushmen&#8221;, a term that 
has been used less in recent years due to its pejorative connotations. As will be described 
throughout the present report, the colonization process resulted in the San being 
marginalized and experiencing a significant loss of their lands and their customary 
livelihoods.  
</p>
<p>8. The Himba, a subgroup of the Herero, are an indigenous people numbering 
approximately 25,000. They are known for the continued practice of their semi-nomadic 
pastoral way of life and their strong cultures and identities. The Himba reside in the 
mountainous Kunene region, which was formerly known as Kaokoland, in northwestern 
Namibia and speak the Otjihereo language. Their livelihood focuses on raising cattle, sheep 
and goats for food, which they supplement with some agriculture and gathering activities. 
The Herero people also encompass other smaller subgroups that live in the Kunene region, 
including the Ovatue, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba.  
</p>
<p>9. While most people in Namibia can be characterized in a strict sense as indigenous to 
the area, the San, Himba, Ovatue, Ovatjimba, and Ovazemba are recognized by the 
Government of Namibia as particularly marginalized groups and have been identified in 
various Namibian laws and policies as groups that merit special attention and concern. The 
conditions of these groups, especially relative to other segments of the population of 
Namibia, can be identified as similar to those of groups identified as indigenous worldwide. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. Other non-dominant groups in Namibia include the Nama, a Khoesan people, and 
the Rehoboth Basters. The Nama are herders and pastoralists who are descendants of some 
of the first inhabitants of present-day Namibia. The Nama traditionally led a nomadic life in 
the vast areas between the Kalahari and the Namib deserts but suffered enormous losses 
during German colonization, which contributed to a breakdown of their tribal social 
structure. Today, the Nama have a population of roughly 80,000 people, who represent 14 
distinct groups and reside throughout the whole of Namibia, with a significant presence in 
the Karas region in the south of the country.  
</p>
<p>11. The Basters are a mixed-race Afrikaans-speaking community descended from Dutch 
South African settlers and Khoikhoi and Nama peoples. The Basters migrated to the 
Rehoboth area of Namibia in the late 1860s. In 1872, they declared a republic and drafted a 
constitution, and throughout German and South African administrations they maintained a 
considerable degree of political autonomy. With a population of approximately 55,000, the 
Rehoboth Basters maintain a distinctive and strong identity within Namibian society.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Between 1883 and 1915, Germany colonized the area currently comprising Namibia, 
which was at the time known as South West Africa. Following the defeat of Germany in the 
First World War, the area became a mandated territory under the League of Nations and 
then under the United Nations. Under the mandate the territory was administered by South 
Africa and was eventually subjected to that country&#8217;s racially discriminatory apartheid 
</p>
<p>policies. From the late 1940s until independence, Namibians petitioned the United Nations 
in various forms against South African rule. In 1966 the South West Africa People&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>Organization initiated independence efforts, and in 1988 South Africa agreed to end its 
administration, leading to the independence of Namibia in March 1990. 
</p>
<p>13. Namibian independence brought with it a Constitution that contains numerous 
progressive elements from a human rights perspective. For example, chapter three of the 
Constitution establishes the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, including 
equality and freedom from discrimination, the right to property, the right to culture and the 
right to education, among other rights. The chapter also includes provisions related to 
apartheid and affirmative action, among which is the stipulation that Namibia can enact 
legislation &#8220;for the advancement&#8221; of people who have been &#8220;disadvantaged by past 
discriminatory laws or practices&#8221; (art. 23, para. 2).  
</p>
<p>14. Customary law is incorporated into the legal framework of Namibia through article 
66, paragraph 1, which affirms that both customary law and common law are valid as long 
as those laws do not conflict with the Constitution or other statutory laws. This recognition 
of customary law is further elaborated in section 3 of the Traditional Authorities Act (Act 
25 of 2000),1 as discussed further in paragraphs 51 and 52 below.  
</p>
<p>15. Significantly, the Namibian Constitution affirms that all treaties binding upon 
Namibia, as well as &#8220;general rules of public international law&#8221;, are incorporated into 
Namibia domestic law.2 Thus, provisions of international human rights treaties to which 
Namibia is a party, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, form part of the domestic laws of the land. 
</p>
<p>Also significant is that Namibia voted in favour of adopting the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Namibia is not a party to International Labour 
Organization Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries, although ratification of this treaty is being considered by the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>16. In 2005, the Government approved the creation of the San Development Programme,3 
which is dedicated to the development of San communities so that they can be integrated into 
the mainstream society and economy, in accordance with Vision 2030, the development 
policy of the Government. In 2009, the Programme was transformed into the Division of San 
Development,4 which currently operates within the Office of the Prime Minister and has a 
budget of approximately N$ 2.4 million (approximately US$ 240,000). The mandate of the 
Division has expanded since its creation to address the Ovatue, Ovatjimba and Ovahimba 
communities. The Division works in the areas of lands and resettlement, education, economic 
development and food security. The creation of the Division of San Development within the 
Office of the Prime Minister is a positive step and appears to have potential for improving the 
lives of the groups that it supports. However, the Division has been criticized for not being 
sufficiently effective in the execution of its work.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>17. Despite the many positive elements of the legal framework in Namibia, certain 
groups continue to face challenges as a result of their historic marginalization or because of 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Act 25 of 2000, Section 3. 
 2  Article 144. 
 3  Cabinet decision No. 25/29.11.05/001.

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>their ethnic identities. Overall, the Special Rapporteur was informed of and observed a lack 
of coherent Government policy that assigns a positive value to the distinctive identities and 
practices of these indigenous peoples. As discussed in this section, the major issues brought 
to the attention of the Special Rapporteur relate to lands and resources, self-governance and 
participation, education, and health. Featured here are the challenges faced by the San 
communities, which generally are understood to be the most vulnerable of the indigenous 
peoples in Namibia, although concerns of other marginalized groups are also noted. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Land and resources 
</b></p>
<p>18. In order to facilitate a stable transition from the previous apartheid regime and to 
promote reconciliation, Namibia adopted a purposefully cautious approach to land reform 
at independence. In 1991, the newly constituted Government of Namibia held a National 
Land Conference, during which it decided that land reform in Namibia would not include 
restoration of &#8220;ancestral lands&#8221;, but that it should assist disadvantaged groups, in particular 
the San, to acquire land in accordance with their needs, thereby setting the foundation for 
the development of future land reform laws and policies. Under the Namibian land reform 
scheme there has been some land restitution for particular groups in the years since 
independence, as discussed further below. However, still today, some 40 to 50 per cent of 
the landmass of Namibia is owned by less than 10 per cent of the population, the majority 
of whom are descendants of European settlers. 
</p>
<p>19. While the loss of land by indigenous peoples during colonialism and apartheid was 
pervasive, by all accounts San groups in the country experienced the greatest loss and 
resultant social, economic, and cultural disruption, the legacy of which has not been 
overcome since independence. Today, San people use and occupy lands in Namibia under 
several different kinds of arrangements, with varying levels of security and control over 
lands and resources, none of which are wholly adequate and without problems. These land 
tenure arrangements include communal lands, conservancies, resettlement farms and 
occupation of lands within national parks.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Communal lands 
</b></p>
<p>20. Today, approximately half of the total population of Namibia live on lands 
designated as &#8220;communal lands&#8221;, which make up around 40 per cent of the Namibian 
landmass. These communal lands, which were recognized following independence, are 
mostly constituted by the areas established by the Government of South Africa as 
&#8220;homelands&#8221; within its system of apartheid. Today, the Communal Land Reform Act (Act 
No. 5 of 2002) regulates the administration of communal lands, vesting ownership in the 
State of Namibia, but authorizing traditional authorities, in coordination with communal 
land boards, to allocate and administer the land for residential occupation, farming, grazing 
and other purposes.5  
</p>
<p>21. Only one homeland, Bushmanland, was reserved for San people prior to 
independence, with the town of Tsumkwe created as its administrative centre. This area 
comprised more or less the traditional hunting area (<i>n!ore</i>) of the Ju/&#8217;hoansi San and was 
occupied almost entirely by this group, although at the time of the establishment of 
Bushmanland, the Government of South Africa had planned to relocate other San groups 
into that homeland.  
</p>
<p>  
 5  See, in particular, sections 20 and 21 of the Act.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>22. Today, San people constitute a majority in the communal lands within the former 
Bushmanland area, with Ju/&#8217;hoansi San living in the eastern side and !Kung San in the 
western side. The San living in former Bushmanland are the only San groups that constitute 
a majority within the communal lands in which they live, and are therefore the only San 
who have decision-making control over land administration of communal lands. For the 
purposes of natural resource management and control, and as discussed further below, the 
Ju/&#8217;hoansi have organized themselves into the Nyae Nyae Conservancy, and the !Kung into 
the N&#8225;a Jaqna Conservancy. Despite continuing to face various issues related to tenure 
security, it is apparent that groups living within the former Bushmanland homeland are 
faring better than San groups living elsewhere, at least in terms of access to lands and 
resources.  
</p>
<p>23. Other San throughout Namibia live within the communal lands dominated by other 
ethnic groups, including within the lands of the former Hereroland and former 
Owamboland, and within the Kavango regions. As numerical minorities in these communal 
areas, the San are in a weak political position to advance their own interests, a situation that 
has also contributed to the breakdown of their own autonomous decision-making structures 
within these areas. These San typically face significant economic and social 
marginalization, competing for limited lands and resources with majority and dominant 
groups, and have a high level of dependency on the dominant tribes or Government for 
basic services and food.  
</p>
<p>24. Despite providing some measure of security of tenure and the appurtenant authority 
to administer lands, the communal land system continues to be problematic. For example, 
the tenure afforded the occupants of communal lands is one of mere usufruct and not full 
ownership, in contrast to the freehold titles by which private commercial farms typically are 
held. Additionally, communal lands of San and certain other indigenous groups, including 
the Himba, are under a continuous threat of encroachment by larger or more powerful 
groups who move into lands, raising fences to demarcate areas in which to graze their 
cattle, despite the fact that the erection of fences within communal land areas is prohibited 
under section 18 of the Communal Land Reform Act.  
</p>
<p>25. The Rehoboth Baster people have a unique history with respect to their communal 
land. Both the German and South African administrations recognized certain rights of the 
Basters to their lands, and a homeland was created for them. However, at the time of 
independence, Baster communal lands were reportedly expropriated by the Government of 
Namibia. Since the 1990s, community members have sought, but not yet been granted, 
validation of their land claims in both domestic and international forums. It was reported to 
the Special Rapporteur during his visit that the loss of the recognition of the Basters&#8217; 
communal lands has resulted in a loss of the recognition of their traditional authority and 
has facilitated the resettlement of other groups into their traditional area. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Conservancies 
</b></p>
<p>26. A significant benefit afforded to those living within communal lands is the option to 
form a conservancy. Under the Nature Conservation Amendment Act (Act No. 5 of 1996), 
&#8220;any group of persons residing on communal land&#8221; can apply to the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Environment and Tourism to have their land, or a portion thereof, declared a conservancy 
for game management and economic opportunities.6 There are currently 59 conservancy 
arrangements in Namibia. As noted earlier, two conservancies are managed by San groups, 
the Nyae Nyae and the N&#8225;a Jaqna conservancies, which are located in the former 
Bushmanland area that is now recognized as communal land.  
</p>
<p>  
 6  Sect. 24A, para. 1. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>27. Established in 1998 after significant efforts and years of advocacy by the Ju/&#8217;hoansi 
people, the Nyae Nyae Conservancy was the first conservancy created over communal 
lands, and is currently one of the most successful conservancies in the country.7 Nyae Nyae 
is situated within the traditional lands of the Ju/&#8217;hoansi San, where there is a high diversity 
of wildlife, especially in the rainy season. Within the conservancy area, the Ju/&#8217;hoansi in 
Nyae Nyae have rights to manage natural resources and promote tourism, including through 
safaris and trophy hunting. They also have the right to hunt traditionally with bows and 
arrows; they are the only San group in the country that has this right under Namibian law. 
The conservancy is a community-based organization of the Ju/&#8217;hoansi people, although it 
has received over the years significant support from both the Government and non-
governmental organizations, to which it owes much of its current success. Nyae Nyae, 
however, is facing ongoing encroachment by outsiders and the Government has not stepped 
in to remedy this situation.  
</p>
<p>28. Within the N&#8225;a Jaqna Conservancy, which was created in 2003 in the western 
Tsumkwe area, the majority !Kung San people are authorized to harvest wildlife 
sustainably and collect wild foods. However, this conservancy is located in an area with 
minimal wildlife or other tourist potential, so it has not been able to draw the same 
economic benefits as has Nyae Nyae. Like Nyae Nyae, the N&#8225;a Jaqna Conservancy is 
threatened by encroachment by outside groups and the erection of illegal fences. The 
conservancy is also threatened by the proposal to convert part of its land area into mixed 
farming settlements, a resettlement effort that, according to information received, is being 
pushed by the Ministry of Lands and Resettlement. 
</p>
<p>29. The conservancies are in a sense flagship programmes for the Government of 
Namibia and have been promoted as models for community-based resource management. 
Certainly the conservancies, especially Nyae Nyae, have allowed communities to have 
some measure of control over and derive benefits from the natural resources within the 
communal areas in which they live. However, a limitation of the conservancies is that they 
can be created only within communal lands or freehold lands, and thus, among the 
numerous disadvantaged San groups, only the Ju/&#8217;hoansi and !Kung San have been able to 
benefit from the conservancy arrangement.  
</p>
<p>30. In addition, the laws and policies affecting communal lands and conservancies, 
including the Communal Land Reform Act and the Nature Conservation Amendment Act, 
have yet to be harmonized effectively, resulting in a confusing and difficult-to-navigate 
regulatory regime within these areas. The Ministry of Lands and Resettlement, which has 
responsibilities with respect to communal lands, and the Ministry of Environment and 
Tourism, which has responsibilities with respect to conservancies, often promote competing 
uses over the same lands, according to sources consulted.  
</p>
<p><b> 3.  The land reform process and resettlement farms 
</b></p>
<p>31. Whatever the limitations of the communal land and conservancy regimes, it is 
apparent that those San and other groups that do not have recognized communal lands are 
currently faring worse than those groups that do. Most San groups in the country have been 
dispossessed of their traditional lands, both by private parties for the creation of agricultural 
farms and by the colonial and apartheid governments, including in the context of the 
process of creating national parks or other protected areas. Exacerbating this already 
devastating situation, following the dispossession of their lands many San lived, and

</p>
<p>worked as labourers, on the private farms established on those taken lands, creating a 
dependency on white landowners for generations of San and hindering the development of 
their own viable economies. Following the decline in commercial agricultural activities in 
the country, thousands of San people lost employment as farm labourers and today have no 
land base at all, living as squatters at the edges of the former or current private farms or in 
other precarious land tenure situations.  
</p>
<p>32. In accordance with section 2 of the Agricultural (Commercial) Land Reform Act 
(Act No. 6 of 1995), the Government may purchase lands to redistribute to landless groups 
who wish to be resettled, especially those that have been &#8220;socially, economically and 
</p>
<p>educationally disadvantaged by past discriminatory laws or practices&#8221;. The National 
Resettlement Policy of 2001 further elaborates that the resettlement &#8220;will focus on the 
resettlement of eligible persons in ways which are institutionally, sociologically, 
economically and environmentally sustainable and which will allow the beneficiaries to 
become self-supporting&#8221;.8 The National Resettlement Policy identifies the San as one of the 
main target groups, noting that they &#8220;have endured exploitation and discrimination at the 
</p>
<p>hands of their fellow citizens throughout history&#8221;.9  
</p>
<p>33. Although expropriation of lands for land reform is authorized under the Agricultural 
(Commercial) Land Reform Act, for political and other reasons the Government has mainly 
been purchasing lands under the principle of &#8220;willing buyer, willing seller&#8221;. In accordance 
</p>
<p>with this principle, the Government has the first option to buy any private farm that is up 
for sale at market value. All purchased land becomes State land, with the resettled groups 
having the right to a 99-year lease. However, it is not clear what happens once this lease 
term expires, thus the underlying issue of land ownership remains unresolved. In any case, 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that, as of yet, no leases &#8211; either communal or 
individual &#8211; have been given to resettled San groups.  
</p>
<p>34. To date, seven resettlement farms measuring some 6,000 hectares each have been 
purchased for San people, with the assistance of the Division of San Development. While 
achieving the important goal of providing some San groups with land, the resettlement 
process has been slow and plagued with problems. The Ministry of Lands and 
Resettlement, which is responsible for purchasing lands, has been hamstrung by inadequate 
funding and, according to the Government, there is also an overall shortage of landowners 
who are willing to sell as well as a shortage of good quality lands to buy.  
</p>
<p>35. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur was informed that a long-awaited deal to 
purchase a resettlement farm for members of the Oshivelo San community, which was 
originally evicted from Etosha National Park in the 1950s, did not advance because the 
seller ultimately withdrew the offer. Members of this community continue to await land, 
living on a small and crowded plot of land behind the police station in the town of 
Oshivelo, where the community has been squatting for some 20 years. Members of the 
Oshivelo community expressed to the Special Rapporteur their desire to have access to 
lands in the national park for tourism purposes as well as be provided with lands suitable 
for agricultural activities adjacent to the park. 
</p>
<p>36. Even when lands are available and purchased, these are not always sufficient or 
adequately situated for productive agricultural use or other economic purposes, even though 
under the National Resettlement Policy &#8220;land with sufficient resources&#8221; is the &#8220;most 
</p>
<p>important and decisive factor in Resettlement&#8221;.10 Further, there have been minimal in-depth 
land-use planning studies carried out prior to the selection of lands or to the resettlement of 
</p>
<p>

</b></p>
<p>San people to the lands bought. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
Hai//om representatives had requested that their community be moved to lands along a 
major road leading into Etosha National Park, which they saw as having greater economic 
development value, but were told that it was not possible for reasons unknown. In most 
cases, the purchased lands are also reportedly too small to sustain economically viable 
farms. 
</p>
<p>37. An additional problem has been that the communities that are resettled do not 
receive sufficient support following resettlement. This concern was uniformly expressed 
during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Seringkop, one of the more developed resettlement 
farms. At Seringkop, as at most resettlement farms, basic infrastructure, including for water 
and sanitation, has for the most part not yet been installed. Viable economies in these farms 
are very far from taking root and people have thus far been living on assistance from the 
Government or non-governmental organizations for almost everything. This situation exists 
despite the fact that the National Resettlement Policy states that resettlement beneficiaries 
will be expected to be &#8220;self-reliant and self-sufficient by the fourth year&#8221;.11 While some 
resettlement farms have agriculture and tourist potential, San people reported to the Special 
Rapporteur that they currently lack the experience and know-how to build thriving 
commercial farms or tourism ventures.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur heard that there is some discomfort on the part of the 
Government about restoring to San groups their traditional lands or resettling them to 
prescribed areas, given that doing so is sometimes viewed as reminiscent of apartheid 
policies in which ethnic groups were divided into administrative territories based on race. 
Yet, if the Government is to carry out a land reform process, which by all accounts is 
imperative in Namibia, it must move forward in accordance with the right of the San and 
other indigenous peoples to hold land collectively, a right that is affirmed in the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (art. 26, ff.). Programmes to 
secure this right are instrumental to promoting equality and providing all Namibians with 
opportunities for development, as contrasted with the racially discriminatory policies of 
apartheid. Despite the challenges, the Special Rapporteur observed some level of optimism 
for land reform in Namibia, given that it is a geographically large country with a relatively 
low population density, and the fact that there is a good level of political will and a legal 
framework to carry out land reform.  
</p>
<p><b> 4.  National parks 
</b></p>
<p>39. National parks in Namibia comprise lands that historically were used and occupied, 
and in some cases continue to be used and occupied, by San people. In multiple encounters 
with San groups and other knowledgeable sources, it was evident to the Special Rapporteur 
that San people continue to maintain a strong cultural attachment to their traditional lands 
within the parks. 
</p>
<p>40. The principal two parks in which San people live or have lived in are Etosha 
National Park, in the Kunene Region, and Bwabwata National Park, spanning the Caprivi 
and Kavango regions. Despite the fact that there exist strong indications that San groups 
have rights over lands and resources within the Etosha and Bwabwata national parks under 
international and common law standards, the Government of Namibia has not to date 
acknowledged San rights to lands within these parks. Thus, as discussed in the present 
section, while the Government has been, especially in recent years, demonstrating an 
increased openness to developing measures for San participation in managing and

<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>benefiting from parks&#8217; resources, the fundamental issue of land rights has, problematically, 
</p>
<p>yet to be resolved. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) The Hai//om San in and around Etosha National Park 
</i></p>
<p>41. Etosha National Park was created in the 1920s by the German colonial 
administration and is today one of the premier tourist attractions in the country. The 
Hai//om people were removed from the park in the 1950s, although they still maintain a 
cultural connection to lands within the park.12 While previously the Hai//om were permitted 
to continue some hunting in the park, following their eviction in the 1950s, all open access 
to the park as well as hunting and gathering in it was banned. As noted, many of the 
Hai//om evicted from the park are now landless and awaiting resettlement, or have been 
recently resettled onto commercial farms. 
</p>
<p>42. In a recent positive development, the Government, through its Ministry of 
Environment and Tourism, granted Hai//om San a tourism concession within Etosha 
National Park &#8211; the first of its kind. Under this concession, the Hai//om have exclusive 
rights to run tourism operations at the Gobaob watering hole, a spot that attracts a high 
number of wild animals and is also of central cultural significance to the Hai//om, being the 
birthplace of many of their ancestors.  
</p>
<p>43. The concession agreement was signed during the course of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit to Namibia, and was met with optimism by both Government and Hai//om 
representatives alike. However, Hai//om people with whom the Special Rapporteur met also 
expressed the concern that only those groups that move to the resettlement farms will 
benefit from the concession, and that those people who choose to not move to the farms 
will not be able to profit from tourism activities. In addition, the Hai//om have a strong 
desire to establish a tourism lodge within the boundaries of the park as part of the 
concession, an undoubtedly more attractive option in terms of tourism potential than a 
lodge outside of the park; however, their proposal in this regard was rejected by the 
Ministry of Environment and Tourism, with the justification that only Namibia Wildlife 
Resorts, a State-owned enterprise, may operate lodges within protected areas in Namibia. 
</p>
<p>44. In any event, overall, Hai//om representatives expressed to the Special Rapporteur 
their feeling that the Government is trying to &#8220;erase&#8221; the Hai//om connection with the park, 
</p>
<p>an assertion that appears to the Special Rapporteur to have some merit. At the very least, 
there is clearly no official policy or activities to reflect the Hai//om connection to Etosha or 
to strengthen that connection. Indeed, there is a dearth of information within Etosha 
National Park that links that area&#8217;s history with the Hai//om San, apart from basic signage 
indicating Hai//om names for watering holes, gathering places or other spots of 
significance. The Special Rapporteur was informed also that a concession previously 
granted to a Hai//om group to perform traditional dances for tourists was not renewed by 
the Ministry of Environment and Tourism.  
</p>
<p>45. Finally, the majority of employees in Etosha National Park are not Hai//om and there 
is no hiring preference for Hai//om people, a fact that is a source of frustration for them, and 
there is also a lack of Hai//om input into decision-making about the park management at all 
levels. However, during a meeting of the Special Rapporteur with representatives of the 
Hai//om and the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Hai//om members proposed the 
establishment of a Hai//om advisory body in relation to the Etosha National Park, and 
representatives of the Ministry indicated a willingness to consider this proposal. 
</p>
<p>  
 12  For a history of the Hai//om in the area of Etosha National Park, see Christina Longden, ed., 
</p>
<p><i>Undiscovered or Overlooked? the Hai//om of Namibia and their Identity</i> (Windhoek, Working Group 
of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa, 2004). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>46. There is still one group of Hai//om people living within the boundaries of Etosha 
National Park, namely in Okaukuejo, a community established for park workers that is 
situated on the outskirts of a large tourist lodge. Most of these people are current or former 
park employees. The Government is encouraging San people living in Okaukuejo to move 
to the resettlement farms that it has purchased adjacent to the park. Representatives of the 
Ministry of Environment and Tourism informed the Special Rapporteur that the reason for 
moving the members of the community is because they make &#8220;too much noise&#8221;, especially 
&#8220;wailing during funerals&#8221;, which according to the Government disturbs tourists and wild 
animals. The Minister stated: &#8220;We must protect the tourists &#8230; they pay a lot of money.&#8221; 
However, from a human rights perspective, this is clearly an inadequate justification for 
removals. The community has lodged a legal complaint against the Government, asserting 
their right to stay and their rights over lands within Etosha National Park. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) The Khwe San in and around Bwabwata National Park 
</i></p>
<p>47. Bwabwata National Park was created in 2007 on the area that had been designated 
as a game reserve prior to the independence of Namibia. The designations of both the game 
reserve and the national park were made without consultations with the some 1,000 to 
2,000 Khwe San people living within the park&#8217;s boundaries, who were also excluded from 
participating in the design or management of the park. Khwe people living in the park have 
a still undefined legal status with respect to park lands (there is not even any written 
acknowledgment of the right of the Khwe to continue to occupy these lands), and there 
does not appear to be any intention on the part of the Government to resolve this issue in 
the short or medium term. The Khwe likewise have no right to hunt game, traditionally or 
otherwise, within the park&#8217;s boundaries, and may only gather, in specific ungazetted areas, 
some essential subsistence items, including firewood.  
</p>
<p>48. Decisions regarding natural resource management within Bwabwata National Park 
are made by the Ministry of Tourism in consultation with the Kyaramacan Association, a 
non-governmental organization that represents people living within the park. Importantly, 
in recent years, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism has facilitated the establishment 
of some innovative land-use and benefit-sharing arrangements for the people within 
Bwabwata National Park. The Khwe, with the assistance of the Kyaramacan Association, 
have been granted hard-won concessions to benefit economically from big game trophy 
hunting and to build a tourism lodge near the Popa waterfalls. However, despite these 
promising developments, the Khwe communities undoubtedly face numerous challenges 
ahead. The Khwe will need significant assistance, both economic and in terms of capacity-
building, to get their development initiatives off the ground.  
</p>
<p>49. The majority of Khwe people in the area of Bwabwata National Park are living in 
situations of abject poverty and marginalization. The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
the Khwe face heightened discrimination because of their prior association with the South 
African Defence Force, which occupied the Bwabwata park area during the apartheid 
regime and used Khwe San people as trackers because of their keen knowledge of the 
area&#8217;s lands and resources. Further, as discussed in the following section, the Khwe are the 
only San group in the country to not have their traditional authorities recognized under the 
Traditional Authorities Act, which contributes to their condition of marginalization and 
lack of voice in decision-making in the area. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation and self-governance 
</b></p>
<p>50. An important aspect of the ability of indigenous peoples to maintain their distinct 
identities is the capacity to maintain and develop their own institutions of authority and 
effectively participate in all decisions affecting them. Yet representatives of indigenous </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>peoples with whom the Special Rapporteur met overwhelmingly expressed a sense of 
exclusion from decision-making processes, at both at the local and national levels, because 
of their ethnic identities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Recognition of traditional authorities 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Traditional Authorities Act allows a traditional community, which is defined in 
section 1 of the Act as &#8220;an indigenous homogeneous&#8221; group that shares &#8220;a common 
ancestry, language, cultural heritage, customs and traditions&#8221; and &#8220;inhabits a common 
communal area&#8221;, to apply for State recognition of its traditional leadership (sects. 1; 2, 
subsect. 1; and 4). Traditional authorities administer and execute customary laws, and are 
responsible for protecting and promoting &#8220;the culture, language, tradition, and traditional 
values&#8221; of a community and preserving cultural sites, works of art and traditional 
ceremonies (sect. 3, subsect. 1). Recognized traditional authorities receive funding from the 
Government to carry out their functions. 
</p>
<p>52. Under the Traditional Authorities Act, the Minister for Regional and Local 
Government has the discretion to deny a group&#8217;s application on several grounds (sect. 3, 
subsect. 1, paras. (a) and (b)). On this basis, the Minister has declined to recognize the 
traditional authorities of various groups, including dozens of Himba and Ovazemba chiefs 
with whom the Special Rapporteur met during his visit. However, concerns were expressed 
to the Special Rapporteur that the traditional chiefs recognized by the Government tend to 
be those who are aligned with the dominant South West Africa People&#8217;s Organization 
political party, and questions were raised about their legitimacy. 
</p>
<p>53. Nearly all of the six major San groups in Namibia have had their traditional 
authorities recognized, the sole exception being the Khwe. The Khwe first applied for 
recognition of their traditional authority in 1997 and have reapplied for recognition since 
then without success. Currently, the Khwe are under the jurisdiction of the chiefs of other 
traditional communities who apparently do not represent Khwe interests and who, in fact, 
have discriminated against the Khwe and actively resisted the confirmation of the Khwe&#8217;s 
own traditional authority.  
</p>
<p>54. Although nearly all San groups have had their traditional authority recognized, as a 
practical matter, most do not have significant authority to administer lands, given their 
small numbers relative to other groups in the areas in which they live. Under the Communal 
Land Reform Act, &#8220;communal land areas&#8221; over which traditional authorities have 
jurisdiction cover basically the same area as the former homelands (sects. 15 and 16, and 
schedule 1). Thus, since no San groups besides the Ju/&#8217;hoansi and !Kung in the Tsumkwe 
district constitute a majority in recognized communal lands, these San authorities do not 
have the power to administer communal land areas.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Participation in governance and decision-making at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>55. Importantly, Namibia has maintained a stable democratic governance system since 
independence. However, representatives of all of the indigenous groups with whom the 
Special Rapporteur met expressed concerns that their disadvantaged conditions and small 
populations relative to dominant groups within Namibia result in challenges in participation 
in governance structures at the national level. Since independence, national politics have 
been dominated by the South West Africa People&#8217;s Organization party, which despite being 
open to all ethnicities and tribes in Namibia, is viewed as a predominately Owambo party, 
given that the Owambo make up around 50 per cent of the population.. Representatives to 
the National Assembly are also elected on the basis of party list proportional representation; 
thus, the parties that have the highest membership receive the most seats in the National 
Assembly, helping to solidify the dominance of the South West Africa People&#8217;s 
Organization in national decision-making.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also received information about the lack of participation of 
indigenous groups in decisions related to natural resource extraction, a mainstay of the 
Namibian economy. Decisions regarding extraction and development of natural resources 
are largely managed from Windhoek, with few benefits going to communities affected by 
these activities. Nama people informed the Special Rapporteur of inadequate participation 
in planning and development of mineral extraction, especially diamonds, in the areas where 
they live. Similarly, Himba of the Kunene Region noted that neither their communities nor 
traditional leaders were informed about mining activities being carried out in their 
traditional territories and grazing lands. Further, there is also strong opposition by Himba, 
Ovazemba, Ovatue, and Ovatjimba peoples to the proposed construction of the Baynes 
hydroelectric power project. The proposed dam would be constructed on the Kunene River 
in an area that these various groups, and the Himba in particular, regard as their traditional 
territory and that is connected to their livelihoods and to cultural practices associated with 
ancestral graves.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Education  
</b></p>
<p>57. In 1990, the Government of Namibia inherited a national educational system defined 
by apartheid policies, under which generations of black indigenous Namibians received an 
education far inferior to that of the white minority. The effects of these discriminatory 
educational policies continue to the present day, and disparities in learning outcomes persist 
between blacks and whites. However, children in marginalized indigenous groups, in 
particular the San and Himba, continue to face the greatest challenges with respect to access 
to education and achievement levels. 
</p>
<p>58. Since independence, a constitutional and policy framework has been put in place to 
make education accessible to all Namibians. The 1990 Constitution requires that primary 
education shall be compulsory and free (art. 20, para. 2). Significantly, within the first years 
of independence, the then Ministry of Education, Culture, Youth and Sport developed the 
Language Policy for Schools, which calls for the use of the mother tongue as the language 
of instruction during the first three years of formal education, with a transition to English 
thereafter.13 Further, the education sector receives the largest portion of the national budget. 
</p>
<p>59. The Government also has specific policies and programmes in place to address the 
educational challenges of what are considered vulnerable groups within Namibia. The 
National Policy Options for Educationally Marginalised Children of 2000 recognized San 
and Himba children as &#8220;educationally marginalized&#8221;, meaning that they experience 
difficulties in gaining access to basic education, drop out of school prematurely, or are 
&#8220;pushed out from the formal education system by the system itself&#8221;.14 In the National 
Policy Options document, the Government proposes the use of &#8220;special efforts&#8221; to facilitate 
greater access by marginalized groups to the education system and greater retention of such 
groups in the system.15 It also provides several options for combating poverty and 
discriminatory attitudes towards marginalized children.16  
</p>
<p>60. For its part, the Division of San Development supports the development of early 
childhood centres, as well as literacy programmes for San pensioners, and provides 
scholarships for schools having a significant number of San learners, to offset costs. In

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>addition, in 2010 the Division launched the Back to School and Stay in School campaign, 
which encourages students who are considered vulnerable to attend and stay in school.  
</p>
<p>61. Despite these positive policies, marginalized indigenous groups in Namibia face 
continued and unique challenges. San children experience the most troubling educational 
indicators in the country. Recent Government figures indicate that 62 per cent of San-
speaking children are enrolled in lower primary school, which includes grades 1 through 4, 
and 23 per cent are enrolled in upper primary school, which includes grades 5 through 7.17 
The enrolment of San-speaking students in higher levels of education remains disturbingly 
low, with only 7 per cent of San-speaking children enrolled in junior secondary school and 
less than 1 per cent enrolled in senior secondary school.18 According to various sources 
consulted, in the entire country only 10 to 12 San students are currently attending 
university.  
</p>
<p>62. As already indicated, a significant barrier that impedes San and Himba children from 
gaining access to education is the discrimination they face in schools, both from other 
students and from teachers. The National Policy Options for Educationally Marginalised 
Children acknowledges the pervasive discriminatory attitudes of the general student 
population and teachers as a major factor contributing to why marginalized children drop 
out of school or are reluctant to attend.19 The Special Rapporteur heard almost uniformly 
that discrimination, teasing and negative stereotyping of San children characterize their 
educational experiences. Himba people with whom the Special Rapporteur met voiced 
similar concerns, adding also that their children were forced to change their traditional 
haircuts and dress at schools.  
</p>
<p>63. Also contributing to low levels of educational attainment by some indigenous 
children is the overall lack of education that is delivered in a culturally and linguistically 
appropriate way. Currently, Ju/&#8217;hoansi is the only San language that is an official teaching 
language of the Ministry of Education. However, in line with the Language Policy for 
Schools, the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the National Institute for 
Educational Development, is developing educational resources in the principle San 
languages with a focus on grades 1 through 3. One positive model is the Nyae Nyae Village 
Schools Project of the Tsumkwe district, which provides San children with educational 
opportunities in their native language near their homes. However, overall there is a lack of 
San language teachers, and the relatively small numbers of San learners significantly 
complicate the implementation of linguistically appropriate education.  
</p>
<p>64. Extreme poverty makes it difficult for San children in particular to attend and stay in 
school Despite the fact that the Constitution requires that primary education be provided 
free of charge, the Education Act (Act No. 16 of 2001) allows for schools, on an individual 
basis, to charge fees towards a &#8220;school development fund&#8221; that goes towards maintenance 
</p>
<p>of facilities and to &#8220;improve educational, sport and cultural activities&#8221;.20 While there is an 
exemption for students who cannot afford to pay the fee,21 the Special Rapporteur heard 
that San students are routinely turned away from schools for not paying development fund 
fees. San children are also more likely than other children to leave school to seek 
employment due to the extreme poverty they face.

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>65. The distances that children must travel to attend schools presents another major 
barrier to education. Schools are in many cases located far away from the student&#8217;s home 
</p>
<p>community, and public transportation is costly and provided irregularly. In order to 
facilitate access to schools for San children from remote areas, the Government has 
established school hostels. But the Special Rapporteur heard of several problems associated 
with these hostels, including bullying and poor living conditions. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur observed the dire conditions of the school hostel at the Seringkop resettlement 
farm, where approximately 40 boy and girl students were housed in two makeshift 
corrugated tin and canvas structures behind the school.  
</p>
<p>66. Another way that the Government has sought to provide access to education in 
remote areas is through the establishment of mobile schools. The National Policy Options 
for Educationally Marginalised Children recommends the use of mobile schools for Himba 
learners in the Kunene Region as a way to address the challenges resulting from their semi-
nomadic lifestyle, in which they move with their livestock depending on available pasture 
lands and water. Yet, Himba representatives reported that the conditions of mobile schools 
have deteriorated significantly since the Government of Namibia has taken over 
management of the schools from outside sponsors.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur heard alarming reports that San girls have suffered sexual 
abuse by teachers. He was also informed that principals and teachers have turned away 
teenage mothers who wished to return to school after their children had reached a certain 
age.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Health 
</b></p>
<p>68. Similar to education, health care in Namibia prior to independence was provided 
along racial lines, with the white minority receiving markedly better care than the black 
majority, who had little or no access to doctors and hospitals, particularly in communal land 
areas. Since independence, the Ministry of Health and Social Services has focused on 
providing health care to all Namibians, which more recently has included a shift of 
resources to &#8220;disadvantaged regions&#8221; &#8211; areas where historical deprivation of health services 
has resulted in greater health-care needs.22 This shift includes the delivery of basic services 
through clinics, mobile health teams and community health-care providers.23  
</p>
<p>69. Disaggregated data on the health situation in Namibia is scarce. However, available 
statistics indicate a problematic health situation of marginalized groups, especially in rural 
areas. San and other indigenous people have been denied medical treatment or expelled 
from hospitals because they are unable to pay for services. San mothers in the Divundu area 
informed the Special Rapporteur that they had been forced out of hospital facilities the 
same day they gave birth because they could not afford care.  
</p>
<p>70. The remote character of many San and Himba groups often aggravates their 
vulnerabilities with regard to health and health care. Estimates are that over 80 per cent of 
San live more than 80 km away from any type of health facility.24 Numerous San 
community members from different villages told the Special Rapporteur that it is not 
uncommon for individuals to die while being transported long distances to receive health

<p>mission to Namibia, adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights at its 38th 
ordinary session (2005), p. 21. </p>

<p>services. In many places, the great distances between San communities and health facilities 
cause San people to rely heavily on mobile outreach units, which reportedly do not 
maintain a regular visitation schedule and are poorly equipped and understaffed.   
</p>
<p>71. Undoubtedly, stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes towards marginalized 
indigenous peoples figure into the poor health of members of their communities. 
Throughout the mission, San and Himba community members repeatedly informed the 
Special Rapporteur that health workers treated them poorly, and Himba representatives 
added that health workers did not want to touch them if they were dressed in their 
traditional clothing. A reported dearth of health-care professionals who speak or understand 
local indigenous languages also frustrates basic services delivery and can result in improper 
diagnosis. San community members expressed to the Special Rapporteur a strong desire to 
have access to educational opportunities that would prepare them for professional health-
care positions to help close the health service gap resulting from cultural disconnects.   
</p>
<p>72. The National Policy on Community Based Health Care of 2008 has the potential to 
mitigate discrimination issues in health care.25 The policy, developed by the Ministry of 
Health and Social Services, seeks to empower and strengthen community-based responses 
to support health through preventative measures and palliative care26 primarily in rural 
settings.27 A key component of the policy involves the delivery of health services through 
community resource persons, including traditional healers and traditional birth attendants, 
who can provide insight into the cultural context in which health services are being 
provided. The National Policy on HIV/AIDS of 2007 similarly calls for traditional, cultural 
and spiritual leaders to be involved in organizing community responses to HIV/AIDS, and 
acknowledges that delivering health care to San and Himba peoples can be complicated by 
cultural issues such as language and the distance to many of their communities. 
</p>
<p>73. The precarious land situation of San people in Namibia also affects their health. 
Specifically, insecure land tenure and restrictions on hunting and gathering traditional foods 
interferes with the San peoples&#8217; ability to rely on their traditional food sources and results 
</p>
<p>in many San relying on government food aid as a principle means of substance. However, 
food aid is often unreliable and insufficient, leading to situations of persistent hunger 
among San communities, which compromises their immune systems and their ability to 
resist disease.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Overarching issues 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> Indigenous peoples in Namibia have suffered injustices in the past that leave 
them disadvantaged, to varying degrees, in the present. Since the independence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Namibia in 1990, the Government has made many significant achievements in rolling 
</b></p>
<p><b>back some of the destructive legacies left by colonialism and apartheid. However, 
</b></p>
<p><b>certain indigenous peoples</b>&#8212;<b>including the San, Himba, Ovazemba, Ovatue and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ovatjimba people</b>&#8212;<b>are disadvantaged relative to other groups in the country and 
</b></p>
<p><b>have not seen the promises and benefits brought by independence fulfilled for them. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> Namibia is a country rich with diverse indigenous cultural and ethnic identities, 
including those of indigenous peoples who have suffered marginalization in various 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of life. However, overall, the Special Rapporteur observes a lack of coherent

</b></p>
<p><b>Government policy in Namibia that assigns a positive value to the distinctive identities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and practices of these indigenous peoples, or that promotes their ability to survive as 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples with their distinct cultures intact in the fullest sense, including in relation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their traditional lands, authorities and languages.  
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Government should strengthen and adopt affirmative measures to protect 
the right of non-dominant indigenous groups to retain and develop the various 
</b></p>
<p><b>attributes of their distinctive cultural identities. Laws and government programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be reviewed and reformed as needed to ensure that they do not discriminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>against particular indigenous groups, and that they accommodate and strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural diversity and adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, in consultation with indigenous peoples, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should look to ratify International Labour Organization Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Lands and resources 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Especially in recent years, the Government has entered into some innovative 
arrangements with San and other groups through which they have been able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase their control over management of lands and natural resources, and derive 
</b></p>
<p><b>some substantial benefits. However, in accordance with international standards, much 
</b></p>
<p><b>more needs to be done to recognize and respect the rights of marginalized indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples over their traditional lands and resources, and to provide redress for any land 
</b></p>
<p><b>that has been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior 
</b></p>
<p><b>and informed consent. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The Government of Namibia should step up efforts to address the problem of 
landlessness of San groups and to carry out initiatives to secure for them rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>land, and do so, to the extent compatible with the rights of others, in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>their historical or traditional land tenure patterns.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The Ministry of Lands and Resettlement should be provided with an increased 
budget to purchase lands for the purpose of resettlement. The selection of lands 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be done in close coordination with the groups concerned and in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with prior feasibility studies. Lands purchased should be sufficient in size, location, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and quality to guarantee that resettled groups have a sustainable basis for their 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural development.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> Resettled San groups should be provided with the necessary financial and 
technical support to ensure that they are able to establish viable communities, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>support should continue for as long as may be required to achieve this purpose. Non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations in Namibia and abroad should also consider providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance to resettled San communities. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Government should give high priority to purchasing adequate resettlement 
lands for the Hai//om people living in Oshivelo and other similarly situated San 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups who were removed from the Etosha National Park in the 1950s. When 
</b></p>
<p><b>selecting lands, the Government should make all efforts to accommodate the Oshivelo 
</b></p>
<p>community&#8217;s<b> desire to have access to lands in Etosha National Park for tourism 
</b></p>
<p><b>purposes and also receive lands adjacent to the park suitable for agricultural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other economic activities. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Namibia should take measures to reform protected-area laws and policies that 
now prohibit San people, especially the Khwe in Bwabwata National Park and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Hai//om in Etosha National Park, from securing rights to lands and resources that 
</b></p>
<p><b>they have traditionally occupied and used within those parks. The Government should </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>guarantee that San people currently living within the boundaries of national parks are 
</b></p>
<p><b>allowed to stay, with secure rights over the lands they occupy.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> In addition, the Government should take steps to increase the participation of 
San people in the management of park lands, through concessions or other 
</b></p>
<p><b>constructive arrangements, and should minimize any restrictions that prohibit San 
</b></p>
<p><b>from carrying out traditional subsistence and cultural activities within these parks.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Government should review its decision not to allow the Hai//om San people 
to operate a tourism lodge within the boundaries of Etosha National Park under their 
</b></p>
<p><b>current tourism concession. Further, management of concessions should not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>limited to only those Hai//om groups that opt to move to the resettlement farms.  
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Government should enforce the provisions of the Communal Land Reform 
Act that prohibit the erection of fences in communal lands. It should also investigate 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegati</b>ons of illegal fencing in the Nyae Nyae and N&#8225;a<b> Jaqna conservancy areas and 
</b></p>
<p><b>in communal areas occupied by Himba people. Furthermore, efforts should be made 
</b></p>
<p><b>to harmonize any inconsistent laws and policies regarding conservancy areas and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communal lands or other actions that promote competing interests on those lands. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Government should also address the concerns over lands and natural 
resources of other groups, including the long-standing land claim of the Baster people 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the concern over natural resource exploitation expressed by the Nama people.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Self-governance and participation 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Recognition of the traditional authorities of indigenous peoples in Namibia is 
an important step in advancing their rights to self-governance and in maintaining 
</b></p>
<p><b>their distinct identities. The State should review past decisions denying the recognition 
</b></p>
<p><b>of traditional authorities put forth by certain indigenous groups, with a view to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting the recognition of legitimate authorities selected in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional decision-making processes.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In this regard, the Government should confirm the traditional authority of the 
Khwe San in Caprivi as a matter of priority. Further, allegations of discrimination or 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse by the traditional authorities of the dominant tribes in areas inhabited also by 
</b></p>
<p><b>other, smaller tribes live should be investigated and actions taken to sanction any 
</b></p>
<p><b>mistreatment.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Indigenous peoples or tribes that are ethnically distinct from the majority 
tribes are underrepresented in legislative and administrative institutions at both the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and district levels. Affirmative measures should be further developed and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented, in consultation with the affected peoples, to enhance representation by 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous groups at all levels and in all institutions of government, including in 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative and legislative bodies at both the national and district levels. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Consultations should be carried out with the communities that might be 
adversely affected by development projects and the exploitation of natural resources, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including mining taking place near the lands of Nama people, with the aim of 
</b></p>
<p><b>obtaining their free, prior and informed consent for the potential project activities. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The creation of the Division of San Development within the Office of the Prime 
Minister is a positive step towards tackling some of the issues faced by indigenous and 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups, and appears to have potential for improving the lives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples in the country. However, the Division should review its work, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with the groups that it supports, in order to ensure that it is responding 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively to the needs of those groups.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/41/Add.1

</b></p>
<p><b>  Education 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note with satisfaction of the high level of 
attention that Namibia has given to education since independence. The Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also be commended for its progressive laws and policies regarding mother-
</b></p>
<p><b>tongue and culturally appropriate education.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>However, more needs to be done to address the troubling educational situation of 
San and Himba groups in particular, whose members continue to lag behind in 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational attainment relative to other groups. In this connection, Namibia should 
</b></p>
<p><b>work to remove the barriers that are keeping the San, Himba and other groups from 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessing education, including in relation to school development fees, distances from 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools, and bullying faced in schools. Himba people should not be forced to abandon 
</b></p>
<p><b>their traditional, semi-nomadic way of life in order to gain access to education, and thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government should strengthen efforts to provide mobile schools in remote areas. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Government should make greater efforts to respond to the problems facing 
indigenous women and girls and investigate any allegations of sexual abuse of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous girls in schools. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Health 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should make concerted efforts to address the structural 
factors contributing to the health problems suffered by indigenous peoples in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country, including poverty and a lack of access to their traditional lands and natural 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources. Measures also need to be taken to combat discrimination against 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples in health centres and to ensure that those people who use their own 
</b></p>
<p><b>language can communicate with and understand medical staff.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Namibia must strengthen efforts to collect data disaggregated by ethnicity in 
order to appropriately identify, monitor and evaluate health services provided to 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged indigenous peoples.  
</b></p>
