FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The forward-looking statements are only predictions and provide our current expectations
or  forecasts  of  future  events  and  financial  performance  and  may  be  identified  by  the  use  of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,”
“plans,” “intends,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or
comparable terminology, though the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a
statement  is  not  forward-looking.  Forward-looking  statements  include  all  matters  that  are  not
historical  facts  and  include,  without  limitation  statements  concerning:  our  business  strategy,
outlook,  objectives,  future  milestones,  plans,  intentions,  goals,  and  future  financial  condition,
including the period of time for which our existing resources will enable us to fund our operations.
We  intend  that  all  forward-looking  statements  be  subject  to  the  safe-harbor  provisions  of  the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to many
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying
on  any  of  these  forward-looking  statements.  They  are  neither  statements  of  historical  fact  nor
guarantees or assurances of future performance.
The  forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  Report  or  the  documents  incorporated  by
reference  herein  speak  only  of  their  respective  dates.  Factors  or  events  that  could  cause  our
actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict them
all. Except to the extent required by applicable laws, rules or regulations, we do not undertake
any  obligation  to  publicly  update  any  forward-looking  statements  or  to  publicly  announce
revisions to any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
(i) Principal products or services and their markets;
Nexgen Applied Solutions Inc. ("Nexgen" or the "Company") was organized under the laws of
the State of Nevada on March 24, 2006. The company was originally organized for the purpose
of acquiring and developing mineral claims (SIC Code: 1000). However, on April 14, 2014, the
Company completed a name change from Viking Minerals Inc. to Nexgen Applied Solutions Inc.
to  pursue  business  opportunities  in  agriculture,  specifically  supporting  the  cannabis  industry
production.  On  June  30,  2014,  the  company  acquired  River  Ridge  Sunshine  Farms  LLC,  a
Washington State corporation, which holds a lease on 40 acres of agricultural land in Benton
County, Washington. The company intends to develop the land for the purpose of subleasing the
land and agricultural buildings to licensed cannabis producers (SIC Code: 6519) in Washington
State.
(ii) Distribution methods of the products or services;
Not applicable
(iii) Status of any publicly announced new product or service;
Not applicable
(iv) Competitive business conditions and the smaller reporting company's competitive position in
the industry and methods of competition;
Currently we are engaged in the business of leasing land and buildings to licensed cannabis
producers in the state of Washington who don’t have the financial resources to purchase land
and build their own greenhouses. There are other public and private companies which compete
with us in this area. However, we believe that our principal competitive advantage is our location
in Benton County, one of the most fertile regions in the state.
The  recent  growth  in  the  industry,  particularly  in  Washington,  has  attracted  many  businesses
trying to enter the market. Some of our competitors have greater capital resources and facilities
which  may  enable  them  to  compete  more  effectively  in  this  market  by  offering  more  attractive
terms.  Due  to  this  competition,  there  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  not  encounter  difficulties  in
generating revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new
entrants to the market, this will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.
3
(v) Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers;
Not applicable
(vi) Dependence on one or a few major customers;
Currently we have only one tenant leasing from us. Our revenue is generated solely from the rent
paid  by  this  client  so  we  are  dependent  on  the  success  of  our  tenant  in  order  to  generate
revenue. The product could suffer mold or mildew during any stage of the production cycle from
planting, growing, harvesting, and drying. Furthermore, the product could fail the State mandated
tests for any number of reasons. Any of these situations would render the product unsellable.
Until the product is sold by our tenant, our tenant is unlikely to have sufficient financial resources
to meet the obligations of their lease.
(vii) Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor
contracts, including duration;
Not applicable
(viii) Need for any government approval of principal products or services.
Not applicable
(ix) Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business;
Under  federal  law,  it  is  illegal  to  possess,  use,  buy,  sell,  or  cultivate  marijuana,  since
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, claiming it has
a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use. This means that Congress has
determined  that  marijuana  is  a  dangerous  drug  and  that  the  illegal  distribution  and  sale  of
marijuana is a serious crime.
In  November  2012,  voters  in  Washington  approved  the  legalization  of  non-medical  use  of
cannabis, however under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law
pre-empts conflicting state laws. Therefore, the company is operating in an industry that walks
the line between what is legal in the state and illegal federally.
The majority of the states across the US have created exemptions for medical cannabis use, as
well  as  decriminalized  non-medical  cannabis  use  and  the  rest  of  the  states  are  expected  to
follow.  However,  multiple  efforts  to  remove  cannabis  from  under  the  federal  Controlled
Substances Act have so far been unsuccessful. This means there exists a clear conflict between
Federal and state law which has yet to be resolved.
Although Washington has enacted voter initiated measures to allow for the personal use of small
amounts  of  cannabis  by  its  citizens,  the  State  has  been  very  clear  to  remind  its  citizens  that
cannabis is currently illegal under federal law and classified as a Class I Controlled Substance.
Since  the  Company  only  leases  land  and  infrastructure  to  cannabis  producers,  we  are  not
directly involved in the production, processing, or distribution of illegal products. However, our
operations  clearly  support  such  activities  so  we  could  be  deemed  to  facilitate  the  selling  or
distribution of such products and therefore be in violation of the federal Controlled Substances
Act anyway or, at the very least, considered to be aiding or abetting, or being an accessory to, a
violation of that Act.
Should  the  federal  government  decide  to  override  the  state  regulations  and  enforce  the
Controlled  Substance  Act,  our  land  and  buildings  could  be  seized  under  civil  forfeiture
regulations for our involvement, albeit indirectly, in illegal activities. However, even if they did not
seize our property, they could seize or destroy our tenant’s crop before they can sell it hampering
their ability to meet their lease obligations.
Changes in the laws or enforcement of  such  laws,  especially  in  light  of  the  upcoming  federal
election, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. However,
such changes or their impact are impossible to predict.
(x) Estimate of the amount spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and
development activities, and if applicable, the extent to which the cost of such activities is borne
directly by customers;
Not applicable

(xi) Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local); and
Not applicable
(xii) Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
On March 31, 2016, the company had one employee: our director, Robert Coleridge
ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS
As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide this information.
ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES
On June 30, 2014, the Company acquired River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC, a Washington state
corporation  in  exchange  for  62,000,000  shares.  The  acquisition  was  valued  at  $51,482,197,
which  is  the  closing  market  value  of  the  shares  of  $0.83  per  share  on  June  30,  2014,  plus
$22,197, which is the net book value of the assets and liabilities of River Ridge Sunshine Farms
on the acquisition date. River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC holds a 10 year lease on a 40 acre
property.
The property is located in Benton County in the south-central portion of the state of Washington
(see Figure 1). This region is known primarily for agricultural, in particular as a successful wine
region  because  of  its  unique  microclimates  and  soil  conditions.  Yakima  Valley,  where  our
property is located, was the first American Viticultural Area established within Washington State,
gaining recognition in 1983.
Figure 1: Map of Washington State highlighting Benton County
The 40 acre property is owned by our former Chief Operations Officer, Ricardo Esparza, who has
leased it to our subsidiary for a nominal monthly fee. The principal terms of the lease agreement
are as follows:
·
10 year initial term, renewable for an unlimited number of subsequent 10 year terms at rates to be
negotiated; and
·
$1,000 per month, payable to Mr. Esparza, for each parcel subleased to licensed cannabis
producers.
Thus far, our subsidiary has subleased one 3.86 acre parcel at 22604 Hosko Road in the city of
Prosser to Fourdub LLC, a licensed Tier 3 Producer.
5
Figure 2: Leased Land Parcels (Subleased parcel highlighted)
The original terms of the sublease agreement were as follows:
·
5 year initial term, renewable for an unlimited number of subsequent 5 year terms at rates to be
negotiated;
·
$2.50  per  square  foot  per  month  for  21,000  square  feet  of  garden  canopy  based  on  existing
improvements and outdoor growing;
·
Upon completion of greenhouse construction of suitable size to accommodate year round indoor
growing, rent will increase to $9.52 per square foot per month for 21,000 square feet of garden
canopy;
·
If  the  Company  fails  to  complete  the  greenhouse  construction,  the  tenant  may  terminate  the
lease, without penalty, before the end of the initial term; and
·
Payment of rent was deferred until November 1, 2015 to allow time for tenant to harvest and sell
their first crop.
The  existing  subleased  parcel  currently  includes  perimeter  fencing,  security  cameras,  septic
system, water supply, two small greenhouses, and an administration/warehouse building. The
large open space within the fenced area is used for growing crops outdoors (see Figures 3, 4 & 5
on  following  page).  Construction  of  a  large  greenhouse,  as  contemplated  by  the  sublease
agreement summarized above, has not commenced as we are still seeking financing. In addition,
we will be seeking legal advice to determine the impact, if any, of recent zoning changes within
the county.
In the 2015 growing season, the tenant’s  crop  yield  was  lower  than  expected  and  prices  had
dropped  such  that  the  tenant  was  unable  to  meet  their  lease  commitments.  The  Company
decided to waive rent for that season and, effective May 1, 2016, the terms of the lease were
modified as follows:
·
$0.63 per square feet of garden canopy;
·
Minimum  payment  of  $3,000  per  month  towards  the  lease  with  the  balance  accruing  until  the
tenant sells their crop;
·
Tenant pays for all utilities and ground maintenance at the property.
The addendum to the sublease agreement is attached to this Annual Report as Exhibit 10-4.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On  February  29,  2016,  the  Company  reported  that  it  had  entered  into  a  share  exchange
agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Teascom UK Limited (“Teascom”). The
acquisition was expected to close on April 15, 2016. On April 7, 2016, Secure Channels Inc. (the
“Plaintiff”)  filed  a  complaint  in  the  Superior  Court  of  California  alleging  that  Teascom  was  in
breach  of  a  contract  over  the  Plaintiff’s  planned  use  of  the  intellectual  property  owned  by
Teascom. A hearing on this matter was held on April 11, 2016. The court dismissed the lawsuit
but  granted  leave  for  the  Plaintiff  to  amend  their  complaint  and  re-file.  With  the  uncertainty
surrounding  the  lawsuit,  the  Company  and  Teascom  mutually  agreed  to  terminate  the  share
exchange agreement effective April 13, 2016.
Even with the termination of the share exchange agreement, the Plaintiff amended and refiled the
lawsuit on April 23, 2016, specifically alleging that the Company and Robert Coleridge conspired
with Teascom to breach the Plaintiff’s contract with Teascom. The matter was heard on July 11,
2016 before the Orange County Superior Court of California which granted our motion to quash.
We are not aware of any other pending or threatened legal actions to which we are a party or of
which  our  property  is  the  subject  that  would,  if  determined  adversely  to  us,  have  a  material
adverse effect on our business and operations.
We have from time to time been  involved  in  disputes  and  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary
course  of  business.  In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  are  also  potentially  susceptible  to
litigation, such as claims asserting violations of securities laws. Any such claims, with or without
merit, if not resolved, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. There can be no
assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward-looking statements. See
“Forward-Looking  Statements”  preceding  Item  1  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for
additional factors relating to such statements.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Report.
Overview
Nexgen Applied Solutions Inc. ("Nexgen" or the "Company") was organized under the laws of
the State of Nevada on March 24, 2006 to explore mineral properties in North America on April
14, 2014 the Company completed its name change from Viking Minerals Inc. to Nexgen Applied
Solutions Inc..
The  company  was  originally  organized  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  and  developing  mineral
claims (SIC Code: 1000). On June 30, 2014, the company acquired River Ridge Sunshine Farms
LLC, a Washington State corporation, and in so doing, changed its business to that of real estate
development  for  the  purpose  of  leasing  land  and  agricultural  buildings  to  licensed  cannabis
producers.
Results of Operations
The Year Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended March 31, 2015
Revenues
The company had recorded rental income of $410,000 from the tenant on the property. However,
the  payment  of  rent  was  deferred  until  the  tenant  was  able  to  harvest  and  sell  their  crops.
Unfortunately, the yield was lower than expected and prices dropped such that the tenant was
unable to meet their financial agreements under the lease the agreement. Therefore, all reported
rental income has been offset by a bad debt allowance such that no income was earned in either
year.
Land Lease
The  company  leases  land  from  our  former  Chief  Operating  Office  for  $1000  per  month  and
subleases it to a licensed cannabis grower. For the year ending March 31, 2015, the company
had accrued 9 months of lease payments starting in July 2014 and 12 months of lease payments
for the year ended March 31, 2016.
10
Management Fees
The  Company  incurred  $233,333  in  management  fees  in  the  year  ending  March  31,  2016
compared  to  $31,102,182  in  the  prior  year.  The  management  fees  were  almost  entirely  stock
based  (with  the  exception  of  $29,960  in  cash  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2015).  The
difference  between  the  two  years  can  be  attributed  to  the  difference  in  the  number  of  shares
issued and the applicable market value of the stock on the date of issuance as follows:

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) were $37,986 and $51,660 for the years ended
March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
was due to an overall decrease in operating expenses now that the construction is completed
and the tenant in occupying the property.
For  the  year  ended  March  31,  2016,  our  G&A  consisted  of  automobile  expenses  of  $2,244,
insurance  of  $2,568,  transfer  agent  fees  of  $8,661,  EDGAR  fees  of  $7,812,  security  fees  of
$7,796, telephone expenses of $3,208, and numerous other minor administrative costs.
Interest Expense
During the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded interest expenses of $132,737 compared to
$450,285 in the prior period. This decrease is is attributable to the conversion of some of our debt
to equity.
Professional Fees
During the year ended March 31, 2016, we incurred professional fees of $46,473 compared to
$17,530 in the prior period. However, this increase is attributable to an increase in accounting
fees  related  to  updating  our  annual  reports  in  response  to  comments  from  the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission.
Repairs and maintenance
During  the  year  ended  March  31,  2016,  our  repairs  and  maintenance  costs  were  $5,473
compared to $5,774 in the prior period.
Non-operating Expenses
For  the  year  ending  March  31,  2016,  our  non-operating  expenses  were  $nil  compared  to
$51,638,410  in  the  prior  year.  In  2015,  we  wrote  off  $156,212  of  a  $185,000  investment  in
Nexgen Union LLC as we were only able to recover $28,778 of the funds we had advanced once
we cancelled the acquisition. In addition, we determined that the goodwill of $51,482,198 from
our acquisition of our subsidiary should be fully impaired because the subsidiary has thus far
failed to generate any revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which
assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. During the year ended March 31, 2016, we incurred losses of
$504,359 in our operating activities. As at March 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of
$544,943 and an accumulated deficit of $114,895,410. Our ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the
necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due. There is no assurance that these events will be satisfactorily
completed.
11
Net  cash  used  in  operating  activities  for  the  years  ended  March  31,  2016  and  2015,  was
$126,342 and $99,119, respectively. This increase can be attributed almost entirely to increased
professional fees.
Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, was $796
and $399,112, respectively. The amounts in 2015 are attributable to our construction project and
the investment in Indie Growers Union. The amount in 2016 was a small capital expenditure on
the property.
Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  for  the  years  ended  March  31,  2016and  2015,  was
$122,800  and  $502,699,  respectively.  With  construction  completed,  our  cash  requirements
decreased accordingly.
Our  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  are  dependent  on  our  ability  to  obtain  additional
financing and generate revenues from the property.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires
us  to  make  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported.  Note  2  -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements describes
the  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial
statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
August 24, 2016
Board of Directors
Indie Growers Association
Carson City, NV
We have audited the accompanying amended consolidated balance sheets of Nexgen Applied
Solutions Inc. and its subsidiary (collectively, the “Company”) as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and
the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  stockholders’  equity,  and  cash  flows,  as
amended, for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements, as amended, are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over  financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the amended financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Indie Growers Association and its subsidiary as of
March 31, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  assuming  that  the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements,  the  Company  has  suffered  recurring  losses  from  operations  and  has  a  significant
accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from
operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The
consolidated  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  that  might  result  from  the
outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2016
1. ORGANIZATION
The company, Viking Minerals Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
March 24, 2006 with 75,000,000 authorized common shares, par value of $0.001 per share. In
January  2011,  the  company  filed  an  amendment  with  the  state  of  Nevada  to  increase  the
authorized shares to 400,000 common shares, par value of $0.001 per share. The Company’s
fiscal year end is March 31st.
On April 14, 2014 the Company changed its name to Indie Growers Association and completed a
1:200 reverse stock consolidation.
The  company  was  originally  organized  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  and  developing  mineral
claims.  On  June  30,  2014,  the  company  acquired  River  Ridge  Sunshine  Farms  LLC,  a
Washington  State  corporation,  and  in  so  doing,  changed  its  business  to  that  of  real  estate
development for the purpose of leasing land and infrastructure to licensed cannabis producers.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
On  April  4,  2016,  the  Company  changed  its  name  to  Nexgen  Applied  Solutions  Inc.  and
completed a 1:100 reverse stock consolidation.
All  share  amounts  in  these  financial  statements  have  been  restated  to  reflect  the  stock
consolidations on April 14, 2014 and April 4, 2016.
These financial statements are presented on the basis that we will continue as a going concern.
The going concern concept contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business.
At March 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit, stockholders’ deficit and operating
losses for the past two years. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company is attempting to generate sufficient
revenues,  the  Company’s  cash  position  may  not  be  enough  to  support  the  Company’s  daily
operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.
Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business
plan and generate sufficient revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a
going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase revenues
and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further
implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with a maturity
date of 90 days or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The company had a cash balance
of $129 and $4,469 as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic  net  loss  per  share  amounts  are  computed  based  on  the  weighted  average  number  of
shares  actually  outstanding.  Diluted  net  loss  per  share  amounts  are  computed  using  the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares
had been issued on the exercise of the common share rights unless the exercise becomes anti-
dilutive and then the basic and diluted per share amounts are the same.
F-6
Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The Company regularly evaluates
estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts,
historical  experience  and  various  other  factors  it  believes  to  be  reasonable  under  the
circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying
values  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  accrual  of  costs  and  expenses  that  are  not  readily
apparent  from  other  sources.  The  actual  results  experienced  by  the  Company  may  differ
materially  and  adversely  from  the  Company's  estimates.  To  the  extent  there  are  material
differences  between  the  estimates  and  the  actual  results,  future  results  of  operations  will  be
affected. The most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the
carrying values of the expected lives of buildings and infrastructure, determination of fair values
of stock based transactions and valuation of deferred income taxes.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in
which  it  incurs  an  obligation  associated  with  the  retirement  of  tangible  long-lived  assets  that
result  from  the  acquisition,  construction,  development  and/or  normal  use  of  the  assets.  The
estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation is based on the current cost escalated at an
inflation rate and discounted at a credit adjusted risk-free rate. This liability is capitalized as part
of the cost of the related asset and amortized over its useful life. The liability accretes until the
Company settles the obligation. To date the Company has not incurred any measurable asset
retirement obligations.
Capital Assets
A Capital Asset is defined as a unit of tangible property that: (1) has an economic useful life of
more than 12 months; and (2) was acquired or produced for a cost of more than $500, including
acquisition and installation costs on the same invoice.
Capital  Assets  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated
impairment losses. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized
as  a  separate  asset,  as  appropriate,  only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits
associated  with  the  item  will  flow  to  the  Company  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of operations during the
financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying
amount and are recognized in the statement of operations.
Depreciation of capital assets is computed as follows:
Furniture and fixtures
Computer equipment
Buildings and infrastructure
7 year straight line
5 year straight line
30 year straight line
Leasehold Improvements
Straight line over the term of lease
Leasehold Improvements
Straight line over the term of lease
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to revenue recognition principles presented in SAB
Topic 13. First, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; Second, delivery has occurred
or services have been rendered; Third, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and
Fourth, collectability is reasonably assured.
The  Company  only  source  of  income  is  from  its  sole  tenant  who  subleases  our  land  and
buildings. We had no revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 because our tenant did
not occupy the property until May 1, 2015. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded
$416,000 in revenue in accordance with the sublease agreement between the tenant and our
subsidiary.  Our  agreement  with  the  tenant  was  that  the  lease  amount  payable  would  accrue
monthly  but  payment  was  deferred  until  the  tenant  could  harvest  and  sell  his  crop.  This  was
anticipated to take place at or before the end of October 2015. After numerous delays, less than
expected crop yield, and falling cannabis prices, we determined in the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year  ending  March  31,  2016  that  the  tenant  would  be  unable  to  meet  their  lease  obligations.
Therefore,  no  revenue  was  recognized  in  the  fourth  quarter  as  there  was  no  reasonable
assurance of collection and the revenue was offset by bad debt expense.
F-7
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow - During the year ending March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company primarily received
cash for the issuance of convertible debt notes. The notes are unsecured, due on demand, bear
interest at 5%, and convertible at par value of $0.001 per share. The shares are not subject to
forward or reverse stock splits unless the shares have been converted and issued prior to any
such  forward  or  reverse  stock  split.  The  Company  received  $107,258  and  $432,309  of
convertible debt financing in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Cash flows used in operations for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ($126,343)
and ($99,118), respectively.
Since  inception  the  Company  has  relied  upon  proceeds  from  convertible  debt  to  fund  its
operations. The Company anticipates continuing to rely on such finding until its tenant is able to
make  lease  payments.  Conversion  of  the  debt  into  shares  will  result  in  dilution  to  its  existing
stockholders. Until the growing season is completed, there is no assurance that the Company
will receive any lease revenue or that it can arrange any other financing to fund our operations.
Capital Resources – As of March 31, 2016, the Company had cash of $129 compared to cash of
$4,469 as of March 31, 2015.
Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company has extended unsecured credit to its only tenant. Accounts receivable related to
lease  revenue  is  recorded  monthly  in  accordance  with  the  sublease  agreement  between  the
tenant  and  our  subsidiary.  At  March  31,  2016,  the  tenant  was  unable  to  meet  its  financial
obligations  due  to  low  crop  yield  and  dropping  cannabis  prices.  Consequently,  the  company
wrote down accounts receivable from the tenant in its entirety.
As we currently only have one tenant and the cannabis industry is still in a state of unpredictable
change,  there  is  the  potential  risk  that  this  could  occur  again.  However,  to  mitigate  the  risk,
commencing May 1, 2016, the monthly lease rate has been reduced and the tenant to making
minimum monthly payments to pay down a portion of the receivable.
The Company will continue to evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts on a
regular basis.
Convertible Debt
According  to  ASC  470-20-25-5  “Recognition  General  Beneficial  Conversion  Features”,  an
embedded beneficial conversion feature present in a convertible instrument shall be recognized
separately at issuance by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that
feature to additional paid-in capital.
Paragraph 470-20-30-4 provides guidance on measuring intrinsic value that applies to both the
determination  of  whether  an  embedded  conversion  feature  is  beneficial  and  the  allocation  of
proceeds  and  paragraph  470-20-30-5  states  that  the  effective  conversion  price  based  on  the
proceeds  received  for  or  allocated  to  the  convertible  instrument  shall  be  used  to  compute  the
intrinsic value, if any, of the embedded conversion option.
According  to  paragraphs  intrinsic  value  shall  be  calculated  at  the  commitment  date  as  the
difference  between  the  conversion  price  and  the  fair  value  of  the  common  stock  or  other
securities into which the security is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the
security is convertible.
In accordance with the convertible debt agreement, the conversion price is par value of $0.001
per share. Accordingly, the Company assessed the conversion option and determined that during
the period the notes had a beneficial conversion feature with intrinsic values in excess of the
debt.  Therefore,  the  Company  fully  amortized  the  conversion  benefit  in  each  fiscal  year  and
recorded  is  as  an  interest  expense.  The  beneficial  conversion  feature  was  $107,258  and
$432,309 in the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The  Company  reviews  and  evaluates  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  at  year  end  or  when
events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  related  carrying  amounts  may  not  be
recoverable.  The  assets  are  subject  to  impairment  consideration  under  ASC  360-10-35-17  if
events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might not be recoverable. When the
Company determines that an impairment analysis should be done, the analysis will be performed
using rules of ASC 930-360-35, Asset Impairment, and 360-10-15-3 through 15-5, Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
F-8
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for share-based payments pursuant to ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”.
Stock compensation expense is expensed immediately under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 when
stock  or  options  are  awarded  for  previous  or  current  service  without  further  recourse.  The
Company  has  issued  stock  to  its  director  who  continues  to  provide  services  to  the  Company.
Consequently, under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18, these issuances were recognized as expense in
the period issued because they were given as a form of payment for services already rendered
with no recourse.
Since the Company’s stock is publicly traded, the value is determined based on the number of
shares issued and the trading value of the stock on the date of the transaction.
The company recognized $233,333 in expenses for stock based compensation to the Company’s
Director in the year ended March 31, 2016 and $31,072,222 in stock based compensation to the
Company’s current Director and two former Officers in the year ended March 31, 2015.
Investments
Investments  in  companies  that  are  not  consolidated,  but  over  which  the  Company  exercises
significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Whether or not the
Company exercises significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of
several  factors,  including,  among  others,  ownership  level.  Under  the  equity  method  of
accounting,  an  investee  company’s  accounts  are  not  reflected  within  the  Company’s  Balance
Sheets and Statements of Operations; however, the Company’s share of the earnings or losses
of  the  investee  company  is  reflected  in  the  Company’s  statements  of  operations  and  the
Company’s carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the Company’s
balance sheets. The Company evaluates these investments for other-than-temporary declines in
value each quarterly period. Any impairment found to be other than temporary would be recorded
through a charge to earnings.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, which
defines  fair  value,  establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  in  GAAP,  and  expands
disclosures  about  fair  value  measurements.  ASC  820  does  not  require  any  new  fair  value
measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value
hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes
between  assumptions  based  on  market  data  (observable  inputs)  and  an  entity’s  own
assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:
·
Level one – Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
·
Level two – Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
·
Level  three  –  Unobservable  inputs  developed  using  estimates  and  assumptions,  which  are
developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would
use.
The only financial instrument on the Company’s balance sheet is cash as outlined below:

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of ASC 740. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for net operating loss and other credit carry forwards and the
future  tax  consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in  which  the  tax  effect  of  transactions  are  expected  to  be  realized.  The  effect  on  deferred  tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the
year that includes the enactment date.
F-9
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a full valuation allowance since it is more likely than not that
the amount will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or
noncurrent  based  on  the  classification  of  the  underlying  asset  or  liability  giving  rise  to  the
temporary difference or the expected date of utilization of the carry forwards.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On  June  10,  2014,  The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
Financial  Reporting  Requirements,  Including  an  Amendment  to  Variable  Interest  Entities
Guidance  in  Topic  810,  consolidation,  which  removes  all  incremental  financial  reporting
requirements from GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from
the  FASB  Accounting  Standards  Codification.  For  the  first  annual  period  beginning  after
December 15, 2014, the presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be
required for the public business entities. The revised consolidation standards are effective one
year later, in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company  adopted  the  amendment  as  of  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2015.  Adopting  this
amendment did not have an impact on the presentation of these financial statements.
In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01 eliminating the concept of extraordinary items
for presentation on the face of the income statement. Under the new standard, a material event or
transaction  that  is  unusual  in  nature,  infrequent  or  both  shall  be  reported  as  a  separate
component of income from continuing operations. Alternatively, it may be disclosed in the notes
to financial statements. The new accounting guidance is required for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted if applied from the beginning of a
fiscal year. As applicable, this standard may change the presentation of amounts in the income
statements.  We  elected  to  adopt  ASU  2015-01  effective  January  1,  2016.  Adopting  this
amendment did not have an impact on the presentation of these financial statements.
There  are  several  new  accounting  pronouncements  issued  by  the  Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  which  are  not  yet  effective.  Each  of  these  pronouncements,  as
applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. As of March 31, 2016, none of these
pronouncements  is  expected  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows of the Company.
3. ACQUISITION OF A PROPERTY
On April 8, 2014, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with the unit holders of
Indie  Growers  Union  LLC  of  Washington  state  wherein  the  Company  would  issue  a  total  of
875,000  shares  (87,500,000  pre-reverse  split)  shares  of  common  stock  and  $185,000  cash  in
exchange for all of the outstanding member units and assets of Indie Growers Union LLC. The
company  advanced  $185,000  but  cancelled  the  agreement  prior  to  issuing  the  shares.  The
company  recovered  $28,788  of  the  $185,000  cash  and  recorded  an  investment  loss  of
$(156,212) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.
On June 30, 2014, the Company acquired River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC, a Washington state
corporation in exchange for 620,000 shares (62,000,000 pre reverse split). The market value of
the Company’s shares on the July 15, 2014, the date the shares were issued, was $0.83 per
share thereby valuing the acquisition at $51,460,000.
River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC holds a 10 year lease on a 40 acre property which has been
subleased  to  a  licensed  cannabis  producer.  The  Net  Book  Value  of  the  acquired  assets  and
liabilities  at  June  30,  2014  was  (22,198)  therefore  the  transaction  has  been  recorded  as  an
acquisition of goodwill where goodwill is in excess of the purchase price as follows:
Share Value
Net book value of acquired assets
Goodwill
51,460,000
22,198
51,482,198
However,  no  revenue  was  generated  from  leases  in  the  year  ended  March  31,  2015  so  the
company determined that the value of this acquisition should be fully impaired. An impairment of
goodwill  was  recorded  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations  effective  as  of  the  date  of
acquisition.

7. TENANT LEASE INCENTIVE
As an incentive to sign a five year lease, the Company provided the tenant with $30,000 of cash
incentives consisting of $20,000 of planting supplies and $10,000 reduction in their lease. This
incentive was amortized on a straight line basis over the 5 year initial lease term to reduce each
month’s rental income.
When the tenant was unable to meet their financial obligations for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2016 and with the ongoing uncertainty in the cannabis industry, the Company determined
that  it  is  uncertain  if  it  can  collect  on  this  incentive  and  should  fully  expense  the  remaining
balance of $26,000 as bad debt.
8. VENDOR INCENTIVE
In  December  2013,  the  Company’s  current  transfer  agent  paid  off  the  outstanding  balance  of
$5,717 owed to the former transfer agent. This has been recorded as a deferred vendor incentive.
It has been amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term of 5 years such that each
year’s  portion  of  the  incentive  will  be  offset  against  transfer  agent  fees  in  the  statement  of
operations.

Subsequent to the March 31, 2016 year end, the Company changed transfer agents prior to the
end of the 5 year contract term. For early termination, the Company was required to pay back the
original amount of the vendor incentive which was added to the termination fees charged by the
outgoing transfer agent.
9. INCOME TAXES
For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses from operations and,
therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has
been fully reserved.
The provision for Federal income tax at the expected rate of 34% consists of the following:

As  the  criteria  for  recognizing  deferred  income  tax  assets  have  not  been  met  due  to  the
uncertainty of realization, a valuation allowance of 100% has been recorded for the current and
prior year.

10. CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES
As of March 31, 2016, the Company had accumulated $ 436,512 in convertible promissory notes
($443,754 at March 31, 2015). The unsecured notes are due on demand, bear interest at 5%, and
convertible at $0.001. The shares are not subject to forward or reverse stock splits unless the
shares  have  been  converted  and  issued  prior  to  any  such  forward  or  reverse  stock  split.
Therefore, if the balance outstanding was converted into common shares, the amount of stock to
be issued would be 436,512,000 common shares.
During  the  year  ended  March  31,  2016,  the  company  received  $107,258  of  convertible  debt
financing  (Year  ended  March  31,  2015:  $432,309).  The  Company  assessed  the  conversion
option and determined that during the period the note had a beneficial conversion feature with
intrinsic  values  in  excess  of  the  debt.  Therefore,  the  Company  fully  amortized  a  conversion
benefit of $107,258 for the current period and recorded is as an interest expense as of March 31,
2016 (Year ended March 31, 2015: $432,309).
During the year ended March 31, 2016, the company issued 1,150,000 shares (115,000,000 pre
reverse split) for the settlement of $115,000 of convertible debt. During the year ended March 31,
2015, the company issued 645,000 shares (64,500,000 pre reverse split) for the settlement of
$64,500 of convertible debt.
The convertible notes have accrued interest in accordance with the following table:

ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our  principal  executive  officer,  who  is  also  our  principal  financial  officer,  has  evaluated  the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation,
we have concluded that because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting discussed below, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  Commission’s  rules  and  forms  and  to  ensure  that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  are  accumulated  and  communicated  to  Company’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Notwithstanding the material weakness discussed below, our management has concluded that
the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  this  Form  10-K  present  fairly,  in  all  material
respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control  over  financial  reporting  as  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(f).  The  Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process affected by the Company’s management to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.
In designing and evaluating our internal controls and procedures, our management recognized
that internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only  a  reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  that  the  objectives  of  the  internal  controls  and
procedures are met.
The  Company’s  management  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  its  internal  control  over  financial
reporting as of March 31, 2016. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Internal
Control—Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management identified deficiencies in
both  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial
reporting, which when aggregated, represent a material weakness in internal control. The most
significant of these are: (1) lack of segregation of duties; (2) lack of accounting expertise; and (3)
lack of timely closing of books; (4) inability to get accounting information and schedules to our
auditors in a timely manner.
A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency  or  a  combination  of  deficiencies  in  internal  control  over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The
material weaknesses identified above result from insufficient qualified personnel in our finance
department.  This  results  in  an  inability  to  provide  effective  oversight  and  review  of  financial
transactions  with  regard  to  accumulating  and  compiling  financial  data  in  the  preparation  of
financial  statements.  The  lack  of  sufficient  personnel  also  results  in  a  lack  of  segregation  of
duties  and  the  accounting  technical  expertise  necessary  for  an  effective  system  of  internal
control.  As  soon  as  our  finances  allow,  we  plan  on  hiring  additional  finance  staff  and,  where
necessary,  utilizing  competent  outside  consultants  to  provide  a  layer  of  review  and  technical
expertise that is currently lacking in our internal controls over financial reporting.
As  a  result  of  these  material  weaknesses,  management  concluded  that  the  Company  did  not
maintain effective control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016.
This  annual  report  does  not  include  an  attestation  report  of  the  Company’s  registered  public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not
subject  to  attestation  by  the  Company’s  registered  public  accounting  firm  pursuant  to  an
exemption for smaller reporting companies under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Director and President
The following is a brief summary of the background of each officer and director including their
principal  occupation  during  the  five  preceding  years.  Neither  of  these  persons  is  a  financial
expert  as  that  term  is  defined  by  the  SEC.  All  directors  will  serve  until  their  successors  are
elected and qualified or until they are removed.
Robert Coleridge is a Systems Analyst/Software Engineer with over 35 years' experience in the
software industry, of which 12 of those years he served at Microsoft as a Senior Software Design
Engineer.  He  was  previously  the  CIO  of  Wikifamilies  SA  where  he  spearheaded  the  platform
development and conceptualization of major concepts leading to patent acquisition of a number
of revolutionary concepts. At Microsoft he spent the majority of his time in the areas of creating
and building strategic and visionary working prototypes for a number of the executives, including
Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. While at Microsoft, Mr. Coleridge also had the opportunity to play
key roles in the development and vision that was to become .NET and WCF. He designed and
implemented Microsoft's first SOAP toolkit which today is better known as web services. Today
more  than  6  billion  devices,  including  every  smart  phone,  relies  on  the  software  that  Mr.
Coleridge helped create.

·
Being  found  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  in  a  civil  action,  the  SEC  or  the  Commodity

associated with a member.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.
Section  16(a)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  requires  that  our  executive  officers  and
directors,  and  persons  who  own  more  than  ten  percent  of  a  registered  class  of  our  equity
securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers,
directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us
with  all  Section  16(a)  forms  they  file.  Based  solely  on  our  review  of  the  copies  of  the  forms
received  by  us  and  written  representations  from  certain  reporting  persons  that  they  have
complied with the relevant filing requirements, we believe that, during the year ended March 31,
2016, all of our executive officers, directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.
Stockholder Communications
Our  board  has  determined  not  to  adopt  a  formal  methodology  for  communications  from
stockholders on the belief that any communication would be brought to the board’s attention by
each of our executive officers.
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
We  do  not  currently  have  an  audit  committee  or  a  committee  performing  similar  functions.
Management  as  a  whole  participates  in  the  review  of  financial  statements  and  disclosure.
However, none of our management is a financial expert.

Outstanding Equity Awards
We had no outstanding equity awards as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.
Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment, Change-in-Control Arrangements
As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any new employment agreements.
Employee Pension, Profit Sharing or other Retirement Plans
We do not have a defined benefit, pension plan, profit sharing or other retirement plan, although
we may adopt one or more of such plans in the future.
Risk Assessment in Compensation Programs
Beginning  in  2nd  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2014  we  changed  our  focus  to  serving  the  cannabis
industry  and  we  began  paying  compensation  to  our  employees,  including  executive  and  non-
executive officers. Due to the size and scope of our business, and the amount of compensation
involved,  we  do  not  have  any  employee  compensation  policies  and  programs  to  review  to
determine whether our policies and programs create risks that are reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on us.
ITEM 12 - SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS
(a) Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
The following table shows the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of August 24, 2016
by  each  person  whom  we  know  beneficially  owns  more  than  5%  of  the  outstanding  shares.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act. This
rule deems a person to be a beneficial owner if that person has the right to acquire beneficial
ownership within 60 days through, among other means, conversion of a security. At August 24,
2016, we know of no shareholders, other than management and Bingo Nation Technologies Inc.,
who have been issued more than 5% of our outstanding shares. However, at August 19, 2016,
we owed Ramsay Capital Corp. (“Ramsay”) $469,370 which, at the option of the Ramsay, can be
converted into common shares of the Company at a rate of $0.001 per share. This means that
Ramsay could at any time convert this debt into 469,370,000 common shares of the company as
reflected in the following table:

Note 1: Although deemed to have beneficial ownership for reporting purposes, Ramsay only has
the  right  to  acquire  these  shares  upon  conversion  of  the  debt.  Until  such  time  as  Ramsay
converts this debt into shares and the shares are issued, Ramsay has no voting control over the
securities.
Note 2: Rule 13d-3 deems any securities subject to conversion privileges to be outstanding for
the  purpose  of  computing  the  percentage  of  outstanding  securities  of  the  class  owned  by
such person. Therefore, the percentage of class outstanding is based on the shares subject to
conversion plus the 52,633,027 shares of common stock outstanding as of August 19, 2016.
Note  3:  As  the  authorized  signatory  of  Ramsay  Capital  Corp.,  Jose  Pineda  has  voting  and
investment control over Ramsay. Mr. Pineda may be reached c/o Ramsay at the above listed
address.

Note 4: As the directors and shareholders of Bingo Nation Technologies Inc., Mr. Greg Dureault
and Mr. Kevin Kortje have voting and investment control over the listed securities. Mr. Dureault

such  person.  Therefore,  the  percentage  of  class  beneficially  owned  is  based  on  52,633,027
shares  of  common  stock  outstanding  as  of  June  30,  2016  plus  469,370,000  shares  which
Ramsay Capital Corp. could acquire within 60 days by means of debt conversion, for a total of
522,003,027 shares.
