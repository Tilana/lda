<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises outlines new developments in the 
field of business and human rights, including the deeper alignment between global 
governance frameworks and the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the 
call by the Human Rights Council for the United Nations system as a whole to integrate the 
business and human rights agenda into its work, and the need for the post-2015 framework 
to integrate the Guiding Principles. The Working Group notes the growing interest and 
demand for support and guidance in the implementation of the Guiding Principles, as well 
as the continuing existence of specific situations of grave concern with regard to the 
adverse impact on human rights of business activities. It describes the key results from 
surveys of States and business enterprises, including on the challenges faced in 
implementation. The Working Group also outlines the key trends and challenges identified 
during the 2012 Forum on Business and Human Rights. On this basis, the Working Group 
outlines priorities for action and recommendations for States, business enterprises, the 
United Nations system, intergovernmental organizations including regional organizations, 
and other stakeholders.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/4, 
in which the Council established the mandate of the Working Group on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group notes the growing interest of all stakeholder groups, in all 
regions and industries, in the issue of business and human rights and in the Guiding 
Principles. Some 1,000 participants from more than 80 countries registered for the first 
Forum on Business and Human Rights,1 far exceeding expectations. A significant number 
of businesses and States also responded to the pilot surveys of the Working Group and 
indicated a high level of awareness of the Guiding Principles and interest in engaging 
further thereon. 
</p>
<p>3. Another indicator of the increasing global demand for support, guidance and 
clarification in the area of business and human rights is the large number of requests that 
the Working Group responds to as a way to fulfil its mandate to disseminate and encourage 
the comprehensive implementation of the Guiding Principles globally. In 2012, the 
Working Group responded to approximately 30 requests per month to provide expert 
commentary and support for initiatives to set into motion or garner relevant political 
consensus around new or improved efforts on business and human rights aligned with the 
Guiding Principles. Such requests come from all stakeholders, including civil society, 
business and industry bodies at the national and international levels, intergovernmental 
organizations and multi-stakeholder initiatives, as well as State agencies.  
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Working Group identifies the key trends and challenges as 
well as priorities in the dissemination and implementation of the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, based on the Forum discussions, the pilot surveys and the 
information received from stakeholders. On this basis, the Working Group makes specific 
recommendations to advance the implementation of the Guiding Principles, and describes 
specific initiatives it has undertaken in accordance with the strategy it adopted and 
presented in its first report to the Human Rights Council.2 
</p>
<p><b> II. Global developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deepening alignment between global governance frameworks and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Working Group has already drawn attention to key global governance 
frameworks that started embedding the Guiding Principles soon after their adoption in June 
2011.3 Many of these are now further deepening and refining the alignment of their 
respective frameworks with the Guiding Principles. This includes the recommendation 
adopted by the Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) that export credit agencies should carry out human rights due diligence,4 as well as 
the Organization&#8217;s mapping of how the Guiding Principles may be embedded into financial

<p>institutions.5 The Working Group welcomes the review by the Compliance Advisor 
Ombudsman of the International Finance Corporation of its operational guidelines6 and the 
embedding of essential elements of the effectiveness criteria for non-judicial grievance 
mechanisms included in the Guiding Principles.7 The United Nations Conference on Trade 
and Development has been engaging with States to support and encourage the 
implementation of the new Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development that 
uses the Guiding Principles as a key reference.8 Following the call from the European 
Union, more than two thirds of the member States of the European Union have or are 
developing national plans of action on the implementation of the Guiding Principles.9 The 
World Bank is currently in the process of updating its safeguard policies, with an 
opportunity for integrating the Guiding Principles and human rights due diligence into the 
safeguards.10  
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group welcomes the positive contribution that key standard-setting 
international organizations are making to the implementation of the Guiding Principles, and 
encourages further alignment and convergence. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Integration of the business and human rights agenda into the work of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>7. In September 2012, the Human Rights Council adopted its resolution 21/5, in which 
it encouraged all relevant entities of the United Nations system to integrate the business and 
human rights agenda into their activities, with a specific role for OHCHR in this effort. 
Resolution 21/5 filled a long-standing need to clarify the role of the United Nations and to 
designate a focal point on the issue within the United Nations. In the resolution, the Council 
encouraged all stakeholders to integrate the Guiding Principles throughout the work of the 
United Nations human rights system, including the universal periodic Review, the mandates 
of the special procedures and the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>8. In its resolution 21/5, the Human Rights Council clearly indicated that the Guiding 
Principles and the business and human rights agenda concerned the entire United Nations 
system, not only the human rights pillar. The Council set out a specific role for the United 
Nations to build capacity and support efforts, including by calling on United Nations 
resident coordinators and country teams to integrate the Guiding Principles into planning, 
advocacy and capacity-building and development efforts at the national level in cooperation 
with national authorities. Recognizing that the need for greater capacity by all stakeholders 
required levels of resources not currently available within the United Nations system, the 
Council also called on the United Nations to explore the establishment of a global fund to

 7 The Working Group provided comments on the draft of the new operational guidelines that was 
</p>
<p>submitted for public consultation, including a suggestion to ensure that the grievance process and 
outcomes be rights-compatible, in accordance with Guiding Principle 31 (f), as well for the 
Compliance Advisor Ombudsman to exercise leverage with business enterprises to reform policies, 
standards, management systems or common practices that may be enabling factors or underlying 
causes of adverse effects.

<p>support capacity-building efforts to advance the implementation of the Guiding Principles. 
Lastly, the Council called on the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the 
recommendations by the United Nations system in the first report due in June 2014. 
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group welcomes the report of the Secretary-General as well as the 
resolution and recommendations of the Human Rights Council. Implementation of these 
recommendations and the full support and engagement of the United Nations system will be 
necessary to advance in building the capacity of national stakeholders to implement the 
Guiding Principles. The Working Group will collaborate closely with OHCHR and other 
United Nations partners to ensure mainstreaming of the Guiding Principles within the 
United Nations system. Furthermore, the Working Group calls on States and the business 
community to support the establishment of a multi-stakeholder fund to support capacity-
building activities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Development of the post-2015 framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. The General Assembly is expected to adopt in late 2013, at its sixty-eighth session, 
its first resolution on the post-2015 development framework, which will replace the 
Millennium Development Goals. The resolution will be the culmination of an intense 
process of national and global thematic consultations and the establishment of a high-level 
panel by the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group notes and supports the recommendation made by the United 
Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 United Nations Development Agenda that 
human rights should be one of the three fundamental principles (alongside equality and 
sustainability) to form the basis for the post-2015 development agenda and framework.11 
The Working Group further highlights that the role of business is critical to all the trends, 
challenges and opportunities that were identified by the Task Team. 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group therefore calls for the Guiding Principles, which were 
developed to address the global governance gap between the scope and impact of economic 
forces and actors, to be fully integrated into global post-2015 strategies relating to business 
enterprises. Specifically, the Working Group, in its submission to the High-level Panel of 
Eminent Persons on a post-2015 United Nations Development Agenda, called for post-2015 
recommendations addressing the role of business to, at a minimum, be aligned with the 
Guiding Principles and the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Information received by the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>13. In 2012, the Working Group received approximately 40 submissions detailing 
situations of concern. Submissions came primarily from civil society organizations and 
academic researchers, as well as from national human rights institutions and 
intergovernmental organizations. These reports commonly addressed the impact of business 
activity on specific communities, with about 25 per cent of the submissions focusing 
specifically on indigenous peoples. The majority of the reports concerned individuals and 
communities in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America and Caribbean regions. They chiefly 
addressed the alleged negative human rights impact caused by or linked to the mining, 
energy and financial sectors. The most frequent allegations concerned the rights to life,

www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Post_2015_UNTTreport.pdf. </p>


<p>health, food, water, work and adequate housing. The Working Group received an especially 
large number of cases involving conflicts between local communities and businesses over 
land and resources, including multiple reports of forced evictions as well as of businesses 
operating or having an impact on land traditionally used by, or of cultural significance to, 
indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed consent. In many reports it was 
noted that conflicts between communities and businesses had led to the harassment and 
persecution of members of the communities affected, as well as of human rights defenders 
investigating, protesting, seeking accountability and access to remedies for victims of 
alleged abuses linked to business activities. This included instances of arbitrary detention, 
threats, violence and killings, targeting by armed groups, disappearances, restrictions of the 
freedoms of assembly and expression, and other violations of rights. The Working Group 
will continue to receive and analyse such submissions to inform its work and strategy, to 
identify barriers to the effective implementation of the Guiding Principles and gaps in the 
protection of human rights in the context of business activities, and to inform 
recommendations made to States, business and other actors on the implementation of the 
Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Results of pilot surveys of States and business enterprises 
</b></p>
<p>14. Today, policymakers and business enterprises broadly acknowledge that States have 
a duty to protect and that companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, as set out 
in the Guiding Principles. Much attention is therefore now focused on how States and 
business enterprises should or do engage with multiple stakeholders as part of their efforts 
to implement the Guiding Principles, including what issue areas or groups require priority 
attention, and how to identify and disseminate best practices. 
</p>
<p>15. While the Working Group and stakeholders across the globe recognize that 
comprehensive integration of the Guiding Principles into State and corporate policies and 
practices through multi-stakeholder consultation and participation takes time, the current 
political reality around the globe, especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, is 
raising expectations on the issue of corporate conduct. The pace at which States and 
companies act, and the pace of action by the constellation of actors that incentivize and 
facilitate implementation, will certainly need to increase if businesses are to manage social 
and political risk. 
</p>
<p>16. To integrate the Guiding Principles effectively and to increase the pace of action 
requires a solid baseline of credible and complete data on existing initiatives and lessons 
learned that can support States, business enterprises, the United Nations and other 
stakeholders as they progress in their work of disseminating, implementing and embedding 
the Guiding Principles globally. 
</p>
<p>17. To that end, and in order to assess progress and to identify how best to assist the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles, the Working Group has elaborated and 
commissioned two pilot surveys12 of States and business on the issue of business and 
human rights, and awareness and implementation efforts. The Working Group thanks all 
those States and business enterprises that responded to the surveys. 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See A/HRC/23/32/Add.2. The State survey was developed and disseminated in cooperation with 
</p>
<p>Denver University and the University of Minnesota. The corporate survey was developed and 
disseminated in cooperation with the Global Business Initiative, the International Chamber of 
Commerce, the International Organisation of Employers and the University of Denver. Preliminary 
findings from the State survey and the findings of the corporate survey were presented by the 
Working Group at the 2012 Forum on Business and Human Rights. </p>


<p>18. The Working Group further encourages in-depth national surveys of State entities 
and business enterprises on implementation initiatives, to complement the global surveys it 
has commissioned.13 
</p>
<p><b> A. State survey 
</b></p>
<p>19. The discussion surrounding the State&#8217;s duty to protect from human rights abuses and 
adverse effects of corporate activity has developed substantially over the past two decades, 
with the Guiding Principles bringing important clarity to the differentiated and 
complementary roles of States, business and civil society. Today, policymakers and 
business focus therefore not on whether States have a duty to protect against abuse by 
business enterprises, but how States should or do engage with multiple stakeholders to fulfil 
such a duty by means of preventive and remedial measures. States are now widely expected 
to provide explicit guidance to businesses specifically on addressing any adverse impact on 
human rights; to ensure that non-judicial and judicial remedy options are available to those 
communities, workers, consumers, clients and shareholders whose rights have been 
negatively affected by business enterprises; to integrate business and human rights into the 
functions of ministries and agencies that interact with and regulate business activity; and to 
strive to close any potential regulatory or policy gaps that may hinder the fulfilment of their 
duty to protect against corporate human rights abuses. More broadly, international business 
organizations voice their demand for greater observance by the State of the rule of law and 
the enforcement of anti-corruption measures, which are understood to foster a conducive 
environment for business to contribute positively to society and sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>20. Given that States design their laws, policies and programmes in accordance with 
their own local context and their international legal obligations, it is to be expected that the 
Guiding Principles will be implemented in a different way from one State Member of the 
United Nations to the next. Still, as implementation of the Guiding Principles kicks off and 
advances, there will be emerging trends, best practices and lessons that can be learned 
among States with regard to successful measures, obstacles and opportunities to build 
capacity among public officials according to the role they play in the individual State. 
</p>
<p>21. The above issues were the focus of a pilot survey14 addressed to all States Members 
of the United Nations by the Working Group in October 2012, with the purpose of 
obtaining an evidence-based foundation for informing the discussions among stakeholders 
on the implementation of the Guiding Principles. The survey also reminded States of the 
increasing worldwide social expectation, as shown by the global participation in the Forum, 
that they embrace proactively the Guiding Principles. Following an extension of the initial 
deadline, as at 31 January, a total of 26 responses from countries all over the world had 
been received. The Working Group also conducted selected interviews with Member States 
between November 2012 and January 2013 to clarify answers and to collect details of 
relevant State implementation initiatives publicly shared at the Forum. The complete results 
of the survey and the systematization of further information shared by States on the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles are presented in an addendum to the present 
</p>
<p>  
 13 Examples include the baseline surveys among member States of the Association of Southeast Asian 
</p>
<p>Nations (ASEAN) commissioned by the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Resource Centre for ASEAN. 
</p>

<p>report.15 The Working Group wishes to thank the States that answered the survey and 
encourages them to make their answers public.16  
</p>
<p>22. The key results of the survey are described below.17 
</p>
<p>23. The demand for the Guiding Principles does not stem from any one region of the 
world, but spans all regions. There is a clear impetus in Europe following the 
Communication on Corporate Social Responsibility of 2011 issued by the European 
Commission,18 which asked countries to develop national plans of action; a large majority 
of member States have already done so.19 Formal communiqu&#233;s, directives and advice by 
regional bodies or national legislators were mentioned as useful tools to encourage 
implementation of the Guiding Principles by States. 
</p>
<p>24. Though key issue areas on business and human rights vary according to the State, 
the groups of potentially affected stakeholders and the types of rights potentially affected 
by business are still broad. The broad scope of the Guiding Principles is therefore 
appropriate. The challenges associated with business effects in contexts where there is 
violence, armed conflict, piracy or criminal activity were frequently mentioned by States as 
priority focus areas.  
</p>
<p>25. The majority of States that responded to the survey indicated that they had corporate 
social responsibility policies already in place. The extent to which these policies are aligned 
with the Guiding Principles is unclear. Some States have explicitly integrated the Guiding 
Principles into their corporate social responsibility policies, while others have done so 
because they base their policies on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and 
the principles of the Global Compact, both of which take the Guiding Principles as the 
authoritative standard of reference on the issue of managing the adverse human rights 
impact of business. Other States only refer to corporate social responsibility in a general 
way. Some States have focused on particular industries, either by convening or hosting 
specific workshops. Others have worked through collaborative efforts, including multi-
stakeholder initiatives, at the national or the international level, such as the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights, the International Code of Conduct for Private 
Security Service Providers and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.  
</p>
<p>26. Sustainability reporting requirements by States and stock markets have been 
increasing over the years. At the Forum, experts suggested the use of reporting as an 
accessible transparency measure to encourage companies to implement the Guiding 
Principles and further assist human rights due diligence by business partners and 
shareholders. According to the survey, 16 States indicated that they encouraged businesses 
to report on human rights; in 10 States, such reports were mandatory; in five States, they 
were voluntary; while in one State, there were both mandatory and voluntary reporting 
requirements. Most States did not have follow-up protocols for reporting. Some States took 
Global Reporting Initiative reports and Communication on Progress reports of the Global 
</p>
<p>  
 15 A/HRC/23/32/Add.2. 
 16 While answers to the survey were treated anonymously to encourage a greater response rate, some 
</p>
<p>States have nevertheless decided to make their replies public; see 
www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/ImplementationGP.aspx.  
</p>
<p> 17 Care should be taken when interpreting the results. Similar to previous State surveys, no firm 
conclusions may be drawn owing to the low response rate. Given the small sample size, the trends 
and practices included in the present report are not necessarily representative of all States. While 
some countries responded to the entire survey, other countries only responded to a few questions. The 
response rate per question varied considerably. 
</p>
<p> 18 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0681:FIN:EN:PDF.  
 19 Statement by the European Union Special Representative for Human Rights (see footnote 9). </p>


<p>Compact to count as human rights reporting; one had introduced new requirements on 
reporting that specifically ask that human rights due diligence, as contained in the Guiding 
Principles, be demonstrated.  
</p>
<p>27. The national dissemination of laws or policies on business and human rights is a key 
challenge that States face in the implementation of the Guiding Principles. Eight States 
identified public dissemination as a major challenge, while seven lacked the resources to 
promote the policies effectively. Six States also reported a lack of willingness by business 
actors to comply. Six States reported that the State lacked the capacity to implement the 
policy.  
</p>
<p>28. In 10 cases, States reported coordination between their agencies in charge of human 
rights and those on trade and investment. In 14 cases, States reported the inclusion of 
human rights provisions (including on environmental and labour issues) in the agreements 
they had signed. Only five States included human rights provisions in their policies to 
promote foreign export and investment. This would suggest a missed opportunity by States 
to introduce greater coherence.  
</p>
<p>29. Broadly speaking, States can regulate respect for human rights for business in many 
ways. Some States reported existing legislation that captures these issues. Some, however, 
commission legal and regulatory gap analyses. States also attempt to identify priority areas 
to maximize their impact given the resource constraints and the nature of the business and 
human rights challenges companies domiciled in their territory face.  
</p>
<p>30. In the survey, States were asked to indicate, from a list of judicial and non-judicial 
tools, which mechanisms the State used to redress cases of business-related human rights 
impact and abuses within the country. Nine States responded that they used sanctions, while 
six others used some kind of compensation (financial or non-financial). Six States also 
reported using environmental rehabilitation, while five States confirmed that they used 
injunctions or guarantees of non-repetition to ensure prevention of harm. Six States also 
reported the use of public or private apologies. Only two States indicated they had turned to 
land restitution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Business survey 
</b></p>
<p>31. The pilot survey of business elicited more than 100 responses from a diverse group 
of business respondents in terms of industry, size, ownership and geographic location. The 
results of the survey suggest that companies are considering and actively working to 
address human rights with reference to international human rights standards and the 
Guiding Principles. The diversity of business respondents to the survey also point to a new, 
more global and diverse dialogue on business and human rights n the private sector. 
</p>
<p>32. The sample reflected rising awareness of and engagement with the Guiding 
Principles in the business community. According to the survey, efforts are being put into 
human rights policy commitments; identifying, assessing and addressing adverse human 
rights impact; communicating with a range of stakeholders; and supporting or providing for 
access to remedies. These results indicate a strengthening in the trend identified by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises20 in the data gathered in his survey 
of Fortune Global 500 companies, which had already shown that a significant number of 
global firms had human rights policies and practices in place. 
</p>
<p>  
 20 See A/HRC/4/35/Add.3. </p>


<p>33. The survey indicated that, as business enterprises progressively implement the 
Guiding Principles, they face more complex challenges that require a more profound and 
nuanced analysis of required responses. One of the most striking patterns revealed by the 
survey was that, when asked general questions about the components of the responsibility 
to respect (policy commitment, addressing impact, communication and reporting), a large 
number of respondents were confident that their company had some form of practice in 
place. When respondents were asked questions pertaining to how mature or embedded 
practices were, however, the response rate dropped considerably and the number of 
&#8220;unsure&#8221; replies increased. While 82 per cent of respondents agreed that &#8220;when an actual or 
</p>
<p>potential human rights impact is identified, responsibility is allocated to the relevant 
business unit and/or department to resolve the issue and report on progress when 
necessary&#8221;, only 53 per cent agreed that their company tracked progress on addressing such 
impact by developing &#8220;qualitative and quantitative indicators, informed by experts and 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders&#8221;. Similarly, while 91 per cent of respondents expressed that they had 
feedback mechanisms that allowed employees to submit issues of concern to management, 
only 51 per cent replied that their company was &#8220;using grievance data for management 
</p>
<p>systems review and continuous learning&#8221;. Addressing such challenges in implementing 
human rights due diligence and engaging in access to remedy may require innovative 
approaches. Good practices and lessons learned in this field should be identified and shared 
with other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>34. With regard to implementing their policy commitment, challenges included 
difficulties in communicating the policy in a clear way to all relevant external parties and in 
translating the policy commitment into relevant operational procedures. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to understanding cases of human rights impact, challenges included (a) 
uncertainty of how far to go into the supply chain in order to understand impact; (b) 
challenges in access to credible information; (c) a lack of proven methodologies and 
frameworks to help assess impact; and (d) a lack of understanding of how to engage with 
stakeholders where Governments restrict dialogue. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to addressing cases of impact, tracking responses and communication, 
challenges included (a) difficulties in managing situations where leverage over business 
partners is limited, and the difficulties in building such leverage; (b) difficulties in 
addressing impact in situations where human rights are not part of local law or not applied 
in practice; and (c) a lack of understanding of company responsibilities in situations where 
government institutions are lacking.  
</p>
<p>37. With regard to complaints, grievances and access to remedies, challenges included 
(a) difficulties in adapting a grievance mechanism to a cultural context; (b) difficulties in 
building trust in the mechanism; (c) challenges in moving from a complaints hotline to an 
effective grievance mechanism; and (d) difficulties in incorporating grievance mechanisms 
into stakeholder management. 
</p>
<p>38. The survey sample did not indicate significant variations in answers according to 
geographical location, industry or company size. Due attention should be paid to this aspect 
in future surveys and consultations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Forum on Business and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>39. The first annual Forum on Business and Human Rights, held on 4 and 5 December 
2012, in Geneva, brought together approximately 1,000 participants from 85 countries, 
including 50 State delegations and representatives of 150 companies and 180 civil society 
organizations, as well as other groups, with equal participation of men and women. 
Participants included directly affected stakeholders and their representatives, including </p>


<p>many representatives of indigenous peoples. From the business sector, a number of major 
multinational corporations participated from the mining, oil and energy, technology, 
chemicals, banking and finance, electronics and textiles industries. Participants also 
included representatives of 15 specialized agencies of the United Nations system, 17 
intergovernmental organizations and 19 national human rights institutions, as well as other 
key leading organizations with regard to standards on business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>40. A summary of the discussions held during the 21 substantive sessions of the Forum 
was prepared by the chairperson of the Forum.21 Additional materials, including session 
concept notes, statements received, written submissions and video recordings are also 
available for consultation.22 
</p>
<p><b> A. Action and priorities based on Forum discussions</b>23<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. On the basis of the presentations made and discussions held at the Forum, the 
Working Group has identified the priorities below, to be considered by States, businesses 
and other relevant stakeholders, as appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. State duty to protect 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Working Group notes the diverse initiatives undertaken by States to fulfil their 
duty to protect human rights from adverse forms of impact of business activities, and 
identifies as a priority the need to obtain increased support to systematize and facilitate the 
exchange of lessons learned from such initiatives at the working level between States. Such 
exchanges will support existing initiatives and encourage States that have not started 
implementation. The survey conducted by the Working Group on State efforts partly 
addresses the need to systematize such experiences. Regional consultations (see also 
paragraph 58 below) and the use of online platforms would also offer further opportunities 
to identify and share lessons learned from such initiatives within and across regions. The 
Working Group also notes the key role that national human rights institutions can play in 
the implementation of the Guiding Principles, and encourages close cooperation between 
other State institutions and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group notes the multiple challenges faced in implementing the State 
duty to protect, and identifies as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To build the capacity of State officials, regulators and national human rights 
institutions in this field;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To explore with all stakeholders possible avenues to address the gap in 
situations of conflict and in the absence of effective State authority;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To collect evidence of good practices in overcoming the negative forms of 
impact of compartmentalization of responsibilities to implement within the State;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To collect evidence of good practices in establishing concrete requirements 
on companies on the basis of the State duty to protect.

<p><b> 2. Corporate responsibility to respect 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Working Group notes the initiatives shared during the Forum with regard to 
implementing the business responsibility to respect, and identifies as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To support efforts for collective action within industries to identify key 
sectoral challenges, and to develop high-quality sector-specific awareness-raising and 
implementation tools;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To provide more tools and support networks for &#8220;champions&#8221; (namely, 
individuals within companies that want to advance in the implementation of the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights);  
</p>
<p>(c)  To support &#8220;safe&#8221; spaces for peer learning and for companies to be able to 
engage openly with each other and other stakeholders to discuss and address challenges. 
</p>
<p>45. The Working Group also notes the challenges faced with regard to implementing the 
corporate responsibility to respect, and identifies as priorities the need to collect and 
disseminate evidence of practice and issue guidance on:  
</p>
<p>(a)  The operationalization of corporate human rights policies and human rights 
due diligence in different industrial sectors;  
</p>
<p>(b)  Effectively tracking responses and establishing accountability mechanisms
 (c)  Addressing non-compliance by business partners and other actors linked to a 
company through business relationships, including by exercising leverage;  
</p>
<p>(d)  Implementing the Guiding Principles in contexts with weak governance and 
rule of law;  
</p>
<p>(e)  Ensuring that corporate efforts address the full range of normative standards 
underpinning the Guiding Principles, including standards of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO).  
</p>
<p>The Working Group further notes the challenge for companies in finding adequate human 
rights expertise and training. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Global governance frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Working Group notes the key role of global governance frameworks in 
requiring or encouraging the implementation of the Guiding Principles by States and 
business enterprises. Embedding the Guiding Principles within such governance 
frameworks is a key component of the strategy of the Working Group, which welcomes the 
integration of the Guiding Principles into several global governance frameworks, including 
the United Nations system, other intergovernmental bodies including regional 
organizations, and private and multi-stakeholder initiatives.24 The Working Group stresses 
the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To increase convergence between the Guiding Principles and other global 
governance frameworks;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To develop further the performance and effectiveness of grievance 
mechanisms based on such frameworks, such as the National Contact Points of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Compliance Advisor 
Ombudsman of the International Finance Corporation;  
</p>
<p>  
 24 See, inter alia, A/HRC/20/29 and A/67/285. </p>


<p>(c)  To strengthen the uptake of the Guiding Principles in the global governance 
frameworks of the financial sector. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to judicial remedy 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Working Group notes the multiple legal and practical barriers for victims in 
their access to judicial remedies for negative cases of impact of business activities, 
including the cost of such mechanisms; the lack of resources and legal assistance available 
for victims; the complexity of corporate structures and contractual relationships; the lack of 
access to information; jurisdictional challenges; the burden of proof; political obstacles; the 
difficulties in enforcing judgements; the lack of legal avenues at the national level; the 
restrictive investment agreements; and weak regulatory regimes. The Working Group also 
notes with concern the reports heard during the Forum of grave allegations of harassment, 
persecution and reprisals faced by victims and human rights defenders when seeking 
judicial remedy. The Working Group stresses the need: 
</p>
<p>(a)  For States to address the legal and practical barriers for victims in their access 
to judicial remedies in the implementation of the Guiding Principles, as well as protecting 
victims and human rights defenders from harassment, persecution and reprisals;  
</p>
<p>(b)  For business enterprises to ensure that they cooperate and do not weaken the 
integrity of judicial processes;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To build evidence of good practices by States in overcoming such barriers;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To further explore possible developments to address the lack of judicial 
remedies for gross human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Access to non-judicial remedies 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Working Group notes that victims face multiple barriers in their access to non-
judicial remedies, and challenges with regard to the effectiveness of non-judicial 
mechanisms. The Working Group also notes the lessons learned and examples shared 
during the Forum with regard to mechanisms for providing non-judicial remedies, including 
State-based mechanisms, grievance mechanisms based within intergovernmental 
organizations, multi-stakeholder mechanisms and company based mechanisms. The 
Working Group stresses the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To conduct further research on the elements and criteria for effective non-
judicial remedies;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To issue more detailed guidance to stakeholders on how to ensure non-
judicial remedies are more effective for victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Role of civil society 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Working Group notes the role of civil society organizations and human rights 
defenders in raising awareness of the grave negative human rights impact of some business 
activities, as well as the harassment, persecution and reprisals faced by human rights 
defenders and civil society organizations that try to address such forms of impact and 
ensure access to remedies for victims. The Working Group stresses the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To increase support for civil society organizations and human rights 
defenders for their work in advocating for the implementation of the Guiding Principles, in 
particular with regard to access to remedies for victims;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To strengthen the protection of civil society organizations and human rights 
defenders from harassment, persecution and reprisals linked to their work;  </p>


<p>(c)  To increase dissemination and awareness of the Guiding Principles among 
civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Implementation of the Guiding Principles by the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Working Group noted the initiatives taken within the United Nations system to 
disseminate and implement the Guiding Principles in the context of the recent report of the 
Secretary General (A/HRC/21/21) and Human Rights Council resolution 21/5, in which the 
Council called on the United Nations system as a whole to support the implementation of 
the Guiding Principles. The Working Group identifies as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 21/5 and in the report of the Secretary-General;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To play a key role in building the capacity of stakeholders at the national 
level in the implementation of the Guiding Principles;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To ensure coordination and coherence among different United Nations 
initiatives in this field, and alignment with the Guiding Principles;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To ensure the integration of the Guiding Principles into the post-2015 
development agenda and framework. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Situations of conflict 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Working Group noted multiple national, intergovernmental, industry and multi-
stakeholder initiatives to regulate and set both voluntary and mandatory standards for 
business investment and operations in situations of conflict. It also noted the potential role 
of investors, credit agencies, stock exchanges, national legislation with extraterritorial 
applications and regional mechanisms in supporting the enhanced implementation by 
business of the Guiding Principles, including human rights due diligence and operational 
grievance mechanisms. The Working Group identified as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To assess the effectiveness of existing initiatives and guidelines in situations 
of conflict, including with regard to access to remedies, and the identification of gaps and 
lessons learned;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To support and strengthen existing initiatives based on lessons learned;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To encourage greater coherence and alignment among relevant standards 
relating to situations of conflict and the Guiding Principles;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To clarify guidance for business in situations of conflict;  
</p>
<p>(e)  To collect evidence on the implementation of the corporate responsibility to 
respect in relation to transitional justice, reparations and post-conflict situations. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Small- and medium-sized enterprises 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group took note of both the multiple challenges to raise awareness of 
human rights and the Guiding Principles among small- and medium-sized enterprises and 
the initiative of the European Commission and others to provide specific guidance to such 
enterprises on the Guiding Principles. The Working Group identified as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To elaborate tools and guidance adapted to small- and medium-sized 
enterprises, including guidance produced and tailored to specific national contexts while 
staying aligned with the Guiding Principles;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To encourage targeted capacity-building for small- and medium-sized 
enterprises;  </p>


<p>(c)  To encourage partnerships and increase dissemination and implementation 
through both chambers of commerce and value chains;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To build evidence and collect examples of practice by small- and medium-
sized enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Working Group took note with concern of the many allegations of serious 
violations and challenges in ensuring respect for the rights of indigenous peoples in the 
context of business activities, as well as of existing initiatives and lessons learned in the 
protection of those rights. The Working Group identified as priorities the need: 
</p>
<p>(a)  To encourage the use of the Guiding Principles in promoting the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights in relation to indigenous peoples and business 
activities in alignment with other relevant standards, including the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To collect further evidence of lessons learned from initiatives and 
partnerships and business practices respecting the rights of indigenous peoples, including 
overcoming challenges in the implementation of such initiatives;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To raise awareness of and build capacity on the Guiding Principles among 
indigenous peoples and on the rights of indigenous peoples among business enterprises;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To provide further guidance on addressing key challenges, including 
culturally appropriate meaningful consultations, access to remedies and addressing conflict 
between enterprises and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> 11. Financial sector 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Working Group noted the key role of both public and private finance 
institutions in ensuring the implementation of the Guiding Principles by businesses. It also 
noted the current initiatives by public finance institutions to incorporate human rights into 
their policies, and identified as priorities the need: 
</p>
<p>(a)  For States to ensure more effective integration of human rights and the 
Guiding Principles into the policies of public financial institutions, including multilateral 
financial institutions and export credit agencies;  
</p>
<p>(b)  For States to address current challenges in this regard as a matter of priority, 
and to encourage the strengthening of grievance mechanisms linked to such institutions, in 
accordance with the Guiding Principles;  
</p>
<p>(c)  For greater collaboration between public finance institutions and alignment 
with human rights standards and the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group notes the potential far-reaching influence and impact of the 
private financial sector on human rights, and also the initiatives by some investors, 
including ethical funds and institutional investors, to incorporate human rights 
considerations into the establishment of their portfolios. The Working Group welcomed 
efforts, such as the OECD initiative, to elaborate specific guidance on the implementation 
of the Guiding Principles n this sector. It identified as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To gather evidence on lessons learned from initiatives in the financial sector;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To elaborate more guidance on the implementation of human rights due 
diligence, access to remedies and exercising leverage within the financial sector;  </p>


<p>(c)  To include references to human rights in the Principles for Responsible 
Investment;  
</p>
<p>(d)  To provide financial regulators with guidance on integrating human rights 
and the Guiding Principles into their work. 
</p>
<p><b> 12. Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Working Group has previously noted that the lack of capacity among 
stakeholders, including States, business enterprises, national human rights institutions and 
civil society organizations, in the area of business and human rights is a challenge to the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. It noted as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To scale up basic awareness-raising and capacity-building with regard to the 
Guiding Principles for all stakeholders;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To promote collaboration, coherence and convergence among different 
initiatives that build awareness, provide guidance and tools on the implementation of the 
Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>The Working Group has further called for the United Nations to examine the feasibility of 
establishing a global multi-stakeholder fund on business and human rights, and for States, 
business enterprises and other stakeholders to collaborate in that effort. 
</p>
<p><b> 13. Implementation of the principles for responsible contracts 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Working Group noted the importance of integrating human rights into contract 
negotiations in accordance with the principles for responsible contracts elaborated by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General.25 Further to the challenges highlighted, 
including lack of awareness and of effective integration in negotiations on investments 
treaties and contracts, the Working Group identified as priorities the need:  
</p>
<p>(a)  To further raise awareness and to promote the principles for responsible 
contracts among all stakeholders;  
</p>
<p>(b)  To collect evidence and lessons learned of the incorporation of human rights 
into contract negotiations in different sectors and contexts;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To build capacity on the use of the principles for responsible contracts by 
State and business negotiators. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional consultations and preparations for the 2013 Forum on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Business and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>58. Following the 2012 Forum on Business and Human Rights, the Working Group 
decided to engage with partners in different regions to organize regional consultations on 
business and human rights, with the aim of:  
</p>
<p>(a)  Raising awareness and promoting the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles in the region;  
</p>
<p>(b)  Identifying trends and challenges in the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles at the regional level;  
</p>
<p>  
 25 A/HRC/17/31/Add.3. </p>


<p>(c)  Identifying priorities to be addressed in each region and opportunities to 
cooperate in addressing them;  
</p>
<p>(d)  Promoting learning and the sharing of experiences from within the region and 
with other regions;  
</p>
<p>(e)  Promoting the adoption of national plans of action.  
</p>
<p>The Working Group plans for the outcomes of each regional consultation to feed into and 
strengthen discussions at the 2013 Forum on Business and Human Rights, to be held on 3 
and 4 December 2013, in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Working Group conducted its first visit to Mongolia from 8 to 18 October 2012, 
and prepared a full report thereon as an addendum to the present report.26 The Working 
Group thanks the Government of Mongolia for its invitation and the Government and all 
stakeholders that assisted the visit and engaged with the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group recognizes the importance of country visits as a key aspect of 
its mandate. They are an opportunity to help to move a country forward in managing cases 
of negative impact of business activities, including through the targeted recommendations 
of the Working Group that are based on direct interaction with representatives of the 
Government, the business community and civil society, and directly affected individuals 
and groups in the country. Country visits also offer an opportunity for the Working Group 
to clarify what the Guiding Principles mean in actual practice, using a concrete national 
context. To achieve the full extent of this potential, the Working Group has adopted a 
systematic approach to its country visits and developed, in collaboration with the Danish 
Institute for Human Rights, a template to guide each country visit. The draft template was 
publicly presented and consulted on during the 2012 Forum on Business and Human 
Rights. The Working Group will continue to develop, refine and consult on the template 
throughout 2013 with a view to further strengthen its approach and generate interest, 
understanding and engagement with country visits. 
</p>
<p>61. The first visit to Mongolia provided the Working Group with an opportunity to 
engage directly with stakeholders in Mongolia to identify the main business-related forms 
of impact on human rights; to identify what key actors are currently doing to address these; 
to clarify the challenges preventing key actors from meeting their human rights obligations; 
and to identify the opportunities to advance the implementation and dissemination of the 
Guiding Principles, and the good practices and lessons learned that can be shared more 
broadly. 
</p>
<p>62. Details on the forthcoming country visits of the Working Group, including dates, 
will be posted on the websiteof the Working Group27 when confirmed with the host 
countries. The Working Group looks forward to engaging with all stakeholders during its 
forthcoming country visits and to the further systematic development of its approach to this 
critical aspect of its mandate.

<p><b> VII. Update on Working Group projects</b>28<b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group presents the updates with regard to the projects described in the 
report of the Working Group to the General Assembly.29 
</p>
<p><b> A. Access to remedy 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Working Group is undertaking a project in collaboration with partners to build 
capacity to enhance access to remedy, both judicial and non-judicial, in the area of business 
and human rights. The project will produce guidance on what constitutes an &#8220;effective 
</p>
<p>remedy&#8221; based on lessons learned; map out existing non-judicial grievance mechanisms; 
make recommendations on domestic judicial remedy options based on research and case 
studies; and promote convergence and coherence among international non-judicial 
grievance mechanisms with the Guiding Principles. Depending on funding and timing, the 
Working Group plans to present initial findings from the project at the 2013 Forum on 
Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group has recognized that some groups and individuals, including 
indigenous peoples, face particularly significant obstacles when seeking remedies for 
business-related human rights grievances.30 It has also noted that indigenous peoples in all 
regions are profoundly and disproportionately adversely affected by business-related 
activities, such as resource extraction and infrastructure development and that they 
frequently face discrimination in law and social practice and are marginalized in the 
development of policies, laws and regulations that have a bearing on business and human 
rights issues that affect them.31 The Working Group therefore announced that it would 
specifically address the situation of indigenous peoples through its activities. At its third 
session, the Working Group decided that it would submit a thematic report on the issue of 
indigenous peoples and business and human rights to the General Assembly in 2013. The 
drafting process will include consultations with all relevant stakeholders, including 
indigenous peoples. The Working Group held initial consultations thereon during its fourth 
session. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Update on tools and guidance on the implementation of the 
Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>66. As part of its strategy to support the dissemination and implementation of the 
Guiding Principles, the European Commission has published a guide to human rights for 
small- and medium-sized enterprises,32 and is further elaborating guidance on 
implementation in the employment and recruitment, information and communications 
</p>
<p>  
 28 Project implementation is subject to the allocation of sufficient financial resources.

<p>technology, and oil and gas sectors.33 The Global Compact published a draft business 
reference guide to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.34 
The Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), the Center for Human 
Rights and Environment (CEDHA) and Cividep have published a guide on how to use the 
Guiding Principles in company research and advocacy.35 The Thun Group of Banks is 
developing guidance on human rights assessments and human rights due diligence within 
the banking sector.36 The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre has developed a 
page referencing known tools and guidance on the Guiding Principles.37 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>67. At its third session, the Working Group adopted revised methods of work.38 It 
reaffirmed its commitment to engage openly and meaningfully with all stakeholders 
through a balanced approach. It further emphasized that it welcomed partnerships and 
support from relevant stakeholders in order to fulfil its mandate and advance the business 
and human rights agenda. 
</p>
<p>68. At its third session, the Working Group decided that, while it was generally not in a 
position to address individual cases of alleged business-related human rights abuse, it may, 
at its discretion, raise specific allegations that it determined to be particularly emblematic 
with relevant State authorities and companies, and request clarification or additional 
information, as appropriate.39 The Working Group appointed a Vice-Chairperson to fulfil 
all the duties of the Chairperson when the Chairperson is otherwise unavailable. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Working Group recognizes that States and businesses face different 
situations and contexts, and that there is no single approach to implementing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles. Nonetheless, on the basis of the engagement and outreach of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group with stakeholders during the first year of its mandate, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>information received by the Working Group, the results of the State and business 
</b></p>
<p><b>surveys and the experiences discussed at the Forum, the Working Group makes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations below on the steps that States, business enterprises and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders should consider taking in order to fulfil their respective duties and 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities.</b>40<b>

 40 The recommendations should be read in conjunction with the Guiding Principles and the preliminary 
</p>
<p>recommendations for stakeholders contained in the report of the Working Group submitted to the 
General Assembly (A/67/285), paras. 74-86. </p>


<p><b> A. Stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Working Group calls upon all stakeholders: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To collect and exchange lessons learned from implementation efforts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Lessons learned from implementation efforts by States and business enterprises 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be systematically shared with the Working Group. At the national, regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sector levels, the exchange of these lessons learned should be facilitated, at both 
</b></p>
<p><b>the policy and the working levels, between stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To enhance guidance on effectiveness of remedy. Stakeholders are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to collaborate in the efforts made by the Working Group to conduct 
</b></p>
<p><b>further research and to establish more detailed guidance on effectiveness criteria for 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-judicial remedy mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To provide small- and medium-sized enterprises with guidance. States 
</b></p>

<p><b>avoid the compartmentalization of responsibilities on implementation of the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles within single departments. The awareness and capacity of members of the

<p><b>for civil society organizations and human rights defenders that address barriers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to remedy for victims of human rights abuses; protecting victims and human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders from harassment, persecution and reprisals for seeking access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies for human rights abuses linked to corporate activities; cooperating with 
</b></p>
<p><b>other States to explore possible developments to address the lack of judicial remedies

<p><b>source of continuous learning. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Industry groups should identify key sector-specific challenges to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing the Guiding Principles, including carrying out human rights due

<p><b>diligence, and support collective action to address these; and develop high-quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector-specific tools and guidance, in full alignment with the Guiding Principles, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>raise awareness and support companies in each sector to implement the Guiding 
</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>small- and medium-sized enterprises, to be able to engage with each other and other

</b></p>
<p><b>when there is limited leverage. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Addressing cases of impact when operating in environments where 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights are not incorporated in national law, when laws are not applied 
</b></p>
<p><b>in practice or in the absence of Government institutions, and effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>engaging with all stakeholders in contexts of restricted dialogue. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Adapting grievance mechanisms to the cultural context, building trust in

<p><b>different segments of the financial sector, including with regard to access to remedies 
</b></p>
<p><b>for any human rights impact caused, contributed to or linked to the activities of the
