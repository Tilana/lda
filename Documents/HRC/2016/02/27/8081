<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the 
promotion of a democratic and equitable 
international order, Alfred Maurice de Zayas  
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In this initial report to the Human Rights Council, the Independent Expert on the 
promotion of a democratic and equitable international order formulates preliminary views 
on the conceptual and legal framework of the mandate and highlights some of the 
epistemological challenges inherent in the notion of democracy at the national and 
international levels, as well as the implications of a culture of equity based on common 
sense and common interest.   
</p>
<p> The present report is inspired by the purposes and principles set out in the Charter of 
the United Nations and in pertinent United Nations and regional human rights norms, 
including the core human rights treaties and multiple declarations and resolutions adopted 
by the General Assembly. The Independent Expert will cooperate with other special 
procedures and coordinate his work with that of other United Nations mechanisms, 
including the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee and treaty bodies. He will liaise 
with intergovernmental organizations and agencies, including the World Trade 
Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labour 
Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Intellectual Property 
Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development. He will conduct consultations with stakeholders 
and academics in all regions of the world. In the present report, the mandate holder 
explores a number of real and potential obstacles to the realization of genuine democracy 
and equity, endeavouring to identify some good practices and lessons learned. He suggests 
ways in which governments, the private sector and civil society can cooperate. 
</p>

<p> Since the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations begins with the words &#8213;We 
the peoples&#8214;, it is necessary to devise ways to give greater voice to civil society, to take the 
temperature of public opinion throughout the world so as to ensure that the will of peoples 
and nations is not supplanted by economic and geopolitical interests. At the same time a 
proper balance must be found so that populism does not denature democracy and frustrate 
the noble goal to serve the higher principle of human dignity<i>.</i>

<p><b> I. Mandate and methodology 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council resolution 18/6 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/6 of 29 September 2011, the Human Rights Council established, 
for a period of three years, a new special procedure entitled &#8213;Independent Expert on the 
promotion of a democratic and equitable international order&#8214;. The mandate holder is 
requested:  
</p>
<p>(a) To identify possible obstacles to the promotion and protection of a 
democratic and equitable international order, and to submit proposals and/or 
recommendations to the Human Rights Council on possible actions in that regard; 
</p>
<p>(b) To identify best practices in the promotion and protection of a democratic 
and equitable international order at the local, national, regional and international levels; 
</p>
<p>(c) To raise awareness concerning the importance of promoting and protecting a 
democratic and equitable international order;  
</p>
<p>(d) To work in cooperation with States in order to foster the adoption of 
measures at the local, national, regional and international levels aimed at the promotion and 
protection of a democratic and equitable international order through concrete proposals 
enhancing subregional, regional and international cooperation, including by holding 
subregional and regional consultations in that regard;  
</p>
<p>(e) To work in close coordination, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, other special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council, international financial institutions, as well as with other relevant 
actors representing the broadest possible range of interests and experiences, within their 
respective mandates, including by attending and following up on relevant international 
conferences and events; 
</p>
<p>(f) To integrate a gender perspective and a disabilities perspective into his or her 
work;  
</p>
<p>(g) To report regularly to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to paragraph 17 of the above-mentioned resolution, the Human Rights 
Council requests the Independent Expert to present his first report to the Council at its 
twenty-first session. Bearing in mind that the mandate holder assumed his functions on 1 
May, this initial report should be understood as a <i>tour-</i>d&#8217;horizon of the multiple aspects of 
the mandate. While the mandate may appear overbroad or abstract, the intention of the 
Council is to give practical application to human rights norms in the international order, 
thus requiring the mandate holder to formulate pragmatic solutions. The individual and 
collective dimensions of the resolution will be taken into account, recognizing the 
individual&#8216;s entitlement to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and the 
inter-State commitment to respect one another&#8216;s sovereignty, ensuring the equitable 
participation of all States in the international order, including global decision-making and 
equitable commercial and financial relations. 
</p>
<p>3. The mandate calls for the identification of obstacles and best practices and for the 
formulation of proposals and recommendations on possible action. While norms and 
mechanisms exist, an important implementation gap prevails. The mandate holder is 
consulting stakeholders and will formulate recommendations on ways to make the 
international order more democratic and equitable. He is committed to cooperate with other 
mandate holders to avoid duplication, recognizing, however, that &#8213;duplication&#8214; in the field </p>


<p>of human rights may also open other perspectives and assist in the process of education, 
stocktaking and reflection. One task is to identify trends and desires for reform of the 
international order and to energize public opinion to demand and carry out such reforms at 
the local and regional levels, ultimately affecting the international order from the grass 
roots up. The Independent Expert will be guided by relevant General Assembly resolutions, 
including 61/160, 63/189 and65/223. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Activities of the mandate holder 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 7 and 8 June 2012 the mandate holder participated in the workshop organized by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 
support of the mandate of the Independent Expert on human rights and international 
solidarity, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 18/5. From 11 to 15 June the 
mandate holder participated in the nineteenth annual meeting of special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council. Both the workshop and the annual meeting were enriched by the 
opinions of experts, State representatives, intergovernmental organizations, national human 
rights institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Their fruitful debates 
provided useful insights. During the twentieth session of the Human Rights Council, the 
Independent Expert participated in numerous side events, including the expert meeting 
organized by the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh in coordination with the Spanish 
Society for International Human Rights Law and the Women&#8216;s UN Report Network on 
fighting violence against women through promoting the right to peace. His statement 
focused on the contribution of women in the promotion of the right to peace, democracy 
and an equitable order. On 2 July he lectured on the scope and potential of the mandate at 
the University of Geneva and on 10 July held a consultation with civil society at OHCHR 
headquarters in Geneva. From 1 to 3 October the mandate holder will participate in the 
2012 Social Forum, which will focus on people-centred development and globalization.  
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert has sent questionnaires to States, intergovernmental 
organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society seeking their views and 
requesting assistance in identifying obstacles and good practices. He has received requests 
from stakeholders concerning areas that require in-depth study. He welcomes information 
at ie-internationalorder@ohchr.org. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The concepts of democracy and equity 
</b></p>
<p>6. A preliminary task of the mandate is a review of the various definitions of the notion 
of &#8213;democracy&#8214;, which States use with varying content. The bottom line is that the people 
</p>
<p>(<i>demos</i>) should meaningfully influence the policies and practices of government. 
Democracy is not merely a formal State structure or a pro forma holding of elections, but 
the correlation between the will of the people and the actions of its elected representatives. 
The will of the people must also be genuine and not the result of populism, demagoguery, 
manipulation by national or international lobbies, distortion through consumerism, 
intimidation or fear. It should also be kept in mind that although &#8213;democracy&#8214; is a better 
</p>
<p>form of government than others, it is not a panacea for all the ills of mankind; thus it is 
necessary to come to grips with the paradoxes of democracy, freedom, the rule of law, and 
ethical values. Majority rule must not negate minority rights, the right to be different, the 
right to practice one&#8216;s own culture, or the right to one&#8216;s individuality and identity. 
Democracy without equity and without caritas can engender inhuman and degrading 
consequences, including extreme poverty and food insecurity. Democracy must always be 
tempered by a constant awareness of the inherent dignity of the human being, by the over-
arching principle of social justice, bearing in mind that while competition is necessary and </p>


<p>useful for material progress, in the absence of a sense of solidarity, competition may 
become predator behaviour. Indeed, democracy is more than just a political concept; it also 
has economic, social, anthropological, ethical and religious dimensions. The rule of law is 
not identical with positivism, but must be animated by Montesquieu&#8216;s <i>Esprit des Lois</i> 
(1748), the existence of an independent judiciary, moderation, a culture of dialogue, 
negotiation and compromise, and a conviction that in human rights terms there cannot be 
any &#8213;legal black holes&#8214;. Finally, it should be remembered that the ritual invocation of the 
</p>
<p>word &#8213;democracy&#8214; does not make it happen. Societies must work in good faith to make it 
function, ensuring genuine participation by the population. At the same time, common 
sense also tells us to beware of the excesses of &#8213;militant democracy&#8214;, a rather bizarre 
</p>
<p>concept, which in some circumstances may take totalitarian overtones, and to abandon the 
fantasy that democracy can be exported or imposed by force. The respect for national 
sovereignty mandated in the Charter of the United Nations also means respect for the 
national identity of countries. 
</p>
<p>7. Democracy can be understood internally but also internationally, since the will of a 
majority of States in the General Assembly deserves respect. Whereas every member of the 
General Assembly has an equal right to vote, consideration must also be given to the fact 
that some States have very large populations and only a single vote, posing a problem of 
weighting. Moreover, the unequal economic and political power of States may lead to 
inequitable results, especially when a few powerful States frustrate the expressed will of 
democratically elected Governments representing hundreds of millions of human beings. 
This has led to the formation of informal voting blocks that do not always serve the cause 
of international equity. A problem of credibility arises when a large number of General 
Assembly resolutions remain unimplemented, although adopted by near unanimity.  
</p>
<p>8. The Independent Expert acknowledges earlier pronouncements of the General 
Assembly concerning democracy, e.g. in resolutions 55/96 on promoting and consolidating 
democracy, 57/221 on strengthening the rule of law, and 59/201 on enhancing the role of 
regional,1 subregional and other organizations and arrangements in promoting and 
consolidating democracy, as well as resolution 50/172 on respect for the principles of 
national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States in their electoral 
processes, in which the Assembly recognized that there is no single political system or 
single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples, 
and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical, political, cultural 
and religious factors. Similarly, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 19/36 on 
human rights, democracy and the rule of law, reaffirms in a preambular paragraph that 
while democracies share common features, there is no single model of democracy and that 
democracy does not belong to any country or region, and stresses the necessity of due 
respect for sovereignty and the right to self-determination. Thus, it should be clear that the 
way toward democracy &#8211; both nationally and internationally &#8211; is arduous and that countries 
should devise their own democratic institutions and mechanisms consistent with their 
culture and traditions, but also grounded in universal human rights.  
</p>
<p>9. The mandate holder will also explore the practical scope of the concept of &#8213;equity&#8214;, 
going back to the Socratic notion of moderation and the Aristotelian approach to justice 
(<i>Ethics</i>) as equality of treatment, i.e. like cases being treated alike, unlike cases differently. 
</p>
<p>10. How can the existing international order evolve so that it will be more democratic 
and more equitable? Certain conditions appear necessary, foremost among them peace in 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See the Inter-American Democratic Charter adopted by the Organization of American States on 11 
</p>
<p>September 2001. </p>


<p>the holistic sense, encompassing not only the absence of war but also positive harmony, the 
absence of structural violence, cultural hegemonism, neo-colonialism, exploitation, 
discrimination and the eradication of extreme poverty as envisaged in the Millennium 
Development Goals. At the request of the Human Rights Council, OHCHR organized an 
expert workshop on the right of peoples to peace, held in Geneva on 15 and 16 December 
2009, in which experts and civil society participated. The report on the workshop 
(A/HRC/14/38) was presented to the Council in June 2010 and led to the adoption of 
resolution 14/3, in which the Council tasked the Advisory Committee with drafting a 
declaration on the right to peace, which also entails reducing the gap between rich and poor 
in all countries,  whether developed or developing, through a process of gradual 
implementation of social justice. Pursuant to Council resolution 17/16 and Advisory 
Committee recommendation 8/4, the Advisory Committee submitted to the Council its draft 
declaration on the right to peace (A/HRC/20/31, annex). At its twentieth session, the 
Council considered the draft, and adopted resolution 20/15 establishing an open-ended 
working group to continue the codification process, taking duly into account all preparatory 
work. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Consultations, questionnaires, future thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p>11. Through early consultations conducted by the Independent Expert, and 
correspondence received from stakeholders, a number of suggestions for thematic studies 
emerged: (a) the nature of democracy, its diverging meanings domestically and 
internationally; (b) the notion of equity; (c) the links between self-determination and 
democracy; (d) the right of participation of unrepresented peoples; (e) the concept of 
&#8213;participation&#8214;; (f) the relationship between democracy and freedom of opinion and 
expression and access to information (including unduly classified information), peaceful 
assembly and association, good governance, and independent judiciary; (g) self-censorship 
and &#8213;political correctness&#8214;; (h) lobbies and pressure groups; (i) free, genuine and 
competitive elections (including issues of election fraud and civil unrest, election financing, 
buying votes); (j) the impact of the financial markets on democracy and equity; (k) the 
influence of transnational corporations and other private sector actors upon the international 
order; (l) the impact of the military-industrial complex, military expenditures and war on 
democracy and equity, and the need to liberate financial resources to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals; (m) the non-implementation of treaties and agreements; 
(n) control over natural resources; (o) corruption in government, business and society; and 
(p) fair trade, free trade agreements, and adverse trade relations. 
</p>
<p>12. Follow-up reports on the above themes may be submitted to the Human Rights 
Council and General Assembly as appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Normative framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Charter of the United Nations as the World Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>13. In a very real sense the Charter of the United Nations can be described as the World 
Constitution. All States are bound by it and should orient their policies and practices 
according to its purposes and principles. Paramount is the commitment &#8213;to save succeeding 
generations from the scourge of war&#8214; through meaningful disarmament and to fulfil the 
promise to turn swords into ploughshares, and end internal and international warfare.  </p>


<p>14. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an emanation of the Charter and 
constitutes a minimum standard which must be respected not only by States but also by 
individuals. 
</p>
<p>15. The world financial crisis is a result not only of toxic loans by irresponsible bankers 
but also of the enormous waste caused by recurrent armed conflicts and by the inordinate 
proportion of national budgets devoted to the development of all kinds of armaments, 
including weapons of mass destruction, which threaten the survival of humanity2 and 
violate article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.3 The Charter 
also stipulates the promotion of human rights, development and friendly relations based on 
respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. The application 
of the Charter is further governed by general principles of law, such as equity, good faith, 
victims&#8216; right to reparation, estoppel (<i>ex injuria non oritur jus</i>), and the overarching 
principles of equality, non-discrimination and the common heritage of mankind. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Relevant instruments 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights constitutes &#8213;a common standard of 
achievement for all peoples and all nations&#8214;. Of particular relevance to the present mandate 
are the rights to freedom of opinion and expression (art. 19), freedom of peaceful assembly 
and association (art. 20), the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs (art. 21), the 
right to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
Declaration can be fully realized (art. 28), and everyone&#8216;s &#8213;duties to the community in 
which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible&#8214; in the light of &#8213;the 
general welfare in a democratic society&#8214; (art.29).4 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. For the realization of an international order that is more democratic, it is necessary 
that States observe the rights stipulated in both the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
With regard to civil and political rights, particularly crucial are the right to hold opinions 
without interference and the right to freedom of expression, including freedom to seek, 
receive and impart information, regardless of frontiers (art. 19), as well as the right to 
peacefully assemble (art. 21) and the right to freedom of association (art. 22). The right to 
due process in civil and criminal proceedings as well as the independence of the judiciary 
(art. 14) are central to every democracy, as is the right of every citizen to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, and to vote and 
be elected at genuine periodic elections (art. 25), and the autonomous right to equality (art. 
26). 
</p>
<p>18. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stipulates 
conditions for the promotion of an equitable international order, in particular the rights to 
work (art. 6), to form and join trade unions (art. 8), to social security (art. 9), to an adequate

Soros, have known, those with great business skills have great responsibilities as well.&#8214; </p>

mental health (art. 12) and to education (art. 13).  
</p>
<p>19. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women contain many relevant provisions. With regard to gender discrimination and 
gender mainstreaming, the Independent Expert will explore the implications of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women&#8216;s general recommendation 
No. 23 (1997) on women in political and public life. The Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the 1951 Convention relating to 
the Status of Refugees provide additional perspectives relevant to the present mandate. 
</p>
<p>20. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993 commits States to &#8213;an 
international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, 
including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms 
for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, 
democracy, justice, equality, rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of living 
and solidarity&#8214;. The United Nations Millennium Declaration of 2000 proclaimed: &#8213;We will 
spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for 
all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right 
to development&#8214; (para. 24). The Millennium Development Goals reaffirm these 
commitments, in particular to end extreme poverty and promote universal education and 
gender equality.5 The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, in August/September 
2001, adopted the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, reaffirmed in the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, adopted on 24 April 2009, and in the 
declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the tenth 
anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
proclaimed by the Assembly in its resolution 66/3.  
</p>
<p>21. Particularly relevant to resolution 18/6 are General Assembly resolutions 3201 (S-
VI) on the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, 2625 
(XXV) on friendly relations and 3314 (XXIX) on the definition of aggression, and more 
immediately resolution 65/223, in which the General Assembly affirms that a democratic 
and equitable international order requires the realization of, inter alia, the right of peoples to 
self-determination, permanent sovereignty over natural resources, development and peace. 
</p>
<p>22. The mandate holder will build on the studies already conducted by the Commission 
on Human Rights, by the Human Rights Council and its Advisory Committee, including the 
Advisory Committee report on enhancement of international cooperation in the field of 
human rights (A/HRC/AC/8/3), as well as by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights, including those of the Special Rapporteur Awn Shawkat Al-
Khasawneh, tasked with preparing a study on the human rights dimensions of population 
transfers, which identify numerous gross violations of democracy and equity that 
accompany every form of &#8213;ethnic cleansing&#8214;,6 and the final report of Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>especially chapters 5 to 7 (Equality, Democracy, and Development); and Jeffrey Sachs, <i>The End of 
Poverty</i> (2005). Harvard&#8216;s Program on Human Rights in Development under the directorship of 
Stephen Marks has made outstanding contributions to an understanding of the correlation between 
development and human rights (see www.hsph.harvard.edu/phrd/).  
</p>
<p> 6 See, in particular, the 1997 report, including a  13-point declaration (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/23 and 
 
 </p>


<p>Miguel Alfonso Mart&#237;nez on treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements 
between States and indigenous populations (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1999/20). He will also build on 
the work of the family of special rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council, the General 
Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, in particular with respect to resolutions 
on the right of peoples to peace (Assembly resolution 39/11 and Commission resolution 
2002/71). The pertinent conventions and directives of specialized agencies, such as the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), will be incorporated into the analysis of thematic 
issues in future reports. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Ethical and historical perspective 
</b></p>
<p>23. It is appropriate to recall that the objectives of the present mandate reflect 
aspirations expressed by the leaders of many countries, even before the creation of the 
United Nations. For instance, President Franklin Roosevelt of the United States of America 
articulated universal hopes in his &#8213;Four Freedoms&#8214; address of 6 January 1941, notably the 
</p>
<p>freedom from want and the freedom from fear. These principles were confirmed in the 
eight-point peace plan known as the Atlantic Charter of August 1941, subsequently adhered 
to by 26 governments in the Declaration by United Nations of 1 January 1942. Article 2 of 
the Atlantic Charter stipulates that the anti-Hitler coalition &#8213;desire to see no territorial 
changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned&#8214;; its 
article 3 provides that &#8213;they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of 
</p>
<p>government under which they will live&#8214;, its article 4 commits States to promote &#8213;the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to 
the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic 
prosperity&#8214;; and its article 8 reaffirms the need for disarmament. 
</p>
<p>24. For centuries secular and religious thinkers have promoted peace and social justice. 
A central thesis of Immanuel Kant&#8216;s philosophy was the imperative to recognize that 
</p>
<p>humans are ends and should not be used as mere means to an end. Mahatma Ghandi 
propounded the philosophy of <i>satyagraha</i>7 in his campaigns to reform Indian society and to

but never elevated to the General Assembly for adoption. The first United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights stated at the opening of an expert consultation convened by Mr. Al-
Khasawneh in February 2007:  
</p>
<p>  Sub-Commission resolutions 1994/24, 1995/13 and 1996/9 recognize &#8215;that

&#8215;ethnic cleansing&#8216; and other forms of forcible displacement of populations within a

<p>country or across borders deprive the affected populations of their right to freedom 
of movement.&#8216; 
</p>
<p>  But I would go further, because the right to live in one&#8216;s native land is a very 
precious and fundamental right. Compulsory population transfers, including the 
implantation of settlers and settlements are a serious matter, not only because they 
affect many people, but also because they violate the whole gamut of civil and 
political rights, economic, social and cultural rights.

<p>awake Indian consciousness to the necessity of his social agenda. He condemned 
discrimination and immorality, inequality and exploitation. He struggled not merely for 
independence from England but for social justice within India: &#8213;Unless poverty and 
unemployment are wiped out from India&#8230; I would not agree that we have attained 
</p>
<p>freedom&#8214;.8 In the same vein, on 28 August 1963, Martin Luther King expressed his hope 
that there can indeed be social progress: &#8213;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise 
up and live out the true meaning of its creed: &#8215;We hold these truths to be self-evident that 
all men are created equal&#8216;.&#8214; Similarly, Nelson Mandela, upon receiving the Nobel Peace 
Prize on 10 December 1993, stated: &#8213;We speak here of the challenge of the dichotomies of 
war and peace, violence and non-violence, racism and human dignity, oppression and 
repression and liberty and human rights, poverty and freedom from want ... countless 
human beings, both inside and outside our country, had the nobility of spirit to stand in the 
path of tyranny and injustice, without seeking selfish gain. They recognised that an injury 
to one is an injury to all and therefore acted together in defence of justice and a common 
human decency.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>25. As to freedom from fear, Aung San Suu Kyi expressed it well: &#8213;Within a system 
which denies the existence of basic human rights, fear tends to be the order of the day. Fear 
of imprisonment, fear of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family, property or 
means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of isolation, fear of failure. A most insidious form 
of fear is that which masquerades as common sense or even wisdom, condemning as 
foolish, reckless, insignificant or futile the small, daily acts of courage which help to 
preserve man&#8216;s self-respect and inherent human dignity. It is not easy for a people 
conditioned by fear under the iron rule of the principle that might is right to free themselves 
from the enervating miasma of fear. Yet even under the most crushing state machinery 
courage rises up again and again, for fear is not the natural state of civilized man.&#8214;9 
</p>
<p>26. In his book <i>Indignez-vous!</i> (Time for Outrage), St&#233;phane Hessel similarly calls for 
taking responsibility in our hands and demanding change. Such courage is being expressed 
in many countries by civil society, indignant at the failures and abuses by government. For 
centuries it has been the role of poets and novelists to use literature to promote a more 
ethical order, from Aristophanes to Ibn Rushd, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau, Friedrich von Schiller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Wilfred Owen, Lu Xun, Anna 
Akhmatova, Gabriel Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez, Vaclav Havel, Arundhati Roy and Wole Soyinka.

mechanisms and build on United Nations initiatives such as the Global Compact.10

<p>comments will enrich the reports of the Independent Expert; he will also rely on 
recommendations resulting from the universal periodic review and on the work of special 
procedures, in particular the reports of the Independent Expert on human rights and 
international solidarity; the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; the Independent Expert on the issue 
of human rights obligations related to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and 
sustainable environment; the Special Rapporteurs on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
and of association, on the independence of judges and lawyers, on the promotion of truth, 
justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, on the right to education, in the field 
of cultural rights, on the rights of indigenous peoples, on extreme poverty and human 
rights, on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, on the right to food, on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, on the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation, on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living, and on the human rights of internally displaced persons; the Working Group on the 
issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises; and the 
Forum on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>29. The mandate holder will follow the work of the 26-member United Nations high-
level panel on post-Millennium Development Goals, established in 2012, and seek 
synergies with the Special Adviser on Post-2015 Development Planning. Attention will be 
paid to the programmes established by several United Nations agencies with objectives 
relating to those of this mandate. In the field of labour law, the ILO promotes social justice 
through standard setting and monitoring; its motto &#8213;<i>si vis pacem cole justitiam</i>&#8214; (if you 
desire peace, cultivate justice) could well be the motto of the present mandate and report. 
This motto is also written on a document buried at the foundation of the old ILO building in 
Geneva, today the headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO). WTO has the 
opportunity to promote a more equitable international order by mainstreaming human rights 
principles into its policies and programmes, including the Doha Development Agenda, 
pursuant to its commitment to achieve the agreed objective of rebalancing trade rules so 
that developing countries can benefit from enhanced equitable commerce. The Independent 
Expert will consider how WTO may promote equity in the global trade regime with fairness 
for all, especially for poor and vulnerable countries.  He will study the relevant reports of 
the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Conference on Trade 
and Development and evaluate criticism by think tanks, academics and civil society.12 The 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) advances 
international understanding through culture and is committed to the promotion of world 
peace, as expressed in the preamble of its Constitution: &#8213;Since wars begin in the minds of 
men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed&#8214;. In this spirit 
the Director-General of UNESCO proclaimed in 1997 the Declaration on the Human Right 
to Peace. Of continued relevance are the UNESCO programme on a Culture of Peace and 
the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (General Assembly 
resolution 53/243). On 12 November 1997 the General Conference of UNESCO adopted 
the Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations towards Future 
Generations (see www.unesco.org/cpp/uk/declarations/ generations.pdf)<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p>30. The Independent Expert will seek synergies with civil society and intergovernmental 
initiatives, including those of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of the Alliance of 
</p>
<p>  
 12 Naomi Klein, <i>The Shock Doctrine</i> (2007).  </p>


<p>Civilizations, United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research and of regional 
organizations, which may further contribute to the realization of a more democratic and 
equitable international order. He will study the future report Fostering cross-cultural 
understanding for building peaceful and inclusive societies. 
</p>
<p>31. In particular, the mandate holder recalls civil society initiatives that have born fruit, 
for example the World Campaign on the Human Right to Peace conducted by the Spanish 
Society for the Advancement of International Human Rights Law, which concluded on 10 
December 2010 with the adoption of the Santiago Declaration on the Human Right to Peace 
at the International Congress on the Human Right to Peace, held in Santiago de 
Compostela, Spain, in the context of the World Social Forum on Education for Peace (see 
www.aedidh.org/?q=node/1853). This Declaration revised the earlier Luarca Declaration on 
the Human Right to Peace13 in the light of inputs from different cultural sensibilities.14 At 
the same Congress the Statutes of the International Observatory of the Human Right to 
Peace were adopted,15 becoming operative on 10 March 2011, and which enjoy the 
endorsement of some 2,000 civil society organizations, as well as of numerous public 
institutions and the 22 member States of the Ibero-American Summit.16 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Obstacles to the realization of an international order that is 
more democratic and more equitable 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert has already held consultations with stakeholders to learn 
what they perceive to be major obstacles and good practices for the realization of an 
international order that is more democratic and equitable. Focused questionnaires have been 
sent and further questionnaires will be addressed to all stakeholders over the next three 
years.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>33. Through informal consultation with members of permanent missions, 
intergovernmental organizations and NGOs, in particular the academic communities of 
several countries, and subsequent study of relevant literature, the mandate holder has 
become aware of numerous concerns that require further study, including the postulate of a 
hierarchy of human rights as one of the remaining ideological debates between developed 
and developing countries. In his view, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights 
are not only interdependent, but they also have equal value and importance. 
</p>
<p>34. With regard to a more democratic international order, some observers have signalled 
the need to reform the United Nations and, in particular, the composition of the Security 
Council so as to make it more responsive to the needs of the 193 States Members of the 
United Nations. A General Assembly task force on Security Council reform is committed to 
explore the modalities of Security Council reform. In his report entitled &#8213;In larger freedom:

<p>towards development, security and human rights for all&#8214;, submitted to the 2005 World 
Summit, the Secretary-General proposed an enlargement of the Security Council to 24 
members (A/59/2005, paras. 168-170). Such enlargement could theoretically be achieved 
through amendment of the Charter of the United Nations (pursuant to art. 108), provided 
that the permanent members of the Security Council agree. 
</p>
<p>35. Other observers have pointed out that the theoretical equality of the Westphalian 
State system is put to question by the realities of power politics, economic imbalance and 
adverse trade relationships. Indeed, the overwhelming economic power of some countries 
renders illusionary the aspirations of sovereignty of many poorer countries. In the United 
Nations, votes are often influenced by economic carrot-and-stick practices, and some 
weaker economies must bend to diplomatic and other forms of pressure. 
</p>
<p>36. In the above-mentioned report (A/59/2005, para. 32), the Secretary-General 
observed:  
</p>
<p>In 2005, the development of a global partnership between rich and poor countries &#8230; 
needs to become a reality &#8230; Each developing country has primary responsibility for 
its own development&#8212;strengthening governance, combating corruption and putting 
in place the policies and investments to drive private-sector-led growth and 
maximize domestic resources available to fund national development strategies. 
Developed countries, on their side, undertake that developing countries which adopt 
transparent, credible and properly costed development strategies will receive the full 
support they need, in the form of increased development assistance, a more 
development-oriented trade system and wider and deeper debt relief. All of this has 
been promised but not delivered. That failure is measured in the rolls of the dead&#8212;
and on it are written millions of new names each year. 
</p>
<p>37. Some observers have expressed concern over &#8213;market fundamentalism&#8214;, a 
philosophy that has much in common with social Darwinism and assumes that a laissez-
faire policy is always the optimal solution.17 &#8213;Corporatocracy&#8214;, unfair taxation, 
uncontrolled markets, currency speculation and runaway finance impact negatively on both 
democracy and equity. 
</p>
<p>38. It has long been noted that certain transnational corporations are wealthier and more 
powerful than some States. Strategies and guidelines must be developed to ensure that 
international business and trade promote rather than hinder a democratic and equitable 
international order. The new Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, established by the Human Rights Council at its 
seventeenth session (resolution 17/4), is tasked with promoting human rights in this 
sensitive area. The Independent Expert will consult with the members of the Working 
Group in order to cross-fertilize and avoid duplication. 
</p>
<p>39. Globalization raises many human rights issues18 and it is in the interest of 
governments, transnational corporations and civil society that the opportunities offered by 
globalization be used to advance and not to restrict the enjoyment of human rights. The 
Independent Expert will explore the impact of globalization on the realization of an

<p>international order that is more democratic and more equitable, and how to reconcile the 
tensions between, on the one side, the legitimate interest in profit and trade expansion19 and, 
on the other side, the right of States, large and small, to sovereignty and control over their 
natural resources, and the right of peoples to self-determination,20 to decide their domestic 
policies of full employment and equity.  
</p>
<p>40. Military expenditures, the power of the military-industrial complex, the overt and 
covert trade in weapons, international organized crime, in particular drug trafficking, 
money-laundering and corruption21 of government officials and non-State actors continue to 
have a deleterious effect on the proper functioning of democracy in many countries. The 
impact of the &#8213;war on drugs&#8214; and of the &#8213;war on terror&#8214; on the rule of law also deserves 
close attention. The killing and harassment of journalists, reprisals against human rights 
defenders, censorship and deliberate disinformation by government and private sector 
media frustrate the democratic goal of empowering the population to develop responsible 
opinions upon which to act in the political arena. Frequently news reporting and 
commentary avoid the crucial issues and distract attention with red herrings of all kinds. 
Observers have noted that all too often the &#8213;elephant in the room&#8214; is ignored. Such 
</p>
<p>practices undermine democracy. 
</p>
<p>41. The International Expert considers that the emergence of a democratic international 
order would be advanced by the participation of a growing number of States which 
implement democratic principles domestically. 
</p>
<p>42. Concern has been expressed about the role of religious institutions in the conduct of 
public affairs. The Independent Expert would like to explore how religious institutions can 
also contribute to a more democratic and equitable international order. 
</p>
<p>43. Greater efforts are needed to limit current attempts to shrink the space of civil 
society at the international and domestic levels. Arbitrary and undue restrictions on the 
effective enjoyment of fundamental freedoms, including the freedoms of association, 
peaceful assembly and expression, seriously obstruct the realization of a more democratic 
international order.  
</p>
<p>44. From the domestic perspective, obstacles to the promotion of a more democratic 
international order also include a lack of correlation between the will of the people and the 
policies and practices adopted by their governments, even democratically elected 
governments, and reflect an epistemological and perception gap between the governing 
elites and the population at large. This lack of correlation may be attributed in part to the 
&#8213;psychology&#8214; of power, but also to the deliberate distortion or manipulation of public 
</p>
<p>opinion.22 
</p>
<p>45. It is generally recognized that a well-informed citizenry is a condition of democracy. 
A country where public opinion is manipulated by the government or private media cannot 
</p>
<p>  
 19 Trade expansion, however, should not be achieved at the expense of local farmers and local industry, 
</p>
<p>thus causing a destruction of local economies and increased unemployment. Nor is it ecologically 
sustainable to relocate production and thereby increase the consumption of fuel for transportation 
purposes. 
</p>
<p> 20 See Cliff Durand and Steve Martinot, eds., <i>Recreating Democracy in a Globalized State</i>, 2012; Noam

<p>have a functioning democracy. Censorship, whether conducted by States or by press 
conglomerates, distorts reality and undermines democracy. Who is financing the media and 
what gets broadcasted or released are important issues in understanding the degree of press 
freedom, also to what extent big media smother out the independent press. Self-censorship 
as a result of intimidation or social pressures, sometimes referred to as &#8213;political 
</p>
<p>correctness&#8214;, constitutes a serious obstacle to the proper functioning of democracy. It is 
important to hear the views of all persons, including the &#8213;silent majority&#8214;, and to give ear to 
</p>
<p>the weaker voices. There is little hope for an international democratic order as long as 
democracy is lacking at the national level. Therefore, it is imperative to focus attention on 
education and access to information, including via the Internet, to enable persons to develop 
freely their own opinions. Direct or indirect censorship, whether through State or private 
sector agencies, undermines opinion-building and constitutes an obstacle for the individual 
and society at large to exercise civic responsibilities, including the right to participate in the 
conduct of public affairs. 
</p>
<p>46. The Human Rights Committee has stated: &#8213;Freedom of opinion and freedom of 
expression are indispensable conditions for the full development of the person. They are 
essential for any society. They constitute the foundation stone for every free and democratic 
society. The two freedoms are closely related, with freedom of expression providing the 
vehicle for the exchange and development of opinions. Freedom of expression is a 
necessary condition for the realization of the principles of transparency and accountability 
that are, in turn, essential for the promotion and protection of human rights.&#8214;23 Some 
pressure groups, lobbies and professional public relations companies may hijack political 
decision-making and leave large parts of the population effectively disenfranchised.  
</p>
<p>47. While the outward face of democracy may be a multiparty system and regular 
elections, some observers contend that there is a substantial difference between the right to 
vote and the right to choose policies. If the choice of candidates for election does not 
correspond to the desires of the people, then a pro forma election among candidates who 
have been put up by political machines does not further the credibility or legitimacy of such 
&#8213;democracies&#8214;. This is not democracy but &#8213;partitocracy&#8214; (Sartori). Similarly, if the only 
choices possible are between candidate A and candidate B, whose programmes are often 
very similar, and the people do not have an opportunity to vote for a candidate C with a 
different programme, then the pro forma election of A or B does not satisfy the essence of 
what democratic government should be. In such cases, the two-party system avers itself to 
be only twice as democratic as the one-party system. Even in multiparty systems, it often 
occurs that the number of representatives in parliament does not correspond proportionally 
to the votes cast, and in some cases a party does not succeed in having a single 
representative in parliament, although proportionally it would have been entitled to some 
representation. 
</p>
<p>48. Another obstacle to the right to choose freely is the combination of policies that 
make up the cocktail of any party platform. Should the citizen be obliged to choose 
between two &#8213;package deals&#8214;, one represented by party A and the other by party B? In 
</p>
<p>many cases, the electorate may agree with as little as 30 per cent of the programme of party 
A, 30 per cent of the programme of party B, and find no candidate at all to espouse 40 per 
cent of his or her wishes. In such or similar cases confidence in the electoral process is 
undermined and results in high levels of electoral absenteeism in many countries. Indeed, 
democracy requires real choices as well as transparent and accountable governance and 
administration in all sectors of society. In other cases, party machines fail to advance a 
</p>
<p>  
 23 General comment No. 34 (2011) on the freedoms of opinion and expression, paras. 2 and 3. </p>


<p>representative number of female candidates. Citizens have a right to be given greater 
opportunity to participate in the conduct of public affairs, particularly by general 
consultations through referenda on issues, not merely by voting for individuals whose 
loyalties are not always with their electorates but more often than not with the rich sponsors 
who financed their political campaigns. In this context many observers have noted that 
election campaigns in many countries entail enormous expenditures and that the choice of 
candidates is frequently dependent on their financial strength, resulting in a kind of elitist 
&#8213;elective dictatorship&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>49. Obstacles of a more general nature are the historical inequities left by centuries of 
slavery, colonialism, imperialism and foreign occupation (that persist in some areas even 
today).24 It is obvious that those persons and countries currently enjoying privileges may 
have an interest in maintaining the status quo and be reluctant to relinquish their 
advantages. In many countries, including developed countries, there is a growing gap 
between rich and poor. It is worth recalling the words of Justice Louis Brandeis, who said it 
simply: &#8213;You can have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, or democracy, but you 
cannot have both.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>50. Other generic obstacles include lack of ethics,25 latent social Darwinism, endemic 
power asymmetry, racism, arbitrary embargoes, marginalization, taboos, &#8213;conspiracies of 
silence&#8214;, political correctness, mobbing, self-censorship, lack of transparency (particularly 
in the financial sector), lack of accountability, false prioritizing, the instrumentalization of 
some human rights for purposes of power and exclusion, abuse of rights, the tendency to 
selectivity, lack of objectivity, double standards, international law &#224; la carte, unilateral 
measures, discrimination among victims, intellectual dishonesty, political hubris, bigotry, 
perpetuation of privilege and common greed. 
</p>
<p>51. Aware that the status quo itself hampers the realization of an international order that 
is more democratic and equitable, the mandate holder intends to explore ways and means to 
overcome these obstacles. The dynamics of economic power must change if progress and a 
more inclusive and balanced growth paradigm are to be achieved. 
</p>
<p>52. There is much room &#8211; as well as need &#8211; for improvement. States, the United 
Nations, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and civil society all need to identify and 
overcome obstacles in their respective areas of competence and influence. This is required 
by the international order intended by the Charter of the United Nations, which entails a 
post-predator world consensus.

<p><b> V. Good practices and promising trends 
</b></p>
<p>53. As a democratic international order demands well-functioning interaction between 
the democratic will of peoples and the concrete policies that affect them, an equitable 
international order requires a correlation between production and wealth, performance and 
reward, and rejects the excesses of the uncontrolled financial markets that have more than 
once adversely impacted on the world economy, causing hardship such as the 
unemployment and loss of savings and pensions of millions of people. In the light of the 
persistence of extreme poverty in the world, including in developed countries, exorbitant 
salaries and bonuses, as well as currency speculation, constitute unethical practices. Efforts 
in many countries to regulate the financial markets are commendable but risk remaining 
insufficient.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. Any progress in the fields of codification, monitoring and enforcement of human 
rights is welcome, even if achieved by homeopathic doses. In her 2012 report on 
strengthening the United Nations human rights treaty body system (A/66/860), the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed greater ratification of the core human rights 
treaties. The goal is universal ratification, accompanied by education so that greater 
awareness of human rights permeates government and society in a sustainable manner. At 
this stage, the Independent Expert has not yet developed benchmarks to assess, measure and 
compare what qualitatively could be considered &#8213;best practices&#8214;. He will further consult 
stakeholders in this respect. 
</p>
<p>55. With respect to a democratic international order, the mandate holder values the 
progress achieved in the empowerment of women in many countries, the greater 
transparency shown in elections, and the added value of election monitoring by many 
actors. As stated earlier, a democratic international order is best secured by a growing 
number of democratic States and by the constant improvement of democratic institutions. 
Democracy also requires an informed citizenry that can articulate its wishes and can choose 
among policies in periodic elections and by referenda. A democratic international order 
requires greater transparency and respect for the needs and aspirations of peoples in all 
regions of the world, regardless of economic power or geopolitical strategic importance, 
giving due regard to national sovereignty and the right of self-determination. 
</p>
<p>56. The mandate holder is studying the democratic traditions of many countries and 
practices of popular initiatives, referenda, recall and impeachment. He intends to explore 
the feasibility of using aspects of the &#8213;direct democracy&#8214;26 model more broadly, which 
would give populations the opportunity to choose among policies and not only persons. It 
should be remembered that the right to vote is not identical with the right to choose. The 
manifold aspects involved in giving civil society the right to initiate legislation by petition, 
which could be put to a general vote if a certain number of signatures is reached, and the 
possibility of referenda on legislation already passed will be explored. Perhaps combining 
aspects of direct democracy and representative democracy could be appropriate for some 
countries. 
</p>

<p>57. Among practices to be studied are enhanced press freedom, access to the Internet 
worldwide, regular elections and election monitoring. Current developments in social 
media may contribute insights. In her statement at the fall session of the United Nations 
System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, held in New York in October 2011, the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that &#8213;human rights, democracy and the rule of 
law are as much a part of the UN brand as peacekeeping and development assistance&#8214;. In 
her opening statement for the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, she stated:  
</p>
<p>Much of this historic period has been marked by public demands of people to live a 
life of dignity and enjoyment of human rights. Although most striking in several 
countries of the Arab region where we have seen tens of thousands of women, men 
and young people take to the streets to voice their claims, popular movements 
denouncing exclusion, inequality, discrimination, absence of genuine political 
participation and lack of economic and social rights have emerged on all continents, 
as people have shown themselves unwilling to accept impunity and lack of 
accountability for the actions of Governments, international institutions and the 
transnational and national private sectors. People are demanding freedom: freedom 
from fear, and freedom from want. They are demanding respect of the rule of law &#8211; 
including in the economic sphere &#8211; and full participation in decisions that affect their 
lives. 
</p>
<p>58. With regard to an international order that shall be more equitable, the Independent 
Expert commends those countries that have met their commitments under the Millennium 
Declaration, in particular the Millennium Development Goals, as well as progress achieved 
in technology transfer and access to medical services and drugs. Foreign investment is 
necessary in developing countries, provided that the profits therefrom are equitably shared. 
Praiseworthy, too, is the growing consciousness that the products we buy at a grocery store 
or elsewhere should come from equitable production and trade, as illustrated by the 
growing popularity of fair trade coffee, flowers and other products. The mandate holder 
will endeavour to obtain more precise information on good practices through questionnaires 
and consultations. 
</p>
<p>59. Women&#8216;s peace movements have raised major issues relating to war and conflict 
situations. Without doubt, these movements to wage peace have accomplished historical 
inroads in influencing public opinion and are reflected in Security Council resolutions 
1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009), bringing a gender perspective into 
peace negotiations. 
</p>
<p>60. The Independent Expert is aware of State and private-sector programmes of cultural 
cooperation and mutual improvement of school textbooks and curricula. Textbooks should 
mainstream human rights and democratic values and eliminate stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>61. Among good practices in the United Nations system the Independent Expert will 
study the successes of OHCHR in providing advisory services and technical assistance to 
countries in transition to democracy, and the operation of the ILO tripartite system in 
achieving more equitable labour conditions worldwide. At Rio +20 (the United Nations 
Conference on Sustainable Development, held from 20 to 22 June 2012), the follow-up 
conference to the Earth Summit of 1992 and Agenda 21, the participating States committed 
themselves to a &#8213;green economy&#8214;, adopting an outcome document entitled &#8213;The Future We 
Want&#8214;, aiming at sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>62. The mandate holder will study the results of the Human Rights Council&#8216;s universal 
periodic review, which is one step towards international democratic order through dialogue 
among stakeholders. The Governments&#8211;United Nations&#8211;civil society triangle should be 
further developed. Without a doubt, individuals and peoples have emerged as interlocutors </p>


<p>with governments and agencies. As former Director of the United Nations Division on 
Human Rights Theo van Boven has emphasized: &#8213;People Matter&#8214;. 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Moving forward 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>A preliminary report can hardly advance conclusions or formulate 
recommendations. These are but working hypotheses that must still be tested in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>course of the coming years. The Independent Expert looks forward to receiving and 
</b></p>
<p><b>analysing feedback from stakeholders, think tanks and universities. He recognizes 
</b></p>
<p><b>that in order to advance in the realization of an international order that is more 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic and more equitable, a change of currently prevailing ways of thinking and 
</b></p>
<p><b>behaviour is necessary. Positivism must be tempered by anthropological, social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural considerations. Building a culture of equity requires recognition that we all 
</b></p>
<p><b>have the same human dignity and rights, i.e., that privileges must be phased out. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Although equity is common sense, based on a conviction that we all share an 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspiration to happiness, education is necessary to unlearn privilege, unlearn exclusion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>unlearn discrimination, unlearn prejudice, unlearn war. This is possible, as the work 
</b></p>
<p><b>of UNESCO demonstrates. A new human rights paradigm should replace the artificial 
</b></p>
<p><b>division of human rights into rights of the first, second and third generations, with its 
</b></p>
<p><b>inherent value judgment, which is both obsolete and misleading. A new paradigm of 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights could be envisioned: enabling rights (peace, food, homeland, development), 
</b></p>
<p><b>immanent rights (equality, due process) and end rights (identity, the right to achieve 
</b></p>
<p>one&#8217;s potential).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>With regard to an international order that should be more democratic, the 
Independent Expert is aware of the frequent disconnect between people and 
</b></p>
<p><b>government, and the dysfunctions prevalent in many countries, both in government 
</b></p>
<p><b>and within civil society itself. States and civil societies are invited to review the degree 
</b></p>
<p><b>of correlation between the will of the people and the policies actually implemented. A 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible citizenry should enjoy the opportunity to peacefully articulate approval or 
</b></p>
<p><b>disapproval of government policies, without intimidation or fear. Independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights institutions, or other non-governmental agencies, could 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertake the task of measuring the level of correlation through periodic polling and 
</b></p>
<p><b>make corrective recommendations to parliaments. On the global scale, an appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>organization or agency could take the temperature of world public opinion. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Supplementing the General Assembly, which is composed of government 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives, other mechanisms could be devised to allow civil society in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries to articulate their views, which in some cases may differ from those 
</b></p>
<p><b>expressed in the General Assembly by government representatives. Moreover, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>feasibility of global public opinion polling, possibly through the Internet or an 
</b></p>
<p><b>aggregate societal platform, on issues such as peace, the environment and the common 
</b></p>
<p><b>heritage of mankind should be explored. Such opinion polls would not have binding 
</b></p>
<p><b>force, but would facilitate a better overview of popular will in all regions of the world. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>With regard to a more equitable international order, the economic dynamics 
that make the rich richer and the poor poorer must be changed. This may entail, 
</b></p>
<p><b>among other things, the cancelling of the debts of many developing countries. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bretton Woods institutions have a crucial responsibility in this respect. 
</b></p>
<p>66. Bearing in mind that &#8220;the market&#8221; is not an invention of capitalism but that it 
<b>has existed for thousands of years in many different societies, social justice logically 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires that the profits resulting from the operation of markets and infrastructures 
</b></p>
<p><b>created by society be equitably shared within societies and, in a larger context, within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the human family. In order to achieve equity, other measures of affirmative action </b></p>


<p><b>must be considered. Perhaps national human rights institutions can make pertinent 
</b></p>
<p><b>proposals. Governments are thus invited to consider what strategies could be most 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducive to progress, and civil society should help their governments devise such 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies. Ultimately it is in the interest of all peoples in all countries. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>On 14 May 2012 five Human Rights Council special procedures mandate 
holders on the issues of extreme poverty, food, business, foreign debt and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international solidarity, proposed the imposition of a global financial transaction tax 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at offsetting the costs of the enduring economic, financial, fuel, climate and food 
</b></p>
<p><b>crises, and to protect basic human rights.27 Moreover, a special tax on all sales of 
</b></p>
<p><b>military aircraft, navy vessels, cruise missiles, and other weapons could be considered. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The adoption of an international arms trade treaty is necessary and further 
</b></p>
<p><b>negotiations should take place in the General Assembly. Lip service to disarmament is 
</b></p>
<p><b>insufficient; the goal is to find ways to redirect the resources used for the military and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reduce the danger of war, while liberating funds to finance development and all-
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive growth. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Advisory services and technical assistance may be necessary to assist States in 
drafting legislation and implementation mechanisms to promote democracy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>equity in their own societies.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights may assist countries in the drafting of laws and enabling legislation so 
</b></p>
<p><b>as to ensure the enforcement and follow-up of international commitments, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>decisions of international courts and tribunals. Moreover, the establishment of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>world court on human rights could be envisaged,28 a project much discussed in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>endorsed by the </b>Swiss Initiative&#8217;s Agenda for Human Rights<b>.29 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Regional economic cooperation through, for example, the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations, the African Union, the European Union, the Community of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Latin American and Caribbean States</b>, <b>as well as subregional initiatives such as Union 
of South American Nations, or MERCOSUR, should be enhanced with the support of 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional human rights institutions. Moreover, the proactive participation of world 
</b></p>
<p><b>religions and philosophies in promoting an international order that is more 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic and equitable should be encouraged. Vast human resources of good will, 
</b></p>
<p><b>optimism, enthusiasm and belief in the future must be tapped. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>As all human rights derive from human dignity, it is important to recognize 
that human dignity is not a product of positivism but an expression of natural law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rationality. Although an abstract concept, human dignity has engendered 
</b></p>
<p><b>concrete norms of human rights, a practical </b>mode d&#8217;emploi<b> strengthened by 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement mechanisms. Whereas the present mandate may also appear abstract, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>is aimed at formulating a pragmatic </b>mode d&#8217;emploi <b>to overcome and remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacles. Rendering the existing international order more democratic and more
