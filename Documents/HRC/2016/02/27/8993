<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/11. In this 
report, the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty has chosen 
as her thematic focus cash transfer programmes (CTPs). These are non-contributory programmes 
providing payments in the form of cash to individuals or households. The primary objective of 
CTPs is to increase the real income of beneficiaries in order to enable a minimum level of 
consumption within the household. CTPs have been identified as effective tools for poverty 
eradication due to their capacity to reduce economic inequalities and break the intergenerational 
transmission of poverty. Yet these programmes have seldom been discussed or analysed from a 
human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert recognizes that CTPs are a tool that can assist States in fulfilling 
their obligations under national, regional and international human rights law. The transfers may 
have an impact on the exercise of a number of economic, social, cultural, civil and political 
rights. In particular, CTPs have the potential to assist in the realization of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> Nonetheless, CTPs are not necessarily the most appropriate and effective means of tackling 
extreme poverty and protecting human rights in all contexts. CTPs should be seen as only one 
component of social assistance policies. As such, they must be integrated within social protection 
systems and grounded by solid legal and institutional frameworks framed by human rights 
standards and principles. This report aims to promote further analysis of the impact of CTPs on 
the fulfilment of the human rights of beneficiaries. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, 
Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, presents her first annual report to the Human Rights Council, 
pursuant to its resolution 8/11. Since assuming her functions on 1 May 2008, the independent 
expert has focused on integrating a human rights perspective into international, regional and 
national efforts to reduce poverty. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert presented her first report to the General Assembly (A/63/274) in 
October 2008. In that report she elaborated on the conceptual framework upon which the work of 
the mandate is based and set out her work plan for the period 2008-2010. In November 2008, the 
independent expert undertook a country visit to Ecuador. During the reporting period, she also 
participated in events and held working meetings with Governments, United Nations agencies, 
donor agencies, academic institutions, NGOs as well as representatives of the poor. In 
September 2008, the independent expert took part in the Social Forum of the Human Rights 
Council. In January 2009, she participated in the seminar on the &#8220;Draft Guiding Principles on 
extreme poverty and human rights&#8221;. She contributed to a joint report on the follow-up to the 
ninth special session of the Council on &#8220;grave violations of human rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks in the occupied 
Gaza Strip&#8221; (A/HRC/10/22). The independent expert also participated in the tenth special session 
of the Human Rights Council on &#8220;the impact of the global economic and financial crises on the 
universal realization and effective enjoyment of human rights&#8221;. 
</p><p>3. As indicated in the independent expert&#8217;s first report to the General Assembly, a human 
rights framework must guide the design and implementation of all social policies that aim to 
reduce poverty. Human rights standards will not necessarily prescribe specific policy measures, 
and States have the discretion to formulate policies that are most appropriate for their 
circumstances. However, they must ensure that international human rights obligations are taken 
into account when designing, implementing and evaluating social policies related to poverty. 
Social policies that aim to reduce poverty must promote the fulfilment, and avoid any violation, 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. Human rights standards also assist in building social consensus and mobilizing durable 
political commitments at the national, regional and international levels. They add legitimacy as 
they refer to a universally accepted set of norms and values. A focus on rights and obligations 
helps to identify who is entitled to make claims and who has a duty to take action, thereby 
empowering those who have legitimate claims to rights. While people living in extreme poverty 
may remain largely invisible to policymakers, a human rights approach facilitates their visibility 
because it requires that people are given a voice and it requires direct interventions that aim to 
protect people living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>5. The human rights normative framework also offers ways of analysing how these 
programmes should or do benefit the most vulnerable by looking not only at the end result - the 
individual/household becoming less poor - but also at the overall process: the individual 
acquiring capacities in order not to be deprived of resources, capabilities, choices, security or 
power. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. As set out in her 2008 report to the General Assembly, for her first thematic report to the 
Human Rights Council the independent expert presents below an analysis of cash transfer 
programmes (CTPs) from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>7. For the purpose of this report, CTPs refer only to non-contributory programmes providing 
payments in the form of cash to individuals or households. The primary objective of CTPs is to 
increase the real income of beneficiaries in order to enable a minimum level of consumption 
within the household, including access to social services. This report does not examine in-kind 
benefits (such as vouchers, food for work, school meals, etc.). It also excludes microfinance 
schemes (e.g. loans that require repayment, saving clubs), insurance schemes (e.g. self-financed 
health insurance, contributory pension systems) or any forms of subsidies (e.g. for food, energy 
supplies or education and health waivers). 
</p>
<p>8. In October 2008, the independent expert sent a questionnaire to all Governments 
requesting information on CTPs being implemented in their respective countries. The 
questionnaire covered five main aspects of CTPs: (a) the legal and institutional framework; (b) 
the extent of funding and coverage; (c) implementation procedures; (d) monitoring mechanisms 
and complaints procedures; and (e) studies and evaluations. Thirty-one responses were received 
between October 2008 and February 2009 from all regions of the world.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>9. On 26 and 27 February 2009, the independent expert convened a meeting organized by the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.<b>2</b> Twenty-eight experts from Governments, 
NGOs, United Nations departments and agencies, and academic institutions from across the 
world attended the meeting and analysed CTPs from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>10. The information on which this report is based was obtained from the questionnaire, during 
the expert meeting, and through an in-depth review of the available literature. The independent 
expert wishes to express her gratitude to all States that submitted information and to the experts 
and NGOs that assisted in the preparation of this report. She will continue evaluating these 
programmes in future mission reports. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMMES  
</b></p>
<p>11. Cash transfers have long been integrated in social policies in developed countries. In recent 
years however, cash transfer programmes have been implemented in every region of the world, 
especially in Latin America, Africa and South Asia. Several CTPs are targeted at the poorest 
households and at sections of the population that are regarded as vulnerable (e.g. older people, 
persons with disabilities, children). The transfer may entail a non-contributory old-age pension 
                                                 
</p>

Uruguay, Viet Nam, Zambia.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(e.g. in India), a disability grant (e.g. in Jamaica), a child support grant (e.g. in South Africa), a 
widows&#8217; allowance (e.g. in Bangladesh), or household transfers to those living in extreme 
poverty (e.g. in China). In a number of countries, more than one CTP exists (e.g. in South Africa, 
where transfers are provided together in the form of non-contributory old-age pensions, child 
grants and disability grants). 
</p>
<p>12. Some States have chosen to implement a specific type of CTP, known as Conditional Cash 
Transfer programmes (CCTPs). Under such programmes, the receipt of cash is tied to the 
beneficiaries&#8217; commitment to fulfil one or more conditions (e.g. enrolling their children in school 
or regularly taking their children for health check-ups). The World Bank describes such 
conditions as &#8220;pre-specified investments in child education and health&#8221; and as contributing to 
&#8220;the human capital of their children&#8221;.<b>3</b> The term &#8220;conditionality&#8221; is gradually being replaced with 
&#8220;co-responsibility&#8221;. This change in terminology reflects the increasing emphasis that is being 
placed on the responsibility of the State to provide public services such as health and education. 
Regardless of whether the terms conditionality or co-responsibility are used, the mechanism is in 
essence the same. 
</p>
<p>13. CTPs, conditional and unconditional, are often presented as flagship programmes for 
reducing poverty. They have been identified as effective tools for poverty eradication due to their 
capacity to reduce economic inequalities and break the intergenerational transmission of poverty, 
yet they have seldom been discussed or analysed from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert welcomes the efforts made by States implementing CTPs. In many 
cases CTPs represent one part of more extensive innovative national strategies to address 
extreme poverty. She also welcomes the fact that a great number of CTPs have developed as a 
result of South-South collaboration. 
</p>
<p>15. Poverty is not only an economic issue. It is a human rights concern and all policies and 
programmes that aim to reduce or eliminate poverty must integrate a human rights perspective. 
All policies and programmes must be designed in a manner that protects human rights and 
implementation must be carried out in a manner that ensures the protection of rights in practice. 
CTPs are a tool that can assist States in fulfilling their obligations under national, regional and 
international human rights law. In particular, they have the potential to assist in the realization of 
the right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food, clothing and housing and the 
right to social security. Moreover, they can facilitate the realization of many other rights, such as 
the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of health as well as the right 
to take part in the conduct of public affairs. CTPs may also contribute to enhanced protection of 
other civil and political rights. Nonetheless, weaknesses and deficiencies in their implementation 
and design can result, in practice, in inconsistencies with human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>16. With this report, the independent expert hopes to contribute to, and foster, dialogue 
between the human rights community and policymakers, development practitioners, economists 
and social researchers involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of CTPs.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMMES AS A COMPONENT  
OF SOCIAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS 
</b></p>
<p>17. As set out by the Secretary-General, social protection systems aim at responding to &#8220;levels 
of risk or deprivation that are deemed unacceptable within a given society&#8221;.<b>4</b> There are 
substantial differences among societies in terms of how they define social protection. &#8220;Differing 
traditions, cultures and organizational and political structures affect definitions of social 
protection, as well as the choice about how members of society should receive that protection.&#8221;<b>5</b> 
Social protection schemes may involve a range of different institutions: central or local 
governments, civil society (e.g. trade unions, NGOs) or the private sector. They can provide 
income or direct service delivery to protect individuals in periods of their lives when they are 
more vulnerable (e.g. childhood, pregnancy, old-age) or to alleviate poverty. 
</p>
<p>18. There are two predominant subcategories of social protection. Firstly, there is social 
assistance which encompasses public and private actions designed to transfer resources to groups 
deemed eligible due to vulnerability or deprivation. Secondly, there are social insurance schemes 
in which beneficiaries are requested to contribute financially (traditionally referred to as social 
security). 
</p>
<p>19. CTPs (whether conditional or not) are a component of social assistance policies which aim 
to establish &#8220;safety net programmes&#8221; or &#8220;social welfare programmes&#8221;. Social assistance policies 
provide a complement to social insurance (e.g. for private health insurance, unemployment 
benefits, contributory pensions, etc.) in social protection systems. CTPs as social-assistance 
schemes can potentially contribute to the realization of the right to social security and the right to 
an adequate standard of living although a number of conditions must be met under international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p>20. International human rights instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights generally do not use the 
term &#8220;social protection&#8221;.<b>6</b> Rather, they set out the right of everyone to &#8220;social security, including 
social insurance&#8221;. This non-exhaustive definition of social security led the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to define the right to social security in a broad manner, as 
encompassing: 
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;Contributory or insurance-based schemes such as social insurance. &#8230; generally 
involve compulsory contributions from beneficiaries, employers and, sometimes, the State, in 
conjunction with the payment of benefits and administrative expenses from a common fund&#8221;;

</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  An exception is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which sets out a 
</p>
<p>right to social protection (art. 28). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) &#8220;Non-contributory schemes such as universal schemes (which provide the relevant 
benefit in principle to everyone who experiences a particular risk or contingency) or targeted 
social assistance schemes (where benefits are received by those in a situation of need)&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (c) &#8220;Other forms of social security are also acceptable, including (a) privately run 
schemes, and (b) self-help or other measures, such as community-based or mutual schemes.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK FOR  
CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMMES 
</b></p>
<p>21. Cash transfer programmes have many reported benefits. The primary objective of many 
CTPs appears to be to empower individuals or households to cope with the impacts of poverty. 
They should, therefore, be intended primarily to contribute to the realization of the beneficiaries&#8217; 
right to an adequate standard of living. As a component of social-assistance policies, CTPs 
should also contribute to the realization of the right to social security. 
</p>
<p>22. In order to contribute to the realization of human rights, CTPs should be designed and 
implemented in ways that ensure that they comply with core obligations of the right to an 
adequate standard of living and the right to social security. CTPs must also comply with human 
rights principles, such as equality and non-discrimination, accountability, transparency, access to 
information and participation. 
</p>
<p>23. The right to an adequate standard of living is established in article 25 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and article 28 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. With respect to State parties to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, obligations include, for 
example, the obligation to devote the maximum available resources for the progressive 
realization of the right, the prohibition of taking deliberately retrogressive measures, and the duty 
to ensure the minimum essential standard of living. Furthermore, the right to an adequate 
standard of living must be exercised without discrimination of any kind and ensuring the equal 
rights of men and women (arts. 2 and 3).<b>8</b> 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 19 on the right to 
</p>
<p>social security (art. 9). 
<b>8
</b>  The obligation of progressive realization of all economic, social and cultural rights and to 
</p>
<p>devote &#8220;the maximum of its available resources&#8221; does not require a State to devote all the 
resources at its disposal nor, obviously, does it require it to devote resources that it does not have 
in order to fulfil these rights. Nevertheless, the allocation of resources is not left to the complete 
discretion of States. They have a duty to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible and 
must accord a degree of priority to human rights in the allocation of resources, collect 
disaggregated data, devise and adopt a plan of action, and monitor the realization of these rights 
among other obligations. There is also a strong presumption that retrogressive measures are not 
permitted. If such measures are introduced, States have to show that they have been introduced 
after consideration of all alternatives and are fully justifiable by reference to all the rights 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. From a human rights perspective, all persons should be covered by the social security 
system. Moreover, particular attention must be paid to ensuring that individuals belonging to the 
most disadvantaged and marginalized groups are covered at a minimum. In order to ensure 
universal coverage, non-contributory schemes such as CTPs are often necessary, especially 
because they have the potential to assist the most vulnerable and excluded to realize their rights 
by avoiding further deterioration of their living conditions. Nonetheless, the independent expert 
underlines that CTPs cannot provide a substitute for social security schemes as defined by 
international human rights law and labour law. International human rights law provides that 
States must work towards universal access to social security and towards the fulfilment of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, beyond the implementation of CTPs only. 
</p>
<p>25. The right to social security has been strongly affirmed in international law: further to 
articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration, it appears in articles 9 and 10 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, article 5 (iv) of the International Convention 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, article 11 of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, article 26 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, article 27 of the International Convention for the Protection of Migrant Workers and Their 
Families. It also appears in regional human rights instruments<b>9</b> and in several International 
Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, in particular Convention No. 102 on Minimum 
Standards of Social Security. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
mentions the right to social protection in its article 28. 
</p>
<p>26. In its general comment No. 19, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
specified the essential elements of this right, drawing from various ILO Conventions and 
Declarations and the Committee&#8217;s experience. The first element is that the right to social security 
requires that a system, whether composed of a single scheme or variety of schemes, should be 
available to ensure that benefits are provided for the relevant social risks and contingencies. This 
system is meant to be characterized by a number of features, such as being established under 
domestic law, and public authorities must take responsibility for its effective administration or 
supervision. Some CTPs meet this condition. Consideration needs to be given as to whether 
CTPs which do not meet this condition can be improved, particularly if social security systems 
have not been established by law in accordance with the right to social security. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>included in the Covenant. States parties are also under a &#8220;minimum core&#8221; obligation to ensure at 
the very least, &#8220;minimum essential levels of the rights&#8221; in the Covenant. See the Committee&#8217;s 
general comment No. 3 on the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations (art. 2, para. 1 of the 
Covenant), para. 12; its general comment No. 12, para. 28, general comment No. 14, para. 18; 
and general comment No. 19, paras. 40-42. 
<b>9
</b>  See article 9, Protocol of San Salvador and article 12, European Social Charter. The African 
</p>
<p>Charter stipulates that &#8220;the aged and the disabled shall also have right to special measures of 
protection in keeping with their physical or moral needs&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. Other essential elements of the right to social security include coverage for the nine 
principal branches of social security,<b>10</b> adequate benefit levels, and that qualifying conditions for 
the benefits are reasonable, proportionate, transparent and accessible to those who are entitled to 
them. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has also identified the core 
obligations of States, which include the obligation to provide a minimum essential level of 
benefits to all individuals and families, and to ensure the right of access to social security 
systems or schemes in a non-discriminatory manner, especially for disadvantaged and 
marginalized individuals and groups. Over time, the right to social security must be realized fully 
by States in accordance with their maximum available resources. The Committee particularly 
notes the importance of providing minimum coverage for those working in the informal 
economy as they cannot access formal schemes. 
</p>
<p>28. Research indicates that CTPs may also play an important role in supporting the realization 
of other human rights, such as the right to education (e.g. article 11, International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), the right to the highest attainable standard of health 
(e.g. art. 12) and the right to work (art. 6). 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Ensuring an adequate legal and institutional  
framework for cash transfer programmes 
</b></p>
<p>29. The replication and expansion of CTPs has promoted the simultaneous development of a 
wide range of institutional and legal frameworks for these programmes. In some cases CTPs are 
institutionalized and incorporated into a national social protection strategy, generally through 
domestic laws, including constitutional legislation. For example, in Brazil, the 1988 Constitution 
recognized the right to social protection. In South Africa, the Social Assistance Act charges the 
national Government with responsibility for social security grants.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>30. In most cases, however, CTPs are based only on presidential decrees, policy statements or 
simply operational manuals and guidelines. Pilot schemes and programmes funded mostly 
through external sources are usually based upon operational guidelines only. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  These nine branches are: health care, sickness, old age, unemployment, employment injury, 
</p>
<p>family and child support, maternity, disability, and survivors and orphans. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  Among the responses to the questionnaire, Chile, Brazil and South Africa reported the 
existence of specific legal provisions regulating their national programmes and their 
implementation. The Brazilian law (Law 10.836/2004) stipulates the right to a basic income in 
order to obtain food, education and health care. The Chilean law (Law 19949 of 5 June 2004) 
sets an indexation mechanism for the all social transfer operations in place. In South Africa, the 
Social Assistance Act (Act 13 - 2004), charges the national government with responsibility for 
social security grants. On the other hand, Kenya has a number of CTPs implemented in the 
country with strong involvement of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development 
but is still lacking a solid legislative framework. Uganda is developing a pilot scheme based on 
its Social Development Sector Strategic Investment Plan. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. In order to protect human rights there must be a clear legal framework for CTPs. Legal and 
institutional frameworks are essential in order to ensure that there is clarity regarding the various 
roles and responsibilities of government entities (at both the national and local levels), 
international organizations and civil society actors involved in the implementation of CTPs. 
</p>
<p>32. The existence of institutional and legal frameworks is also essential to ensure long-term 
involvement of State authorities at all stages of CTPs. This is the case regardless of whether they 
are implemented by States themselves, or by international or national NGOs. There is a risk that 
where CTPs are implemented without clear institutional and legal frameworks the necessary 
protection of human rights standards may be lacking and this risk increases in the case of 
small-scale initiatives and pilot projects, because when they finish, beneficiaries may be left in a 
more difficult situation than before the institution of the programme, or suffer from the abrupt 
loss of income. Without a strong legal and institutional framework and a long-term strategy, 
beneficiaries are not in a position to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>33. Where clear and effective legal and institutional frameworks are adopted there is also less 
risk that political changes jeopardize the existence of the CTPs, which in turn protects the 
enjoyment by their beneficiaries of the right to social security. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ensuring that cash transfer programmes reach the most  
vulnerable and the most excluded members of society 
</b></p>
<p>34. Universal provision of CTPs (e.g. old-age pensions given to everyone of pensionable age 
regardless of income) is the simplest and most transparent structure, and with the lowest 
administrative costs. Universal coverage reduces opportunities for corruption and has no stigma 
attached as it is available to all who qualify and might receive broad political support. The cost 
of delivering universal cash transfers is often viewed as a major impediment. Nonetheless, 
costing studies suggest that they are affordable even in low-income countries and experience 
shows that the administrative costs can be kept relatively low.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>35. When poverty is widespread, the administrative costs and problems associated with 
targeting methods in the identification, monitoring, and delivery of programmes tend to 
overweigh the benefits. Nevertheless, targeting can be useful to complement universal policies or 
when the poor represent a small percentage of the population. There are several targeting 
methods such as categorical (benefits are provided to a specific group), means testing (benefits 
are provided to individuals or households under certain criteria) and self-selection. 
</p>
<p>36. Due to resources constraints, when designing CTPs policymakers often set up eligibility 
criteria in order to target specific households or individuals. Defining which beneficiaries to 
target is one of the most complex questions in the design of any CTP. Decisions about targeting 
in the design of a CTP must make careful consideration of the fact that practical implementation 
often involves targeting errors: some of the poor may be excluded and some of the non-poor may 
</p>
<p>

Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>be included. While no targeting mechanism can ever be perfect, from a human rights perspective 
inclusion errors (providing the benefit to someone who is not in the target group) are not as 
problematic as exclusion errors (failure to provide the transfer to those targeted). 
</p>
<p>37. CTPs have the potential for targeting certain groups that would not directly benefit from 
other schemes. Depending on the characteristics of the population, certain schemes may in 
practice assist in reaching more persons than others, and from a human rights perspective, 
reaching the most vulnerable and marginalized poor people should be a primary concern. For 
example, in a number of African countries where HIV/AIDS is prevalent, universal old age 
pensions have proven to be effective because they have impacted positively on the lives of AIDS 
orphans raised by their grandparents.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>38. &#8220;Means-testing&#8221;, which is used in a number of CTPs, is an interesting method which might 
be seen as a way of reaching the poorest. Nevertheless caution is required. It involves methods of 
wealth calculation that require more sophisticated administration systems and which may lead to 
exclusion errors that are discriminatory. Moreover, the more complicated the adopted method of 
calculation is, the more opaque the eligibility criteria becomes: this can render scrutiny of the 
process by beneficiaries difficult, if not impossible. As the process becomes less transparent it 
becomes more difficult for individuals to access the CTP. In sum, means testing is costly, it is 
administratively complex and requires significant administrative capacity. It can lead to large 
under-coverage, rendering targeted programmes ineffective. These are strong reasons for 
adopting universal policies in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>39. The principle of equality and non-discrimination requires that the targeting process and 
eligibility criteria be fair, reasonable, objective and transparent. Targeting mechanisms must be 
open to scrutiny, assessed on a regular basis and must not exclude those in need of support. CTPs 
in which the registration of beneficiaries is limited to a fixed survey or to an enrolment period 
raise particular concern as to the compliance with this principle. 
</p>
<p>40. Poverty originates from overt and covert discriminatory practices and these practices in 
turn reinforce the poverty experienced by those who are subject to discrimination. If CTPs have 
as their objective the reduction of poverty, then they must contribute to reducing the 
stigmatization of beneficiaries and eliminate negative stereotypes and social exclusion. This 
implies, for example, that benefits for HIV/AIDS patients be disbursed in a way that preserves 
their dignity and their right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>41. The principle of accessibility requires that outreach and information on CTPs must be 
specifically designed to reach groups that are particularly vulnerable or excluded. Information 
should employ channels that reach the poorest segments of society (e.g. radio announcements, 
talk shows, community plays, etc.). Outreach must also overcome physical barriers (e.g. by using 
Braille or other specific means to reach persons with disabilities) and cultural barriers (e.g. by 
making information available in languages used by minorities, indigenous peoples and by

 <p> 
</p>
<p>immigrant populations). Where appropriate, technological measures to facilitate access to the 
programmes should be put into place. For example, in various states of South Africa, the 
population can access information about grants and entitlements through toll-free phones. 
</p>
<p>42. Information is not sufficient to ensure accessibility and that all eligible persons are actually 
in a position to claim their benefits. CTPs&#8217; outreach must also incorporate measures to remove 
any physical, cultural, geographical and other impediments to access by certain groups who face 
particular obstacles: in particular, persons with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous peoples, 
minorities or people with HIV/AIDS. Special measures should be taken for administrators to 
reach beneficiaries living in remote rural areas. 
</p>
<p>43. With proper guarantees against abuse, there should be ways and means for potential or 
actual beneficiaries to be represented by others. This is particularly important for the elderly and 
persons with disabilities. Accessibility also requires removing administrative barriers that may 
have a disproportionate impact on the extremely poor, such as requiring identification documents 
for registration when such documents are costly or are required in countries where many persons 
are not registered at birth.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ensuring accountability, transparency and access to information 
</b></p>
<p>44. The direct transfer of cash to a large number of beneficiaries raises concerns about 
potential abuses by the programme administrators. It is essential that all CTPs have 
accountability mechanisms in order to avoid corruption, abuse, mismanagement and political 
manipulation. Transparency and access to information are essential elements of accountability. 
</p>
<p>45. Transparency means that beneficiaries - and society at large - should be able to identify the 
roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders (at both the national and local level). There should 
also be transparency in regard to several components of the CTPs, such as targeting mechanisms, 
eligibility criteria, benefits, complaints mechanisms, and avenues for redress. As such, the first 
requirement is that the legal and institutional framework of a CTP is clear and public. 
</p>
<p>46. In order to safeguard against abuse and maladministration, CTPs should have built-in 
mechanisms for the disclosure of information about every step of implementation. Beneficiaries 
and the whole society must have access to information about the design of CTPs as well as about 
how the authorities are discharging their obligations. Information on the results of monitoring 
and evaluations should also be made available. Information must be accessible culturally 
appropriate and provided in a manner which is also accessible to the illiterate. 
</p>
<p>47. CTPs without accountability and redress mechanisms are less likely to be understood in 
terms of entitlements and rights and are rather more likely to be viewed as instruments of 
clientelism, which can be manipulated by political actors. Independent and effective mechanisms 
to monitor the administration of programmes and to collect and process complaints are essential 
to prevent abuses. Such mechanisms are essential in particular for the review of three key 
elements: qualification under the programme, the maintenance of the programme (to report 
instances of demands of inappropriate work, political support, demands for money, threats, or 
sexual harassment) and the supervision of payment procedures. These mechanisms not only 
enhance the protection of the beneficiaries but they also contribute to improving the efficiency of 
a CTP. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>48. Complaints procedures should include an appeal process that is accessible, simple, fair and 
effective. In order to reduce power imbalances, complaints mechanisms should provide 
guarantees of anonymity and they should permit both individual and collective complaints. In 
Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, evidence shows that both the protection of anonymity and the use 
of toll-free hotlines have created positive incentives and facilitated the exposure of corrupt 
practices and clientelism.<b>14</b> Complaints mechanisms must be sufficiently resourced and culturally 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>49. Under human rights standards, everyone has the right to an effective remedy when their 
rights have been violated. Therefore, quasi-judicial and judicial remedies must be available to the 
beneficiaries of CTPs. Those people that are entitled to transfers (in accordance with the national 
strategy plan), but who are excluded from the CTP, must have a final recourse to a judicial body. 
</p><p>50. Non-judicial mechanisms such as independent national human rights institutions have a 
role to play in empowering potential beneficiaries in their relationship with the programme&#8217;s 
authorities and to promote transparency. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Ensuring meaningful and effective participation 
</b></p>
<p>51. International human rights law sets out a right to participation in public life (e.g. art. 25, 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).<b>15</b> The participation of persons living in 
extreme poverty in policies and programmes that affect them, and generally in public life, is 
essential for the protection of the rights of the poor. Therefore beneficiaries of CTPs must have 
the right to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of the programmes. 
</p>
<p>52. However, participation is not simply something desirable from the point of view of 
ownership and sustainability, but rather a right. It must play a role in the design and 
implementation of CTPs. Due to the asymmetry of power between the beneficiaries of 
programmes and the authorities that administer them, beneficiaries are often unable to protect 
their rights. Without fair and effective mechanisms that enable beneficiaries to actively 
participate, CTPs are vulnerable to political manipulation. 
</p>
<p>53. The absence of participation means that policymakers and programme administrators have 
no feedback from the people and this in turn undermines their effectiveness, their development 
and their sustainability. Participation also contributes to ensuring social cohesion and political 
support for CTPs. 
</p>
<p>54. Often, when participatory strategies are put in place, they are not meaningful because 
participation is pro forma or reduced to mere consultation, which does not actually enable the 
beneficiaries to have any real impact on decisions. Frequently, participation processes are

<p>incorporated without giving serious consideration to the causes that restrict the participation of 
vulnerable groups, such as existing power asymmetries between groups in this society. This runs 
the risk of producing results that are the opposite of those desired, as it may perpetuate, rather 
than eliminate, abuses of power by local elites and the exclusion of marginalized groups, 
especially women. Therefore, participation should be understood in a broad sense. For example, 
it should include not only beneficiaries but also civil society organizations that can play a role in 
advocating the rights of the beneficiaries and compensating for the asymmetry of power. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Conditional versus unconditional cash transfer programmes 
</b></p>
<p>55. &#8220;Conditional cash transfer&#8221; programmes (CCTPs) are specific types of CTPs that pay cash 
to beneficiaries in exchange for a commitment on the part of the beneficiary to do something in 
return - such as enrol their children in school, participate in health programmes or meet nutrition 
objectives. Based on the experience of some Latin American and South Asian countries, some 
international development agencies and financial institutions, including the World Bank, are 
encouraging more countries to establish conditional CTPs. 
</p>
<p>56. There is currently a lack of sufficient evidence as to the respective costs and benefits of 
conditional versus unconditional CTPs. There is a debate as to whether attaching conditions to 
cash transfers increases the ability of CTPs to reduce poverty and improve the enjoyment of 
other human rights, for example by improving literacy or infant mortality rates. 
</p>
<p>57. There are three predominant arguments in support of CCTPs. First, they are necessary to 
influence the behaviour and attitudes of the targeted beneficiaries. This argument is based upon 
the assumption that, in the absence of conditionalities, beneficiaries would not make the same 
investment in health or education. Second, CCTPs are more likely to be perceived as benefiting 
the &#8220;deserving poor&#8221;, and therefore are able to gain wider political support. Finally, CCTPs 
contribute to the self-esteem and sense of autonomy of the beneficiaries as they are not receiving 
&#8220;something for nothing&#8221;. In addition, some advocates argue that by fostering the demand for 
health and education services, CCTPs strengthen human capital and thus in the long term 
contribute to breaking the intergenerational reproduction of poverty. 
</p>
<p>58. There are also strong arguments against conditionalities. Critics indicate that there is no 
sound social and economic evidence about the extent to which conditions are necessary to 
achieve the desired result, so that it is possible that the same improvements would be achieved 
without them. The imposition of conditions is also questioned on the basis of the potential 
negative impact of conditionalities in the absence of proper investment in the supply side of 
public services. This is particularly true for low-income countries, countries devastated by war or 
in middle-income countries where in some regions services are non-existent, inaccessible or of 
poor quality. Another argument is the fact that conditionalities involve additional monitoring and 
administration costs, as well as private costs on the beneficiaries to comply with them. Evidence 
suggests that in the context of low-income countries, resources may be better spent in extending 
existing social services rather than on the administrative costs associated with monitoring 
compliance with conditionalities. It is also argued that the imposition of conditions may 
unnecessarily undermine the individual&#8217;s autonomy and assume that the poor cannot make 
rational choices that improve their livelihoods. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>59. One of the key choices in designing conditions is determining how they will be enforced. 
While some States establish rigid penalties for non-compliance, in others, conditionalities are not 
enforced and non-compliance does not result in benefit cuts. The exclusion of an individual or a 
household from a CTP because of failure to satisfy the imposed conditions raises strong human 
rights concerns. Non-compliance with conditionalities should assist programme officials in 
identifying and acting upon problems. For example, in some countries girls are not going to 
school (a condition of the CTPs) because they are sexually harassed, pregnant women are not 
going to health clinics because the quality of service is very low or the clinics are too far away. 
In such cases, the CTP should have a mechanism in place to help families that are not complying 
with the conditionalities, without any punitive outcome. This is particularly the case when 
female heads of households are in charge of ensuring that the conditions are met (see 
paragraph 66 below). 
</p>
<p>60. Enforcing rigid conditionalities (e.g. expelling families from the CTP for failure to comply 
the condition) may mean that the poorest are punished. States must ensure that whatever policy 
they implement, the final result will not violate the right of individuals to at least a minimum 
essential level of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  The current economic crisis, cash transfer programmes and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution S-10/1, invited all relevant special procedures 
to consider the impacts of the current economic and financial crises on the enjoyment of human 
rights. While the international community is still assessing the impact of the crisis, it is clear that 
the poor are disproportionately affected, and that the crisis will push more people into poverty. 
</p>
<p>62. At the time of writing, countries were in the process of deciding which policies to adopt in 
order to mitigate the social impacts of the crisis, including responses to wage and savings losses, 
reduction of remittances, increased prices of basic food, fuel, essential drugs, home foreclosures 
and limited access to credit. Stimulus packages announced in some countries tend to include cash 
transfer initiatives and expansion of social security schemes for example strengthening 
unemployment benefits (e.g. Canada, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America), increased cash transfer 
programmes (e.g. Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Philippines, 
Republic of Korea and Thailand), child benefits (e.g. Australia, Germany, Mexico, South Africa 
and Spain) and old age pensions (e.g. Argentina and China). 
</p>
<p>63. The majority of developing countries face a contracted fiscal space, limiting government 
spending and investment in social services. There are risks that official development assistance 
(ODA) may decrease too. However, evidence from previous crises, especially from the Asian 
crisis in the late 1990s, shows that crises periods are not the moment when social expenditures 
should be cut.<b>16</b> On the contrary, it should be used as an opportunity to redress imbalances and 
set up comprehensive social security systems, of which cash transfer programmes are only one 
element. 
</p>
<p>

</i></p>
<p><i>poverty</i>, World Bank Policy Research Report, 2009, p. 197. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. CTPs should be seen as one policy tool amongst many others that are necessary to tackle 
the crisis. The 1929 financial crisis caused widespread poverty in developed countries, but it also 
led to government programmes such as the New Deal, because it generated the political will to 
expand social security systems for all, social assistance for the poor and employment 
programmes. The same opportunity exists today in developing countries - with the support of 
international assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>65. Any CTPs must be accompanied by long-term social security systems. Unclear 
economic perspectives across developed and developing countries should not be interpreted 
as sufficient reason to regress on the realization of the economic and social rights of all, 
including the rights to social security and to an adequate standard of living. Implementing 
temporary cash transfer initiatives alone would not amount to sufficient efforts towards the 
realization of these rights. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  GROUPS IN NEED OF PARTICULAR ATTENTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Women and gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>66. Human rights law allows, and under certain circumstances requires, States to adopt 
temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women 
(article 4, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women). In 
addition, States must take all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of 
conduct of men and women with the aim of eliminating prejudices, customary and all other 
practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either sexes or on 
stereotyped roles for men and women (art. 5 (a)). States must also promote a common 
responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children (art. 5 (b)). 
</p>
<p>67. As noted by many observers and stressed by the independent expert in her 2008 report to 
the General Assembly (A/63/274), the multifaceted nature of gender discrimination means that 
women are overrepresented among the extremely poor. Recognizing this, many CTPs include 
specific provisions to address gender inequality. For example, in some schemes women qualify 
for a social pension transfer at an earlier age than men (e.g. South Africa). In other countries, 
transfers target poor widows and destitute women (e.g. Bangladesh) or they are channelled 
through the female head of the recipient household (e.g. most CCT programmes in 
Latin America). Sometimes, both conditional and unconditional transfers aim explicitly to 
bolster the nutrition, health and education of girls and mothers living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>68. Some of these CTPs have been successful in reducing the country&#8217;s gender gap in 
education and in empowering women. It has been argued that channelling the cash through 
women reinforces their role and independence, especially as they are entrusted with financial 
matters within their families. This results in a shift in the balance of power in the household, as 
women acquire greater control over household expenditure and the increased income is 
considered as increasing opportunities for women to seek jobs and education.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>69. Men and women are indeed affected in different ways by the CTPs. A gender-based 
approach is required to refine the analysis on the potential impact of CTPs in the enjoyment of 
human rights by women living in extreme poverty. For example, means testing that links a 
woman&#8217;s eligibility to a spouse&#8217;s income can exacerbate potential vulnerability to abuse or 
economic deprivation. 
</p>
<p>70. Without the removal of legislative, procedural and cultural barriers that impede women&#8217;s 
participation, they cannot exercise their rights. Often, women&#8217;s participation is constrained due 
to their subordinate status in relation to men at home (e.g. husbands, fathers and brothers) or men 
as decision makers and power-holders (traditional leaders, local council members, judges, 
police).<b>17</b> Women often confront disadvantages in terms of education, access to land, credit and 
other productive assets. Without security, power or resources they cannot participate and demand 
accountability. 
</p>
<p>71. CTPs that make women heads of household ensure that conditions are met (e.g. sending 
children to school, participating in health checks or attending nutrition workshops) may create an 
unnecessary burden on women while perpetuating traditional notions of gender roles within the 
family. Putting conditionalities on women is based on evidence suggesting that women&#8217;s 
commitment to the well-being of their families is generally greater than that of men. In such 
case, programmes are designed to circumvent the risks of men misusing the resources provided 
to them and ensuring that the intended beneficiary (e.g. children) is reached. However, this 
approach runs a high risk of perpetuating patriarchy and society&#8217;s view of this behaviour instead 
of working to change it.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>72. CTPs imposing conditionalities on women may have a punitive outcome if they do not take 
into account the opportunity costs for women (e.g. their own time and behaviour) or ensure that 
services are available, affordable and gender-sensitive. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Children 
</b></p>
<p>73. Resource transfers facilitate the compliance with several obligations assumed by States 
with regard to children. They can have an impact on a child&#8217;s right to survival (article 6, 
Convention on the Rights of the Child), on their right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of health (art. 24), on the right to benefit from social security, including social insurance 
(art. 26), on the right to a standard of living adequate for the child&#8217;s physical, mental, spiritual, 
moral and social development (art. 27), on the right to the highest attainable standard of health 
(art. 24) and right to education (art. 28), among others. As established under the Convention, &#8220;a 
child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the 
child, majority is attained earlier&#8221;.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. Extreme poverty affects children not only in the immediate present, but also in the longer 
term, having a cumulative impact on their evolving capacities. Children are particularly 
dependent on social services to provide the conditions they need to grow without suffering from 
poverty. Children require, in particular, access to health, social welfare and educational 
services.<b>19</b> Support to children may also be deeply affected by economic deprivation and other 
changes that significantly reduce family capabilities to invest in their development. 
</p>
<p>75. Many CTPs identify children as a vulnerable group. These CTPs channel the benefits to 
heads of households with the expectation that alleviating economic constraints will be a direct 
(in the case of conditional cash transfer) or indirect (for the unconditional) incentive for 
improving access to health, education and nutrition for children. Programmes may also focus on 
discouraging child labour, and on raising gender equality by supporting investment in the human 
capital of girls and the bargaining power of women within the household. 
</p>
<p>76. Evidence suggests that cash transfers are an effective tool in improving some indicators 
related to child poverty. It suggests that various models of cash transfers targeting children can 
have broadly similar effects on poverty reduction.<b>20</b> According to studies, the regularity and 
reliability of payments allows families to start planning again and investing additional income in 
generating activities, or in the education of their children.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>77. Even if children are frequently indicated as the target population of CTPs, they are not 
usually seen as the subjects of rights, and the evaluation of CTPs is very often not adequately 
child-focused. The improvement of net income to a household with children may have very 
limited effects if the social services offered to these same children remain inadequate to meet 
their basic needs. </p>
<p>78. Data compiled by the World Bank indicates that conditional CTPs had positive effects on 
school enrolment and attendance, and that they occasionally helped to reduce the gender gap in 
school enrolment.<b>22</b> Available research says little, however, about whether students actually learn 
more. Furthermore there is little evidence about the modest effects in school participation, 
progression and attainment of additional years of schooling.<b>23</b> Experts express particular fears

</p>
<p>that the imposition of conditions as a part of CTPs may have negative influence on the school 
environment, as it provides teachers with additional means to exert authority over students and 
parents, that are not dependent on the quality of the instruction they provide.<b>24</b> The same study 
indicates that empowering teachers with the authority to directly influence the welfare of poor 
families may undermine the potential to develop more democratic and participatory forms of 
school management. 
</p>
<p>79. There is also some evidence of increases in the use of preventive health services as a 
consequence of the transfer. Nonetheless, it is apparent only for some outcomes (such as growth 
monitoring for children) and generally not for others (such as immunization rates).<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>80. Research also indicates that CTPs accompanied by information, social support, weight 
monitoring and micronutrient supplements, can stimulate healthier feeding practices and improve 
young children&#8217;s nutritional status dramatically, particularly the incidence of stunting. However, 
the mixed picture with respect to issues such as vaccination, morbidity and mortality, suggests 
that encouraging utilization of services through CTPs may not produce the expected results if the 
quality of the services offered remains low.

<p>81. The reduction of child labour is not an explicit objective of the majority of the existing 
CTPs. Nevertheless the ILO has identified it among the positive effects that CTPs have had in 
Latin America.<b>26</b> However, the lack of adequate data on child labour in most countries impedes 
the identification of the exact impact of the transfers in child labour. 
</p>
<p>82. In general terms, the impact of CTPs on children living in poor households can be 
influenced by: (a) the volume of the transfers; (b) the degree to which the design of the scheme is 
child-oriented;<b>27</b> (c) who controls the transfers at the household level; and (d) the availability of 
complementary social services.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>83. CTPs should only be seen as one component of the wider social protection system. The 
impact that CTPs may have on children&#8217;s lives can only be achieved through their full 
integration with a broad range of social policies and the provision of public services. Special

<p>  CTPs could achieve this by either focusing on children, by taking children&#8217;s needs into 
account when determining the size of transfers, and/or by linking beneficiary households to other 
services that provide for children&#8217;s needs.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>attention should be paid to particularly vulnerable groups of children, such as orphans, street 
children, children with disabilities, and child-headed households, who are detached from 
adult-headed households and often are omitted from CTP. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>84. Disability is often both a cause and consequence of poverty. There are 
approximately 650 million persons with disabilities in the world - that is 10 per cent of the global 
population. An estimated 80 per cent of these persons live in developing countries, many in 
poverty. In both developed and developing countries, evidence suggests that persons with 
disabilities are disproportionately represented among the poor and tend to be poorer than their 
counterparts without disabilities.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>85. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, article 2 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and the principle of non-discrimination in international human rights law 
oblige States to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy all human rights on an equal basis 
with others.<b>30</b> It recognizes the right of persons with disabilities to an adequate standard of living 
for themselves and their families and to ensure their realization without discrimination on the 
basis of disability. It also recognizes the obligation of States to ensure their right to social 
protection without discrimination. States must ensure access of persons with disabilities to social 
protection and poverty reduction programmes and the right of those living in poverty and their 
families to have access to assistance from the State with disability-related expenses, including 
financial assistance (article 28, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities). 
</p>
<p>86. The above Convention also specifically recognizes the importance of international 
cooperation and its promotion of the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities: it 
stipulates that international cooperation measures should be inclusive of, and accessible to, 
persons with disabilities, and facilitate and support capacity-building (art. 32). 
</p>
<p>87. Disability grants must be part of a broader social protection system that should include a 
comprehensive set of measures, from inclusive access, to education and health services to 
facilitate employment. A key concern should be the adequate standard of living and social 
inclusion of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>88. Today, there is a lack of data on the impact of CTPs on persons with disabilities and their 
families. States should strengthen the collection of data on the impact of CTPs on persons with 
disabilities as well as in regard to the type and degree of disability in the population.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>89. The potential cost of national CTPs in low-income countries is not insignificant. 
Nonetheless, evidence suggests that they are affordable and can be implemented where the 
necessary political will exists.<b>31</b> In some cases, they are made possible by the provision of 
international assistance. States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights are obliged to use the maximum available resources, individually or in the 
context of international assistance and cooperation (art. 2, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>90. In recent years, several States, donor agencies, international financial institutions and 
NGOs have shown interest in supporting more CTPs. The World Bank announced that in 2009, it 
would provide US$ 2.4 billion in lending to scale up and start CCTP operations around the 
world. 
</p>
<p>91. CTPs cannot replace other measures of international assistance - rather they can only 
complement wider assistance packages. Donors may however play a crucial role in ensuring 
sustainable social security systems in recipient countries. To this end, international assistance 
should be transparent, predictable and reliable, and should support long-term processes that 
empower the poor. Donor initiatives should be coordinated to foster a more comprehensive 
coverage, reduce duplication and lower administrative costs. 
</p>
<p>92. When implementing CTPs with external assistance, it is crucial to build political support 
and country ownership of the programmes.<b>32</b> The design of any CTP must be based on the 
particular circumstances of the recipient country, in addition to being in compliance with human 
rights standards. CTPs should be introduced in genuine partnership with the recipient State and 
in dialogue with the potential beneficiaries. With the support of donors, States must invest in 
building the capacity of their institutions and staff to deliver CTPs. 
</p>
<p>93. Pilot projects of CTPs provide an implementation option that is useful when, for example, 
a country lacks sufficient human or financial resources to fully implement its own programme. 
However, to ensure ownership and sustainability during the pilot period, donor agents should 
seek harmonization of their aid and assistance. In addition, recipient States should ensure that the 
pilot project is implemented within an appropriate legal and institutional framework. Even 
during a pilot period, it is desirable that the recipient State contribute to or co-finance it (to their 
maximum available resources), and explicitly commit to increase progressively the contribution 
of domestic funds. 
</p>
<p>94. Intergovernmental organizations and particularly international financial institutions should 
respect and support the fulfilment of States human rights obligations in the context of CTPs.

<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Cash transfer programmes are today considered an effective means to alleviate 
poverty and extreme poverty worldwide. In developed countries, where better established 
social security systems are in place, the transfer of resources to households living in 
extreme poverty is a longstanding component of a number of social assistance programmes. 
More recently, CTPs and CCTPs have been developed and replicated in several developing 
countries. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The independent expert recognizes that CTPs are a policy option that can assist 
States in fulfilling their human rights obligations. Transfers can impact positively on the 
exercise of a number of economic, social, cultural civil and political rights. In particular, 
CTPs have the potential to assist in the realization of the right to an adequate standard of 
living including adequate food, clothing and housing. Hence, the independent expert 
welcomes the efforts made by States implementing CTPs, in many cases as part of broader 
national strategies to address extreme poverty. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Nonetheless, CTPs are not necessarily the most appropriate and effective means of 
tackling extreme poverty and protecting human rights in all contexts. CTPs should be seen 
as only one component of comprehensive efforts to reduce poverty. Weaknesses and 
deficiencies in the design and implementation of CTPs may result, in practice, in 
inconsistencies with human rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>While further analysis is required on how CTPs can contribute to, or impact on, the 
enjoyment on human rights the independent expert will continue to examine the links 
between human rights and social protection systems, including CTPs, over the course of 
her mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>She wishes to present the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Integrate CTPs within social protection systems and ensure solid legal and 
institutional frameworks: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States must fully integrate CTPs within broader social protection systems. 
In order to become a stable component of these systems, CTPs must be 
well articulated within the existing social security system - its legal and 
institutional framework must take into account the international and 
national standards regarding the right to social security; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) States must establish solid legal and institutional frameworks in order to 
guarantee legitimacy, effectiveness and sustainability of CTPs. Legal and 
institutional frameworks are shields against political and economic 
instability and, most importantly, are essential elements to ensure clear 
determination of responsibilities; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Integrate human rights principles and standards throughout the design, 
implementation and evaluation of CTPs; while taking into consideration specific conditions 
of each country, in particular demographic, geographic, economic and social conditions, 
States should ground their decisions on the following principles and standards: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Equality and non-discrimination: The principle of equality and 
non-discrimination requires States to give priority to disadvantaged and 
marginalized individuals and groups. States must ensure that targeting 
processes and eligibility criteria are fair, effective and transparent, and 
that they safeguard against discrimination. CTPs must not lead to further 
stigmatization or social exclusion of any individual or group in society. 
The principle of non-discrimination also requires that States pay 
continuous attention to the accessibility and adaptability of the schemes to 
different physical, geographical, social, cultural contexts, taking into 
consideration particular constraints faced by groups particularly 
vulnerable to discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Transparency, access to information and accountability: States must 
ensure that CTPs have built-in mechanisms for the disclosure of 
information about the programmes&#8217; design and functioning. Information 
on the results of monitoring and evaluation should also be made widely 
available. Information must be accessible, culturally appropriate and 
provided in a manner which is accessible to all, in particular those 
receiving the transfer. States must also ensure that CTPs have complaints 
mechanisms that are easily accessible, sufficiently resourced and culturally 
appropriate. Beneficiaries must have access to effective remedies in cases 
of performance failure or abuses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Meaningful participation: 
 States must ensure the existence of mechanisms to stimulate meaningful 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation by those living in poverty in the context of the 
implementation of CTPs. The establishment of participatory channels 
must take into account local power structures and ensure the inclusion of 
particularly vulnerable groups. The result of meaningful participatory 
processes should lead to the elimination of asymmetries of power between 
those receiving benefits and those distributing them, enhancing the 
capacities of beneficiaries to resist potential political manipulation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Further assess the impact of conditional cash transfers: States that attach 
conditions to cash transfer schemes must ensure their implementation does not exclude and 
further expose to human rights violations those that fail to comply with the established 
requirements. Prior to attaching conditionalities to cash transfers, States and policymakers 
must undertake in-depth analyses of the programmes&#8217; capacity to properly monitor 
compliance and simultaneously provide social services that correspond to the needs of the 
population living in extreme poverty; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Mainstream gender perspectives: States must mainstream gender into the 
design and implementation of CTPs. They should assess whether programmes affect 
women&#8217;s decision-making authority and participation, and whether they perpetuate 
gender-biased stereotyped roles for men and women. Gender equality must also be one of 
the standards against which the performance of the CTPs are evaluated. States should also 
strengthen the collection of gender-disaggregated data about the impact of CTPs and 
ensure that their complaint mechanisms are gender-sensitive; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Integrate CTPs with broader cross-sectoral child-focused policies: States must 
ensure the full integration of CTPs into a broad range of social policies, and the provision 
of public services focused on children in other areas, in order to increase their impact on 
children&#8217;s lives. Special attention should be paid to some vulnerable groups of children, 
such as orphans, street children, children with disabilities, and child-headed households 
States are required to ensure that all children are treated without discrimination of any 
kind; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Integrate CTPs for persons with disabilities into social protection systems: 
States must ensure that CTPs for persons with disabilities are integrated into social 
protection systems. The use of CTPs as a measure to cover the substantive gaps that exist in 
various national social protection systems is acceptable as long as they are developed within 
a strategy that pursues the establishment of progressive universal schemes that will ensure 
the fulfilment of the right to social security. Particular measures to avoid stigmatization 
and further exclusion must be also devised in parallel to the transfers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure international cooperation to support the implementation of CTPs: 
International cooperation is required in order to develop and expand CTPs around the 
world. In particular, in situations of economic crisis, international support can play a 
decisive role in the protection of the most vulnerable through CTPs. Cooperation toward 
the implementation of CTPs must be guided by human rights standards and must 
particularly consider the long-term integration of the transfers into national social 
protection systems; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Expanding social protection systems: States should use the momentum created 
by the current financial crisis to build political consensus to ensure sufficient levels of 
public spending on social policies and interventions, including the expansion of social 
security, health and education coverage.
