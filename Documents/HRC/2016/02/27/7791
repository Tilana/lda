<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth session from 
22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of the Russian Federation was held at the 12th meeting 
on 29 April 2013. The delegation of the Russian Federation was headed by the Minster of 
Justice, Alexander Konovalov. At its 18th meeting, held on 3 May 2013, the Working 
Group adopted the report on the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Russian Federation: Argentina, Benin, 
Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of the Russian Federation: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/RUS/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/16/RUS/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/RUS/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Kyrgyzstan, the Netherlands, Norway, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Slovenia and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Russian Federation 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the recommendations of the first cycle of the UPR had 
become additional guarantees for increasing observance of human rights and the 
effectiveness of the mechanisms for their protection. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that significant measures had been taken to ensure the 
implementation of human rights guarantees and principles enshrined in the Constitution. 
The main achievements and impediments to the realization of human rights had been 
mentioned in the national report, prepared in cooperation with civil society. 
</p>
<p>7. As indicated in the national report, the democratization of State institutions and 
increasing civil society participation in decision-making had remained a priority. The 
delegation explained that, as of 2012, all federal executive bodies had been required by law 
to publish information on draft normative acts and to carry out public discussion on them, 
including with the participation of the public councils which included representatives of 
civil society. Furthermore, the Government had approved a concept regarding a new 
mechanism envisaged for public submission of legislative proposals by citizens through the 
Internet for their subsequent consideration by the Government. </p>


<p>8. The mechanism for law enforcement monitoring had operated over the past three 
years. It provided for broad participation of civil society in the evaluation of the 
effectiveness of legislation, as well as in the analysis of the need for legal amendments. 
Over the past four years the civil society institutions had been able to independently 
evaluate legislation. 
</p>
<p>9. The concept of open government provided many opportunities for the active 
involvement of civil society in the process of oversight over the Government&#8217;s activities. 
</p>
<p>The posts of Ombudspersons for children&#8217;s rights and the rights of entrepreneurs had been 
set up alongside the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) and the Council on the 
Development of Civil Society and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government continued administrative reforms aimed at increasing access to 
government services and limiting the competences of specific public officials, including 
those leading to arbitrary decisions and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>11. The procedures for creating and registering non-commercial organizations had been 
simplified and their periodic reporting had been brought down to a minimum. The 
registration requirements of political parties had also been revised and simplified. More 
than 60 political parties had been registered and their number had been constantly growing. 
</p>
<p>12. Video broadcasting from more than 90,000 polling stations was introduced through 
the Internet during the 2012 presidential elections to ensure transparency of the voting 
process, which would continue to operate for all subsequent elections. 
</p>
<p>13. While some difficulties remained in the army, the penitentiary system and some 
social institutions, significant progress had been made. In particular, reforms in in the 
penitentiary system had started in 2009, such as revision of the criminal legislation, which 
shifted the focus towards alternative punishments to deprivation of liberty. As a result, the 
number of persons sentenced to imprisonment was decreased and the ratio between persons 
sentenced to imprisonment and alternative forms of punishments had also gone down from 
3:1 to 2:3. 
</p>
<p>14. Another important area of the prison reform was to increase the guarantees of the 
rights of inmates, such as access to medical care, educational services, acquisition of 
professional skills and rehabilitation. The public oversight commissions, comprised of 
representatives of civil society, had regular access to all penitentiary institutions. 
</p>
<p>15. Significant measures were taken to eliminate corruption, including the amendment 
of relevant legislation. The authorities worked closely in this area with the relevant 
international and regional intergovernmental bodies. 
</p>
<p>16. The law-enforcement bodies had been reorganized, additional guarantees limiting 
their activities had been created and mechanisms for the eradication and prevention of all 
forms of torture and cruel treatment had been established. 
</p>
<p>17. Several measures had been undertaken to increase the independence of the courts 
and transparency of their proceedings. Any interested person could obtain information 
related to the functioning of the courts and to the proceedings of criminal and civil cases, 
subject to the data protection requirements. All court decisions had been published and 
were widely accessible. 
</p>
<p>18. In 2011 the possibility of determining the composition of the court through 
automated computer systems was provided, allowing for random selection of judges and 
thus minimizing the chances of appointing persons interested in the outcome of specific 
cases. Several draft laws had been initiated to suppress attempts by individuals or officials 
to influence court proceedings and decisions and to provide guarantees against abuse of </p>


<p>power. Russia had been taking measures to bring its national judicial practices into 
compliance with the standards of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). 
</p>
<p>19. The law on free legal aid adopted in 2010 had broadened the guarantees of access to 
free legal advice in civil cases for the neediest sectors of the population. Free legal advice 
in criminal cases had always been provided without any limitations. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation noted that the legacy of the past and various unfavourable factors 
inherited had continued to impair the realization of human rights. Systemic risks, such as 
arbitrariness of decisions taken by public and municipal officials, insufficient 
responsiveness and effectiveness of the courts, and the low level of public dialogue in 
society remained, and these had been taken into account in designing new measures. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 102 delegations made statements.

report.

</p>
<p>29. Indonesia commended the adoption of the national strategy for action in children&#8217;s

the minimum wage, leading to a decline in poverty. 
</p>
<p>30. The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomed the delegation of the Russian Federation and 
noted investment in health and education, which had led to improved quality of life. Active 
participation in the UPR demonstrated commitment to human rights. 
</p>
<p>31. Iraq welcomed implementation of measures resulting from the previous cycle of the 
UPR, including judicial reform, protection of the right to education of persons with 
disabilities and efforts to combat terrorism. </p>

funded organizations. 
</p>

Cultural Rights (CESCR) and encouraged the country to do so. It welcomed ratification of

the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC), encouraging 
its ratification. 
</p>

</p>
<p>50. The Netherlands raised the question of the LGBT community and legislation 
restricting freedoms of expression and assembly, and the issue of harassment of NGOs, 
journalists and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>51. Nicaragua noted legislative and institutional reforms and improved administration of 
justice. It welcomed the appointment of the Commissioner for the Rights of the Child and 
the National Action Plan for Children. 
</p>
<p>52. Nigeria commended progress made in promoting and protecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>53. Norway, while commending simplified procedures for registering political parties, 
expressed concern over human rights defenders and at laws on restricting NGOs, and on 
treason and extremism. 
</p>
<p>54. The delegation stated that the amendments made in June 2012 to the Federal Act on 
assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, marches and picketing increased responsibility for the 
violations committed in this sphere. Not a single provision set forth in this Act, however, 
would be comparatively stricter than measures provided for in similar laws of other 
countries. Some provisions of this Act would be subjected to additional clarifications 
further to the decision taken by the Constitutional Court in February 2013. For example, the 
minimum fines would be reduced and punishment in the form of mandatory work would be 
abolished. Some restrictions related to violations of public order, health and safety norms, 
and obstruction to movement of transport were consistent with the restrictions applied by 
other countries, and the validity of these restrictions has been confirmed by the 
Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>55. The &#8220;foreign agent&#8221; status of NGOs did not trigger any restrictions or sanctions for 
NGOs with this status. Sanctions could only be applied by the court and only when the 
provisions of the Act on the voluntary declaration of the &#8220;foreign agent&#8221; status were not 
</p>
<p>being complied with. The purpose of introducing this status was to obtain information as to 
whether the organizations had foreign funding and had been involved in domestic politics. 
The delegation stated that the monitoring and checks which had been carried out by the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had been among planned activities. 
</p>
<p>56. The Criminal Code ensures liability for obstructing the lawful professional activities 
of journalists either by preventing them from disseminating information or by forcing them 
to disclose sources. The sanction for a violation of this provision was increased in 
December 2011 to six years&#8217; imprisonment. Criminal prosecution of journalists for their 
professional activities did not take place, but crimes against journalists and human rights 
activists unfortunately did occur. Crimes committed in relation to these persons&#8217; 
professional activities were being dealt with by the Investigative Committee as a matter of 
priority. 
</p>
<p>57. With respect to the murder of Anna Politkoskaya, the delegation reported that one of 
the accomplices in the case had already been sentenced to long-term imprisonment. The 
murderers of Stanislav Markelov and Anastasia Baburova had also been sentenced. An 
international arrest warrant had been issued for the alleged perpetrator of murder of Natalya </p>


<p>Estemirova. Measures had been taken to solve other crimes committed against journalists 
and human rights activists. 
</p>
<p>58. The right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution and censorship 
was prohibited. Distribution of information that could cause damages should be limited in 
order to prevent terrorism, extremism, etc. Legal amendments had singled out three 
particularly dangerous types of information, namely, child pornography, instructions on 
how to produce drugs and information on ways to commit suicide. In March 2013, the list 
of information that could cause damages was supplemented by information on the children 
who had been victims of crimes. The Law provided for a number of steps in order for 
specific information to be deemed prohibited. Prohibitions related only to the specific types 
of information mentioned above and had no impact on freedom of expression or the use of 
the Internet. Filters had an important role to play as far as children&#8217;s access to the Internet 
was concerned. 
</p>
<p>59. There was no specific legislation regulating the Internet and this had been subject to 
general legal norms. The delegation highlighted that restrictions in this area had been 
introduced with the aim of countering terrorism, extremism and prevention of 
dissemination of dangerous information and the implementation thereof should be carried 
out in accordance with the law in order to make restrictions on freedom of expression 
unnecessary. 
</p>
<p>60. Regarding questions on restrictions on freedom of assembly and demonstrations, the 
delegation stated that legal reforms in this area had been completed and that the key 
objective of the legislation was to ensure balance between the realization of freedom of 
expression for all, including through public manifestation, and public order. 
</p>
<p>61. Pakistan welcomed the 2012 legislation providing for free legal assistance to 
citizens, establishment of Regional Commissioners for human rights and a Commissioner 
for children&#8217;s rights. It noted steps to comply with the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>62. Paraguay noted results in protecting human rights, and protection of women and 
persons with disabilities. It noted evolution in due process and freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>63. The Philippines welcomed the signing of the Convention on the Legal Status of 
Migrant Workers from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS States). It 
commended the establishment of the Commissioner for Children&#8217;s Rights and expressed 
confidence with regard to similar protection for women. 
</p>
<p>64. Poland noted the development of human rights infrastructure. It expressed concern 
at regulations requiring NGOs to register as foreign agents, and about reports of violence 
against women and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>65. The Republic of Korea highlighted significant steps taken to address racially 
motivated crime and improvements to ease the requirements for founding political parties.

right to a fair trial. Considerable progress had been achieved: some laws had been adopted 
or amended; compensation to citizens for violation of their right to the prompt
