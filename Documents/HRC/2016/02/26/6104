<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 
18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance 
with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect human 
rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the responsible operation of transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises and effective national legislation can contribute to the promotion of respect for 
human rights and assist in channelling the benefits of business towards contributing to the 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> that weak national legislation cannot effectively mitigate the negative impact of 
globalization or derive maximally the benefits of activities of transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises and that therefore efforts to bridge governance gaps at the national, 
regional and international levels are necessary, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the reports of the Special Representative and in particular the 
identification, through the process of consultations, studies and analysis, of the framework based 
on the three overarching principles of the State duty to protect all human rights from abuses by 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, the corporate responsibility to respect 
all human rights, and the need for access to effective remedies, including through appropriate 
grievance mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to operationalize this framework with a view to providing more 
effective protection to individuals and communities against human rights abuses by transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, and to contribute to the consolidation of existing 
relevant standards and any future initiatives; </p>

persons belonging to vulnerable groups, in particular children; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To liaise closely with the efforts of the human rights working group of the Global 
Compact in order to identify, exchange and promote best practices and lessons learned on the

</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To work in close coordination with United Nations and other relevant international

programmes, treaty bodies, civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as

</p>
<p>his mandate, inter alia, through the submission of comments and suggestions on the issues 
related to his mandate; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
organize, within the framework of the Council, a two-day consultation bringing together the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, States, business representatives and all relevant 
stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations and representatives of victims of
