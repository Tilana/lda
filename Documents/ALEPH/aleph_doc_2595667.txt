1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. 
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate 
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The 
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period. 
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3. 
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the 
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period. 
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, where the entity’s 
corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable. 
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just 
retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can 
also, if you wish, delete the “OR” at the end of the selection.

Diversity 
The Group understands the value inherent in a diverse workforce and promotes a high performance culture that draws 
on  the  diverse  and  relevant  experience,  skills  and  expertise  of  its  board  members  and  employees.  The  board  is 
committed to having an appropriate blend of diversity throughout the Group that will provide the benefits of a broader 
pool  of  high  quality  employees,  improving  employee  retention,  accessing  different  perspectives  and  unique  personal 
attributes. 
 
The  board  has  established  a  policy  regarding  gender,  age,  ethnic  and  cultural  diversity  and  details  of  the  policy  are

Key management personnel exclude directors which are reported as part of board representation. 
 
The board has determined that no specific measurable objectives will be established due to the size of the Company 
being  less  than  10  employees.  The  board  does  not  consider  it  practical  or  meaningful  to  formerly  establish  specific 
targets at this time. The Company will however, continually look for opportunities to increase gender diversity at a board 
and key management personnel level in future years as projects move to a steady state operational environment.   
 
 
Performance evaluation 
The board reviews and evaluates its performance and the performance of the individual directors including the CEO, the 
committees  of  the  board  and  senior  executives  periodically.  The  board  and  the  committees  conduct  an  annual  self-
assessment  questionnaire  of  their  performance,  which  serves  to  identify  strengths,  weaknesses  and  areas  of 
improvement. The completed self-assessments are taken into account by each committee and the board in determining 
performance improvements for the following year. 
 
The performance evaluation in respect of the year ended 30 June 2016 has taken place in accordance with this process. 
 
 
Principle 2: Structure the Board to add value 
The membership of the board is considered by the full board from time to time, having regard for the ongoing needs of 
the  Company.  The  board  is  structured  to  ensure  that  it  has  proper  understanding  of  current  and  has  the  skills  and 
competence  to  exercise  independent.  Directors  of  the  Company  are  considered  to  be  independent  when  they  are 
independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with or could 
reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with the exercise of their unfettered and independent judgment.
3
An independent director is a non-executive director (i.e. is not a member of management) and:
–
Is  not  a  substantial  shareholder  of  the  Company  or  an  officer  of,  or  otherwise  associated  with,  a  substantial 
shareholder of the Company;
–  Within the last three years has not been employed in an executive capacity by the Company or its subsidiaries, or
–
–
been a director after ceasing to hold any such employment; 
Is  not  a principal  or  employee  of  a  professional  adviser  to  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries  whose  billings  are  a 
material part of the advisor’s total revenue. A director who is a principal or employee of a professional advisor will 
not participate in the provision of any service to the Company by the professional adviser; 
Is not a significant supplier or customer of the Company or its subsidiaries, or an officer of or otherwise associated 
directly or indirectly with a significant supplier or customer. A significant supplier is defined as one whose revenues 
from the Company are a material part of the supplier’s total revenue. A significant customer is one whose amounts 
payable to the Company are a material part of the customer’s total operating costs;
–  Has  no  material  contractual  relationship  with  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries  other  than  as  a  director  of  the
Company;
–  Has not served on the board for a period which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with
–
the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and 
Is free from any interest and any business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, 
materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Company.
In accordance with the definition of independence above, and the materiality thresholds set, the following directors of 
Poseidon are considered to be independent:
Name 
Mr C Indermaur  
Mr G Brayshaw
Position 
Non-Executive Director 
Non-Executive Director
Mr  D  Singleton  and  Mr  R  Dennis  are  not  considered  independent  at  this  time  as  both  have  previously  undertaken 
executive roles. Mr Singleton was the Managing Director (“MD”) and CEO until 31 January 2016 and Mr Dennis was the 
Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) until December 2013. 
 
There  are  procedures  in  place,  agreed  by  the  board,  to  enable  the  directors  in  furtherance  of  their  duties  to  seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
  
The term in office held by each director is as follows:
Name 
Mr C Indermaur 
Mr G Brayshaw 
Mr D Singleton 
Mr R Dennis
Term 
8 years 
9 years 
9 years 
2.5 years
When a board vacancy exists, through whatever cause, or where it is considered that the board would benefit from the 
service of a new director with particular skills, the Remuneration, Nomination and Diversity Committee will recommend to 
the board a candidate or panel of candidates with the appropriate expertise. The board then appoints the most suitable 
candidate  who  must  stand  for  election  at  the  next  general  meeting  of  shareholders.  Written  agreements  with  each 
director that set out the terms of their appointment are put in place. 
 
The MD and CEO, Mr D Singleton, resigned on 31 January 2016 but has remained on the board as a non-executive 
director. The Company does not intend to recruit a replacement CEO through this prolonged period of low nickel prices 
where cash preservation is of paramount importance. The non-executive chairman, Mr C Indermaur, has taken on some 
of  the  duties  of  the  CEO  on  a  part  time  basis  with  the  support  of  the  COO  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (“CFO”).  The 
Company considers that Mr Indermaur has retained his independence during this period.

Principle 4: Safeguarding integrity of financial reporting 
The board has established an Audit and Risk Management Committee, which operates under a Charter approved by the 
board. It is the board’s responsibility to ensure that an effective internal control framework exists within the Company. 
This includes internal controls to deal with both the effectiveness and efficiency of significant business processes, the 
safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records, and the reliability of financial information as well 
as  non-financial  considerations  such  as  the  benchmarking  of  key  performance  indicators.  The  board  has  delegated 
responsibility for establishing and maintaining a framework of internal control and ethical standards to the Audit and Risk 
Management Committee. 
 
The  committee  also  provides  the  board  with  additional  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  information  for 
inclusion in the financial reports. The board has established an Audit and Risk Management Committee comprising of 
three non-executive directors. 
 
The members of the Audit and Risk Management Committee during the period and up to the date of this report were:
Name 
Mr G Brayshaw (Chairman) 
Mr C Indermaur 
Mr D Singleton 
Mr R Dennis
Status 
Member for the whole period 
Member for the whole period 
Member since 1 February 2016 
Member for the whole period
For qualifications of the Audit and Risk Management Committee members and details on the number of meetings of the 
committee held during the year and the attendees of those meetings, refer to section 3 of the Directors’ report. 
 
The  Company  policy  is  to  appoint  external  auditors  who  clearly  demonstrate  independence.  The  performance  of  the 
external auditor is reviewed annually by the committee. The auditors have a policy of rotating the partner at least every 
five years.  
 
The CEO and CFO also provide written assurance to the board on an annual basis that to the best of their knowledge 
and belief, the declaration provided by them in accordance with Section 295A of the Corporations Act is founded on a 
sound system of risk management and internal control and that the system is operating effectively in relation to financial 
reporting risks. 
 
The assurances from the CEO and CFO can only be reasonable rather than absolute due to factors such as the need for 
judgement and possible weaknesses in control procedures. Any material changes in the Company’s circumstances are 
released to the ASX and included on the Company’s website. 
 
 
Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure 
The Company has established policies and procedures, set out in its Disclosure Policy, relating to the timely disclosure of 
information  to  interested  parties.  The  policy  provides  effective  support  for  compliance  with  the  ASX  Listing  Rules 
regarding continuous disclosure which is overseen by the board.   
 
 
Principle 6: Respect the rights of shareholders 
The  board,  under  the  Company’s  Communications  Strategy  Policy,  is  responsible  for  ensuring  shareholder 
communications  are  adequate,  appropriate,  transparent  and  based  on  sound  corporate  governance  principles.  These 
principles form the basis of the policy which has the objective of providing shareholders with important information in a 
timely manner through written and electronic communication. 
 
The Company promotes direct communications with shareholders. The Annual General Meeting presents the opportunity 
for shareholders to attend and question directly the Directors and external auditors. In addition, shareholders may at any 
time direct questions or request information from the directors or management of the Company. 
 
The Annual Report is made easily available to shareholders and other stakeholders in a timely manner both in print and 
on-line.  The  Company’s  financial  reports  and  presentations  can  be  freely  downloaded  from  the  website  which  also 
includes information released to the ASX.

Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk 
The board recognises that the identification and management of risk, including calculated risk taking, is an essential part 
of creating long term shareholder value. Management reports directly to the board on the Company’s key risks and is 
responsible  through  the  CEO  for  designing,  maintaining,  implementing  and  reporting  on  the  adequacy  of  the  risk 
management and internal controls systems. 
 
The  Audit  and  Risk  Management  Committee  monitors  the  performance  of  the  risk  management  and  internal  control 
systems and reports to the board on the extent to which it believes the risks are being managed and the adequacy and 
comprehensiveness of risk reporting from management. 
 
The board must satisfy itself, on a regular basis, that risk management and internal control systems for the Company 
have been fully developed and implemented. 
 
In  conjunction  with  its  external  advisors,  the  Company  has  identified  specific  risk  management  areas  being  strategic, 
operational and compliance. During the 2016 financial year, the board continued to review the strategic and operational 
risks on a regular basis during the reporting period. 
 
A detailed risk identification matrix has been prepared and regularly updated by management. High and very high risk 
issues are reported to the board. An internal officer is responsible for ensuring the Company complies with its regulatory 
obligations. The executive committee also meets regularly to deal with specific areas of risk. 
 
 
Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly 
It  is  the  Company’s  objective  to  provide  maximum shareholder  benefit  from  the  retention  of  a  high  quality  board  and 
executive  team  by  remunerating  directors  and  key  executives  fairly  and  appropriately  with  reference  to  relevant 
employment  market  conditions.  To  assist  in  achieving  this  objective,  the  Remuneration,  Nomination  and  Diversity 
Committee links the nature and amount of executive directors’ and officers’ remuneration to the Company’s financial and 
operational performance. The expected outcomes of the remuneration structure are:
– 
– 
–
Retention and motivation of key executives; 
Attraction of high quality management to the Company; and 
Performance incentives that allow executives to share in the success of the Company.
For full discussion of the Company’s remuneration philosophy and framework and the remuneration received by directors 
and executives in the current period please refer to the Remuneration report, which is contained within section 7.1 of the 
Directors’ report in the 2016 Annual Financial Report. 
 
There is no scheme to provide retirement benefits to non-executive directors. 
 
The  board  is  responsible  for  determining  and  reviewing  remuneration  arrangements  for  the  directors  themselves,  the 
CEO  and  the  executive  team.  The  board  has  established  a  Remuneration,  Nomination  and  Diversity  Committee 
comprising four non-executive directors.   
 
The members of the Remuneration, Nomination and Diversity Committee during the period and up to the date of this 
report were:
Name 
Mr C Indermaur (Chairman) 
Mr G Brayshaw 
Mr D Singleton 
Mr R Dennis
