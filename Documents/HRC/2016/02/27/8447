</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The consultation on the role of regional and subregional mechanisms in international 
efforts to counter trafficking in persons, especially in women and children was held in 
Dakar on 4 and 5 October 2010 and focused on effective ways of tackling trafficking in 
persons at the regional and subregional level through collaborative, innovative and human 
rights-based approaches. 
</p>
<p>2. Convened at the initiative of the Special Rapporteur,1 the consultation provided the 
first opportunity for technical experts from nine regional mechanisms representing all five 
of the world&#8217;s continents to come together to share current trends, good practices, 
challenges and lessons learned with their counterparts from other regions as well as with 
the Special Rapporteur and United Nations observers.2 
</p>
<p>3. At the consultation a forward-looking approach was adopted, building on the 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2010 report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/14/32), on the theme of regional and subregional action to counter trafficking in 
persons. This facilitated not only sharing of practical experiences and lessons learned, but 
also discussions of possible ways forward in further strengthening the contribution of 
regional mechanisms to the global response to trafficking in persons in a way that that is 
both effective and serves to promote and protect the human rights of trafficked persons. In 
this regard, all participating experts expressed the wish and the will to continue to engage 
with each other, the United Nations system and other stakeholders, including civil society, 
to promote and protect the human rights of trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur has long maintained that, in order to effectively address the 
serious challenge to humanity posed by the phenomenon of trafficking in persons, better 
cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination is required. In this regard, she 
has notably stressed her conviction that regional and sub-regional mechanisms &#8220;play a key 
role in providing a response that is both multilateral and sufficiently close to countries&#8217; 
realities and the specificities within a certain region&#8221; (A/HRC/14/32, para. 2). In her above-
mentioned report to the Human Rights Council, she noted an extraordinary number of 
encouraging and innovative anti-trafficking initiatives taken by regional mechanisms, as 
well as a number of areas of concern requiring attention. 
</p>
<p>5. She has equally stressed the vital importance of adopting a victim-centred, human 
rights-based approach in any efforts aimed at tackling trafficking in persons, and has 
repeatedly highlighted the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights as providing a reference point in this regard for States and other actors.  
</p>
<p>6. It was against this backdrop that the Special Rapporteur convened the consultation, 
in recognition of the unique position of regional mechanisms at the interface of 
international action and local realities. Notably, this consultation brought together for the 
first time the nine regional mechanisms representing all five of the world&#8217;s continents to 
specifically discuss and share information on the implementation of their anti-trafficking 
</p>

</p>
<p>collaboration with its West Africa Regional Office.

<p>policy and practices. The annex to the present document contains the agenda of the 
consultation and all other background documents of this consultation are available from 
www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/trafficking/Dakar_consultation_oct2010.htm. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of discussions 
</b></p>
<p>7. The consultation was officially opened by the Minister of Human Rights of Senegal, 
Coumba Gaye, who highlighted some of the national efforts to curb the trafficking 
phenomenon in Senegal, including in cooperation with other countries in West Africa. 
</p>
<p>8. The agenda of the consultation was formulated to revolve around issues that are of 
vital importance from a human rights point of view and in which the regional mechanisms 
appeared to play a particularly pertinent role. 
</p>
<p>9. Discussions addressed: the normative and institutional frameworks adopted by 
regional and subregional systems to support anti-trafficking work; regional perspectives on 
the prevention of trafficking and the protection of trafficked persons; and innovative forms 
of cooperation and partnership between regional mechanisms and between these and other 
stakeholders, with a particular focus on how regional mechanisms might complement and 
add value to efforts being made at international, national and local levels. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Normative and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>10. After an introductory presentation3 by the Special Rapporteur framing the 
discussions within the perspective of a human rights-based approach to tackling trafficking 
in persons, the participants presented how their respective mechanisms had sought to 
integrate such an approach in their work, through normative instruments, institutional 
arrangements, work plans and programmes. 
</p>
<p>11. These presentations covered a number of structures and initiatives that had been 
recently launched in various regions.4 Regarding the African region, the ongoing process 
(African Union Commission Initiative against Trafficking, AU.COMMIT) of launching 
regional workshops on operationalizing the African Union Ouagadougou Action Plan to 
Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children and a 
corresponding monitoring and evaluation tool in each of the African subregions was 
explained. At the African subregional level, a number of policy initiatives to complement 
those at the African Union level were explained, including the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS) Plan of action against trafficking in persons (2008&#8211;2011), 
the recently adopted ECOWAS Policy on Protection and Assistance to Victims in 
Trafficking of Persons, the soon-to-be-launched ECOWAS standard operating procedures 
for the protection of trafficked persons and the joint plan of action between ECOWAS and 
the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding the European region, the mechanism recently established to evaluate the 
implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in 
Human Beings was described. Consisting of a technical pillar (Group of Experts on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings, GRETA) and a political pillar (through the 
Committee of the Parties), this mechanism provides for information-gathering visits by

</p>
<p>Regional Structures and Initiatives to Counter Trafficking in Persons&#8221; from

</b></p>
<p>GRETA to countries having ratified the Convention, although the group had yet to conduct 
its first country visit at the time of the consultation.5 Regarding the European Union 
subregion, a presentation was made on the main framework that is to govern the future anti-
trafficking work of the European Union. This framework, it was noted, would consist of 
legislation through the directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, 
and protecting victims,6 and a strategy on fighting trafficking in human beings. Once 
adopted, these instruments will replace those currently in force, namely the 2002 Council 
framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings and the 2005&#8211;2010 action 
plan on trafficking respectively. Plans to appoint a European Union anti-trafficking 
coordinator and to launch a website intended to serve as a one-stop shop for anti-trafficking 
practitioners were also presented.7 
</p>
<p>13. In the Middle East and North Africa region, the regional work plan the Arab 
initiative to combat trafficking in persons launched by the League of Arab States in March 
2010 was described, along with plans to establish a unit to monitor the phenomenon of 
trafficking in this region and to serve as a hub for the exchange of information and 
experiences. Regarding the Americas region, the 2010&#8211;2012 Work Plan against Trafficking 
in Persons in the Western Hemisphere adopted by the member States of the Organization of 
American States in June 2010 was described, along with trends and routes, 
accomplishments, and challenges faced by the countries of the Americas in preventing and 
combating trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>14. During the ensuing discussions, the participants identified early lessons that might 
be drawn from the establishment of regional monitoring mechanisms and their features.  
They also discussed the extent to which it might be possible to assess the impact of regional 
and subregional action plans, as well as any methods that had proven to be effective in 
conducting such assessments. 
</p>
<p>15. Representatives from the different regional mechanisms discussed the concept of a 
human rights-based approach in relation to trafficking in persons and how such an approach 
could be translated into practice. It was agreed that human rights &#8211; and their progressive 
realization &#8211; needed to be at the centre of efforts to tackle trafficking in persons if such 
efforts were to be effective in the long term. 
</p>
<p>16. The participants also noted that joint political commitment of the member States (as 
expressed e.g. through a non-binding memorandum of understanding) to cooperate and 
coordinate in good faith towards jointly agreed goals was important in translating regional 
plans into concrete actions.  
</p>
<p>  
 5 GRETA has since the consultation conducted its first three country visits, to Cyprus (in October 
</p>
<p>2010), Slovakia and Austria (both in November 2010). 
 6 An amended version of the draft directive was adopted through a vote of the European Parliament on 
</p>
<p>14 December 2010 resulting in 643 votes in favour, 10 against and 14 abstentions. The Directive will 
be legally binding for European Union member States, except the United Kingdom and Denmark in 
accordance with the Protocol (No. 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect 
of the area of freedom, security and justice and the Protocol (No. 22) on the position of Denmark 
annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 
(Lisbon Treaty). For the final text, see http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5849482.  
</p>
<p> 7 A European Union Anti-trafficking Coordinator has since been appointed, and the website launched.

</p>
<p><b> B. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>17. In the area of prevention, the participants agreed that continued efforts were needed 
to clarify definitions and terminology used in the area of trafficking, both among States and 
within society at large. Examples were mentioned of failures by State agents to react 
appropriately to trafficking cases owing to a lack of such understanding, and corresponding 
failures among members of civil society to exercise necessary vigilance owing to a lack of 
understanding or acknowledgement of the risks associated with trafficking. Societal 
attitudes, such as those adopted towards children, men, women or certain categories of 
workers, were raised as issues needing to be addressed in that regard. The participants also 
stressed the need to include the perspective of those closest to local realities, and notably 
that of trafficked persons themselves, in formulating effective and appropriate responses in 
the area of prevention and other areas. In that regard, the participants also identified the 
need to recognize the heterogeneity of trafficked persons, including in terms of their 
wishes, and resist one-size-fits-all solutions. 
</p>
<p>18. The participants were also encouraged to discuss whether and how regional 
mechanisms might contribute to promoting safer migration avenues as a trafficking-
prevention measure. In that regard, a presentation was made describing a project launched 
by the African Union Commission and the European Commission to facilitate dialogue on 
the Africa-European Union Partnership on Migration, Mobility and Employment, which 
aims at &#8220;comprehensive responses to migration and employment challenges with a focus on 
creating more and better jobs for Africa and facilitating mobility and free movement of 
people in Africa and the EU and better managing legal migration between the two 
continents.&#8221;8 The project, which is implemented by a consortium of three organizations9 
under the supervision and guidance of a steering committee led by the African Union 
Commission and the European Commission, foresees a number of concrete initiatives in 
both trafficking and migration-related areas. Planned initiatives described in relation to 
prevention of trafficking include: the establishment of an African Remittances Institute; the 
organization of regional and subregional multi-stakeholder forums on employment, social 
protection and labour migration; and the creation of an observatory on migration through a 
network of research centres and independent researchers to produce reliable and 
harmonized data on migration.  
</p>
<p>19. The participants highlighted a number of good practices in the field of prevention. 
These included conducting monitoring and evaluation research, using models and 
methodologies that have proven to be effective in other fields, such as sentinel surveillance 
techniques employed in public health programmes. The practice among several regional 
mechanisms of continually integrating research findings into prevention programmes with a 
view to formulating more appropriate, nuanced and targeted prevention messages was 
mentioned as another potentially effective strategy. 
</p>
<p>20. A number of important lessons learned emerged from the session. It was noted, for 
example, that before deciding how to tackle the varying manifestations of the problem of 
trafficking in persons in a particular context, it was necessary to form a clear picture of its 
nature, scope and causes, including &#8220;push&#8221; and &#8220;pull&#8221; factors. In that respect, experiences 
shared appeared to point to a continuing need for a more nuanced understanding of the 
problem and related trends, as exemplified by a study conducted in the Greater Mekong 
region indicating that, contrary to the assumptions of some prevention programmes,

</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>increased levels of income and education in some cases resulted in a higher rather than 
lower risk of being trafficked. Other lessons learned identified include the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) There is a continuing need to refine and better target the messages conveyed 
through prevention campaigns, including through the use of impact assessments and 
research focused on how different levels of society (family, peers, wider society) influence 
choices that eventually lead to the increased vulnerability of certain persons to being 
trafficked. Education at all levels, including factual information on the conditions facing 
migrant workers, should be explicitly recognized as a prevention measure; 
</p>
<p>(b) There is also a need to identify in each region the structure best placed to 
coordinate and/or conduct research needed to inform policies and interventions within the 
region, and follow up to ensure that findings are translated into action. In that regard, it was 
recognized that the most effective solution could vary between contexts (possibilities 
identified in that regard included: regional mechanism secretariats performing this function 
themselves; cooperation with civil society and academic institutions; and the setting up of 
regional observatories); 
</p>
<p>(c) Protocols allowing for freedom of movement within regions may contribute 
to preventing trafficking, provided that they are fully implemented and that there is 
recognition that such arrangements cannot in themselves prevent all forms of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Protection 
</b></p>
<p>21. In the area of protection, it was recognized that the role of regional mechanisms was 
relatively limited, consisting primarily of standard development, monitoring the 
implementation of member States&#8217; obligations under regional instruments and developing 
tools and analyses to support member States in that regard.  
</p>
<p>22. During the discussions at the session, the participants identified and evaluated 
measures that could be taken to promote and/or consolidate the elaboration and promotion 
of tools designed to increase the protection of trafficked persons and the relevance of such 
tools across regions and contexts.10 The role that regional mechanisms might play in 
strengthening practical cooperation for protection, notably with and among providers of 
support and services to trafficked persons was also discussed. The participants also 
addressed ways in which regional mechanisms could ensure that trafficked women are not 
stigmatized, through awareness-raising activities or measures to promote safe migration, 
and that the views of trafficked persons, including children, were taken into account in anti-
trafficking policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>23. A number of good practices were identified during the discussions. Among those, 
efforts to mainstream gender-sensitive and child-centred approaches at regional and 
national levels &#8211; in full recognition of equality before the law and the prohibition of 
discrimination &#8211; were underlined as crucial in anti-trafficking work. In addition, it was 
noted that the best interests of the child, as a well-established human rights principle, 
should be taken into account in any action concerning presumed trafficked children. The 
need to use the concept of a &#8220;presumed trafficked person&#8221; as a way to counteract the well-
documented difficulties involved in systematic identification of trafficked persons was also 
noted.

<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation and partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>24. In the area of cooperation and partnerships, the participants stressed that a 
prerequisite to effective and wider cooperation was effective coordination at the national 
and regional levels through structures such as focal points, rapporteurs or coordinators. It 
was further noted that, for such coordination functions to be exercised effectively at the 
regional level, regional mechanisms needed to be equipped with a certain level of authority 
vis-&#224;-vis States, such as a power to issue compulsory requests for information. One 
participant highlighted in that regard the difficulty of effectively monitoring the practices of 
and collecting accurate data from member States when they did not submit the required 
reports, or failed to use standardized formats to document their activities. 
</p>
<p>25. The participants highlighted the role of civil society and other actors, including 
parliamentary bodies, in providing input and following up on recommendations made to 
States by regional mechanisms. In that regard, it was noted that regional mechanisms 
needed to coordinate among themselves and with other actors, both to ensure the optimal 
use of limited resources and avoid overlapping and contradictory messages that could lead 
to &#8220;monitoring fatigue&#8221; or &#8220;standard-shopping&#8221; among States. To that end, the participants 
stressed the need for enhanced coordination and recognition of complementarities among 
all stakeholders and for networks through which the designated focal points of the different 
regional mechanisms could share information and experiences. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of good practices were identified in the area of cooperation and 
partnership. The need to involve all relevant sectors of government at the appropriate level 
and civil society, including community-based organizations and the private sector, in anti-
trafficking interventions was especially noted. Effective and meaningful participation of all 
categories of trafficked persons, a well-established human rights principle, was highlighted 
as crucial in determining both general policy and individual cases. Regular consultation 
with civil society organizations on policies and strategies alongside any involvement of 
such organizations in implementation was also recognized as generally valuable to regional 
mechanisms. Also noted was the need to strengthen practical cooperation with civil society 
organizations and United Nations agencies with respect to their complementary roles, such 
as promoting the possibility for NGOs to act directly on behalf of trafficked persons to 
obtain reparations. The discussions also pointed to the fact that regions could not solve the 
problem of trafficking by acting in isolation; hence coordination of efforts and sharing of 
methodologies among regions was seen as imperative. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>27.<b> Having taken stock of progress made in terms of strategies and initiatives to 
tackle trafficking in persons in the different regions, several participants noted the 
degree to which the issues faced were similar across regions and types of mechanisms, 
while both local conditions and the most effective response in a given context tended to 
vary significantly. In that context, it was highlighted that, in addition to promoting the 
international legal and political instruments, it was important to capture the 
specificities of the different regions in implementing measures to address trafficking 
in persons. This was borne out by several examples shared by the participants of 
innovative and context-appropriate solutions found at the local level and, in some 
cases, shared across the subregions and regions. 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>The participants agreed that standard-setting &#8211; notably through international 
and regional human rights instruments &#8211; had been a significant driver of progress 
made thus far. Furthermore at the technical level, the specificities and complexities 
faced in the different regions should be taken into account in implementing the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards. It was also noted, however, that in many cases resources and 
capacities were not currently sufficient to allow for comprehensive integration of a 
human rights-based approach into all levels of action. 
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>Furthermore, it was also noted that additional efforts might be required in 
some cases to obtain the buy-in necessary at both political and technical levels to 
implement regional and national action plans in a way that was both effective and 
respectful of human rights. Jointly owned monitoring and evaluation plans that 
included specific achievable goals and corresponding measurable indicators were seen 
as vital in this regard, not least to strike a balance between the need to maintain 
momentum and the aforementioned risk of contributing to &#8220;monitoring fatigue&#8221; 
among States. 
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>The participants agreed on the need for &#8211; and benefits of &#8211; enhanced 
coordination, cooperation and partnerships at all levels, and stressed the need to move 
to the next level through implementation and careful monitoring of agreed work plans 
and programmes. In that regard, the sharing of innovative solutions to the different 
challenges faced within the regions was particularly appreciated, as was the sharing of 
effective implementation models and methodologies for measuring impact. 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>The exchange of experiences also revealed that, despite the progress and lessons 
learned, the efforts to effectively combat trafficking in persons continued to be 
hampered to some extent by a number of challenges. Among the major challenges 
raised by the participants from different regions were the collection of reliable and 
uniform data from member States on actions taken (e.g. the number of trafficked 
persons identified or the number of residence permits issued to trafficked persons), 
and related challenges posed by a lack of uniformity in States&#8217; legal systems, 
legislation and definitions used. Other challenges included: a lack, in some instances, 
of adequately structured and resourced institutional frameworks; a lack, in many 
instances, of effective instruments for coordination and exchange; inadequate 
understanding of the specific challenges to be tackled and the persistence of a number 
of misconceptions and false assumptions; and an absence of sustainability caused, 
inter alia, by a lack of sustainable funding bases which hampered many programmes 
and projects, including ones having achieved demonstrated impact and results. 
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>Looking ahead, the participants acknowledged the added value of the mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur, particularly in terms of its function as a catalyst for 
regional mechanisms, and its potential to mobilize the political commitment and will 
that are essential preconditions to effective implementation of a human rights-based 
response. 
</b></p>
<p>33. <b>The participants discussed a number of recommendations and points for action 
as follows:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Interventions to address any of the dimensions involved in trafficking in 
persons must be based on solid data and methodologically sound research. In this 
regard there is a need to promote more effective methods of collecting, analysing and 
sharing data (both on the phenomenon of trafficking and on the efforts by States and 
other actors to tackle it), as well as jointly owned and appropriate monitoring and 
evaluation instruments to measure progress and take corrective action where needed. 
Further empirical research, notably impact assessments, is also needed to dispel myths 
and assumptions and inform strategies and interventions. In this regard, there is also a 
need to identify in each region the structure best placed to coordinate and/or conduct 
the research needed to inform policies and interventions within the region and follow 
up to ensure findings are translated into action; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Adequate allocation of human, financial and material/technical 
resources at all levels, including the grassroots level, and capacity-building, where 
needed, are prerequisites to building a more effective, human rights-based response to 
trafficking in persons within the regions. In this regard, there is a need to identify, 
explore and pool available resources to actualize effective service delivery; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Institutional structures that are adequate and appropriate to each 
context are needed to allow for effective coordination, both within and among 
mechanisms. In this regard, it may be seen as generally preferable to reinforce existing 
structures rather than recreate them, as such a proliferation might bring the risk of 
diluting both resources and impact; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) In terms of entrenching a human rights-based approach, it might be 
necessary in some cases to ground anti-trafficking efforts more firmly in a broad-
based political and institutional human rights platform; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) There is a need, within many regions, to further harmonize legislation 
and standards in key areas to facilitate cooperation in those areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Cooperation and coordination of actions to end human trafficking 
across, but particularly within, the regions is essential and requires deepened 
coordination between mechanisms, especially subregional ones belonging to the same 
region; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Cooperation and partnerships across regions can usefully be 
strengthened and need to be based on the principles of complementarity and equal 
partnership. In this regard, lessons learned and good practices (including models and 
instruments) can usefully be shared across, as well as within, regions, but such models 
and instruments often need to be adapted to local realities rather than directly 
transposed as blueprints; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Protection of trafficked persons should include efforts to foster and 
ensure cooperation with relevant authorities including asylum, migration and border 
authorities as well as with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, to ensure that trafficked persons are properly identified, and that those who 
are, or may be, in need of international protection are referred to the competent 
authorities and have access to adequate procedures for the examination of their claims 
in an &#8220;age and gender-sensitive manner&#8221;. Trafficked persons, or persons who are at 
risk of being trafficked, whose claims fall under the 1951 Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees should be recognized as refugees and afforded the corresponding 
international protection, including protection against refoulement to a place where 
they would be subjected to persecution. Those who do not qualify as refugees but who 
fear being subjected to other human rights violations or ill-treatment such as torture, 
or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return, should 
be afforded the corresponding protection in line with international human rights law 
and standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Continued efforts are needed to strengthen and refine the integration of 
perspectives that are sensitive to both gender and age considerations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) There is a need for sustainably funded compensation schemes for 
trafficked persons, coupled with effective arrangements for transnational granting of 
compensation to trafficked persons who have been repatriated or resettled; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) The participants unanimously agreed that information-sharing and 
exchanges of views among technical experts from regional mechanisms, such as those 
that took place during this consultation, were of great added value and held significant 
potential for enhanced cooperation and partnership, and the identification of ways </b></p>

<p><b>forward at different levels. The consultation was seen as a valuable exercise in terms of 
taking stock of trends and challenges and identifying the general direction forward. In 
that regard, the participants recommended that such consultations should continue in 
some form at regular intervals and focus on one specific issue at a time. In that 
respect, effective strategies for collection of quality data to inform public policy was 
identified by several participants as an area that was both vital and in which regional 
mechanisms working together were ideally placed to contribute to international 
efforts. Other possible topics suggested for in-depth discussions include: ways of 
clarifying, strengthening and harmonizing legal frameworks especially the key 
elements in the legal definition of the offence of trafficking in persons; a victim-
centred and human rights-based approach to criminal justice with a particular focus 
on protection of trafficked persons; effective forms of technical cooperation and 
partnerships; and trafficking-related trends and modus operandi between regions. It 
was also noted that such consultations, if continued, should be inclusive of other 
regional and subregional mechanisms and should take into account the differences in 
structures, membership and modalities between different mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Regardless of whether the format of the consultation might be replicated 
for future consultations among representatives of regional and subregional 
mechanisms, the participants recommended that exchanges of practical information, 
including activities under way, good practices and lessons learned, should take place 
through regular contact, for example, via email exchanges.
