                 INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report submitted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on human rights defenders, Hina Jilani </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report focuses on follow-up activities undertaken by the Special Representative and 
the role of stakeholders in implementing her recommendations and illustrates the Special 
Representative&#8217;s work in the three main areas of her activities, i.e. communications, country 
visits and thematic reports. 
</p>
<p> In the area of communications, the Special Representative shows that following up on 
cases includes not only following up on individual situations reported in communications, but 
also looking at cases as a whole to identify general trends. The quantitative and thematic analysis 
of communications enables it to identify challenges and achievements in the implementation of 
the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders (General Assembly resolution 53/144, annex) and 
to formulate targeted recommendations to address specific implementation gaps. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative proposes some methodological tools that can be used to 
facilitate follow-up activities, in particular to assess the situation of human rights defenders on 
the ground. For instance, she outlines a schematic list of indicators aimed at assessing the 
situation of human rights defenders on the ground and a matrix to undertake follow-up visits. 
</p>
<p> In her recommendations, the Special Representative emphasizes the role of stakeholders in 
following up on her activities. She recommends to States to respond in a timely, systematic and 
comprehensive manner to her communications. She also invites States to see the 
communications procedure as an opportunity not only to redress individual situations but also to 
correct structural gaps in the implementation of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, of 
which the individual cases are just a symptom. 
 The Special Representative recommends to develop and strengthen capacity-building 
activities on the Declaration and the mandate of the Special Representative as well as to 
strengthen the role of regional and international networks and organizations which often act as 
interfaces between the Special Representative and sources on the ground. These are two strategic 
measures that would increase the impact of her work. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative recommends that the situation of human rights defenders be 
one of the elements to review in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative believes that the intensification of collaboration and joint 
initiatives among existing international and regional mechanisms for the protection of human 
rights defenders reinforces the overall system for the protection of human rights defenders and 
its follow-up capacity. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD OF REVIEW 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 1/102 and 
resolution 5/1, in which the Council decided to extend exceptionally for two successive years the 
mandates and mandate-holders of all the special procedures of the Commission on Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Communications transmitted to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>2. Between 2 December 2006 and 10 December 2007, the Special Representative 
sent 372 communications, dealing with the cases of 835 defenders. Communications were sent 
to 76<b> </b>countries, and at the time of writing of the present report, 49 of them had provided her with 
responses to one or more communications. All communications sent and responses received 
during the period covered by this report are included in addendum 1 to the present report 
(A/HRC/7/27/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, the Special Representative visited Indonesia (5-12 June 2007), 
the Republic of Serbia, including Kosovo (17-21 September 2007), and The former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia (24-25 September 2007) as a follow-up to her first visit of January 2003. 
Separate reports on these visits have been submitted to the current session of the Council as 
addenda to the present document. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Cooperation with the United Nations system  
and intergovernmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Representative cooperated with bodies of the United Nations and 
intergovernmental organizations. She was invited to participate in conferences, workshops, 
seminars and round tables with these organizations on issues related to her mandate.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Representative was appointed as one of the seven members of the group 
of experts which was established pursuant to resolution 4/8 of the Human Rights Council 
on 30 March 2007 to &#8220;ensure the effective follow-up to and to foster the implementation of 
resolutions and recommendations on Darfur, as adopted by the Human Rights Council, the 
Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations human rights institutions, as well as to 
promote the implementation of relevant recommendations of other United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan in this regard, to safeguard the 
consistency of these recommendations and contributing to monitoring the human rights situation 
on the ground&#8221; (para. 7 of the resolution). The Group of Experts met in March, June, October 
and November 2007, and presented three reports to the Human Rights Council.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>6. In March 2007, the Special Representative presented her report to the fourth session of the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/37 and Add.1 and 2) 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  A/HRC/5/6, A/HRC/6/7 and A/HRC/6/19.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. Also in March, she held a meeting with the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights 
Defenders of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>8. From 18 to 22 June, the Special Representative attended the Annual Meeting of Special 
Procedures in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>9. In October, the Special Representative presented her report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second  session (A/62/225),  in which she reiterated that the right to peaceful protest is a 
fully fledged right, which entails the enjoyment of a set of rights internationally recognized and 
reiterated in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs 
of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (General Assembly resolution 53/144, annex). These rights include freedom of 
expression and opinion, freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly, and trade unions&#8217; 
rights, including the right to strike. The Special Representative particularly drew attention to 
article 12 of the Declaration that forms the basis for the protection of everyone against retaliation 
as a consequence of reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means or activities, any act of 
violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>10. In October, she had a meeting with the Great Lakes and Southern Africa Team within the 
Africa Unit of the Department of Political Affairs in New York to present her mandate and raise  
concerns with regard to the situation of human rights defenders in that region. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Cooperation with non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Representative continued her fruitful interaction with civil society at the 
national, regional and international levels. The Special Representative regrets that because of 
time constraints she was not able to participate in all conferences and seminars to which she was 
invited. On occasions where the Special Representative could not avail herself, she tried to have 
one staff member of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) working 
on the mandate participating in meetings and conferences, as at the 4th Dublin Platform for 
Human Rights Defenders and the 9th EU NGO Forum on Human Rights in Lisbon. 
</p>
<p>12. During the reporting period, the Special Representative participated in numerous events 
organized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Wilton Park Conference, 
the Carter Center Conference in Atlanta, the launch of the Manual on Women Human Rights 
Defenders in New York, the workshop of the Bar Human Rights Committee in London, the 
regional conference organized by the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development as well 
as the Conference on Women Human Rights Defenders organized by the Asia Pacific Forum on 
Women, Law and Development (APWLD) both held in Bangkok.  
</p>
<p><b>II. FROM ACTION TO IMPACT:  FOLLOW-UP TO THE 
ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>13. After more than seven years since the establishment of the mandate on human rights 
defenders and her appointment in August 2000, the Special Representative expects this to be her 
last report to the Human Rights Council. During her tenure, the Special Representative gave </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>shape to the mandate by adopting her own working methods consistently with the other special 
procedures, identified priorities and carried out her activities on that basis. She undertook 
13 country visits to 12 countries, sent 2,007 communications to 120 countries and 
presented 34 reports, of which 21 went to the Commission on Human Rights, 7 to the 
General Assembly and 6 to the Human Rights Council, including the present one. 
</p>
<p>14. The underlying purpose of all the reporting activities of the Special Representative has 
been to fulfil her overarching protection mandate in compliance with the Declaration. In 
assessing the impact of the work of the Special Representative, it is essential to assess both the 
effectiveness of the mandate as a protection mechanism and the responsiveness of stakeholders, 
Governments in particular, to her recommendations. This aspect of the work of special 
procedures is known as follow-up and is intended to include &#8220;the full range of measures taken to 
encourage, facilitate and monitor the implementation of recommendations by any of the Special 
Procedures&#8221;.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Representative considers that ending her tenure with a report focusing on 
follow-up activities is timely, to assess the achievements of the mandate but also to provide a 
basis for continuity. 
</p>
<p>16. The distinctive methodological feature of follow-up activities of this mandate compared to 
other special procedures is the use of the Declaration as a benchmark to measure progress in the 
situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>17. This report provides an overview of the follow-up activities undertaken by the Special 
Representative and the role of stakeholders in this process and in implementing her 
recommendations. It takes the major features of work of the mandate, i.e. communications, 
country visits and thematic reports, to illustrate how each component has been followed up on. 
The purpose is not to give an exhaustive account of all these activities carried out by the Special 
Representative but to provide illustrations that give shape to a methodology to follow-up that can 
be replicated and strengthened. 
</p>
<p>18. This report is based on the previous work of the Special Representative. Therefore, the 
sources used are almost exclusively the reports of the Special Representative. In particular, this 
report is to be read in conjunction with her report to the sixty-second session of the 
Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/95), which gave an overview of the steps taken in 
implementing the mandate, and her first report to the Commission (E/CN.4/2001/44), in which 
she focused on her mandate and methods of work.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Data on communications 
</b></p>
<p>19. Since the beginning of her tenure, the Special Representative sent 2,007 communications 
to 120 countries.<b>3</b> The number of communications steadily increased over the years and 
remained stable in the last two. So did the number of countries to which communications were 
sent.

</p>
<p>20. In 2004, OHCHR upgraded the database on communications. This allowed the 
collection of a wider range of data, which are presented in the next paragraphs. Data refer 
to the period 1 January 2004 to 10 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>21. The Asia and Pacific region accounts for the highest number of communications 
(31 per cent), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (27 per cent), North Africa and the 
Middle East (15 per cent), Africa (14 per cent), and Europe, North America and Central Asia (13 
per cent). 
</p>
<p>22. Communications sent concerned the situation of 3,376 defenders. Women defenders 
represented 22 per cent of cases addressed in communications, although this increased by eight 
points between 2005 (18 per cent) and 2006 (26 per cent). The regional breakdown indicates that 
communications concerned women defenders in higher proportions in Europe, North America 
and Central Asia, where 36 per cent of defenders whose situation was addressed in 
communications were women; followed by Latin America and the Caribbeans (25 per cent); 
Asia Pacific (21 per cent); North Africa and Middle East (15 per cent); and Africa (10 per cent).

</b>  Data refer from the beginning of the mandate until 10 December 2007 included. The number 
</p>
<p>of communications related to 2007 includes cases sent from 2 December 2006 to 
10 December 2007 for the first two graphs. In the following graphs, data are calculated using the 
calendar year from 1 January to 31 December with the exception of 2007 which includes data

<p>23. The average rate of Governments&#8217; replies to communications is 52 per cent, five points 
higher than the average rate of replies for communications sent by the whole system of special 
procedures (47 per cent). Older communications received a considerable higher rate of replies 
with 64 per cent of communications replied to for those sent in 2004 and only 34 per cent of 
replies received for communications of 2007.<b>4</b> While the Special Representative welcomes a rate 
of replies of some two thirds for older communications and understands that time appears to be 
an important factor to respond to communications, she nevertheless invites States to reply to 
them more consistently and in a timely manner. Replies received many months or a few years 
after the alleged facts took place lose much of their relevance and allow only for limited 
follow-up.

<p>24. The Special Representative also follows up on cases through the additional information 
that sources submit on the same case. Further information can report positive or negative 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  64 per cent of communications were replied to in 2004; 58 per cent in 2005; 52 per cent in 
</p>
<p>2006; and 34 in 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>developments. In the latter, the Special Representative sends follow-up communications. On 
average, the Special Representative receives further information from sources in 38 per cent of 
communications, with no significant change from one year to the other, with the exception 
of 2007, when understandably less follow-up information was received as the cases are recent. 
</p>
<p>25. Sources that submit the larger number of cases are also those submitting further 
information in higher percentages. This is probably due both to resources and to a better 
understanding of the mechanism. When further information was received from the source, the 
Special Representative sent a follow-up communication in about half of the cases. This means 
that sources submitting further information more often have more chances to have their case 
followed up on by another communication of the Special Representative.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>26. The regional breakdown indicates that sources submitted further information in higher 
proportions for cases in the North Africa and Middle East region (50 per cent), followed by 
Africa and Asia and the Pacific (42 per cent), Europe, North America and Central Asia (39 per 
cent) and Latin America (25 per cent). 
</p>
<p>27. Nineteen per cent of the communications sent by the Special Representative are follow-up 
communications.<b>6</b> There has been a considerable increase of follow-up cases between 2004 
(12 per cent) and 2006 (26 per cent), with 16 per cent in 2007. Regions with a higher percentage 
of further information submitted had more follow-up cases (26 per cent in North Africa and the 
Middle East and only 12 per cent in Latin America).

<p><b>2.  Thematic analysis of communications 
</b></p>
<p>28. Another way of following up on communications has been through the thematic analysis 
carried out by the Special Representative in several reports, which has allowed her to identify 
trends, prevalence of certain forms of violations, categories of defenders affected, and actors 
involved in the States&#8217; response, and to identify specific recommendations needed to address 
gaps in the implementation of the Declaration.

<p>29. In her reports to the Commission on Human Rights in 2004 and 2005 (E/CN.4/2004/94 and 
E/CN.4/2005/101), the Special Representative analysed communications sent in the reporting 
year and identified trends related to defenders targeted; vulnerability; types of violations; 
perpetrators; and outcome of cases and government responses. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. More recently, she undertook a thematic analysis of communications focusing on the right 
to assembly (A/61/312); defenders working on economic, social and cultural rights 
(A/HRC/4/37); defenders at particular risk (A/HRC/4/37); and the right to protest in the context 
of freedom of assembly (A/62/225). 
</p>
<p>31. In her report to the General Assembly in 2006 (A/61/312), which contains an analysis of 
communications on freedom of assembly, based on violations suffered by human rights 
defenders in their exercise of freedom of assembly, the Special Representative identified six 
categories of violations: arrests; violence against defenders during assemblies including 
defenders who have been killed; threats against defenders; travel restrictions for defenders 
wishing to participate in assemblies to promote and protect human rights; assemblies that are 
interrupted or that are not allowed to be held; and restrictions imposed on freedom of assembly 
through legislation. 
</p>
<p>32. The report presented in 2007 to the General Assembly (A/62/225) built on that analysis 
and focused on the right to protest in the context of freedom of assembly. In order to give 
prominence to the protest element of the analysis, the information was organized on the basis of: 
groups of protesters i.e. women defenders, student activists, trade unionists and defenders 
working on the rights of lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual persons (LGBT); and thematic 
areas of protest, i.e. the anti-globalization movement, demonstrations linked to elections, peace 
demonstrations and protests linked to land rights and environmental claims. 
</p>
<p>33. The analysis of communications related to violations committed against defenders working 
on economic, social and cultural rights identified issues on which defenders work and the 
specific violations they are exposed to because of their engagement in these areas. 
</p>
<p>34. Through her analysis of communications, the Special Representative has also been able to 
identify defenders who are at particular risk of becoming victims of human rights violations. 
Defenders at particular risk are those defending the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities; 
those defending the rights of LGBT persons; and women human rights defenders (A/HRC/4/37). 
</p>
<p>35. The high number of communications accumulated over the years made such a thematic 
analysis possible, and findings are credible as they are not based on anecdotal evidence but on a 
solid number of cases. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Building a constructive dialogue between Governments,  
the Special Representative and sources 
</b></p>
<p>36. The main purpose of communications is to provide some degree of protection to defenders 
whose rights are violated or at risk of being violated. The effectiveness of this protection 
depends on how constructive the dialogue between Governments, the Special Representative and 
sources is. 
</p>
<p>37. A constructive dialogue also facilitates follow-up to communications in a process whereby 
sources submit reliable information to the Special Representative, who transmits cases pertaining 
to her mandate to Governments, which provide replies to the communications received. This 
process, which visually represents a line with the sources and Governments at the extreme and 
the Special Representative acting as intermediary between the two, can turn into a cycle by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>which further information provided by the sources and the observations of the Special 
Representative can lead to follow-up communications and follow-up replies from Governments 
until a case can be considered closed. 
</p>
<p>38. While this is the ideal process that communications should follow until cases are solved, it 
happens more on an ad hoc basis than systematically. All actors in the process, Governments, 
sources and the Special Representative herself, need to strengthen their respective capacity to 
make full use of the potential of the communications procedure. The following sections will 
address achievements and gaps of each actor in this area. 
</p>
<p>39. Other stakeholders can play a positive role in this respect. These are national institutions, 
the United Nations system and in particular United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs), regional 
organizations and the diplomatic community. They can act as mobilizing agents and as a bridge 
between Governments and defenders as well as between the Special Representative and 
defenders, particularly those at the local level. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Governments&#8217; responsiveness and fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>40. The first request to Governments in a communication of the Special Representative is 
always to verify the veracity and accuracy of the allegations reported. The role of Governments 
is then to report on the measures adopted to investigate the violations, prosecute perpetrators, 
compensate victims, protect defenders at risk, and prevent future human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>41. The degree of Governments&#8217; responsiveness to these questions in the communications 
procedure determines the need for follow-up. When Governments report concrete and targeted 
measures taken to fight impunity of violations against defenders, communications can be 
considered closed. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Representative regrets that this is not the case in most of her communications. 
A quantitative analysis of replies, with the achievements and weaknesses in this area, has been 
made above; the present section considers the quality of such replies. 
</p>
<p>43. When replies fail to address the specific queries of the mandate in relation to the treatment 
of human rights defenders, the dialogue that the communications procedure aims at building is of 
poor quality. 
</p>
<p>44. Although specific questions are asked in allegation letters or urgent appeals sent to 
Governments, the replies received seem to suffer from a lack of relevant information and 
structure. Often the questions that were asked are left unanswered, while other information that 
may not have been solicited is given instead. 
</p>
<p>45. In other cases, replies insist on the supposed illegal acts committed by the defenders 
involved, without any explanation of the action or omission of the Government which is the 
central concern of the communication. Governments have rarely acknowledged the human rights 
activities of defenders and their responses usually fail to address or meaningfully comment on 
the possible link between a human rights activity and reported violations. Replies that repeatedly 
and exclusively focus on the presumed illegality of the activities of defenders indicate alarming 
patterns of criminalization of defenders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. If replies were constructed in a methodological and informative manner, this would greatly 
enhance the mandate&#8217;s capacity to analyse them and arrive at conclusive results. Comprehensive 
replies would enable the Special Representative and Governments to fully grasp the situation of 
human rights defenders and the progress and setbacks in the implementation of the Declaration. 
This would enhance the efficiency as well as the mutual benefits of the communication between 
Governments and the Special Representative, reducing the need for the mandate to request 
further information, as replies can act as benchmarks against which subsequent developments in 
the situation of human rights defenders can be monitored and measured. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  An expanded network of sources on the ground in a position to follow cases</b> 
</p>
<p>47. A large network of sources, including and especially those on the ground, is essential to 
follow up on cases addressed in communications. The Special Representative is not in a position 
herself to gather information on the ground for the hundreds of cases she handles every year. As 
explained in the section below, she can do so in a limited number of cases, usually through and 
during her country visits. 
</p>
<p>48. In order to ensure that an increasing number of sources can inform the mandate of 
follow-up to communications, potential sources must be adequately informed and trained on how 
to use the mandate as well as on the importance of submitting such information. Outreach 
initiatives and training activities are instrumental to reach more defenders on the ground and to 
build their capacity to use the mandate. 
</p>
<p>49. At the grass-root level, the question of language is often a barrier that prevents local and 
national organizations from accessing the mandate directly. At the same time, defenders and 
organizations that address the mandate for the first time and are not familiar with its procedures 
need much more feedback and guidance from OHCHR staff. This is where regional and 
international organizations and networks that act as hubs for defenders on the ground play an 
important role as interfaces between the Special Representative and sources at the grass-root 
level. Reinforcing the capacity of these organizations is therefore strategic to do more 
follow up-work. 
</p>
<p><b>6. Ad hoc meetings, country visits and press releases as a means to  
follow up on communications  
</b></p>
<p>50. During her tenure, the Special Representative has on several occasions held ad hoc 
meetings to follow up on cases brought to her attention through the communications mechanism 
and during country visits. She discussed cases with some Permanent Missions to the 
United Nations in Geneva to learn about developments on defenders whose situation she had 
addressed in communications. 
</p>
<p>51. Country visits have also been an opportunity to directly follow up on cases on the ground 
with national authorities and civil society. During her visits, the Special Representative 
consistently raised cases previously addressed to the country in communications that she 
considered as still pending. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Representative has also issued press releases to follow up on communications 
sent to Governments, or on previous press releases, as an additional means of action when she 
feels that her concerns are to be raised publicly. In 2007, she issued press releases following up 
on situations addressed in communications with regard to the ongoing campaign against human 
rights defenders in Myanmar,<b>7</b> the suspension and the subsequent reinstatement of the Chief 
Justice in Pakistan,<b>8</b> and the constitutional reform in Venezuela<b>9</b>. In 2006, she condemned the 
lack of respect for human rights shown in the eviction of Bassac residents in Phnom Penh.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>53. Country visits and reports thereon are among the most powerful means that special 
procedures have to make a difference at the national level. The major force of country visits lies 
in the momentum they create. Seizing this momentum to turn the potential for change generated 
by a country visit into decisions, actions and results is a primary responsibility of the 
stakeholders to whom the recommendations contained in the report on the visit are addressed, 
most commonly Governments, human rights defenders, national institutions and the international 
community. 
</p>
<p>54. While responsibility for the actual implementation of recommendations lies with the 
stakeholders, mainly Governments, follow-up activities of the Special Representative are 
important to both document the impact of the visit as well as to maintain continued dialogue and 
engagement with the country, which can give additional impetus to national efforts to improve 
the situation of human rights defenders.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>55. Country visits open opportunities to establish direct contacts with institutions and 
organizations, which allows the Special Representative to make more targeted interventions after 
the visit. Similarly, county visits allow defenders to learn about the mandate and how to access 
it. The Special Representative consistently remarked significant improvements in the flow of 
information to and from a country after a mission. This in itself is a positive outcome of a visit 
and constitutes a channel to monitor the situation of human rights defenders and the level of 
implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Like other mandate-holders, the Special Representative used questionnaires to request 
information on achievements and challenges in the implementation of her country-based 
recommendations. She did so for her report to the Commission on Human Rights at its 
sixty-second session (E/CN.4/2006/95/Add.5), which focused on developments in the 
implementation of the Declaration. All the 11 countries visited by the Special Representative<b>11</b> 
are among the 118 countries that are profiled in that report. Country reports were used as major 
references to assess progress and identify challenges and concerns. It is interesting to note that in 
all the countries which she had visited, at least one stakeholder responded to the questionnaire 
and for six of them, responses were received by the Government, civil society organizations 
and/or the UNCT. Even more remarkable was the rate of Government replies to the 
questionnaire: 64 per cent from countries that had received a visit of the Special Representative, 
while the average for the 118 countries reviewed in the report was 30 per cent. This clearly 
indicates a higher level of responsiveness of stakeholders in countries visited by the Special 
Representative, particularly among Governments. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Representative carried out two follow-up missions, the first one being to 
Colombia in 2004, three years after her country visit. Although carried out in agreement with the 
Government, the follow-up mission to Colombia was not a fully-fledged country visit and 
did not have a dedicated report. Nevertheless, the two-day mission allowed gathering new 
first-hand information which was reported as an update in the 2005 communications report 
(E/CN.4/2005/101/Add.1, paras. 203-216). In November 2007, the Special Representative was 
informed that the report on her country visit in 2002 (E/CN.4/2002/106/Add.2) was being used 
as evidence in a case currently pending before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. This 
is a good example of how other stakeholders, in this case a regional human rights mechanism, 
can use country visit reports. 
</p>
<p>58. The second follow-up mission was an official country visit undertaken to The former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in September 2007, four years after the country visit. The 
report on the visit undertaken in 2004 (E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.2) was used as the basis to assess 
progress and gaps in the subsequent four years. To facilitate the assessment, a matrix was 
prepared containing a list of over 60 issues, findings and recommendations detailed in a 
schematic manner. For each item, information on developments that had occurred between 2003 
and 2007 was sought before and during the mission. This allowed immediately identifying areas 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  As specified above, the overall number of countries visited by the Special Representative 
</p>
<p>is 13. They were 11 in 2006, when the report referred to was issued. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in which progress had been more prominent, and others which stagnated more. On this basis, 
new recommendations were made, which are contained in her report on this mission 
(A/HRC/7/23/Add.4). 
</p><p>59. The example given below illustrates the methodology used. While this methodology 
provides a sound basis to assess the situation of human rights defenders in light of a first report, 
it is nevertheless important to make follow-up visits flexible enough to allow capturing new 
developments or concerns that go beyond the coverage of the first report but which should be 
considered in order to make a fair and accurate assessment of the situation of human rights 
defenders.

<p>The Special 
Representative 
welcomes the 
recently 
established

has however 
reported that the

defenders and 
groups belonging 
to minorities. This 
is because 
information on the 
mechanism has 
not been made 
available in 
minority

Special

ensuring that 
information on the 
mechanism is

and disseminated 
in minority 
languages. 
</p>
<p> <i>Note</i>:  The present example has been made to illustrate the methodology used and does not 
refer to any country. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Overview of thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Representative fulfilled her reporting requirements to the Human Rights 
Council and the General Assembly by studying and analysing thematic areas relevant to 
defenders and the implementation of the Declaration. Along the years, she addressed new topics 
and built on previous reports to deepen knowledge and understanding of the obligations related 
to the implementation of the Declaration and to give visibility to the challenges faced by 
defenders. 
</p>
<p>61. In this section of the report, the Special Representative gives an overview of the thematic 
areas she addressed and how she followed up on them from one report to the other to build a 
coherent framework and discourse on human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>62. In her report to the Commission on Human Rights in 2002 (E/CN.4/2002/106), the Special 
Representative studied the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks on human rights defenders. 
She pointed to the danger that the terrorist attacks of 11 September and the global war on 
terrorism may be used by some Governments as a pretext to breach human rights and to restrict 
and attack human rights defenders. She continued to analyse this issue in her report to the 
General Assembly in 2007 on the right to protest in the context of the freedom of assembly, in 
which she focused on anti-terrorism measures and how they restrict the right to protest and 
freedom of assembly, particularly affecting peace demonstrations after 11 September (A/62/225, 
para. 83). She also developed her analysis in this area by addressing the impact of security 
legislation on defenders and the role and situation of defenders in emergencies (A/58/380). In her 
report to the General Assembly in 2005 (A/60/339), the Special Representative focused on the 
essential role of human rights defenders in the preservation, restoration and building of peace 
and security. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Representative studied the enjoyment of freedoms which are especially 
instrumental for the work of defenders and in her reports, focused on freedom of association and 
the impact of restrictions on the work of defenders (A/59/401), and on freedom of assembly, first 
by analysing violations suffered by defenders in the exercise of this right (A/61/312) and then by 
addressing the right to protest in the context of freedom of assembly (A/62/225). 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Representative consistently addressed the specific situation of women 
defenders. She did so in her report to the Commission on Human Rights in 2002 
(E/CN.4/2002/106, paras. 80-94) and in other reports, reiterating consistently that women 
defenders face specific risks and therefore need additional protection measures to work in 
a secure environment (E/CN.4/2006/95, para. 10, A/61/312, paras. 72-73, A/HRC/4/37, 
paras. 98-104, A/62/225, paras. 59-66). 
</p>
<p>65. In addition to her attention to the gender dimension in the work of defenders, the Special 
Representative also addressed the situation of defenders who enjoy less protection, are more at 
risk of violations, or both. In that context, she analysed the situation of defenders working on 
economic, social and cultural rights, those defending the rights of indigenous peoples and 
minorities and those defending the rights of LGBT persons (A/HRC/4/37). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>66. The importance of regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders was 
also addressed in some of her reports (A/57/102, and E/CN.4/2006/95, paras. 60-66). 
</p>
<p>67. This short review shows the areas developed by the Special Representative as it relates to 
current human rights challenges that affect the work of defenders, such as security legislation 
and counter-terrorism measures; gaps in defenders&#8217; enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set 
forth in the Declaration, such as freedom of association, freedom of assembly and the right to 
protest; the situation of defenders enjoying less protection or more exposed to human rights 
violations; and the human rights mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders as 
they develop at the regional level. 
</p>
<p>68. While the Special Representative hopes that this is an important basis for a better 
understanding of the Declaration as well as a set of recommendations to facilitate its 
implementation, there is no doubt that this work needs to be continued and expanded in order to 
advance the human rights discourse on defenders and to further empower them by equipping 
them with more knowledge on the Declaration and the implications and ramifications of its 
implementation and of the lack of implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Report on country profiles 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Representative&#8217;s report to the Commission on Human Rights in 2006 
contained a compilation of the developments in the situation of human rights defenders and the 
implementation of the Declaration in 118 countries since 2000. The countries included in the 
report were for the most part countries to which the Special Representative had addressed 
communications on individual cases over the past six years, as well as countries for which, 
despite not having been the object of communications, consistent and reliable information had 
been received in response to the questionnaire she had sent in preparation of the report. This 
comprehensive report offered a general picture of the situation of human rights defenders 
worldwide. It identified areas of progress in the implementation of the Declaration and 
remaining challenges faced by defenders. It was largely hailed by human rights defenders as a 
very useful tool for advancing their cause in their respective countries. 
</p>
<p>70. That report was supposed to be the final one of the Special Representative, as she had by 
then served two terms on the mandate. However, because of the developments within the Human 
Rights Council, the Special Representative&#8217;s tenure was extended for two more years. 
</p>
<p>71. That report can serve two purposes as regards follow-up. On the one hand, it represented a 
thorough exercise of follow-up and stocktaking of the activities of the Special Representative at 
the country level. Each country profile contained in the report reviewed the communications sent 
and the findings and recommendations of country visits when applicable. On the other hand, the 
wealth of information contained in that report and its pragmatic approach make it a benchmark 
against which progress on the implementation of the Declaration could be measured. Regular 
updating of that report would make it a lively tool with the potential to reflect processes in 
addition to contents. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Engaging stakeholders in thematic areas 
</b></p>
<p>72. The recommendations of thematic reports are mainly addressed to Governments, some to 
human rights defenders, others to national institutions, the international community, including 
regional organizations, and in some cases to the media. Each of these stakeholders should devise 
strategies aimed at implementing recommendations addressed to them and using reports as 
advocacy tools to give more strength and legitimacy to their claims, positions and concerns. 
</p>
<p>73. While this remains mainly within the responsibility of stakeholders, the role of the Special 
Representative is to encourage to the extent possible this kind of dynamics. Some ideas in that 
respect could be: using questionnaires to be sent to stakeholders for the preparation of thematic 
reports. This would make stakeholders participate more directly in the preparation of reports, 
hence more inclined to take ownership of the conclusions and recommendations reached; to hold 
consultations to gather through a participatory process suggestions on topics to be addressed; to 
organize expert seminars in preparation of thematic reports; to disseminate reports among 
stakeholders and encourage further dissemination and translation in languages other than the 
official United Nations languages; to undertake surveys among stakeholders to find out how 
reports are being used and what could be done to increase their impact. 
</p>
<p>74. All of these activities and others could enhance the impact of thematic reports. 
Nevertheless, they are all time-consuming and resource-intensive. A realistic assessment has to 
be made to identify what can be undertaken and what not. The ideas above are to be seen as a 
series of possible options identified by the Special Representative on the basis of her experience 
in the attempt to give shape to a comprehensive methodology to follow up on the work of the 
mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Indicators on human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>75. Over the years, the Special Representative has been assessing the situation of human rights 
defenders worldwide on the basis of the rights and duties established in the Declaration. Through 
thematic studies, country visits, communications and their analysis, the Special Representative 
has given content to what compliance with the Declaration means. 
</p>
<p>76. The analytical framework and the parameters developed by the Special Representative to 
gauge the situation of human rights defenders can be distilled into a set of indicators that 
facilitate assessing compliance with the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>77. While the identification of indicators on human rights defenders deserves a thorough 
analysis and a larger discussion that go well beyond these few paragraphs, the Special 
Representative wishes to outline schematically a set of indicators that can be used to assess the 
situation of human rights defenders. She does this with the double purpose of providing a 
schematic framework for analysis distilled from the monitoring and protection work realized by 
the mandate, and encouraging her successor as well as other actors working on the assessment of 
the situation of defenders to further develop and use indicators to measure progress or setbacks 
in the implementation of the Declaration. Indicators are tools to follow up on the work of the 
mandate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Representative identifies the following indicators: 
</p>
<p><i>Legislation 
</i></p>
<p>&#8722; Compliance of legislation relevant to the activities of defenders with the Declaration. 
Several laws can be relevant for the activities of human rights defenders, from laws on 
NGOs, to those on access to information, freedom of peaceful assembly, witness 
protection, right to strike, etc. 
</p>
<p><i>An enabling environment for human rights defenders 
</i></p>
<p>&#8722; Enjoyment of rights and freedoms instrumental to the activities of defenders and 
recognized by the Declaration, e.g. freedom of expression, association, peaceful 
assembly, access to information, including access to detention places and police 
stations, access to remedies. Each of these rights has a full set of indicators to measure 
their level of implementation, which are not developed in this report; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Existence and effectiveness of independent national human rights institutions; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Systematic collaboration with public authorities; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Systematic participation and consultation in decision-making processes, including in 
law and policymaking; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Policies on human rights defenders (e.g. strategy on the implementation of the 
Declaration, national plan on human rights including human rights defenders, policies 
on the collaboration with civil society); 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Human rights education policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Open support to defenders from public authorities and the political establishment. 
</p>

<p>&#8226; Responsiveness to communications (timelines, comprehensiveness in replying to all

<p>&#8226; Responding positively to requests of invitations to carry out country visits; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reporting on measures taken to implement recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Engaging stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>79. In addition to the follow-up initiatives carried out directly by the Special Representative to 
monitor the effectiveness of her work, the impact of the activities of the mandate is maximized 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  Sets of indicators can be used to measure the levels of collaboration of Governments with 
</p>
<p>other human rights mechanisms. In this report, the Special Representative only details indicators 
related to the collaboration with her mandate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>when stakeholders engage in the implementation of the recommendations of the Special 
Representative and make the promotion and respect of the Declaration their own goal. 
</p>
<p>80. This section of the report complements previous reports of the Special Representative and 
in particular her report to the Commission on Human Rights in 2006. The Special Representative 
reiterates the considerations made therein as regards the role of the different stakeholders, 
namely the United Nations, including OHCHR, civil society organizations, national institutions 
and treaty bodies (E/CN.4/2006/95, paras. 67-82). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Capacity-building and outreach 
</b></p>
<p>81. The first step to get stakeholders engaged is to make them aware of the mandate and to 
build their capacity to use it. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Representative, like other special procedures, does not have the resources to 
carry out awareness campaigns and capacity-building programmes. She nevertheless undertook 
activities aimed at increasing awareness and access to the mandate. The numerous conferences, 
seminars and platforms she attended across the world gave a remarkable visibility to the 
mandate, established strategic collaborations and engaged defenders&#8217; organizations, regional 
mechanisms, academic institutions, Governments, national institutions, international 
organizations and others with the mandate. 
</p>
<p>83. The OHCHR staff supporting the mandate act as resource persons in training sessions and 
workshops to build the capacity of defenders to access and use the mandate. These training 
programmes are a good opportunity to sensitize participants on the importance to follow up on 
the work of the Special Representative and their role in this process. Most of these activities are 
organized by OHCHR and NGOs dealing with human rights. Some, like the International 
Service for Human Rights, integrated training on the mandate of the Special Representative as a 
standard component of their training programmes. 
</p>
<p>84. The OHCHR factsheet on human rights defenders is a good tool to disseminate knowledge 
on the Declaration and the mandate of the Special Representative. More efforts should be made 
to have it translated into languages other than the official United Nations languages. 
</p>
<p>85. It would be important to develop a training manual on the Declaration and the mandate of 
the Special Representative, maybe in the framework of a broader training package on special 
procedures. Such a tool would make training on the mandate and special procedures an activity 
that could be implemented by many organizations working on human rights capacity-building 
programmes. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) can be an important opportunity to monitor the 
situation of human rights defenders in countries reviewed by the Human Rights Council. 
Through the UPR, all Member States will be reviewed on the basis of universal and equal 
parameters and standards. These standards include, among others, the Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>87. The review of countries is based on three reports. One is prepared by the Government 
while the other two are produced by OHCHR, one of which is a compilation of United Nations 
information while the other is a summary of contributions by various stakeholders, including 
civil society organizations and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Representative invites Governments to include in their pledges made at the 
time of their election to the Human Rights Council commitments on the implementation of the 
Declaration. Information on the fulfilment of these commitments should then be included in their 
reports through the UPR. The Special Representative equally encourages other stakeholders, 
including defenders, to submit contributions on the situation of human rights defenders that will 
be included in the stakeholders&#8217; report prepared by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Complementarities with international and regional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>89. International and regional human rights mechanisms play an important role in 
strengthening the impact of the work of the Special Representative. 
</p>
<p>90. Special procedures mandate-holders follow up on each other&#8217;s work and build on 
their respective findings and recommendations. Joint activities take place at all levels, from 
day-to-day communications to press releases, joint country visits and reports. The advice and 
recommendations of independent experts on countries that would benefit from official visits 
of mandate-holders prompted the realization of some missions, including those undertaken by 
the Special Representative. To quote but one example, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, in his report on his mission to Brazil, included among his 
recommendations a country visit by the Special Representative.<b>13</b> One year later, the Special 
Representative visited Brazil. Similarly, the suggestions of the Special Representative prompted 
requests of invitations by other mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>91. At the regional level, several mechanisms and instruments have been established and 
adopted to increase the protection of human rights defenders - the Special Rapporteur on Human 
Rights Defenders of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights; the Unit for 
Human Rights Defenders within the secretariat of the Inter-American Commission for Human 
Rights; the enhanced mandate of the Commissioner for Human Rights and the forthcoming 
declaration on human rights defenders of the Council of Europe; the Unit on Freedom of 
Association within the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE/ODIHR); and the 2004 European Union 
Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  &#8220;In view of the threats and acts of violence against judges, lawyers and defence attorneys, 
</p>
<p>especially those working on cases involving social issues (such as land, indigenous or 
environmental issues), the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders should visit the country&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/60/Add.3, para. 106). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>92. The establishment of regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders has 
been one of the major developments to advance the situation of human rights defenders in the 
last few years. Further efforts are needed to turn developments into achievements. 
</p>
<p>93. Regional mechanisms and structures are in their first years of existence. In establishing 
their own methods of work and practices, it is crucial to share experiences, compare mandates, 
and identify common objectives. This will facilitate the design of strategies aimed at 
strengthening complementarities, synergies and cross-fertilization of the mechanisms. The 
Special Representative hopes that initiatives in that direction will continue in the coming months 
and years. 
</p>
<p>94. In the area of follow-up, the potential of regional mechanisms to follow up on 
recommendations and communications of the Special Representative is of paramount 
importance. To quote but one example, one of the four areas of action established by the EU 
Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders is support to United Nations special procedures, 
including the Special Representative. Strengthening the implementation of the EU Guidelines by 
raising awareness about them and by disseminating good practices on how to use them has a 
strategic value. In this respect, the Special Representative welcomes the recent publication of the 
Front Line booklet on good practices in the implementation of EU Guidelines.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>95. Regular exchanges and common planning among existing mechanisms will enable the 
identification and implementation of common priorities that would strengthen the overall system 
for the protection of human rights defenders and might prepare the ground for the establishment 
of new mechanisms in other regions. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Following up on the work of the Special Representative is both a methodology as well 
as an end in itself. It is a methodology to monitor and assess the impact of the work of the 
Special Representative and to provide her with elements to identify gaps, trends, 
achievements and concerns in the implementation of the mandate and of the Declaration. 
Follow-up as an end in itself relates to the actual implementation of the recommendations 
of the Special Representative, including the collaboration with the mandate. As a 
methodology, it is part of the working methods of the Special Representative while 
follow-up intended as implementation of recommendations is within the responsibility of 
stakeholders, Governments, human rights defenders, international and regional 
organizations, international and regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights 
institutions and the media. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The two understandings of follow-up overlap and depend one on the other. Reviews 
and analysis of the work of the Special Representative facilitate implementation by further 
refining and targeting recommendations and advance the discourse on human rights 
</b></p>

<p><b>defenders. Implementation is strengthened when it is acknowledged by review exercises 
that recognize experiences and initiatives to follow up on the work of the Special 
Representative as good practices. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In reviewing work on follow-up undertaken by the Special Representative, this report 
outlines elements of a methodology, which shows how quantitative and qualitative analysis 
can combine to provide a comprehensive picture of the work of the Special Representative 
based on data and their analysis and not on perceptions; proposes a matrix to undertake 
follow-up country visits; outlines a schematic list of indicators to assess the situation of 
human rights defenders; and underlines the role of stakeholders in following up on each 
component of the work of the Special Representative, be it communications, country visits 
or thematic reports. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>A follow-up methodology is of use not only to the mandate-holder but also to all those 
committed to the implementation of the Declaration. The Special Representative 
encourages stakeholders, in their different roles and capacities, to use and further develop 
this methodology to facilitate the implementation of the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>In this respect, the Special Representative recalls the contribution and collaboration 
expected from stakeholders to follow up on the activities of the mandate and implement its 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments should respond to all the communications sent by the Special 
Representative. Replies should be timely and comprehensive in responding to the 
questions asked by the Special Representative. In addition to these minimum 
requirements, a good practice for replies is to provide information not only on the 
measures taken to redress the individual situation reported but also on the initiatives 
undertaken to prevent similar situations from happening again. In some cases, by 
reporting individual situations, communications point in fact to structural and 
systematic problems of which individual situations are a consequence. Governments 
should see the communications procedure as an opportunity to be alerted to 
situations that, if addressed properly and thoroughly, can improve not only the 
situation of individual defenders but the overall environment of human rights 
defenders, which is a fundamental indicator of the general situation of human rights 
in a country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human rights defenders, and organizations and institutions that act as sources of 
communications, should provide follow-up information on cases submitted to the 
Special Representative in a more systematic manner. They should also look at replies 
sent by Governments and provide feedback on that basis. Sources on the ground are 
in a better position to assess the information provided in Governments&#8217; replies. In 
order to improve the exchange of information between sources on the ground and the 
Special Representative, the role of international networks and organizations that act 
as interfaces between the mandate and sources on the ground is to be strengthened. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Country visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Special Representative recommends to all stakeholders to regularly report on 
challenges and achievements in the implementation of the recommendations 
contained in reports on country visits. The Special Representative can submit this 
information in a separate report on follow-up to country visits, as the Special 
Rapporteur on torture does on a yearly basis, in the communications report, or in 
updates of the report on country profiles submitted in 2006. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Special Representative opened some lines of research, such as the enjoyment of 
defenders of the rights set forth in the Declaration or the situation of defenders at 
particular risk or less recognized. The Special Representative recommends this 
analytical work be continued and expanded to enrich knowledge and understanding 
of the Declaration and the challenges and achievements related to its implementation. 
The high number of communications sent by the mandate provides now, and every 
year more so, a solid caseload that can serve as a basis for a wide range of thematic 
analysis and monitoring. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Special Representative recommends a more active engagement of stakeholders in 
the preparation of and the follow-up to her thematic reports, and refers to the 
practical suggestions and recommendations in this area put forward in paragraphs 72 
to 74 above. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Capacity-building activities on the Declaration and the mandate of the Special 
Representative should be developed and strengthened, those implemented by NGOs as well 
as by the United Nations system, in particular OHCHR, and other international and 
regional organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Special Representative recommends that the situation of human rights defenders 
be one of the elements to review in the UPR process of the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Representative encourages the intensification of collaboration and joint 
initiatives among existing international and regional mechanisms for the protection of 
human rights defenders, with a view to strengthen the overall system for the protection of 
defenders by building on complementarities. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Finally, the Special Representative wants to pay tribute to human rights defenders, 
for whose recognition and protection she has been working all these years, and encourages 
them to continue their struggle for the promotion and protection of human rights 
worldwide.</b>
