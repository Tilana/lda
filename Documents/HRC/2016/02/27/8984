<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The conceptual and policy framework proposed in 2008 by the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises, and unanimously endorsed by the Human Rights Council, rests on 
three pillars: the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including 
business through appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; the corporate responsibility 
to respect human rights meaning essentially not to infringe on the rights of others; and greater 
access by victims to effective remedy, judicial and non-judicial.  
 The State duty to protect is grounded in international human rights law, which provides 
that States are obliged to take appropriate steps both to prevent corporate-related abuse of the 
rights of individuals within their territory and/or jurisdiction and to investigate, punish and 
redress such abuse when it does occur - in other words, to provide access to remedy. Several of 
the core international and regional human rights treaties explicitly provide for these elements of 
remedy; and where they do not, there has been some useful commentary from the relevant 
human rights commissions, courts and United Nations treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p> Building on research previously conducted by the Special Representative, this report 
examines the scope of State obligations to provide access to remedy for third party abuse, 
including by business, under the following international human rights treaties: the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<b>1</b> It also discusses the scope of States&#8217; 
obligations under the main regional human rights treaties: the American Convention on 
Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p> The remedial principles governing international human rights law have been strongly 
influenced by the law of State responsibility and, as a general rule, follow its emphasis on 
compensatory justice - that is, putting the victim back in (or as close to) the position they would 
have been in but for the violation.  
</p>
<p> With respect to the United Nations treaty bodies, some common strands can be identified 
in their approach to State obligations to provide access to remedy for human rights abuses, 
whether committed by public or private actors. They have emphasized the importance of:  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  This reports draws significantly on the Special Representative&#8217;s earlier series of papers on the 
</p>
<p>State duty to protect under the core United Nations human rights treaties, summarized in 
A/HRC/8/5/Add.1. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting prompt, thorough and fair investigations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing access to prompt, effective and independent remedial mechanisms, 
established through judicial, administrative, legislative and other appropriate means 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Imposing appropriate sanctions, including criminalizing conduct and pursuing 
prosecutions where abuses amount to international crimes; and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing a range of forms of appropriate reparation, such as compensation, restitution, 
rehabilitation, and changes in relevant laws 
</p>
<p> Several have also stressed the need for special attention to be paid to &#8220;at-risk&#8221; or 
vulnerable groups - potentially including women, children, indigenous peoples and other 
minorities - to ensure that they have access to effective remedies that are appropriately tailored to 
their needs. This is complemented in the case of indigenous peoples by other international 
instruments dealing specifically with their rights.  
</p>
<p> Although some of the newer international human rights treaties expressly contemplate 
States taking steps to eliminate abuse by business enterprises, and even establishing liability for 
legal persons,<b>2</b>  there remains a lack of clarity as to the steps they should take to hold companies 
accountable. Particular areas that would benefit from greater clarity include whether States 
should impose liability on companies themselves, in addition to natural persons acting on the 
entity&#8217;s behalf; when States are expected to provide individuals with civil causes of action 
against companies (i.e. separate from criminal sanctions and going beyond administrative 
complaints mechanisms); and whether and to what extent States should hold companies liable for 
alleged abuses occurring overseas.  
</p>
<p> While the extraterritorial dimension of the State duty to protect under international human 
rights law remains unsettled, current guidance suggests that States are not required to regulate or 
adjudicate the extraterritorial activities of businesses incorporated in their jurisdiction, but nor 
are they generally prohibited from doing so, as long as there is a recognized jurisdictional basis 
and an overall reasonableness test is met. Within those parameters, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD) have encouraged States to take steps to prevent abuse abroad by 
corporations within their jurisdiction and to hold them accountable.<b>3</b>

</p>
<p> The regional human rights commissions and courts have elaborated upon key aspects of 
the State obligation to provide access to remedy for human rights abuses, including the meaning 
of a &#8220;fair hearing&#8221; and when practical matters, like inadequate legal aid or representation, may 
constitute unacceptable barriers to remedy. With respect to corporate-related abuse, a study on 
the Inter-American system conducted for the Special Representative shows consideration of the 
impact of business operations in situations involving violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, 
threats to an individual&#8217;s physical integrity (including from environmental harm), and in contexts 
implicating economic and social rights and the rights of the child.<b>4</b> Further research is being 
conducted into the treatment of corporate-related abuse by the European and African systems.  
</p>
<p> While the State duty to protect, including the obligation to provide access to remedy, 
extends to all recognized rights that private parties are capable of impairing and to all business 
enterprises, some types of companies, rights, and victims have been referred to more frequently. 
For example, the United Nations treaty bodies have emphasized that States should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protect employees&#8217; rights in both public and private settings and establish effective 
complaints mechanisms for employment-related grievances 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Minimize the potential for extractive companies to impair the ability of communities 
affected by their activities, especially indigenous peoples, to access remedial 
mechanisms 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In situations where &#8220;State functions&#8221; have been privatized, ensure that effective systems 
are in place to remedy any abuse by the relevant private companies involved 
</p>
<p> This State obligation to provide access to remedy is distinct from the individual right to 
remedy recognized in a number of the international and regional treaties. While the State 
obligation applies to abuse of all applicable rights by third parties, including business, it is 
unclear how far the individual right to remedy extends to abuses by non-State actors. However, 
an individual right to remedy has been affirmed for the category of acts covered by the 
United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law, &#8220;irrespective of who may ultimately be the bearer of 
responsibility for the violation&#8221;.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p> The United Nations Basic Principles were intended as a restatement of existing State 
obligations. They indicate the international community&#8217;s enhanced concern with access to 
remedy in cases involving gross violations, and may reflect increased expectations that 
individuals should be able to resort to national courts to vindicate their treaty rights in such 
</p>

</p>
<p>situations. The Principles also identify three core aspects of the individual right to remedy in 
relation to gross violations: the right to equal and effective access to justice; to adequate, 
effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered; and to access to relevant information 
concerning violations and reparation mechanisms.<b>6</b> They suggest that States may be required to 
do more, and be afforded less discretion, where there is such an individual right. Their adoption 
invites a renewed focus on existing State obligations to provide access to remedy for gross 
violations committed by private actors, and on the legal and practical implications of the 
individual right to remedy in cases involving corporations.  
</p>
<p> The Special Representative will continue to follow developments in these areas and to 
consult with relevant stakeholders in exploring the implications for operationalizing the three 
complementary pillars of the &#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; framework.

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The conceptual and policy framework proposed by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises in his report (A/HRC/8/5), and unanimously endorsed by the Human Rights Council, 
comprises three core principles: the State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third 
parties, including business through appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; the 
corporate responsibility to respect human rights, meaning essentially not to infringe on the rights 
of others; and greater access by victims to effective remedy, both judicial and non-judicial. 
Access to remedy is central to both the State duty to protect and the corporate responsibility to 
respect. This overview report addresses its relationship with the former.  
</p>
<p>2. The State duty to protect is grounded in international human rights law. Guidance from 
international human rights bodies suggests that the duty applies to all recognized rights that 
private parties are capable of impairing and to all types of business enterprises.<b>7</b> As part of the 
duty, States are obliged to take appropriate steps both to prevent corporate-related abuse of the 
rights of individuals within their territory and/or jurisdiction and to investigate, punish and 
redress such abuse when it does occur - in other words, to provide access to remedy. Several of 
the core international and regional human rights treaties explicitly provide for these elements of 
remedy; and where they do not, there has been some useful commentary from the relevant 
human rights commission, courts and United Nations treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>3. This report summarizes the most relevant provisions, commentary and decisions dealing 
with State obligations to provide access to remedy under the international and regional human 
rights systems. It builds upon, and will be further complemented by, detailed research 
undertaken in support of the Special Representative&#8217;s work exploring the treatment of the State 
duty to protect in relation to corporate-related abuse by the United Nations treaty bodies and by 
the regional systems.  
</p>
<p>4. The State obligation to provide access to remedy is distinct from the individual right to 
remedy recognized in a number of the international and regional treaties. As noted above, while 
the State obligation applies to abuse of all applicable rights by third parties, including business, it 
is unclear how far the individual right to remedy extends to abuses by non-State actors. 
However, an individual right to remedy has been affirmed for the category of acts covered by the 
United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law, &#8220;irrespective of who may ultimately be the bearer of 
responsibility for the violation&#8221;. Accordingly, this report also considers the provisions of the 
United Nations Basic Principles and their possible implications in this area.  
</p>
<p>5. The report begins by briefly outlining the relevance of general remedial principles in the 
law of State responsibility to State obligations to provide access to remedy in the human rights 
field (section I). It then considers relevant provisions of the main international human rights 
                                                 
</p>

</p>
<p>treaties, and their interpretation by the respective United Nations treaty bodies (section II). The 
discussion focuses on States&#8217; obligations to take appropriate steps to investigate, punish and 
redress third party abuse and draws on the series of papers prepared for the Special 
Representative on the work of the treaty bodies to highlight any business-specific references in 
the treaties and in the comments made by the relevant treaty bodies. This section also briefly 
considers other international instruments pertaining to indigenous peoples. The report then 
discusses the main regional human rights treaties in a similar manner, bearing in mind that 
further research is being undertaken for the Special Representative on the European and African 
systems (section III).<b>8</b> It concludes with a discussion of the individual right to remedy under the 
United Nations Basic Principles (section IV).  
</p>
<p><b>II. GENERAL REMEDIAL PRINCIPLES IN THE 
LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY 
</b></p>
<p>6. The classic formulation of the State obligation to provide remedy under international law is 
found in the 1928 decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the <i>Chorz&#243;w 
Factory</i> case, in the context of a claim between States: &#8220;it is a principle of international law, and 
even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to 
make reparation&#8221;.<b>9</b> The Court continued:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The essential principle ... is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the 
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all 
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this 
is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind 
would bear ...&#8221;<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The International Law Commission&#8217;s draft articles on State responsibility for 
internationally wrongful acts,<b>11</b> which are highly influential but not legally binding, provide that 
States which are in violation of their international obligations are required not only to cease the 
offending conduct but also to &#8220;make full reparation&#8221; for &#8220;any damage, whether material or 
moral&#8221;; this may entail individual forms of reparation (such as compensation, restitution, 
satisfaction) or a combination of forms.<b>12</b> The commentary on the draft articles explains that they 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Detailed research has already been conducted on the Inter-American system. See Cecilia 
</p>
<p>Anicama, &#8220;State Responsibilities to Regulate and Adjudicate Corporate Activities under the 
Inter-American Human Rights System&#8221;, paper prepared for the Special Representative, 
April 2008, available at http://www.reports-and-materials.org/State-Responsibilities-under-Inter-
American-System-Apr-2008.pdf.

</p>
<p>codify the <i>Chorz&#243;w Factory</i> rule.<b>13</b> These principles have been reiterated by the International 
Court of Justice (ICJ) in a number of cases, and the <i>Chorz&#243;w Factory</i> decision has been 
described as &#8220;the cornerstone of international claims for reparations, whether presented by states 
or other litigants&#8221;.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The draft articles, like the <i>Chorz&#243;w Factory</i> case before them, adopt a compensatory 
approach, and avoid sanctions or penalties like punitive damages; the purpose of a remedy is to 
place an aggrieved party in the same position they would have been in had the wrongful act not 
occurred. This remedial approach in the area of State responsibility has heavily influenced 
conceptions of remedy in international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>9. However, particularly in situations involving international crimes, international human 
rights law imposes clear obligations on States to prosecute and punish those who commit abuses. 
In other cases as well, as discussed below, the international and regional human rights 
institutions have stressed the importance of sanctions, including criminalizing violations of 
certain rights, and of adequate investigations. This report now considers the international human 
rights treaties and the State obligations arising under them directly. 
</p>
<p><b>III. STATE OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO REMEDY UNDER 
THE CORE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES 
</b></p>
<p>10. This section considers the following international human rights treaties and relevant 
commentaries by the respective bodies charged with monitoring their implementation: the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC), the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW), and the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).<b>15</b>

Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories, the ICJ held that all natural and legal persons affected by the relevant breaches of 
international human rights and humanitarian law were entitled to reparation: Advisory Opinion 
of 9 July 2004, paras. 152-153. 
<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  This section draws primarily on the Special Representative&#8217;s 2007 series of papers on the 
United Nations human rights treaties and commentaries by the treaty bodies, but also includes 
relevant developments since those papers were published. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>11. In each case, provisions and commentary that deal with States&#8217; obligations to provide 
access to remedy in general are considered, with business-specific references noted at the end of 
each discussion.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>12. Article 2 (3) of the ICCPR provides that States parties are required to ensure that &#8220;any 
person&#8221; whose Convention rights or freedoms are violated &#8220;shall have an effective remedy&#8221;.<b>16</b> 
The French and Spanish versions of article 2 (3) would not automatically entail the substantive 
(as opposed to procedural) aspects of remedy, but in general comment No. 31 (2004) the 
Human Rights Committee interpreted an &#8220;effective remedy&#8221; as requiring reparation where 
appropriate.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>13. A person seeking such a remedy is entitled to have their claim &#8220;determined by competent 
judicial, administrative or legislative authorities or by any other competent authority provided for 
by the legal system of the State&#8221;,<b>18</b> and to have a decision in their favour enforced. As the 
Special Representative&#8217;s work on the ICCPR shows, &#8220;general comment No. 31 highlights that 
the HRC views access to such competent authorities as pivotal to States Parties&#8217; obligations 
under the Covenant. It says that it &#8216;attaches importance to States Parties establishing appropriate 
judicial and administrative mechanisms for addressing claims of rights violations under domestic 
law&#8217;. The HRC&#8217;s commentaries consistently encourage States to make greater efforts to provide 
forums for claims regarding public and private human rights abuses.&#8221;<b> 19</b> 
</p>
<p>14. States are also specifically required to &#8220;develop the possibilities of judicial remedy&#8221; under 
article (3) (b). The Human Rights Committee has encouraged this by outlining &#8220;the different 
ways in which the judiciary may effectively assure rights, including through &#8216;direct applicability 
of the Covenant, application of comparable constitutional or other provisions of law, or the

<p>interpretive effect of the Covenant in the application of national law.&#8217; Further, in Concluding 
Observations, the HRC has expressed regret at situations where the Covenant &#8216;has not yet been 
invoked in the courts or before the administrative authorities (article 2 of the Covenant).&#8217;&#8221;<b> 20</b> 
</p>
<p>15. As Nowak comments, whether a remedy is effective &#8220;may ultimately be determined only 
on the basis of concrete cases, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, the respective 
national legal system and the special features of the substantive right concerned&#8221;.<b>21</b> However, the 
Human Rights Committee has offered some guidance.  
</p>
<p>16. The Committee has emphasized the centrality of prompt, thorough and effective 
investigations into allegations of abuse (particularly where they involve threats against the 
security of the person) by independent and impartial bodies. Indeed, it has said that the failure to 
establish appropriate procedures to carry out such investigations may constitute a separate breach 
of the Covenant.<b>22</b> Where an investigation reveals that an abuse has occurred, the Committee has 
recommended that a State should ensure that those responsible are brought to justice; again, 
failure to do so may constitute a breach of the Covenant in its own right, particularly where those 
violations are recognized as criminal under international law, such as torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>17. While generally giving States latitude in determining what constitutes an effective remedy, 
the Committee has said that in cases of &#8220;particularly serious&#8221; human rights abuses, notably in 
cases involving violations of the right to life, &#8220;purely disciplinary and administrative remedies 
cannot be deemed to constitute adequate and effective remedies within the meaning of 
Article 2 (3)&#8221;.<b>24</b> Barriers to the establishment of legal responsibility in such serious cases - 
including doctrines like immunity of a State&#8217;s officials, the defence of superior orders, and 
unreasonably short statutory limitation periods - should be &#8220;removed&#8221; and States parties should 
assist each other in bringing such perpetrators to justice.  
18. In its general comment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee has stressed that the 
right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established 
by law in article 14 (1) of the ICCPR is broad in its scope, applying not only to criminal trials but 
also to the determination of rights and obligations in a &#8220;suit of law&#8221; - meaning judicial or 
administrative proceedings &#8220;aimed at determining rights and obligations&#8221; and including, for

<p>example, civil claims in the areas of contract, tort and property law, and decisions or proceedings 
involving public officials that affect their private entitlements, such as social security 
assessments or decisions about pension benefits (para. 16). Whenever such rights and obligations 
are being determined, this must be done &#8220;at least at one stage of the proceedings&#8221; by a competent 
tribunal: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The failure of a State party to establish a competent tribunal to determine such 
rights and obligations or to allow access to such a tribunal in specific cases would amount 
to a violation of article 14 if such limitations are not based on domestic legislation, are not 
necessary to pursue legitimate aims such as the proper administration of justice, or are 
based on exceptions from jurisdiction deriving from international law such, for example, as 
immunities, or if the access left to an individual would be limited to an extent that would 
undermine the very essence of the right.&#8221;(para. 18). 
</p>
<p>19. The Human Rights Committee suggests that a legal cause of action must actually exist for 
the right to a fair hearing to apply. In other words, while article 14 (1) protects against obstacles 
to access in relation to existing civil causes of action, it does not appear to support the creation of 
a new cause of action where none currently exists. 
</p>
<p>20. General comment No. 32 also notes some key features of a fair hearing, which include the 
avoidance of undue delay, the transparency of the proceedings (which should in principle be 
conducted orally and publicly), and the right to review by a higher tribunal (in the case of 
criminal proceedings). 
</p>
<p>21. The Human Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;where appropriate, reparation can involve 
restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction, such as public apologies, public 
memorials, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and practices, as well as 
bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations&#8221;.<b>25</b> While there is no duty to 
provide it, the Committee considers that &#8220;the Covenant generally entails appropriate 
compensation&#8221;. It has often recommended changes in States parties&#8217; laws or practices beyond the 
specific remedy for the victim in the case at hand, in order to prevent recurrences. The 
Human Rights Committee has also emphasized that effective remedies must be &#8220;appropriately 
adapted so as to take account of the special vulnerability of certain categories of persons, 
including in particular children&#8221;.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Business-specific references 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Human Rights Committee has made clear its view that States parties are required 
under the Covenant to legislate against abuse of the rights of individuals within their territory 
and/or jurisdiction by private actors, to impose adequate sanctions, and to ensure the existence of

<p>appropriate complaints mechanisms, and it has specifically discussed employers in this regard.<b>27</b> 
With respect to particular sectors, the Committee has expressed concern about adverse effects on 
indigenous peoples and minorities caused by extractive and land development activities, and has 
recommended that States parties take steps to regulate and adjudicate activities capable of 
jeopardizing rights in such situations, including activities affecting access to justice.<b>28</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>23. The ICESCR does not contain a specific provision dealing with the State obligation to 
provide access to remedy for abuses of Covenant rights. However, the general requirement in 
article 2 (1) providing for the progressive realization of all rights contained in the Covenant &#8220;by 
all appropriate means&#8221; has been interpreted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (CESCR) as implying such an obligation. 
</p>
<p>24. Although the Committee has discussed and indicated support for a wide range of remedies, 
it has put particular emphasis on judicial remedies: &#8220;the Committee considers that, in many 
cases, the other &#8216;means&#8217; used could be rendered ineffective if they are not reinforced or 
complemented by judicial remedies&#8221;.<b>29 </b>Administrative remedies may thus be &#8220;adequate&#8221;, 
provided there is an opportunity for judicial review.<b>30 </b>Whatever remedy is provided, the 
Committee has stressed that it should be provided in an accessible, affordable, timely, and 
effective manner.  
</p>
<p>25. With respect to some rights, particularly non-discrimination, the Committee has stated that 
protection through judicial means is &#8220;indispensable&#8221;, whether the abuse is committed by public 
or private actors.<b>31</b> The Committee has been at pains to stress that &#8220;there is no Covenant right 
which could not, in the great majority of systems, be considered to possess at least some 
significant justiciable dimensions ... The adoption of a rigid classification of [economic, social 
and cultural] rights which puts them, by definition, beyond the reach of the courts would thus be 
arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and 
interdependent&#8221;.<b>32</b> It seems reasonable to conclude that this concern has influenced some of its 
strong pronouncements in support of judicial remedies.

</p>
<p>26. In relation to State obligations to provide access to remedy where there has been a 
violation of article 2 (2) - which provides for the non-discriminatory exercise of Covenant 
rights - the Committee has stated in a draft general comment that:<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;National policies and strategies should provide for the establishment of effective 
mechanisms and institutions where they do not exist, including administrative authorities, 
ombudsmen, national human rights institutions, courts and tribunals. These institutions 
should investigate and address alleged violations relating to article 2 (2), <i>including actions 
by private actors</i>. They should be empowered to provide effective remedies, such as 
compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition, 
declarations, public apologies, educational programmes and prevention programmes. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;... States parties are obliged to monitor effectively the implementation of laws and 
policies to comply with article 2 (2). This includes establishing the necessary monitoring 
institutions<i> and encouraging other actors such as civil society and the private sector </i>to 
carry out such a function.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Business-specific references 
</b></p>
<p>27. Given the number of economic and social rights that relate to the employment setting, it is 
perhaps not surprising that the Committee has emphasized State obligations to regulate 
employers with respect to issues including forced and child labour, discrimination-related abuse, 
safe working conditions, and the right to form and join trade unions.<b>34</b> The Committee &#8220;clearly 
considers that States parties have a duty to protect employees from abuse of Covenant rights by 
State and non-State employers, including business enterprises. It highlights that States must play 
a central role in regulating and adjudicating employers&#8217; behaviour, including through enacting 
and/or enforcing legislation (in some cases criminal) to ensure protection.&#8221;<b>35</b>  
</p>
<p>28. CESCR has specifically mentioned the importance of States regulating the activities of 
private providers of social security and other core State functions.<b>36</b> It has also discussed the 
importance of remedial measures in the context of extractive and other major infrastructure 
projects and their impact on indigenous peoples, and has emphasized the importance of 
providing adequate compensation as well as alternative land to displaced groups.

<p>29. On the issue of compensation, it is not entirely clear whether the Committee expects States 
to ensure that this is paid directly by the private actor(s) involved.<b>37 </b>While general comment 
No. 17 (2005) seems to indicate this in the context of infringements of intellectual property 
rights, in concluding observations dealing with individual States parties, the Committee has 
indicated that it expects States to ensure compensation is provided, but they then seem to have 
discretion as to whether to require third parties to contribute directly. 
</p>
<p>30. Notably, CESCR has commented on the importance of States seeking to prevent negative 
impacts by &#8220;their own citizens and companies&#8221; operating overseas, and to &#8220;take steps to 
influence other third parties&#8221; to respect rights &#8220;through legal or political means&#8221;, in accordance 
with international law.<b>38</b> Further, in general comment No. 19 on the right to adequate social 
security, CESCR recommended that &#8220;States parties should extraterritorially protect the right to 
social security by preventing their own citizens and national entities from violating this right in 
other countries. Where States parties can take steps to influence third parties (non-State actors) 
within their jurisdiction to respect the right, through legal or political means, such steps should 
be taken in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and applicable international law&#8221; 
(para. 54).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>C. International Convention on the Elimination of All  
Forms of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>31. Like the ICCPR, ICERD sets out State obligations to provide access to remedy for 
violations of Convention rights and freedoms. Article 6 ensures both the procedural and 
substantive aspects of remedy in providing that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;States parties shall assure to everyone within their jurisdiction effective protection and 
remedies, through the competent national tribunals and other State institutions, against any 
acts of racial discrimination which violate his human rights and fundamental freedoms 
contrary to this Convention, as well as the right to seek from such tribunals just and 
adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage suffered as a result of such 
discrimination.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>32. Article 6 contemplates both injunctive relief to prevent abuse (in the reference to 
&#8220;protection&#8221;) as well as adequate reparation where abuse actually occurs. In discussing the 
regulatory measures States should take, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD) has recommended various steps involving the inclusion of certain 
provisions in national criminal law as well as the amendment of various procedural standards, 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>like the burden of proof, in racial discrimination-related cases.<b>39</b> The Committee has stated that 
the obligation that such provisions be &#8220;&#8216;<i>effectively implemented</i> by the competent national 
tribunals and other State institutions&#8217; is implicit in article 4 of the Convention, under which State 
parties &#8216;undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures&#8217;&#8221;.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>33. To comply with article 6, investigations should be thorough, proper, impartial and 
effective.<b>41</b> This applies to all relevant institutions (including the police, public prosecutors and 
the courts). Both civil and criminal proceedings may be relevant but the Committee has made 
clear its view that the Convention does not require a system of &#8220;sequential remedies&#8221;, which 
must be followed in all cases. Rather, it has recommended that remedies must be provided within 
a reasonable time.<b>42 
</b></p>
<p>34. Articles 1 (4) and 2 (2) require States to take special measures to ensure the full and equal 
enjoyment of human rights for particular groups, and CERD has been especially concerned about 
remedies for &#8220;at-risk&#8221; or vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples, migrant workers and 
minorities such as Roma. In relation to indigenous peoples, CERD has made clear its view that 
when they are deprived of their lands without their free, prior and informed consent, States are 
required to provide effective remedies, including the return of such lands. In particular, it has 
recommended that States ensure that indigenous peoples have equal access to justice by 
&#8220;establishing adequate procedures, and defining clear and just criteria to resolve land claims by 
indigenous communities. They should do so within the domestic judicial system, while taking 
due account of relevant indigenous customary laws, and providing interpreters and bilingual 
counsel for court proceedings&#8221;.<b>43</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Business-specific references

(including indirect harm) caused to indigenous peoples by extractive and forestry companies.<b>44</b>

<p>individual States parties has encouraged them to take appropriate legislative or administrative 
measures to prevent &#8220;adverse impacts&#8221; on the rights of indigenous peoples in other countries 
from the activities of corporations registered in that State, and has recommended that States 
parties explore ways to hold such transnational corporations &#8220;accountable&#8221;.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  
of Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>36. CEDAW does not contain a general provision equivalent to those in the ICCPR and 
ICERD requiring States to provide &#8220;effective remedy&#8221; for individuals whose rights are violated. 
However, article 2 (a) of the Convention obliges States &#8220;to ensure, through law and other 
appropriate means, the practical realization&#8221; of the principle of non-discrimination between men 
and women, article 2 (c) requires States &#8220;to ensure through competent national tribunals and 
other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination&#8221;, 
and article 2 (b) deals with sanctions against perpetrators. The Convention also specifically 
refers to business in article 2 (e), under which States parties commit &#8220;to take all appropriate 
measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>37. As the Special Representative&#8217;s work on the Convention has shown: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the Convention clearly contemplates adjudication of public and private actors to eliminate 
discrimination and the Committee has spoken of the importance of effective complaints 
procedures, as well as judicial action in some situations, to protect rights.  
&#8220;The Committee discusses the use of &#8216;legal measures&#8217; to provide &#8216;effective protection&#8217;, 
including complaints mechanisms, penal sanctions, civil remedies and compensatory 
provisions. It expects States parties to take steps not only to prevent abuse by third parties 
but also to punish and redress abuse. &#8216;Protective measures&#8217; for victims (including 
rehabilitation and support services) are also considered important.&#8221;<b> 46 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Committee has stressed the importance of access by women to effective complaints 
mechanisms and reparation, including compensation where appropriate, in relation to workplace

<p>discrimination, sexual harassment, and especially in situations of public or private violence. It 
has also stressed the importance of legal aid in ensuring such access is meaningful. The 
Committee&#8217;s recommendations apply to all women but they indicate that special attention may 
need to be given to certain groups, including girls and indigenous women. 
</p>
<p><b>Business-specific references 
</b></p>
<p>39. Beyond article 2 (e) noted above, other Convention provisions do not explicitly mention 
business but address contexts that are very likely to involve business, including employment, and 
the provision of health care and financial services. The Committee regularly refers to the need 
for States parties to combat abuse in the labour market and to regulate a wide range of 
employers, including small businesses as well as major publicly listed companies, using an array 
of different regulatory tools. It has also made particular mention of certain industries including 
health, tourism, apparel, agriculture and the financial services sector.  
</p>
<p>40. The Committee has stressed the particular vulnerabilities of female migrant workers, 
including with respect to abuse by non-State actors, and recently observed that &#8220;States parties 
should take active measures to prevent, prosecute and punish all migration-related human rights 
violations that occur under their jurisdiction, whether perpetrated by public authorities or private 
actors.&#8221;<b> 47</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or  
Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</b></p>
<p>41. Taken together, articles 2 (1) and 16 (1) of the Convention oblige States parties to take 
action through legislative, administrative, judicial, and other means to effectively prevent torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 4 requires States parties 
to criminalize all acts, including attempted acts of, and complicity or participation in, torture (as 
defined in article 1). It requires them to punish torture by State actors or others acting in an 
official capacity, including private persons acting with official sanction, and officials who know 
or have reasonable grounds to believe that such abuses are being carried out by private parties 
and fail to take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate or punish such abuses. It is not clear 
whether States are obliged to prosecute legal persons, including corporations, as well as 
individuals in cases where the accused is a private person acting with official sanction.  
</p>
<p>42. Article 13 deals with the procedural aspects of remedy in requiring that any individual who 
claims he or she has been subjected to torture in any territory under the jurisdiction of a State 
party &#8220;has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, 
its competent authorities&#8221;.<b>48</b> Article 12 provides for prompt and impartial investigations. 
Article 4 provides that penalties must be appropriately severe in order to reflect the grave nature

<p>of the crime. In addition, article 14 provides that each State party &#8220;shall ensure in its legal system 
that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and 
adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>43. In its general comment No. 2 (2008), the Committee stated:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain basic guarantees apply to all persons deprived of their liberty. Some of these are 
specified in the Convention, and the Committee consistently calls upon States parties to 
use them. The Committee&#8217;s recommendations concerning effective measures aim to clarify 
the current baseline and are not exhaustive. Such guarantees include, inter alia, maintaining 
an official register of detainees, the right of detainees to be informed of their rights, the 
right promptly to receive independent legal assistance, independent medical assistance, and 
to contact relatives, the need to establish impartial mechanisms for inspecting and visiting 
places of detention and confinement, and the availability to detainees and persons at risk of 
torture and ill-treatment of judicial and other remedies that will allow them to have their 
complaints promptly and impartially examined, to defend their rights, and to challenge the 
legality of their detention or treatment.&#8221;<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The Committee has expressed concern at the lack of effective State policy to prevent and 
punish violence against &#8220;at-risk&#8221; or vulnerable groups like women, children and ethnic and other 
minorities, including when it is committed by private actors.<b>50</b> The State action requirement in 
the Convention means that the Committee has not focused on abuse by private business actors to 
the same extent as the other treaty bodies. However, it has observed that States are responsible 
for ensuring that all detention facilities comply with the Convention&#8217;s guarantees, which by 
implication must encompass facilities that have been outsourced by the State and are privately 
run. The Committee noted that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;each State party should prohibit, prevent and redress torture and ill-treatment in all 
contexts of custody or control, for example, in prisons, hospitals, schools, institutions that 
engage in the care of children, the aged, the mentally ill or disabled, in military service, 
and other institutions as well as contexts where the failure of the State to intervene 
encourages and enhances the danger of privately inflicted harm.&#8221;<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Convention does not, of course, limit the international responsibility that States or 
individuals can incur for perpetrating torture and other related crimes under international 
customary law or other treaties - notably the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

<p><b>F.  Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>46. The CRC does not contain a general provision dealing with the State obligation to provide 
access to remedy. However, it contains various provisions addressing specific aspects of access 
to remedy, particularly judicial remedy, including in article 9 (2) (the opportunity for an affected 
child to participate in separation proceedings), article 12 (the opportunity for a child to be heard 
in any judicial proceedings that are held), article 19 (2) (judicial involvement in cases of violence 
against children), article 37 (d) (the opportunity for prompt access to a court to challenge any 
detention order), and article 40 (2) (b) (iii) (the opportunity for prompt penal proceedings).  
</p>
<p>47. In general comment No. 5 (2003), the Committee on the Rights of the Child stated that &#8220;for 
rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress violations&#8221;, and that the 
right to an effective remedy is implicit in the Convention.<b>52</b> The Committee considers that States 
parties must &#8220;give particular attention to ensuring that there are effective, child-sensitive 
procedures available to children and their representatives&#8221; and that such procedures should 
include &#8220;access to independent complaints procedures and to the courts with necessary legal and 
other assistance&#8221;. (These concerns recur in general comments Nos. 8 and 9.) Where a violation 
of a Convention right is found, &#8220;there should be appropriate reparation, including compensation, 
and, where needed, measures to promote physical and psychological recovery, rehabilitation and 
reintegration&#8221;. Relevantly, general comment No. 5 also stresses incorporation of the Convention 
into domestic law. 
</p>
<p>48. The Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
contains detailed provisions requiring changes to national criminal law, and refers to 
compensation for victims as well as penalties for perpetrators. The Committee has expressed 
concern at reducing penalties where compensation is available and has called for separation 
between reparation and penalties to ensure perpetrators are held to account.<b>53</b> The Optional 
Protocol also requires States parties to adopt measures to ensure recovery and reintegration for 
victims.  
</p>
<p><b>Business-specific references 
</b></p>
<p>49. According to the Special Representative&#8217;s work on the CRC, the Committee&#8217;s 
commentaries imply that access to remedial mechanisms and appropriate reparation should 
follow abuses by State and non-State actors alike, including business enterprises. With respect to 
criminal sanctions, in accordance with article 32 of the Convention, the Committee has called for

<p>prosecution and punishment of private actors engaged in economic exploitation or 
discrimination, trafficking or violence against children, and has said that punishments should be 
well publicized so as to act as a deterrent.  
</p>
<p>50. The Committee has focused on the issue of businesses carrying out &#8220;State functions&#8221;, and 
has stressed that States must ensure that non-State service providers, including business, act in 
accordance with the Convention.<b>54</b> The Committee has also discussed the importance of 
regulating media and Internet companies, and various types of employers, in ensuring the 
effective implementation of Convention rights. 
</p>
<p>51. The Optional Protocol on the sale of children requires States parties to ensure that 
complainants have access to adequate procedures to seek compensation from those &#8220;legally 
responsible&#8221; under article 9. The Committee has encouraged States parties to extend liability 
under the Optional Protocol to legal persons, pursuant to article 3 (4), which provides that 
&#8220;subject to the provisions of its national law, each State party shall take measures, where 
appropriate, to establish the liability of legal persons for offences established in paragraph 1 of 
the present article. Subject to the legal principles of the State party, such liability of legal persons 
may be criminal, civil or administrative&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>G. International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All  
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>52. Article 83 of the ICRMW sets out States parties&#8217; obligations in exactly the same terms as 
article 2 (3) of the ICCPR, that is, by requiring States to ensure that &#8220;any person&#8221; whose 
Convention rights or freedoms are violated &#8220;shall have an effective remedy&#8221;. Recognizing that 
migrant workers face particular problems in enforcing their rights as they may not be allowed to 
stay in a host State&#8217;s territory once their contract of employment expires, the Committee on 
Migrant Workers (CMW) has recommended that migrant workers be allowed &#8220;to stay in the 
country [of employment] for the time necessary to seek remedies for unpaid wages and benefits&#8221;. 
The Committee also recommended that States &#8220;should consider offering legal services to migrant 
workers in legal proceedings related to employment and migration&#8221;. The Committee further 
recommended that States &#8220;establish effective and accessible channels which would allow all 
migrant workers to lodge complaints of violations of their rights without fear of retaliation on the 
grounds that they may be in an irregular situation&#8221;.<b>55</b>

</p>
<p>53. Article 18 of the Convention provides that &#8220;migrant workers ... shall have the right to 
equality with nationals of the State concerned before the courts and tribunals&#8221;. According to the 
Committee, &#8220;Article 18 does not apply only to a situation where migrant workers seek a remedy 
for violations under the Convention, but rather to any situation before courts and tribunals&#8221;.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>54. The CMW has recommended special attention be given to protect the rights of migrant 
women, particularly domestic workers.<b>57</b> Similarly, OHCHR has highlighted the plight of 
unaccompanied migrant children, arguing that States should ensure that such children, and the 
children of migrant workers, are given equal opportunities to exercise their rights. OHCHR&#8217;s 
comments apparently contemplate States regulating private as well as public employers in order 
to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights of migrant children.<b>58</b> 
<b>Business-specific references 
</b></p>
<p>55. Article 68 of the Convention specifically provides for the imposition of effective sanctions 
on persons, groups or entities that organize, operate, or assist in organizing or operating illegal 
movements of migrant workers, or that use violence, threats or intimidation against migrant 
workers. This obligation appears to extend to activities by business enterprises engaged in 
trafficking or employing trafficked migrant workers.<b>59</b> With respect to specific businesses, the 
Committee has emphasized the importance of adequate regulation, including licensing, of 
recruitment agencies; it has also noted the importance of regular monitoring and inspection of 
workplaces, particularly in the domestic and agricultural sectors. In the case of domestic 
workers, the CMW has recommended in concluding observations that a State party should 
ensure that such workers have access to a mechanism to report alleged abuse by their employers, 
and that all cases of abuse be investigated and the perpetrators sanctioned.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>56. As one of the most recent international human rights treaties, the CRPD explicitly 
mentions business in article 4 (1) (e), which requires States parties to &#8220;take all appropriate 
measures to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability by any person, organization or 
private enterprise.&#8221;

</p>
<p>57. The CRPD requires States parties to make provision for effective access to justice for 
persons with disabilities (which is distinct from a general obligation to provide access to remedy 
for violations of Convention rights). Article 13 provides that: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;1. States parties shall ensure effective access to justice for persons with 
disabilities on an equal basis with others, including through the provision of procedural and 
age-appropriate accommodations, in order to facilitate their effective role as direct and 
indirect participants, including as witnesses, in all legal proceedings, including at 
investigative and other preliminary stages. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;2. In order to help to ensure effective access to justice for persons with 
disabilities, States parties shall promote appropriate training for those working in the field 
of administration of justice, including police and prison staff.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>58. The Convention also details the rights of persons with disabilities in the context of 
employment, referring in article 27 (1) (b) to the State obligation to &#8220;Protect the rights of persons 
with disabilities, on an equal basis with others, to just and favourable conditions of work, 
including ... the redress of grievances&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>59. It remains to be seen what views the newly established Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities will offer with respect to State obligations to provide access to remedy 
for business-related abuse. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  International instruments pertaining to the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>60. In discussing corporate-related abuse, the treaty bodies often pay particular attention to the 
special protections that may need to be afforded to indigenous peoples under the main 
international human rights treaties. More detailed provisions elaborating on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
human rights can be found in two other key international instruments.  
</p>
<p>61. International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries provides in article 4 that special measures &#8220;shall be adopted as 
appropriate&#8221; by States parties to safeguard the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples. In terms of 
the substantive aspects of remedy, it contains, in articles 15 and 16, several provisions relating to 
compensation for harm suffered through exploration, or use of resources, on indigenous and 
tribal peoples&#8217; lands, and for their removal from such lands where return is not possible. Under 
article 20, States parties are required to ensure that the rights of indigenous employees are 
effectively protected, including ensuring &#8220;that they are fully informed of their rights under labour 
legislation and of the means of redress available to them&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>62. While ILO Convention No. 169 has only a small number of parties, there has been much 
broader support among the international community for the recent, in itself non-binding, 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration goes into more 
detail than the Convention with respect to the appropriate substantive remedies for the loss of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; lands or resources, or harm suffered through the use of such lands and 
resources, without their free, prior and informed consent in articles 10, 28 and 32. Under 
article 8, States are expected to provide effective mechanisms to prevent and provide redress for </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>actions that violate the right of indigenous peoples not to be subjected to forced assimilation or 
destruction of their culture. Under article 11, States are also expected to provide redress where 
indigenous cultural property is appropriated without the free, prior and informed consent of the 
peoples involved. 
</p>
<p>63. The Declaration contains an overarching provision dealing with access to remedy, stating 
in article 40 that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indigenous peoples have the right to access to, and prompt decision through, just and fair 
procedures for the resolution of conflicts and disputes with States or other parties, as well 
as to effective remedies for all infringements of their individual and collective rights. Such 
a decision shall give due consideration to the customs, traditions, rules and legal systems of 
the indigenous peoples concerned and international human rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>J.  Summary 
</b></p>
<p>64. Various procedural and substantive aspects of States&#8217; obligations to provide access to 
remedy for human rights abuses are addressed in the main international human rights treaties. 
Some treaties explicitly require States to provide remedy for abuse, although States generally 
have discretion in how to fulfil this obligation; in other cases, the treaty bodies have provided 
some useful guidance about what individual treaties appears to contemplate in this regard.  
</p>
<p>65. There are some common strands in the approaches of the various treaty bodies to State 
obligations to provide access to remedy for human rights abuses - whether committed by public 
or private actors. A number have emphasized the importance of:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting prompt, thorough and fair investigations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing access to prompt, effective and independent remedial mechanisms, 
established through judicial, administrative, legislative and other appropriate means  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Imposing appropriate sanctions, including criminalizing conduct and pursuing 
prosecutions where abuses amount to international crimes  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing a range of forms of appropriate reparation, such as compensation, restitution, 
rehabilitation and changes in relevant laws 
</p>
<p>66. Several treaty bodies have also stressed the need for special attention to be paid to &#8220;at-risk&#8221; 
or vulnerable groups - potentially including women, children, indigenous peoples and other 
minorities - to ensure that they have access to effective remedies that are appropriately tailored to 
their needs. This is complemented in the case of indigenous peoples by other international 
instruments dealing specifically with their rights.  
</p>
<p>67. Although some of the newer treaties expressly contemplate States taking steps to eliminate 
abuse by business enterprises, and even establishing liability for legal persons,<b>61</b> there remains a 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>61
</b>  See para. 51 above. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>lack of clarity as to the steps States should take to hold companies accountable. Particular areas 
that would benefit from greater clarity include whether States should impose liability on 
companies themselves, in addition to natural persons acting on the entity&#8217;s behalf; when States 
are expected to provide individuals with civil causes of action against companies (i.e. separate 
from criminal sanctions and going beyond administrative complaints mechanisms); and whether 
and to what extent States should hold companies liable for alleged abuses occurring overseas. 
The comments by CESCR and CERD in this respect offer some guidance, although a number of 
points remain unclear.  
</p>
<p>68. Some types of companies, rights, and victims have been referred to more frequently than 
others by the treaty bodies. For example, several of them have emphasized that States should:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protect employees&#8217; rights in both public and private settings and establish effective 
complaints mechanisms for employment-related grievances  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Minimize the potential for extractive companies to impair the ability of communities 
affected by their activities, especially indigenous peoples, to access remedial 
mechanisms 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In situations where &#8220;State functions&#8221; have been privatized, ensure that effective systems 
are in place to remedy any abuse by the relevant private companies involved 
</p>
<p>69. These and other implications of the State obligation to provide access to remedy for 
corporate-related abuse under the core international human rights treaties would benefit from 
further attention and elaboration.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. STATE OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO REMEDY 
UNDER REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>70. This section surveys the situation under the main regional human rights treaties, namely 
the American Convention on Human Rights, European Convention on Human Rights and the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.  
</p>
<p>71. The discussion of the Inter-American system draws on an analysis of the State duty to 
protect against human rights abuses by business under that system previously prepared for the 
Special Representative. Similar research is currently being conducted in support of the Special 
Representative&#8217;s work into the European and African regional human rights systems, including 
States&#8217; obligations to provide access to remedy. This section therefore deals first with the 
Inter-American system, and then discusses some of the general principles underlying the 
remedial approaches in the European and African systems.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  American Convention on Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>General principles 
</b></p>
<p>72. Under article 1 (1) of the American Convention on Human Rights, States parties are 
required to undertake to &#8220;respect&#8221; and &#8220;ensure&#8221; the rights contained in the Convention with </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>respect to all persons subject to their jurisdiction.<b>62</b> In its judgement in its first contentious case, 
<i>Vel&#225;squez Rodriguez</i>, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights analysed what the obligation to 
&#8220;ensure&#8221; rights means:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;This obligation implies the duty of States Parties to organize the governmental apparatus 
and, in general, all the structures through which public power is exercised, so that they are 
capable of juridically ensuring the free and full enjoyment of human rights. As a 
consequence of this obligation, the States must prevent, investigate and punish any 
violation of the rights recognized by the Convention and, moreover, if possible attempt to 
restore the right violated and provide compensation as warranted for damages resulting 
from the violation. 
</p>
<p>&#8230; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;This duty to prevent includes all those means of a legal, political, administrative and 
cultural nature that promote the protection of human rights and ensure that any violations 
are treated as illegal acts, which, as such, may lead to the punishment of those responsible 
and the obligation to indemnify the victims for damages. It is not possible to make a 
detailed list of all such measures, since they vary with the law and the conditions of each 
State party. &#8220;<b> 63</b> 
</p>
<p>73. While the case concerned violations by State-sponsored forces, the judgement also noted 
that States have similar obligations to prevent or respond to private acts that are not directly 
attributable to the State.  
</p>
<p>74. Article 25 (1) of the American Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right of 
<i>amparo</i> - a procedure for obtaining judicial review of an executive act affecting an individual 
that allegedly violates domestic legal norms, similar to the common law habeas corpus 
action - and extends its reach to alleged breaches of the Convention.<b>64</b> It provides that:  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>62
</b>  The Convention is one of the two main human rights instruments adopted by the Organization 
</p>
<p>of American States (OAS). The other is the non-binding American Declaration of the Rights and 
Duties of Man, which applies to all OAS member States, including those which have not ratified 
the American Convention on Human Rights. 
<b>63
</b></p>
<p>  (1988) 1 Inter-Am Ct HR (ser. C) No. 4, paras. 166, 177. 
<b>64
</b></p>
<p>  The American Declaration also speaks about the right to access national courts in 
article XVIII, as well as providing for the right of <i>amparo</i>: &#8220;Every person may resort to the 
courts to ensure respect for his legal rights. There should likewise be available to him a simple, 
brief procedure whereby the courts will protect him from acts of authority that, to his prejudice, 
violate any fundamental constitutional rights.&#8221; Note that article 8 of the UDHR resulted from a 
proposal put by Mexico during the drafting of the Declaration that <i>amparo </i>should be protected 
by its provisions. Mary Ann Glendon, &#8220;The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence 
on the Universal Human Rights Idea&#8221;, <i>Harvard Human Rights Journal,</i> vol. 16 (2003), p. 38. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has the right to simple and prompt recourse, or any other effective recourse, to a 
competent court or tribunal for protection against acts that violate his fundamental rights 
recognized by the constitution or laws of the State concerned or by this Convention, even 
though such violation may have been committed by persons acting in the course of their 
official duties.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>75. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has emphasized that article 25 requires 
access to effective judicial remedy for the protection of fundamental rights, meaning that the 
tribunal must reach a reasoned conclusion on the merits of the claim.<b>65</b> Under article 25, States 
parties are also required to undertake to develop the possibility of judicial remedies, and to 
ensure that the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies when granted. Neither the 
Court nor the Commission has interpreted article 25 (1) as creating an individual right to 
establish the criminal or civil liability of alleged human rights abusers.  
</p>
<p>76. Article 8 (1) contains a general guarantee of the right to a fair hearing in both civil and 
criminal cases:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person has the right to a hearing, with due guarantees and within a reasonable time, 
by a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal, previously established by law, in the 
substantiation of any accusation of a criminal nature made against him or for the 
determination of his rights and obligations of a civil, labour, fiscal, or any other nature.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>77. Article 63 provides that if the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention, 
it shall rule, if appropriate, that fair compensation be paid to the victim. The Court may also 
adopt provisional measures. With respect to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the 
Commission has stressed that it is not a &#8220;court of fourth instance&#8221;, but it has also recognized a 
number of exceptions to the rule, including where domestic legislation does not provide adequate 
protection, where access to remedy has been denied, or where there has been unwarranted delay. 
As in the European system, these exceptions can be proven through evidence of a pattern of 
gross violations that have gone unremedied. The Court has stated that lack of legal representation 
can also constitute an exception in certain circumstances.  
</p>
<p>78. The Commission has developed a body of decisions upholding the right of the individual 
victim to know the truth about violations of their human rights, including the identity of those 
who committed them. The Court&#8217;s emphasis on investigation and access to information in its 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>65
</b>  The Commission processes individual petitions from victims of human rights abuses and, 
</p>
<p>where it finds an abuse has occurred, issues recommendations to the relevant State about 
measures to redress the abuse and prevent future violations. Where a State fails to implement 
those recommendations, and where it has submitted to the contentious jurisdiction of the Court, 
the Commission may refer the case to the Court for a binding judgement. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>decisions is not surprising given that the majority of the contentious cases brought before it have 
involved disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in situations where many of the States 
involved had granted amnesties to the perpetrators of these abuses.<b>66</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Business-specific references 
</b></p>
<p>79. As noted above, the Court has clearly held that the State duty to protect under the 
Convention extends to investigating, punishing and redressing abuse by &#8220;third parties&#8221; or 
&#8220;private persons&#8221;, and has referred to the duty in situations likely to involve businesses.<b>67</b> The 
Commission has made clear that the Convention can be relied on by individuals in relation to 
State failures to adequately prevent, investigate, punish or redress abuse by private actors, 
specifically including corporations. It has considered the impact of business operations in 
situations involving violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, threats to an individual&#8217;s physical 
integrity, including where this arises as a result of environmental harm, and, increasingly, in 
situations implicating economic and social rights and the rights of the child. The Commission 
has also moved from ordering precautionary measures focused on the suspension or cancellation 
of licences by the State to include measures that require the continued involvement of the 
relevant corporation in monitoring and mitigating its impacts.  
</p>
<p>80. The Commission has emphasized the importance of protecting indigenous peoples&#8217; 
interests in their lands and natural resources - indeed, this is the main context in which it has 
discussed State responsibilities with respect to corporate-related human rights abuse. The 
Commission has stressed that States should ensure, where business operations affect indigenous 
lands or peoples, that the relevant lands are appropriately identified and demarcated, that the 
indigenous peoples involved are consulted in all matters affecting their interests (including 
through the provision of adequate translation services where necessary), and that irreparable 
harm is not caused to their identity or rights.  
</p>
<p>81. The Court has ordered provisional measures in cases where the State has failed to 
adequately protect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, including against the effects of third parties&#8217; 
commercial operations. The Court has stressed the importance of environmental and social 
impact assessments in the context of major resource and extractive projects, and the 
responsibility of States to ensure that such assessments are carried out in accordance with 
relevant international standards and best practices, while also taking into account cultural

</p>
<p><b>66
</b>  The Court has begun to expand its consideration of social and economic rights under 
</p>
<p>article 26 of the Convention and under the 1988 Additional Protocol in the Area of Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (Protocol of San Salvador). 
<b>67
</b></p>
<p>  The following discussion draws on Anicama, op. cit., pp. 10-12. The Court has not explicitly 
used the term &#8220;companies&#8221;, with the exception of Judge Ant&#244;nio Can&#231;ado Trindade in a separate 
opinion in a case involving provisional measures ordered against Ecuador. </p>

<p>considerations.<b>68</b> Such assessments should be carried out in advance of any rights to land being 
granted and should consider the cumulative impact of proposed projects on affected 
communities.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  European Convention on Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>82. Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides: &#8220;Everyone whose 
rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy 
before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons 
acting in an official capacity&#8221;. Summarizing the views of the European Court of Human Rights, 
Shelton explains that: &#8220;the attributes of an effective remedy include institutional independence of 
the remedial body from the authority responsible for the violation, ability to invoke the 
Convention guarantees in question, capability of the remedial body of affording redress, and 
effectiveness in fact.&#8221;<b> 69</b> 
</p>
<p>83. The broad guarantee in article 13 is linked to the more specific requirements relating to 
habeas corpus actions in article 5 (4), compensation for unlawful arrest in article 5 (5), and 
access to justice, which the European Court of Human Rights has inferred from the fair hearing 
guarantee in article 6 (1), which article provides: &#8220;In the determination of his civil rights and 
obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public 
hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>84. The Court has held that a complainant must have a &#8220;bona fide&#8221; opportunity to have their 
case heard and, where appropriate, to have reparations assessed. States are entitled to impose 
reasonable restrictions on access to the courts to ensure a functioning system of justice (for 
example, through statutes of limitations, or the requirement of legal representation), but they 
must not impair the fundamental essence of the right to a fair hearing. The Court has held that 
where legal representation is required by law, or where the law is so complicated as to make 
legal advice essential, then the State must provide it.<b>70</b> For example, in a case involving two 
campaigners from Greenpeace who were successfully sued by McDonalds, the Court held that 
the failure of the United Kingdom to provide them with legal aid &#8220;had deprived them of the 
opportunity to present their case effectively before the court and contributed to an unacceptable 
inequality of arms&#8221; in contravention of article 6 (1).<b>71</b>

</p>
<p>85. Article 6 (1) does not mandate judicial consideration: at least where civil rights or 
obligations are at issue, an initial determination may be made by an administrative body, 
provided that that body complies with article 6 (1) requirements, or by a private body, provided 
there exists a right of appeal to a body complying with article 6 (1).<b>72</b> Thus the remedy provided 
by a State may also be administrative or legislative, but it must be effective. In a series of cases 
in the 1990s against Turkey, the Court found violations of the broad guarantee in article 13 in the 
consistent absence of an effective remedy at the national level - including the State&#8217;s failure to 
investigate alleged abuses, its failure to prosecute alleged offenders and its failure to provide 
compensation.  
</p>
<p>86. In other cases, the Court has concluded that, for the purposes of article 13, the nature of the 
right at issue will have implications for the nature of the remedy that must be provided. For 
example, where a case involves the protection of the right to life, or the prohibition on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, then the State must ensure an 
effective investigation that is capable of leading to the identification, prosecution and 
punishment of those responsible.<b>73</b>  
</p>
<p>87. While parties before the European Court of Human Rights are expected to have exhausted 
national remedies, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies that are inadequate or 
ineffective, or where there are &#8220;special circumstances&#8221; like the routine passivity of national 
authorities in the face of serious allegations.<b>74</b> The Court has said that due allowance must be 
made for the fact that the exhaustion of domestic remedies rule is being applied in human rights 
proceedings, meaning it should be applied in a flexible manner and &#8220;without excessive 
formalism&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>88. It should be noted that article 47 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is 
currently not legally binding but is contained in Part II of the draft European Union Constitution, 
incorporates the requirements of both articles 6 (1) and 13, as well as specifically providing for 
legal aid where that is &#8220;necessary to ensure effective access to justice&#8221;.

<p><b>C.  African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights

<p>89. Article 7 of the African Charter states that:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This comprises: (a) the right 
to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as 
recognized and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force &#8230;&#8221;

<p>90. This provision appears to take the obligation on States parties to provide access to 
&#8220;competent national organs&#8221; for individuals to vindicate their rights and to extend it beyond the 
African Charter to other treaties dealing with fundamental rights and freedoms.<b>75</b>  
</p>
<p>91. Article 26 requires States parties to guarantee the independence of their courts and to allow 
&#8220;the establishment and improvement of appropriate national institutions entrusted with the 
promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the present Charter&#8221;. The 
African Commission has emphasized that States are expected to conduct effective investigations 
into alleged violations, and ensure the provision of a fair trial.<b>76</b> 
</p>
<p>92. The procedural exhaustion requirement in articles 50 and 56 (5) of the Charter is &#8220;the one 
condition most frequently invoked and contested by the parties before the African 
Commission&#8221;.<b>77</b> The Commission has stated that national remedies must be &#8220;available, effective 
and sufficient&#8221; to be considered.<b>78</b> To be available, the remedy must be evident and a claimant 
must be able to pursue it without impediments; to be effective, the substantive right must be 
adequately provided for in national law; and to be sufficient, the remedy must offer at least the 
prospect of success. Again, a pattern of persistent violations that have not been redressed can 
constitute evidence of inadequate domestic remedies.  
</p>
<p>93. The Commission has made clear that States have positive obligations under the Charter to 
prevent and sanction third party abuses of human rights. It has held that the decision of the 
Inter-American Court in <i>Vel&#225;squez Rodriguez</i> is of direct relevance in the African context, 
specifically, in interpreting article 1 of the Charter, which requires States parties to &#8220;recognize 
the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined in the Charter and &#8230; undertake to adopt legislative and

<p><b>75
</b>  In comparison, article 9 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights provides that &#8220;everyone within 
</p>
<p>the territory of the State has a guaranteed right to a legal remedy&#8221;, but it is not clear that this 
extends beyond violations of existing national laws. The Charter entered into force in 
March 2008 and has been controversial in parts. Note also that the Inter-American Court may 
consider any human rights treaty that is applicable to the American States in its advisory 
jurisdiction. 
<b>76
</b></p>
<p>  Shelton, <i>Remedies in International Human Rights Law</i>, op. cit., p. 142. The African Court on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has recently begun hearing its first contentious case. Under the 2008 
Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights, the African Court on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights will merge with the AU Court of Justice to form a new institution, 
which will assume jurisdiction over any human rights cases currently under consideration by the

</p>
<p>other measures to give effect to them&#8221;.<b>79</b> A State may breach its obligations where it fails to 
exercise the necessary care to prevent abuse by private actors, or fails to take the necessary steps 
to investigate, punish and redress abuses where they occur - including restoring the right that has 
been violated and providing compensation.<b>80</b>  
</p>
<p>94. The best known application of these principles in the context of corporate-related abuse is 
the decision by the Commission on a communication concerning Nigeria&#8217;s alleged failure to 
protect against abuse by an oil consortium comprised of State-owned and private enterprises.<b>81</b> 
The Commission found that the State had failed in its duty to protect the affected individuals 
from abuse by non-State actors. It said that the duty requires States to create and maintain an 
appropriate legal and regulatory framework enabling individuals to freely realize their rights, 
including by ensuring that they have access to remedy. Among other measures, the Commission 
recommended more effective and independent oversight of the petroleum industry.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Summary 
</b></p>
<p>95. In considering States&#8217; general obligations to provide access to remedy for human rights 
abuses, the regional human rights commissions and courts have focused on a number of key 
issues, including the meaning of a &#8220;fair hearing&#8221; and when practical matters, like inadequate 
legal aid or representation, may constitute unacceptable barriers to remedy. In applying the rule 
requiring exhaustion of domestic remedies to proceedings before them, they have also gone into 
some detail about when, and what kind of, failures at the national level will vitiate this 
requirement - including ongoing State passivity in the face of persistent allegations.  
</p>
<p>96. With respect to corporate-related abuse, as noted above, further research is being carried 
out into the European and African systems. But as the study on the Inter-American system 
conducted for the Special Representative shows, some consideration has been given to steps that 
States should take to prevent, and also to investigate, punish and redress abuse by private actors. 
For example, the Inter-American Commission has considered the impact of business operations 
in situations involving violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, threats to an individual&#8217;s 
physical integrity (including where this arises as a result of environmental harm), and, 
increasingly, in situations implicating economic and social rights and the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>97. The Inter-American Court has also dealt with State responsibility for third party abuse in 
the context of violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and has emphasized the importance of 
consultation and the carrying out of environmental and social impact assessments prior to project 
approval being granted. However, these and other issues concerning States&#8217; obligations to 
provide access to remedy for corporate-related abuse would benefit from further consideration 
and guidance by the regional human rights commissions and courts.

<p><b>V. THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO REMEDY IN SITUATIONS 
OF GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98. The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious 
Violations of International Humanitarian Law were adopted in 2005, first by the Commission on 
Human Rights, and subsequently in a resolution of the General Assembly, giving them an 
authoritative, if not legally binding, force.<b>82</b> The preamble indicates that they are intended to 
reiterate States&#8217; existing obligations under the main international and regional human rights 
treaties, international humanitarian law conventions, and other relevant sources of international 
law, to provide access to remedy for gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law.<b>83</b> The Basic Principles also provide for an individual right to 
remedy in such cases, &#8220;irrespective of who may ultimately be the bearer of responsibility for the 
violation&#8221;,<b>84</b> and thus extend to third party, including corporate-related, abuses.  
</p>
<p>99. This section outlines the understanding of &#8220;gross violations&#8221; that shaped the drafting of the 
Basic Principles, and then discusses their key provisions and notes their potential implications 
for situations involving corporate-related abuse.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Gross violations 
</b></p>
<p>100. In his progress report in 1993, when the draft principles applied only to gross violations of 
international human rights law, the initial drafter, Theodor van Boven, explained that:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;While under a number of international instruments any violation of provisions of these 
instruments may entail a right to an appropriate remedy, the present study focuses on gross 
violations of human rights as distinct from other violations. No agreed definition exists of 
the term &#8216;gross violations of human rights&#8217;. It appears that the word &#8216;gross&#8217; qualifies the 
term &#8216;violations&#8217; and indicates the serious character of the violations but that the word 
&#8220;gross&#8221; is also related to the type of human right that is being violated.&#8221;<b>85</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>82
</b>  An important precursor was the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for 
</p>
<p>Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, adopted by the General Assembly in 1985 
(resolution 40/34, annex), which focused on remedies for victims of crimes committed by 
non-State actors under national law and on governmental abuse of power.  
<b>83
</b></p>
<p>  See, generally, International Commission of Jurists, <i>The Right to a Remedy and to Reparation 
for Gross Human Rights Violations: A Practitioners&#8217; Guide</i> (2006). 
<b>84
</b></p>
<p>  Principle 3 (c). With respect to human rights abuses committed by third parties that do not 
amount to gross violations, however, the content of the right to remedy is less clear, and it will 
be necessary to look to the relevant source of the State obligation (usually the relevant treaty 
provision). 
<b>85
</b></p>
<p>  E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/8, para. 8. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>101. After reviewing relevant sources, he concluded that the types of acts that would almost 
always constitute &#8220;gross violations&#8221; included &#8220;at least the following: genocide; slavery and 
slave-like practices; summary or arbitrary executions; torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; enforced disappearance; arbitrary and prolonged detention; deportation 
or forcible transfer of population; and systematic discrimination, in particular based on race or 
gender&#8221;. However, as the inclusion of &#8220;systematic discrimination&#8221; indicates, gross violations 
may also arise from large-scale and systematic violations of other rights. Thus, there is no 
accepted list of what can constitute gross violations, and later drafts of the Basic Principles did 
not attempt to define them.<b>86</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  State obligations and individual rights 
</b></p>
<p>102. The Basic Principles stress States&#8217; core obligations to respect, protect, and ensure all 
international human rights and international humanitarian law, which obviously goes beyond the 
issue of providing access to remedy (Principles 1-3). They also reiterate the obligation on States 
to investigate, prosecute and punish violations of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law, where the latter amount to international crimes, and to cooperate 
with other States in bringing perpetrators to account (Principles 4-5).  
</p>
<p>103. Principle 8 defines who can be considered a &#8220;victim&#8221;, including who may be considered an 
&#8220;indirect victim&#8221;:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Victims are persons who individually or collectively suffered harm, including physical or 
mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their 
fundamental rights, through acts or omissions that constitute gross violations of 
international human rights law, or serious violations of international humanitarian law. 
Where appropriate, and in accordance with domestic law, the term &#8220;victim&#8221; also includes 
the immediate family or dependants of the direct victim and persons who have suffered 
harm in intervening to assist victims in distress or to prevent victimization.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>104. This definition goes beyond what is stated or assumed in many of the core international 
human rights law treaties - namely, that a victim typically is an individual who is the direct 
&#8220;target&#8221; of a violation. But the definition in the Basic Principles reflects international 
jurisprudence, particularly with respect to cases involving killings and disappearances.<b>87</b>  
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>86
</b>  Similarly, with respect to &#8220;serious violations of international humanitarian law&#8221; there is no 
</p>
<p>accepted list but they would certainly include the following: grave breaches of the Geneva 
Conventions; war crimes (as provided for in the Additional Protocols to the Conventions); 
breaches of a number of other related treaties, like those on the protection of cultural property 
and on land mines; and other relevant principles of customary international law. While still a 
large field, there is greater codification of what might constitute serious violations of 
international humanitarian law than is possible in respect of gross violations of international 
human rights law, where potentially all rights might be implicated if the harm is large-scale and 
systematic enough. 
<b>87
</b></p>
<p>  See International Commission of Jurists, op. cit., pp. 33-42. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>105. Principle 11 sets out the three core remedial rights of victims &#8220;as provided for under 
international law&#8221;:<b>88</b>  
</p>
<p>(a) Equal and effective access to justice;  
(b) Adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered; and 
</p>
<p>(c) Access to relevant information concerning violations and reparation mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>106. In defining &#8220;access to justice&#8221;, Principle 12 provides that victims &#8220;shall have equal access 
to an effective judicial remedy as provided for under international law&#8221;, as well as referring to 
administrative and other relevant domestic mechanisms. States should &#8220;provide proper assistance 
to victims&#8221; and, in addition to individual justice, should endeavour to develop procedures for 
group claims and access to international mechanisms as appropriate (Principles 12-14).  
</p>
<p>107. The Basic Principles state that victims should be provided with &#8220;adequate, effective and 
prompt reparation&#8221; that is proportional to the harm suffered, which may include restitution, 
compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition (Principles 15-23).<b>89</b> 
With respect to where the responsibility for providing reparation lies, Principle 15 provides that 
&#8220;in cases where a person, a legal person, or other entity is found liable for reparation to a victim, 
such party should provide reparation to the victim or compensate the State if the State has 
already provided reparation to the victim.&#8221; States are expected to ensure that reparation decisions 
are enforced, including in cases involving foreign judgements (Principle 17).  
108. The qualification noted above that under Principles 11 and 12 victims are entitled to 
remedy &#8220;as provided for under international law&#8221; may reflect a desire on the part of some States 
to emphasize that the Basic Principles do not expand the existing scope of State obligations to 
provide access to remedy for gross violations of international human rights law and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law. However, they are certainly indicative of an 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>88
</b>  While access to information has usually been treated as an aspect of access to justice, or 
</p>
<p>indeed as a substantive violation of the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment, it is included here as a stand-alone right. It evolved out of international 
humanitarian law requirements regarding the recording and passing on of information about the 
wounded, sick and dead. Cases concerning enforced disappearances have also stressed the 
importance of the victim&#8217;s right to information about the violation, particularly where the 
claimant is not the direct victim but is closely linked to them. See International Commission of 
Jurists, op. cit., Ch. 5. 
<b>89
</b></p>
<p>  Guarantees of non-repetition are often considered as an aspect of satisfaction; they are 
intimately related to the State obligation to prevent violations and so the primary obligation (to 
prevent) overlaps with the secondary obligation (to guarantee non-repetition where a violation 
has occurred).  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/13/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p>enhanced concern on the part of the international community to ensure access to remedy for 
victims of gross human rights violations, and may reflect increased expectations that individuals 
should be able to resort to national courts to vindicate their treaty rights where those rights are 
the subject of gross violations.  
</p><p>109. The Basic Principles suggest that States may be required to do more, and be afforded less 
discretion, where gross violations occur and the individual right to remedy applies. For example, 
in order to ensure the individual right to access to justice (defined as &#8220;an effective judicial 
remedy&#8221;) States may need to go beyond showing that they have taken appropriate steps to 
provide access to judicial remedy, and in fact ensure that in cases involving gross violations, 
including those committed by private parties, legal and practical barriers to accessing justice 
have been adequately addressed so as to enable the individual right to be effective.  
</p>
<p>110. Their adoption clearly invites a renewed focus on existing State obligations to provide 
access to remedy for gross violations committed by private actors, and on the legal and practical 
implications of the individual right to remedy in cases that involve corporate-related abuse.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  GOING FORWARD 
</b></p>
<p>111. The Special Representative will continue to follow developments in the areas discussed in 
this report, including the interpretation and application of State obligations to provide access to 
remedy for corporate-related human rights abuses under the main international and regional 
human rights systems, and expectations arising from the individual right to a remedy in cases 
involving gross violations, as reflected in the Basic Principles. He will explore the implications 
of these developments as he works to operationalize the three complementary pillars of the
