CAUTIONARY NOTE TO US READERS
 
 
CAUTIONARY NOTE TO US READERS
 
As  a  Canadian  reporting  issuer,  the  Company  is  subject  to  rules,  policies  and  regulations  issued  by  Canadian  regulatory
authorities and is required to provide detailed information regarding its properties including mineralization, drilling, sampling and
analysis, security of samples and mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates. In addition, as a Canadian reporting issuer, the
Company is required to describe mineral resources associated with its properties utilizing Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy
and  Petroleum  ("CIM")  definitions  of  "indicated"  or  "inferred",  which  categories  of  resources  are  recognized  by  Canadian
regulations but are not recognized by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
 
The SEC allows mining companies, in their filings with the SEC to disclose only those mineral deposits they can economically and
legally  extract  or  produce.  Accordingly,  information  contained  in  this  document  regarding  our  mineral  deposits  may  not  be
comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the
United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
In particular, this document uses the term "indicated" resources. U.S. readers are cautioned that while that term is recognized and
required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize it. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of
mineral deposits in this category will ever be converted into mineral reserves.
 
This document also uses the term "inferred" resources. U.S. readers are cautioned that while this term is recognized and required
by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize it. "Inferred resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their
existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred
Mineral Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources may
not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that part
or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.

1 SUMMARY
 
1.1             Introduction
 
Aurizon Mines retained the services of BBA Inc. to undertake the current Feasibility Study for the development of the Joanna Gold
Project.  Aurizon  also  retained  the  services  of  Roche  Inc.  to  cover  all  environmental  aspects  of  the  project  including  tailings
management.
 
The geological block model and resource estimate for the current Feasibility Study was prepared by SGS Canada Inc. (Geostat)
and has been previously posted on Sedar in the following document:
 
“NI  43-101  Technical  Report  Mineral  Resource  Estimation  Joanna  Gold  Project  Rouyn-Noranda,  Quebec  Aurizon  Mines  Ltd.
September  2011  Update”.  The  Report  was  prepared  by  SGS  Canada  Inc.  (Geostat)  and  authored  by  M.  Dupéré,  P.  Live,  E.
Palumbo, A. Grandillo, M Magnan. The effective date of the report is December 31, 2011.
 
This  current  Technical  Report  entitled  “Technical  Report  -  Feasibility  Study  for  the  Development  of  Joanna  Gold  Project”  was
prepared by a Qualified Person following the guidelines of the “Canadian Securities Administrators” National Instrument 43-101
(effective June 30, 2011), and in conformity with the guidelines of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM)
Standard on Mineral Resources and Reserves. This Report provides a summary of the Feasibility Study. The Feasibility Study
considers only the Mineral Reserves associated with the Hosco deposit. It should be understood that the mineral resources which
are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
This Report is effective as of June 5, 2012 and is considered as the Current Report for the development of the Joanna Property.
 
1.2             Property Description and Location
 
The Joanna Property is situated 20 km east of Rouyn-Noranda, Province of Québec. The Property is accessible via a gravel road
connecting to Highway 117, which is the main road between Rouyn-Noranda and Val d’Or. The nearest city, Rouyn-Noranda, with
a population  exceeding 40,000, is a regional center with significant mining history, infrastructures and a workforce to support a
mining operation.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The  Joanna  Property  consists  of  three  (3)  separate  blocks  without  inclusions  located  in  the  Joannes  and  Bousquet  townships
totalling 156 claims covering 4,294 ha. The project area extends east-west for more than 12 km and reaches 3 km in the north-
south direction. The Joannes Township claim block comprises a total of 118 claims composed of the original 67 claims acquired in
2006, 25 claims acquired in 2007, 19 claims optioned in 2008, 6 claims acquired in 2009, and another claim acquired in March
2010. The claim blocks located in the Bousquet Township comprise 30 claims for the West Block and 8 claims for the East Block
all acquired by staking in 2009. The Joanna Property is subject to four (4) separate royalties.
 
1.3             Geology and Mineralization
 
The  Joanna  Property  is  situated  on  the  famous  Cadillac  structural  break.  The  structure  generally  strikes  east-west  and  dips
northward. It is characterized by a layer of schistose, chloritic rocks cross cutting a uniform package of metamorphosed, fine-grain
sediments. Gold mineralization is composed of disseminated sulphides (pyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite) in deformed and biotite-
rich zones along the Cadillac Fault. Small quartz veins ranging from a few centimetres to a metre wide are encountered in these
zones. The Au disseminated mineralization is found in strongly altered and deformed corridors with an azimuth of N260° dipping
55° to the north-west. These mineralized corridors average a horizontal width of 20 metres and extend along the strike over 3,000
metres, reaching a depth of 400 m.
 
1.4             Exploration and Drilling
 
The Joanna Property has been explored throughout the last seventy-five years by various owners and optionees. Aurizon optioned
the Property in 2006 and initiated an extensive exploration program in 2007. The following number of holes and meters of drilling
pertain only to the Hosco sector of the Property. The 2007 program involved systematically re-sampling 118 historical holes and
drilling 62 holes totaling 20,647 m. Following this, the first NI 43-101 compliant resources estimate was completed by SGS Geostat.
In 2008, Aurizon drilled 354 holes totalling 86,320 m, and completed a Preliminary Assessment Study for an open-pit  operation
conducted by BBA Inc. In 2009, 55 exploration and infill holes were drilled totaling 13,536 m. SGS Geostat then completed the
updated NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate. BBA completed a positive Pre-Feasibility Study for an open pit operation in the
Hosco sector. In 2010, Aurizon drilled 349 exploration and infill holes totaling 71,917 m including 43 condemnation holes that were
drilled in the northern part of the Property. In 2011, Aurizon drilled 115 exploration and infill holes totaling 30,055 m. Following this,
a last resources estimate update was completed by SGS Geostat with the effective date of December 31, 2011. In 2012, prior to this
Feasibility Study, nine infill holes totaling 3,002 m were drilled.

As  part  of  the  independent  verification  program.  SGS  Geostat  validated  Aurizon’s  exploration  methodology  including  core
sampling, analytical procedures, and their QA/QC protocol. The QA/QC practice implemented by Aurizon consists of the insertion
of reference material in the sample stream (certified and composite analytical standards and blanks).  The author considers the
samples representative and of good quality, and is confident that the system is appropriate for the collection of data suitable for the
estimation of a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate.
 
1.5 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork
 
Metallurgical testwork has been performed at the various study stages of the Joanna Project. Testwork results have been analyzed
and interpreted and used to define the Process Flowsheet, mass balances, gold recovery and other process design parameters
and equipment sizing.
 
1.5.1 Comminution
 
1.5.1.1 Comminution Testwork
 
Seven (7) samples were prepared and were subjected to the SMC test, the Bond rod and ball mill tests, and the bond abrasion test.
In addition, one (1) of these samples was also analyzed using the standard JKTech drop weight impact test and Bond low-energy
impact test, in addition to the tests listed above. The results of these tests are shown in Table 1.1.

Table 1.1: Grindability Test Statistics
 
 
Values obtained of A x b, DWI and CWI were generally considered to be hard with respect to the SGS database, while RWI and
BWI values were considered moderately hard, and AI values were considered moderately abrasive.
 
1.5.1.2 Crusher Selection
 
The crusher selection for the FS was based on the CWI result obtained as part of the comminution tests performed. The CWI value
used for the crusher sizing was 16.2 kWh/t. The crusher selected is a jaw-type crusher with a feed opening measuring 1,250 mm x
950 mm, and an installed power of 200 kW. It is fed ROM ore having F80 of 600 mm, and generates product having P80 of 110 mm.
In sizing the crusher, the crusher availability was assumed to be in the order of 65% with a nominal capacity of 545 t/h. This would
provide the nominal daily throughput of 8,500 t/d.
 
1.5.1.3 Grinding Circuit Modelling and Mill Selection
 
Analysis of the comminution testwork data and comminution modelling were carried out in order to determine optimum SAG and
ball mill sizes for various grinding scenarios, whereby ore hardness, throughput and final grind size are varied within a design
envelope. Based on the simulations conducted, the SAG mill and ball mill were sized as shown in Table 1.2. This sizing was
based on design ore (A x b of 30.4, BWI of 15.7), nominal throughput of 381 t/h nominal grind of 90 µm SAG mill power of 85% of
maximum and Ball mill power of 82.5% of maximum.

1.5.2 Gravity Separation of Gravity Recoverable Gold
 
Five (5) Composite samples were subjected to testwork with the goal of measuring their gravity recoverable gold (GRG) content.
Modeling was then performed using the results of this testwork to predict the gold recovery that may be expected from this ore in a
gravity concentration circuit. Based on the results of the modeling it was decided that two (2) Knelson XD-48 units would be used,
having the capacity to process a total of 600 t/h. Furthermore, considering the marked effect of grind size on GRG recovery, a grind
having a P80 of 90 microns was the selected grind. This grind was also found to provide good flotation recoveries. It was estimated
that gold recovery in gravity would be in the order of 34.8%. This value was used in the process flowsheet mass balance.
 
1.5.3 Flotation
 
In addition to flotation testing undertaken for PFS, a series of batch and locked cycle tests were performed in order to determine
optimum conditions for a flotation pilot plant. Grind size, reagents and circuit configuration were investigated.
 
1.5.3.1 Pilot Plant for the Production of Albion Feed
 
A flotation pilot plant was carried out on approximately 8.6 tonnes of ore from the Joanna deposit. The objectives of the pilot plant
were to see if results previously obtained at a laboratory scale could be replicated on a larger scale, and to produce a relatively
large  quantity  of  representative  concentrate  for  feed  to  pilot  scale  Albion  testwork.  The  average  Au  recovery    achieved  in  the
flotation pilot plant was 90.7% with a weight recovery of 4.33% at a grind of 77 µm. The results show that the final concentrate %S
was well controlled at the target of 15%.

1.5.3.2 Pilot Plant for the Production of POX Feed
 
Following the decision to adopt the POX process for oxidation, a second pilot scale production run was undertaken to produce
concentrate for subsequent POX testwork. The flowsheet used for this POX flotation pilot plant was similar to the flowsheet used for
the Albion flotation pilot plant, with the exception that in the latter, the second cleaner was removed.
 
The ore for the production of the concentrate for POX development was derived from drill core material (DC) and from reverse
circulation material (RC). These were processed separately.The average combined gold recovery for gravity and flotation for the
DC material was 88.8%, while that of the RC was 92.3%.
 
1.5.3.3 Flotation Circuit Design
 
Data from the pilot testwork as well as from the batch flotation locked cycle tests was used to develop the design criteria for the
flotation circuit. The flotation circuit design consists of a rougher stage comprised of mechanical tank cells, a cleaner column and a
cleaner scavenger column with residence times of 37 minutes, 13 minutes and 8 minutes respectively.

1.5.4 Sulphide Oxidation by POX
 
During  the  course  of  the  Feasibility  Study,  it  was  decided  that  the  Albion  Process,  previously  adopted  in  the  PFS,  should  be
replaced  by  the  POX  process  for  ore  oxidation.  Aurizon  Mines  mandated  Sherritt  Technologies  to  conduct  the  testwork  and
develop the POX area of the processing plant.
 
The concentrates generated from the flotation pilot plant treating the RC and DC material were treated separately in the POX pilot
plant. Gold extraction for the RC concentrate was typically between 88 to 90%, whereas for the DC concentrate, gold extraction
was between 93 to 94%. In both cases, lower gold extractions were obtained in cyanide leaching of the solids from continuous test
solids than those obtained in the batch test program. Based on the results from this testwork, it was concluded that plant design
should  be  based  on  a  75-minute  retention  time  and  220ºC  autoclave  operating  temperature.  For  the  purpose  of  the  FS,  the
autoclave was designed to treat up to 3.85t/h of sulphur, which corresponds to the nominal feed flow to the autoclave at the 80th
percentile sulphur head grade.
 
The oxygen required for the POX process will be generated on-site using a vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) plant at a
purity of 92.5%. The autoclave is designed to operate at 3 MPa and 220ºC, and have a residence time of 75 minutes.
 
1.5.5 Cyanidation
 
The design of the cyanide leaching circuit was based on a CIP-type circuit as no “preg-robbing” behavior was exhibited in the
leaching tests on the pilot plant samples. The residence time in the cyanide leaching portion of the circuit was selected to be 48
hours.  The  Pumpcell  technology  by  Kemix  was  selected  for  use  as  the  activated  carbon  adsorption  portion  of  the  circuit.  This
technology allows the circuit to be operated in a carousel mode.
 
1.5.6 Thickening
Five (5) thickeners are included in the design: one (1) each for the flotation concentrate and tailings and three (3) for the POX area,
(one (1) in neutralization, and two (2) for counter current  decantation). The sizing of the thickeners was based on settling testwork
performed on samples of each of the materials to be thickened.

1.5.7 Cyanide Destruction
 
Various cyanide destruction options, including Caro’s acid, SO2/Air and CombinOx processes were investigated on a laboratory
scale for treatment of slurry effluent samples from the Joanna Project. Performance and reagent consumption data for each process
were compared using a weak acid dissociable cyanide (CNWAD) treatment target of 20 ppm or less, while also recognizing the 20
ppm total cyanide (CNT) limit. OPEX and CAPEX estimates were prepared by Cyanco for the three (3) processes based on the
results of the testwork. The SO2/Air process was recommended by Cyanco because, although it was the least economical in terms
of OPEX, it had a much lower CAPEX than the other processes. For plant design, the SO2/Air system was designed with a
residence time of 4 hrs.
 
1.5.8 Gold Recovery
 
By consolidating the gold recoveries for the individual process areas, the overall gold recovery at nominal conditions, and an
average LOM gold head grade of 1.25 g/t was estimated to be in the order of 87.5%.
 
1.6             Mineral Resources
 
This Feasibility Study only considers resources classified as reserves for the Hosco deposit. It should be understood that mineral
resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
The updated mineral resources for the Hosco deposit are shown in Table 1.3.

1.8             Mining Methods
 
The ore of the Joanna Hosco deposit will be mined using conventional open-pit mining methods based on a truck/shovel operation.
The open-pit operation will be designed to support an average daily production rate of 8,500 tonnes, seven (7) days a week, 365
days per year. The ore will be trucked to surface using the ramp, crushed and conveyed to the processing plant.
 
Waste rock consists of material containing 0.3 g/t Au or less. The waste rock will be disposed of within two (2) separate stockpiles
given environmental considerations. The majority of the waste material, approximately 90%, will be stockpiled in the main waste
dump and does not require any special environmental considerations. The remaining 10% consists of waste material which could
leach arsenic, and requires environmental protection measures. Overburden material will be removed during the first four (4) years
of operation, and will be stored in a separate area.

The mining equipment fleet consists of up to 10 (ten), 100-short ton class haulage trucks, two (2) drill rigs, two (2) 10 m3 hydraulic
excavators, one (1) front-end loader, two (2) dozers, one (1) motor grader, one (1) backhoe excavator and auxiliary equipment. All
equipment is assumed to be purchased as new by Aurizon Mines.
 
1.9             Recovery Methods and Processing Plant Design
 
The metallurgical testwork for the Hosco deposit performed during this Study allowed for the development of the process mass and
water balances. These were used to develop the process plant design. The plant is required to process a nominal flow of 8,500
tonnes per calendar day or 3.1 Mt/y. The hourly flow rates for the plant were evaluated based on an overall plant utilization of 85%,
with the exception of the crusher, which was assumed to have a 65% utilization rate. The main process areas are the following:
 
▪     Crushing;
 
▪     Grinding (including gravity gold concentration);
 
▪ Flotation;
 
▪ Pressure oxidation;
 
▪ Cyanide leaching;
▪ CIP (activated carbon adsorption);
 
▪ Carbon stripping and regeneration;
 
▪ Electrowinning and Casting.
 
For the purposes of the FS, the weight recovery in the flotation stage was assumed to be 5%, representing the amount of material to
be treated in the POX and cyanide leaching stages. Flotation tails represent 95% of the ROM and are sent directly to tails.
 
Based on metallurgical testing, a gold recovery of 87.5% was assumed for the purposes of the FS. Based on an average head
grade of 1.26 g/t, the annual gold production will be 109,237 oz/y.
 
Based on this information, the process design criteria and mechanical equipment list were developed and used as the basis of the
capital and operating cost estimates.

1.10             Environment
 
1.10.1 Jurisdictions and Applicable Laws and Regulations
 
The evaluation process and review of environmental impacts will apply. For the Joanna Project, it is assumed that public hearings
will be required given the relative proximity of a biodiversity reserve and residential areas, and the fact that environmental groups
have raised concerns about an open-pit operation in the mining industry. It should be noted that Aurizon Mines Ltd. has already
initiated active and participative discussions with local and regional stakeholders and that such an approach will be continuing as
the project progresses. This approach aims at establishing and maintaining a sustainable dialogue with stakeholders in order to
identify  specific  issues  associated  with  the  Project.  A  period  of  about  20  months  is  anticipated  for  the  preparation  of  the
Environmental Impact Assessment and obtaining the government decision. Within the context of the current Study, fish habitat was
not  considered  a  trigger  for  the  federal  environmental  review  procedure  considering  project-specific  characteristics  and  their
potential impacts on the receiving environment.
 
1.10.2 Environmental Permitting
 
Once  the  Project  will  have  undergone  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  be  authorized  by  the  Government  pursuant  to
Section  31.5  of  the  Act,  it  would  still  be  subject  to  Section  22  of  the  EQA  and  must  therefore  obtain  a  general  certificate  of
authorization. The issuance of that authorization, however, should only be a formality as the certificate issued pursuant to Section
31.5 of the Act binds the Minister as to where he exercises the powers provided in Section 22. In addition to the certificate of
authorization required under Section 22 of the Environment Quality Act, the proponent must obtain various permits, authorizations,
approvals, certificates and leases required from the appropriate authorities. The authorization application and permitting process is
expected to take one year. Applications may be filed concurrently with the construction work and should not therefore impact the
critical project schedule.
 
1.10.3 Environmental Baseline Studies
 
Several  comprehensive  assessments  were  performed  from  2007  to  now  in  order  to  define,  in  compliance  with  all  applicable
guidelines,  policies,  regulations  and  laws  in  Quebec  and  Canada,  the  state  of  reference  of  the  Joanna  Project  receiving
environment. A review of all existing  information on local topography, regional hydrography (watershed) and geomorphology was
done in order to precisely define the physical context in which the Joanna Project will be implemented.
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
In order to characterize the groundwater flow regime, detailed geotechnical and hydrogeological studies were conducted as part of
the project in the pit area, and at the sites where the development of associated mining infrastructure is foreseen. The modeling
results indicated that a maximum rate of 8,100 m³/d should be maintained for operation of the mine. The radius of influence of the
dewatering activities will potentially affect up to approximately 1 km from the pit limits. According to the results of the hydrogeology
study performed in 2010 and 2012, the operation of the Joanna mine should not impact residential water wells in the area, in terms
of either water supply or quality. Moreover, groundwater quality and level will be monitored to ensure residential wells are not
affected by mining operations.
 
A  study  area  covering  the  entire  Property  was  established  in  order  to  assess  biological  conditions  prevailing  prior  to  the
implementation of the Project. A vast review of all existing information on wildlife in the study area was also completed. Additional
field surveys were done to precisely map all fish habitats within the Property limits.
 
A comprehensive Fisheries and Fish Habitats Assessment Program was performed to precisely locate all sections of the Stitchman
Creek and its affluents, which are to be considered as fish habitats according to Canada’s Fisheries Act. The objective of such
work was to limit the ecological footprint of the Project to areas located out of those habitats. None of the Stitchman Creek and its
affluents hosts fish species of importance to any ongoing productivity of commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fisheries.
 
1.10.4 Tailings Characteristics and Management
 
Ore processing includes the flotation of sulphides associated with gold and aims to produce a sulphide concentrate. It also involves
treating  sulphide  concentrates  by  way  of  cyanidation  to  recover  gold.  For  the  Joanna  Project,  the  objective  is  to  incorporate
environmental protection measures in a context of sustainable development as soon as the initial phase of the Project is complete.
It has therefore been decided to manage tailings separately. The goal is to produce  desulphurized tailings through step flotation of
sulphides (~95% of tailings). The other type of tailings (~5% of tailings) is leachable and requires protective measures specified
under Directive 019. Consequently, two tailings management facilities (TMF) will be constructed on site.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
1.10.5 Waste Rock, Overburden and Top Soil Management
 
According to the waste rock geochemical characterization results, the wacke, conglomerate and mafic intrusions are low-risk under
Directive  019  and  account  for  about  85-90%  of  all  waste  rocks,  whereas  the  amphibolites  and  the  Cadillac  Fault  rocks  are
considered leachable for arsenic and represent about 10-15% of all the waste rocks. Waste rocks will therefore be stockpiled into
separate  piles.  The  area  where  the  leachable  waste  rock  is  stockpiled  will  be  protected  with  a  geo-membrane  to  prevent
groundwater contamination. A low-grade ore stockpile will be set up near the crusher site and will be protected similarly to the
leachable  waste  rock  stockpile.  Topsoil  and  overburden  that  is  removed  to  allow  for  pit  operations  will  be  stockpiled  into  two
separate piles and used for site restoration.
 
1.10.6 Site Geotechnical Assessment
 
Site Geotechnical Assessment works identified the presence of materials such as surface organic soil; cohesive soils; granular
soils; and bedrock (from 0 to almost 30m deep). The northwestern extremity of the Hosco area is preferable for the construction of
buildings  with  superficial  foundations  as  the  presence  of  rock  close  to  the  surface  would  allow  for  heavy  loads  such  as  those
associated with mill, crusher and other similar buildings.
 
Preliminary analysis at the Hosco and West pits indicates that excavation slopes (in overburden) should be within 1.0V: 4.0H and
1.0V: 5.5H depending on their location. A more specific analysis will be required to further specify the pit slopes. Many areas were
considered to locate the TMFs: the western part of the Property was selected for the Flotation TMF and an area located directly to
the north of the Hydro-Quebec power lines for the POX TMF.
 
1.10.7 Water Management Plan
 
All mine infrastructures are located within only one sub-watershed, namely the Stitchman Creek. No water discharge is located
outside  the  Stitchman  Sub-Watershed.  The  effluent  of  the  Process  Water  Polishing  Pond  is  considered  as  the  final  effluent
following  Québec’s Directive  019.  The  final  effluent  will  comply  with  all  provincial  (Directive  019)  and  federal  (CCME,  MMER)
criteria/guidelines. Two (2) water treatment units will be implemented – one at the outlet of the POX TMF and another at the outlet
of the Process Water Pond – to make sure their effluent complies with all applicable criteria/guidelines.
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Three other water discharges were also considered (Topsoil, Overburden and Main Waste Rock piles). It is planned to collect
water  running  off  of  the  As-Ni  Waste  Rock  Pile,  the  Ore  Stockpile  and  the  Mill  Area  by  pumping  them  from  a  collecting  basin
towards the Process Water Pond. Mine water will be pumped to the Process Water Pond. Water from the Flotation TMF Pond will
be recirculated to the mill. All water accumulated in the Process Water Pond and that will not have been recirculated to the mill will
be discharged with the final effluent following treatment.
 
1.10.8 Rehabilitation and Mine Closure Plan
 
The main objective of mine site rehabilitation is to restore the site to a satisfactory condition by: a) eliminating unacceptable health
hazards  and  ensuring  public  safety;  b)  limiting  the  production  and  circulation  of  substances  that  could  damage  the  receiving
environment and, in the long-term, trying to eliminate maintenance and monitoring; c) restoring the site to a condition in which it is
visually acceptable to the community; and, d) reclaiming the areas where infrastructures are located (excluding the accumulation
areas) for future use. The mine site rehabilitation plan focuses on land reclamation, reclamation of waste dumps, tailings areas and
water basins, and surface drainage patterns to prevent erosion. The successful completion of a rehabilitation plan will ensure that
the project results in a minimum of disturbance. Site inspections and monitoring (physical stability, geotechnical, environmental,
agronomic) will be carried out before the property is retroceded to the Government. The rehabilitation concept for the current project
complies with the requirements set out in the Guidelines for Preparing a Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan and General Mining Site
Rehabilitation Requirements and current legislation.

1.11             Capital and Operating Costs
 
The total initial capital cost, including direct costs, indirect costs and contingency has been estimated to be in the order of $422.2M,
as  indicated  in  Table  1.5.  Mining  costs  include  costs  of  pre-stripping  of  waste  and  overburden,  required  as  part  of  the  mine
construction phase, which have been estimated at $21.8M. To support continued operations, sustaining capital required over the
life of the operation has been estimated to be in the vicinity of $70.2M. An additional amount estimated by Roche in the order of
$27.1M is expected to be put in escrow for site closure and restoration related to the permanent closure of waste rock stockpiles
and tailings ponds. Of this amount, $20.3M will be deposited during the initial period. The total of Sustaining Capital plus Closure
and Rehabilitation Costs is in the order of $97.3M.

1.12             Economic Analysis
 
The economic evaluation of the Joanna Gold Project was performed by BBA using the discounted cash flow model on a before-tax
basis. The Net Present Value (NPV), based on a discounting rate of 0% and 5% (base case) resulting from the net cash flow
generated by the Project, was calculated. The payback period is also indicated as a financial measure. A discount rate is applied to
the cash flow to arrive at a NPV and payback period. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 1.7. It was found that the
pre-tax net NPV at a 5% discounting rate is 112M$, and the pre-tax IRR is 8.7%.
 
The following assumptions were made for the financial analysis:
 
▪      A production life of 13.4 years for the Hosco deposit, based on the resource estimate;
 
▪  A gold price of $1350/oz based on a 36 month moving average to the end of May 2012;
 
▪   Production startup 44 months after initiation of environmental permitting process;
 
▪   No escalation or inflation factor has been taken into account (constant 2012 $);
 
▪   US Dollar at par with Canadian Dollar.

1.13             Conclusions
 
Based on the overall results obtained in this Feasibility Study, the following conclusions can be drawn.
 
▪The Joanna Project Hosco deposit consists of a low grade, arsenic bearing refractory gold mineralization.
 
▪Mining at a rate of 8,500 t/d classifies this operation as a low tonnage operation.
 
▪Ore processing requires crushing, grinding, gravity, flotation, pressure oxidation, cyanide leaching and CIP gold extraction.
 
▪The arsenic content of the ore has significant repercussions on environmental management, namely in the design of the higher
grade arsenic bearing waste rock and tailings. This also adds to the complexity of managing water and effluent on site. Despite
incorporating diligent design techniques to minimize environmental risks, the mere presence of arsenic bearing waste rock and
tailings on site may affect the Environmental Permitting process.
▪The pre-production (initial) capital cost for the Project was estimated at $422.2M. Site closure and restoration costs were estimated
at $27.1M. Sustaining capital required over the life of the operation has been estimated to be in the order of $70.2M.
▪The average operating cash cost is estimated at US$716 per ounce of gold and $25.32 per tonne milled. This excludes
transportation, refining and royalties.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
▪The financial analysis, using a price of gold of US$1,350 per ounce indicates a pre-tax Net Present Value ("NPV") (using a 5%
discount rate) of $112 million with a pre-tax internal rate of return ("IRR") of 8.7%. The undiscounted payback period is 8.2 years.
The results of the Feasibility Study indicate that, although Project economics are positive (based on the financial assumptions
used), the potential financial returns are however marginal and small fluctuations in gold price (and to a lesser extent capital and
operating costs) can significantly impact the economic viability of the Project.
 
At this time, given the exploration potential elsewhere on the property, Aurizon Mines may want to consider further development of
the Heva deposit and evaluate if a joint Hosco/Heva mining operation would improve project economics. Furthermore, considering
that the Environmental Permitting process for this Project may be more complex and longer than planned, Aurizon Mines may want
to  consider  proceeding  with  the  obtention  of  permits  and  authorizations  for  the  Project  so  that,  if  and  when  project  economics
become more favorable, they can proceed quickly with its execution.

4  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
 
4.1 Location
 
The  Joanna  property  is  situated  in  the  Joannes  Township,  Province  of  Québec,  20  km  east  of  Rouyn-Noranda  and  five
(5) kilometres northeast of the municipal airport, proximal to Highway 117 between Rouyn-Noranda and Val d’Or (Figure 4.1). The
Property is accessible via a gravel road to the covered shaft collar of the old Hosco mine. Some concrete foundations remain as
evidence of the previous mining activities. The north-south gravel road crosses a railway line that runs east-west. The railway line
does not pass over any previously identified gold mineralization. The Project is located on the NTS sheet 32D02.

4.2 Property Description, Ownership and Agreements
 
As of July 2012, the Property consists of three separate blocks without inclusions, totalling 156 claims covering 4,294 ha. The main
claim block, which hosts the Hosco, Heva, and Alexandria (Figure 4.2) deposits, is located in the Joannes Township. The two (2)
other claim blocks are situated in the Bousquet Township, east of the main block, in the so-called Bousquet sector (Figure 4.3). The
project area extends east-west for more than 12 km and reaches 3 km in the north-south direction.
The Joannes Township claim block comprises a total of 118 claims covering 3,690 ha. The claim block is composed as follows:
The original 67 claims (with the old Hosco mine and parts of the old Heva mine) were optioned in 2006; three (3) claims from a
private owner, the 20 Henriksen claims, the two (2) Vantex claims (with the rest of the old Heva mine) acquired in 2007; and the
19 Alexandria claims optioned in 2008. In May 2009, Aurizon acquired another six (6) claims from a private owner. Finally, one
(1) claim was acquired from a private owner in March 2010.
The claim blocks located in the Bousquet Township are composed of 30 claims covering 480 ha for the West Block and eight
(8) claims covering 124 ha for the East Block. The Bousquet Township claims were acquired by staking in May 2009.
The  Property  is  adjacent  to  a  biodiversity  reserve  located  just  south  of  the  Joannes  Township  claim  block,  which  has  been
excluded for exploration and mining activities. Gescad Inc. manages the mining titles for Aurizon and generates an update on the
titles each month. All statutory work and tax payments are in good standing. A detailed listing of the Joanna property claims is
included in Table 4.1.

Details of the legal agreements are available upon request at Aurizon Mines office. As per conversation with management, all
payments and obligations of Aurizon to third parties are in good standing.
4.3 Royalties Obligations
 
As described in Section 4.2, the Property is subject to four separate royalties. The first concerns the 67 original Joanna claims
where a 2% NSR is retained by 90569 Canada Inc. for 1.5% and 0.5% to Iamgold Corporation. The mineral reserves associated
with the Hosco deposit are located within this 67 claim block. The second royalty related to the 20 Henriksen claims where Crus
Tal Exploration has rights to 2% NSR. The third royalty is a 2.5% NSR retained by Resources Vantex for 1.5% and private owners
for 1% on the two (2) Vantex claims where 0.75% of the Vantex Royalty can be repurchased by Aurizon for $500,000. The last
royalty  concerns  the  19  Alexandria  claims  where  private  owners  have  rights  to  2%  NSR  in  addition  to  a  2%  gross  overriding
receipts royalty on diamonds (on 13 claims). Aurizon has an option to buy back 1% of the NSR for $2 million.
4.4 Permits and Environmental Liabilities
 
Aurizon is conducting exploration work under valid intervention permits delivered by the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et
Faune  (“MRNF”)  which  are  renewed  by  the  MRNF  before  each  exploration  campaign.  Aurizon  received  a  Certificate  of
Authorization  from  the  Ministère  du  Développement  Durable,  de  l’Environnement  et  des  Parcs  du  Québec  (“MDDEP”)  for  the
construction of access roads in poorly drained areas which represent 75% of the property surface.
According to MRNF, there are no environmental liabilities related to the historical mining operations at Hosco and Heva due to the
fact  that  there  was  no  mineral  processing  and/or  waste  disposal  facilities  at  the  Property.  There  are  no  other  environmental
liabilities pertaining to the Property according to Aurizon management.

5  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
 
5.1 Physiography
 
The  topography  of  the  area  is  generally  flat  with  a  gentle  downward  slope  toward  the  north.  The  land  drainage  patterns  flow
westward by small creeks. Outcrops occur north and mainly south of the main mineralization corridor observed on the Property.
The overburden consists of glacial-fluvial till and lacustrine deposits and is generally less than 15 m thick. Elevation in the area
averages 310 m above sea level.
Vegetation  of  the  surrounding  area  is  characterized  by  grassy  swamps  in  topographic  lows,  mainly  to  the  north  and  trembling
aspens and balsam poplars in forested areas. Formations of balsam fir trees in pure settlements or associated white spruce and, to
a lesser extent, black spruce are also present on the Property. Most of the mineralized zones do not outcrop and are situated under
swampy terrain.
5.2 Accessibility
 
The Joanna project is located in the Joannes and Bousquet Townships in the Province of Québec. It is situated 20 km east of the
city of Rouyn-Noranda, just north of Highway 117. In the Joannes Township, the Property is accessible via a gravel road to the
covered old shaft collar of the Hosco mine. In the Bousquet Township, the side road to St Norbert du Mont-Brun and the Doyon
mine crosses the Property. The Property is well located regarding access (air, road, and train), electricity, water and manpower.
5.3 Climate
 
The climatic data used to characterize the sector under study comes from the meteorological station of Val-d’Or, Québec. These
observations  were  carried  out  during  1961-1991.  Exploration  work  in  the  area  can  typically  be  carried  out  year-round  but  soft
ground in the areas covered by wetlands creates difficult working conditions from late spring until early winter.
In  the  Val-d’Or  region,  the  average  daily  temperature  is  slightly  above  the  freezing  point,  i.e.  1.6°C.  The  average  temperature
during July reaches 17°C, while the temperature in January falls to -16°C.
July 2012
5-1
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Precipitation averages 928 mm of water annually in the area. Average monthly precipitation ranges from 48 mm in February to
103 mm in September. Snow falls from October to April, but is much more significant from November to March. The average for
these five months is 26 mm using a snow to water conversion factor. The pH of the precipitations measured at the Joutel station in
1991 varies from 4.30 in November to 4.78 in June.
 
The anemometric data collected in Val d’Or between 1961 and 1991 indicates that from June to January, the southwest winds are
dominant, whereas from February to May, the northwest winds are more frequent. In this sector, the winds have an average velocity
varying between 11 and 14 km/h.
5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructures
 
The regional resources regarding labour force, supplies and equipment, are sufficient, the area being well served by geological
and mining service firms. The city of Rouyn-Noranda, with more than 40,000 citizens, is a regional center for the Western Abitibi
region  and  has  the  necessary  infrastructures  and  workforce  to  support  a  mining  operation.  While  there  is  currently  a  general
shortage of qualified personnel in the mining and exploration sector, the location of the Project is favourable in that regard. The
area is traditionally a mining area with several operating mines and active exploration companies. All major services are available
in Rouyn-Noranda and Val d’Or.
The existing infrastructures on the Joanna property consist mainly in an access gravel road from Highway 117 which leads to the
site near the old shaft collar of the Hosco mine. Some concrete foundations remain as witness of the past mining operations. The
existing inclined shaft and ramp could be used to perform underground exploration activity although there is no indication at this
stage  that  their  integrity  would  allow  it.  The  north-south  gravel  road  crosses  an  east-west  railway  which  is  not  located  on  the
identified  gold  mineralization.  A  recently  refurbished  local  electrical  distribution  is  available  at  the  former  Hosco  shaft  from  the
power line on the nearby Highway 117. A 120 kV power line passes 2.7 km north of the Hosco deposit.

6 HISTORY
 
Reference to the mineral resource and mineral reserves reported in this section is provided only to comply with the requirement in
NI  43-101  to  provide  such  historical  information  on  the  Property  and  such  estimates  should  not  be  relied  upon.  Readers  are
cautioned that these estimates pre-date NI 43-101 and are not comparable to estimates prepared in accordance with the mineral
resource and mineral reserves categories required by NI 43-101.  Neither Aurizon nor the authors of this Report have verified any
of the data upon which such estimates were based. Original numbers stated in imperial units have been converted to the metric
system for comparative purpose.
6.1 Hosco
 
The following is a summary of the exploration work history compiled for the Hosco sector of the Property.
The principal source of the historical information for the Hosco sector is Descarreaux (1985). The Hosco sector of the Property has
been  explored  over  the  last  sixty  years  by  various  owners  and  optionees.  A  summary  of  the  historical  exploration  work  is  as
follows:
1944-1945: Hosco Gold Mines did a magnetic survey and 81 diamond drillholes totalling approximately 20,000 m.
1946:Sinking of an inclined shaft (55°) to a vertical depth of 131 m. Three underground levels opened, i.e. 40 m, 80 m and 120 m.
1946-
1947:
Drifting and crosscutting on the three levels, i.e. 95 m on level 40, 1042 m on level 80 and 1262  m on level 120 for a
total of 2399 m.
1948-
1949:
Production at a rate of 100 tpd. A total of 45,872 t grading 6.58 g/t Au was extracted from nice (9) shrinkage stopes and
milled at the nearby mill of McWatters Gold Mines Ltd. Mill head grade was 4.90 g/t Au.

7  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION
 
7.1 Geological Setting
 
The  following  information  is  based  on  observations  by  Aurizon  geologists  and  contract  geologists  involved  in  field  work  and
petrographic studies, which were supervised by Martin Demers P.Geo, Exploration Manager of Aurizon and Qualified Person on
the project.
7.1.1  Regional Geology
 
The Joanna property (formerly Hosco-Heva-Alexandria) is situated in Joannes Township in the south central portion of the Abitibi
Greenstone Belt, within the Superior structural province of the Canadian Shield. All rocks are Archean in age except for the late
crosscutting  Proterozoic  diabase  dykes.  A  wide  variety  of  syn-volcanic  to  late  tectonic  intrusive  rocks  of  intermediate  to  felsic
composition occur throughout the region, forming large batholiths or minor intrusions controlled by regional faults.
The Rouyn-Noranda mining district is well known for its polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphides deposits associated with the
Blake River Group but several gold-only deposits in the immediate vicinity of the Cadillac Break have been defined over the years.
Thick sequences of Archean lavas of the Blake River Group yield ages between 2703 and 2696 Ma (Mortensen, 1993; Lafrance et
al.,  2005).  The  recent  isotopic  data  coupled  with  stratigraphic  relationships  suggest  that  the  various  formations  composing  the
Blake River Group do not represent a simple stratigraphic pile, but rather different geographically isolated, synchronous volcanic
complexes (Lafrance et al., 2005). Volcanism in this area tends to be bimodal, demonstrated by successions of mafic and felsic
lavas with affinities varying between tholeiitic and calcalkaline. Pyroclastic equivalents of mafic to felsic lavas occur intercalated
with massive flows.
Younger flysh-type sediments, such as the Cadillac and Kewagama group, are about 10 million years younger than the youngest
volcanic units (Gouthier. 2007). They sit on top of volcanic units and form continuous units, generally in an East-West direction.
Locally,  younger  fluviatile  sedimentary  sequences  dated  between  2679  and  2673  Ma,  such  as  the  Temiskaming  group,  are
developed within basins closely associated to the regional faults (Mueller et al, 1996).Volcanic and sedimentary assemblages are
tightly folded and cut by major E-W and NW-SE faults developing a regional losangic or lenticular shaped pattern with mostly sub-
vertical north or south dip. Regional deformation is generally expressed by an east-west, steeply dipping schistosity, sub-parallel to
the main folds axial plan. On a regional scale, fold axis tend to be sub-horizontal but can also be more vertical within the major fault
corridors (Daigneault et al, 2002).

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The  main  structural  feature  of  the  region  is  the  Cadillac  or  Cadillac-Larder  Break.  It  is  a  large-scale,  regional  tectonic  feature
extending  for  200  km  from  Kirkland  Lake,  Ontario  to  Val  d’Or,  Quebec  bordering  the  Abitibi  Greenstone  Beltto  the  south.  The
structure  is  divided  in  different  branches  forming  a  succession  of  a  few  metres  to  a  few  hundred  metres  wide  heterogeneous,
ductile  deformation  zones  dipping  northward  with  main  decollement  following  volcanic-sediments  and  ultramafic  units  contacts
inside  various  stratigraphic  units.  A  strong  carbonate  and  micas  alteration  track  the  deformation  intensity.  Late  brittle-ductile
expression of the fault corresponds to talc, chlorite-carbonate schist, or tectonic breccias.
Metamorphism  varies  from  sub-greenschist  to  greenschist  facies  throughout  the  region  and  increases  quickly  to  amphibolites
facies immediately south of the Cadillac Break in the Pontiac Sub-Province.
A number of gold showings occur in the region typically associated with the Cadillac Break. The previously mined McWatters Mine
and  O’Brien  Mine  located  respectively  10  km  west  and  50  km  east  of  the  Joanna  property  are  previously  known  as  the  most
significant deposits of the area with past production of approximately 1 million ounces of gold. These mineralized occurrences
which are classified as orogenic, are characterized by narrow, discontinuous, syn-tectonic quartz veins mostly conformable with
structural  grain.  Gold  bearing  alteration  halos  are  prominent  with  strong  replacement  by  biotite,  albite  and  locally
tourmaline.  Disseminated arsenopyrite is the main gold carrier in this environment.
7.1.2  Property Geology
 
The east-west striking zone favourable for gold mineralization is closely related to the Cadillac fault, which dips 55o to the north in
this  area.    According  to  traditional  nomenclature  it  is  underlain  from  south  to  north  by  rocks  of  the  Pontiac,  Temiskaming  and
Cadillac groups.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The complete sedimentary sequence cut by exploration works is composed of poorly graded greywacke interbedded with a main
matrix-supported polymict conglomerate unit historically related to the Temiskaming Group depositional environment.
The east-west striking zone favourable for gold mineralization is closely related to the Cadillac Fault, which dips 55 degrees to the
north in this area. The main 10 to 20 metres-wide brittle structure, composed essentially of chloritic schist, is included in a much
broader ductile deformation zone that goes from about 100 metres north of the fault to more than 500 metres south of it. In general,
the  principal  foliation  is  conformable  to  the  fault  zone  and  bedding.    A  tight  asymmetric  folding  pattern  with  fold  hinges  gently
plunging toward the west is developed in conglomerate units south of the fault.Deformation within the sediments can be difficult to
evaluate  as  a  result  of  re-crystallization  of  some  minerals  at  superior  greenschist  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism.    Some
sediment  intervals  show  mineral  segregation  in  a  tectonic  fabric  and  sulfides  remobilization  along  foliation  planes  indicating  a
strong  ductile  deformation  level.  Vein  folding  and  orientation  within  the  different  types  of  zone  suggest  a  gradual  decrease  in
deformation intensity from the Cadillac Fault to the south.
The Cadillac Group, as described in literature by a facies succession of greywacke with mud rock and iron formation units (reef),
has yet to be interpreted on the property and its limit is suspected to be located farther north toward the Blake River Group limit. A
few diabase dykes also cut the host sedimentary rocks with a kilometric spacing. Figure 7.1 shows the geology in the immediate
Property area (taken from Aurizon Mines Ltd., Annual Information Report 2010, see References).

7.2 Mineralization
 
Gold mineralization of the Hosco-Heva area is distributed in multiple lenses on both sides of the Cadillac Fault, making each one a
few metres to a few tens-of-metres thick. To date, mineralization has only been identified in the Fault zone. The more continuous
and gold-rich zones seem to be associated with a silica-biotite, albite and tourmaline alteration.  Mineral assemblage also includes
variable concentrations of white mica, chlorite carbonate, garnet and possibly other alumino-silicates.  Amphibole and tourmaline
rich replacement zones have been locally identified. In the Heva zone, gold mineralization contoured this type of alteration zone.
Mineralized lenses are included within a 100 to 190 metre wide lower grade halo of 0.5 to 2.0 grams per tonne.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Generally speaking, most of the zones look alike in terms of structure and mineralization, some differentiate slightly by the content
in quartz veins (millimetric to centimetric), arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and pyrite but currently they are believed to be all related to the
same geological event with variations in the alteration assemblages and degree of deformation. Narrow, widely spaced, quartz
veins with higher grades have been intersected on the Heva side and immediately south of the Hosco Zone.
Gold is concentrated in different locations closely related to sulphides grains and is mostly fine grain (<20 micro metres). According
to  different  petrographic  and  micro-analytical  studies  performed  on  rock  samples  and  on  a  sulphide  concentrate  sample,  the
majority of gold weight is under the form of free or attached particles to the surface of sulphides grains. A fraction of gold including
sub-microns particles and ionic gold is concentrated in some types of arsenopyrite grains (taken from Aurizon Mines Ltd., Annual
Information Report 2010, see References).
7.2.1  Hosco
 
Gold in the Hosco deposit is closely associated to sulphides and alteration mineral distribution indicating at first view the prime of
hydrothermal  reaction  with  hosted  sediments.  The  microscopic  in-situ  observation  of  gold  particles  or  concentrations  in  many
alteration contexts and gold enrichment levels suggested that the sulphidation process was the main process involved in the gold
precipitation process.
Gold in the deposit is mostly microscopic with a few occurrences of coarser, sub-millimetric particles. Thin section and sulphide
concentrates microscopic observation returned a majority of very fine grain particle (average of 8 µm in the concentrate) and about
30%  of  gold  weight  is  evaluated  to  be  under  a  colloidal  or  solution  state  in  sulphides  grains.  In-situ  measurement  of  gold
concentration in individual sulphide grains by SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) returned gold concentrations at different
levels in all groups of sulphides. The maximum average gold grade was obtained in coarse arsenopyrite with 80 g/t. On the other
hand, pyrite and pyrrhotite contain about 1 g/t gold (SGS Lakefield 2008).
July 2012
7-5
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Apparent zoning of sulphide assemblages across the deposit seems to be related to the fault position. Pyrrhotite, which covers the
whole deposit, is mostly concentrated at both edges of the mineralized system with a strong concentration inside the ductile portion
of the fault zone. The main concentration of arsenopyrite is located inside a few ten to hundred meters south of the fault where the
most  consistent  grades  are  found.  Pyrite,  usually  unnoticeable,  is  restricted  to  a  narrow  portion  of  the  mineralized  system
immediately south of the fault. According to micro-textures, all sulphides are contemporaneous.
Many  factors  had  probably  interacted  to  explain  zoning  and  gold  location  from  a  late  tectonic  and  syn-metamorphic  peek
metallogeny. For example, alteration, deformation and vein density will influence the porosity and volume of potentially mineralized
fluid in circulation.  Location of high grade intersections in strongly altered and laminated host sections support this assertion. Also,
chemical gradients such as pH, sulphur and arsenic availability in the mineralized environment possibly influenced gold expulsion
from sulphide structures and prevented a more complete absorption of gold by the arsenopyrite crystalline structure. Figure 7.2
shows the sulphide distribution across a conceptual profile of the Hosco mineralized zone (Renou, 2009).
Figure 7.2 : Sulphide Distribution Across a Conceptual Profile of the Hosco Mineralized Zone (Taken from Renou, 2009)
Historical work focused on separating and labelling the narrow but high grade lenses developed immediately south of the fault.
These  high  grade  zones  are  found  within  the  new  zones  defined  by  the  2007-2009  Aurizon  drilling  campaign.  The  latter  was
executed with the objective of defining larger mineralized zones and evaluating the open pit potential of lower grade and higher
tonnage material. The mineralized corridor extends along a 2,450 m east-west trend and can be followed down to a depth of 400 m.
Mineralized zones within that corridor dip by 50° to 65° to the north with a western plunge. They can be discriminated in 5 types
following a combination of features:

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
1.  The North Zone (NZ), a mylonitic unit, occurs just north of the Cadillac fault and is restricted to the western half of the deposit
(Hosco block). It is generally represented by a tourmaline-biotite-silica and locally albite-sericite altered greywacke, foliated and
injected by up to 20% thin quartz ribbons concordant to tight folding (Figure 7.3). Pyrrhotite is the main sulphide phase with
variable arsenopyrite as an accessory; both can represent up to 10% of the material. The zone is often moulded to the north by
an amphibolised unit. Occasional porphyroblastic amphiboles can also be seen within the North Zone.
Figure 7.3 : Mineralization in the North Zone (Hole JA-08-200 --Section 8650mE)
2.  The  South  Zone  1  (SZ1)  is  a  minor  type  of  mineralization  found  just  south  of  the  fault  and  is  defined  by  a  high  level  of
deformation (Figure 7.4). It is characterized by thin, grey quartz veins crosscutting thin, competent, tourmaline- rich zones. 5-10%
of arsenopyrite can sometimes be observed in semi-massive stringers associated with quartz. Even if some high grade values
are associated with this zone, it remains a marginal contributor to the resources of the deposit.

Figure 7.4 : Mineralization in the South Zone 1 (Hole JA-08-200 -- Section 8650mE)
3.  South Zone 2 (SZ2) represents the most important gold bearing mineralization.  This mineralization can be identified by lower
deformation  intensity  and  by  its  concordant  banded  aspect  caused  by  the  succession  of  5-10%  of  generally  sub  parallel,
millimetric quartz stringers and silica-albite-biotite altered host rock (Figure 7.5). Alteration is also characterised by the presence
of sericite, chlorite and carbonate in variable amounts. The colors of these altered bands vary from brown-yellowish to light
green. Sulphide content is usually around 5-10% with an assemblage of pyrrhotite-pyrite and arsenopyrite. Arsenopyrite crystals
from the SZ2 zone often exhibit a needle shape.

4.  The South zone 3 (SZ3) resembles the SZ2 in terms of quartz veining density, level of deformation, alteration, and sulphide
content. However, no sericite is present in this zone. Vein contacts are occasionally very diffuse. Even if it remains generally
concordant to the deformation zone, veins in SZ3 are often more discordant than those of SZ2. Both zones show a close spatial
association and transitional zones between both are often observed. Figure 7.6 shows visible gold in a quartz vein.

5.  The South Zone 4 (SZ4) is represented by thicker and often more discordant veins composed of white, occasionally smoky,
quartz (Figure 7.7). Coarse arsenopyrite in amounts of up to 20% is sometimes associated with these veins. The veining density
is highly variable and occasionally takes on a breccia aspect. Some veins sections can reach a metric size. They occur more to
the south, isolated from the other zones and in less deformed rocks. They seem to mark the end of the mineralized system in the
investigated  area.  High  grade  gold  samples  have  been  found  within  this  zone  but  contribution  to  the  bulk  of  the  resources
seems marginal.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The different zones do not always respect a distinct, parallel conformable order, and in some sections, SZ2 and SZ3 merge to
create a complex series of braid-like lenses parallel to the Cadillac fault, with variable width and dip extension (please see Figures
7.8 to 7.12) general way, gold bearing envelopes are represented by a single, continuous lens on the north side of the fault and by
two or three main lenses on the south side of the fault. The latter is mainly composed of SZ2 with variable amounts of SZ3. Main
branches  can  reach  real  thickness  of  up  to  50  m.  The  large  envelopes  are  often  interpreted  to  separate  into  several  thinner
branches that can pinch and swell. The largest part of the branches south of the fault form westward plunging ore shoots. The
observation  on  some  section  of  a  folded  conglomerate  layer  on  both  sides  of  the  South  Zone  may  suggest  that  the  distance
between mineralized lenses is dependent on a fold opening. Mapping and sampling in the underground openings of the high grade
quartz vein zones within the low grade corridors show that those partially mined zones are continuous but with some pinch and
swell.
To our knowledge, there is no other significant mineralization on the property which merits modelling and estimation of mineral
resources aside from gold. A metal scan on selected control samples from the 2007 data verification program has been done by
SGS Geostat to verify the presence of other commodities. Silver values are reported as not significant.

7.2.2  Heva
 
Gold is located in several lenses in the south side of the Cadillac Break dipping approximately 60 degrees to the north and forming
an envelope of thickness between 30 and 60 metres. In the Heva area, main lenses (Zone P) are located on the footwall contact of
the Cadillac Fault up to 30 metres from this fault. Mineralization takes the form of a swarm of centimetric to metric grey/white quartz
veins within biotite-tourmaline altered wacke and argilite. Pyrrhotite is the main sulphide. Locally, gold is remobilized inside the
chlorite schist of the Cadillac Fault (Zone F). Others lenses (Zone S) are developed in amphibolitized conglomerate between 70 to
110 metres from the fault zone footwall. See Figures 7.13 to 7.17 for sections of mineralized intervals.
 
7.2.2.1  Heva East
 
Approximately 1 kilometre east of the Heva sector, mineralization has been intersected between 10 to 60 metres from the Cadillac
Fault  footwall.  Gold  is  associated  with  strong  concentrations  (up  to  20%)  of  pyrrhotite  inside  amphibolitized  rocks  of  unknown
origin. Heva East is a new mineralized area, intersected to date along a 200 metre strike and with a possible extension open in all
directions.
 
7.2.2.2  Heva West
 
High  grades  have  been  intersected  in  this  area.  Arsenopyrite  is  mainly  associated  with  quartz/tourmaline  veins  in  silicified,
sericitized  and  biotized  rock.  These  zones  are  located  at  least  125  metres  from  the  footwall  contact  of  the  Cadillac  Fault.
Mineralized zones in this area are usually narrower than main lenses (Zone P) located on the footwall contact of Cadillac Fault.

8  DEPOSIT TYPES
 
The  following  description  of  the  deposit  model  and  associated  mineralization  is  based  on  information  from  different  technical
reports listed in the References section, site visit observations of core, and information provided by Aurizon geologists.
The Joanna gold deposits may be described as sediment hosted orogenic gold deposits related to the structural control of the
Cadillac fault. Mineralization is mainly developed in the form of finely disseminated sulphide envelopes (pseudo-lenses) with minor
quartz veining in sediments of the Pontiac Group (Consorem, 2010) on both sides of a strong 10 to 100 meter wide ductile to
ductile-brittle deformation zone identified as the Cadillac Fault. The ductile-brittle fault is materialized by chlorite-carbonate schist.
The mineralized corridor of the Hosco deposit is described along a 3,000 m east-west trend and can be followed down to a depth of
400 m in the central part of the deposit. The mineralized corridor can be followed in the Alexandria Sector. The Heva, Hosco and
Alexandria deposits (related to the structural control of the Cadillac fault) are following the same trend. The east-West extensions of
the gold deposits remain open. They will probably be all connected with additional drilling. Mineralized zones within that corridor
dip by 50° to 65° to the north with a western plunge. They are usually narrower and less continuous in the Heva sector and wider
and more continuous in the Hosco sector. The description of the Heva deposit in this report is not as detailed as for the Hosco
sectors of the property. This is because the focus of the exploration and concurrent feasibility study is on the Hosco deposit.
The genesis of the Hosco deposit has not been studied in detail but intensive descriptions of hand specimens and thin sections
combined with field investigation of accessible outcrops around the deposits help to develop a robust field model of the deposit that
can be outlined by the following points:
§  Mineralization  is  developed  in  uniform,  medium-grained  wacke  affiliated  with  the  Pontiac  Group  using  Pearce  Zr/TiO2  and
Al2O3/TiO2 ratios.
§  The  gold  enrichment  corresponds  visually  to  a  continuous  biotite  alteration  zone  forming  an  association  with  fine  pyrrhotite,
which is Ni bearing. Outside the fault area the ductile deformation is weak; detrital quartz grains are only slightly dislocated and
biotite is moderately oriented (Renou, 2009).

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
§  Quartz  veining  is  common  south  of  the  Cadillac  Fault  and  defines  probably  a  sub  regional  feature  recognized  more  or  less
continuously along a 7 km strike. As observed near the deposit, increasing vein density may correspond to local folding and
decollement following a 15° westerly plunge (Figure 8.1). Increasing deformation is directly related to the development of mica-
rich alteration halos. The plunging effect is also materialized by gold grade 3D modelling.
Figure 8.1: A Western Plunge of 15°in the Hosco Area
§  Gold bearing quartz veins are mainly conformable to bedding and are contemporaneous to gold bearing alteration halos. Quart
micro-textures indicate a late-tectonic emplacement (Renou, 2009).
§  Various gold bearing alteration halos are observed across the deposit. North of the fault, wacke are completely replaced by fine
grains and a laminated biotite-tourmaline assemblage. Carbonate activity is restricted to the fault area with a weak interaction
southward for a few tens of metres. South of the fault in the biotite halos, a strong albite-quartz flooding is observed around
mineralized  veins.  White  mica  is  sporadically  observed  in  the  mineralized  system  and  strongly  correlates  to  localized  slight
increases in deformation.

§  A geochemical profile across the deposit using a mass balance approach shows an alternate gain in Na and K while Ca and Mg
remain  unaffected  indicating  the  low  circulation  level  of  CO2.  Figure  8.2  shows  the  alteration  minerals  distribution  across  a
conceptual profile of the Hosco mineralized zone.
Figure 8.2: Alteration Minerals Distribution Across a Conceptual Profile of the Hosco Mineralized Zone (taken from Renou, 2009)
§  Lack  of  observed  chlorite  aside  from  its  crystallization  as  a  fringe  around  biotite  flakes  may  indicate  mineralized  conditions
equilibrate at upper greenschist facies. Syn to late kinematic garnet porphyroblasts support this assessment (Renou, 2009).
§  A late, apparently post-kinematic and post-mineralization amphibolitisation event affected host rock on both side of the fault. The
tremolite-rich assemblage selectively replaces up to 100% of the host rock.

9  EXPLORATION
 
The exploration history of the property is directly linked to the history of the discovery and development of the Hosco and Heva
mine  previously  discussed  in  this  report.  Since  2006,  Aurizon  has  carried  out  extensive  computerization  and  integration  of  the
historical data.  Exploration holes were incorporated into a database in electronic format at the end of 2006. Where possible, the
casing of old holes has been located in the field with GPS. A surveyed grid (GML grid) has been established as a unique reference
for all information related to the property. Sylvestre, Julien, Leclerc Land Surveyor (“SJL Surveyor”) have surveyed 184 old holes.
For 170 holes previously surveyed by an unidentified surveyor, we corrected the coordinates in order to integrate them into the
GML grid.  Easily computerized and reliable underground data was also included in the new database.
In 2007, Aurizon initiated an extensive exploration program by systematically re-sampling 118 (72 Hosco and 46 Heva) historical
holes  over  wide  intervals  in  order  to  define  the  extension  of  the  mineralized  system  according  to  sulphide  disseminations.  A
magnetic  and  EM  survey  has  been  completed  north  of  the  Hosco  and  Heva  sectors.  See  Section  10.  A  previous  NI  43-101
compliant resources estimate by SGS Geostat was also completed.
In the late summer of 2007, a mapping and sampling campaign was conducted on the Henriksen claims located northeast of the
Joanna property. See Section 4. Mineralization indicators as strong alteration and disseminated sulphide occurrences returning
anomalous gold values between 0.02 and 0.3 grams per  tonne  from  233  grab  samples  on  outcrops  added  to  the  collection  of
1077  soil  samples  for  MMI  (Mobil  Metal  Ion)  detection  throughout  the  property  and  led  to  the  trenching  and  channel  sampling
(300 samples) of 6 selected areas. Results in the range of 200 to 1000 ppm for Zn and 100 to 400 ppm for Cu were obtained in the
western part of the block located in the Blake River volcanic group. Another signature with gold between 0.002 to 0.01 ppm and
arsenic between 0.2 to 1 ppm resulted in the eastern part of the block with a similar gold context as results of the Hosco sector.
In 2008, Aurizon conducted a magnetic survey on lines totalling 27.1 km. A preliminary geometrical, structural, and depositional
model  based  on  field  observations,  including  Leapfrog  modelling  of  gold  grade  and  petrographic  works,  was  proposed.
Metallurgical testing was

initiated with LTM Laboratory with two (2) composite samples. An IP survey totalling 25.4 km was conducted in the region of the
Joanna North sector adjacent to the eastern boundary of the Henriksen sector. An infiniTEM survey (11.0 km) was also conducted
in the Henriksen sector. Roche, the consulting company, presented a phase 1 environmental characterization of the property. BBA,
the consulting company, completed a preliminary assessment study for an open-pit operation of the Hosco sector.
In 2009, in addition to the drilling (see Section 10) and the completion of the NI 43-101 compliant resource estimates by SGS
Geostat, Aurizon completed several field programs. Work included an induced polarization (IP) survey, MMI soil sampling, hammer
prospection  and  mechanical  stripping.  The  results  of  the  IP  survey  were  used  to  map  the  properties  of  resistivity  and
chargeability of geological formations on the property. In the Bousquet sector, Daniel Gauthier Exploration carried out line cutting
work in June 2009 for a total of 31 lines at 200 m spacing. A rock sampling/mapping program was then conducted in the Bousquet
sector  between  September  21,  2009  and  October  28,  2009.  The  team  consisted  of  a  consulting  geologist  (Michael  Lacey),  a
geological engineer, and three (3) technicians from Technominex Services Inc. During this period, a 2.35 km line was covered on
the  eastern  portion  of  the  Bousquet  sector.  A  total  of  56  lithological  samples  were  taken.  Lakefield  Research  received  five  (5)
composite  samples  to  perform  a  sequence  of  metallurgical  testing  including  grinding,  flotation,  oxidation  and  cyanidation.
Mineralogical and micro-analytical studies were conducted to explain gold recovery.
In 2010, the mapping and sampling program resumed with two (2) geologists and a Technominex technician. 28 km and 5.25 km of
line were surveyed on the west and east blocks respectively from May 16 to July 19th, 2010. A total of 286 samples were taken on
the Bousquet sector and analyzed by ALS Laboratory Group of Val d’Or. Electromagnetic surveys were conducted using Beep Mat
in an effort to explain certain anomalies of high intensity and considerable lateral extent. A gravimetric survey was conducted on
the Henriksen sector in an effort to distinguish amphibolites, wackes, and mineralized conglomerate.
No other exploration work was realized in 2011 and to date, none has been realized in 2012. Only drill holes were completed on
the property (see Section 10).

10.1 Drilling Methodologies
 
This  section  is  based  on  information  provided  by  Aurizon  and  observations  made  during  the  independent  verification  program
conducted at the project work sites by SGS Geostat on December 31, 2011.
Drill holes are planned by a geologist on printed sections showing all geological and grade information from surrounding holes.
Corrections  to  the  holes’  theoretical  traces  are  made  using  a  determined  deviation  rate.  The  planning  information  is  then
transmitted to the technical team responsible for checking physical access and conformity to forestry and environmental permits.
Holes are physically implemented on surveyed grids attached to the NTS grid. The process has been supervised and certified by
Sylvestre, Julien, Leclerc Land Surveyor (“SJL Surveyor”). Drill rig alignment, horizontality and dip, are checked with levels and
sticks by the contracted exploration services firm Services Technominex Inc. (“Technominex”). Once holes have been drilled, they
are surveyed by SJL Surveyor.
Drillhole deviation (dip and azimuth) is measured by either a Reflex or a Flexit tool. Measurements are made at every 30 m during
the drilling operation and at the end of each hole. A continuous survey is also done during the rod pulling operation. An error of 4%
is attached to each measurement according to tool technical specifications. Completed holes are secured with a cement plug and
closed by a steel cover. The position and orientation of the drill hole casing is surveyed, and the survey values are recorded as the
final coordinates and hole orientation in the database.
The exploration drills use NQ-diameter metric coring equipment. During drilling operations, operators place the continuous cored
rock in wooden trays and indicate the depth on a wooden block following every 3 m interval drilled. Ground material intervals or
missed core is indicated by a specific block. Closed core boxes filled and tagged by the drilling company at the drill rig are carried
by truck to the Rouyn-Noranda core shack facility by Services Technominex personnel. The same firm handles all the rock material
from length measurement to shipping in an indoor and access-restrained area.

In 2007, Aurizon drilled 62 surface core holes on the Hosco Sector (JA-07-01 to 25 and 68 to 104) totalling 20,647 m. 42 holes (JA-
07-26 to 67) totalling 26,269 m on the Heva sector for a total of 104 holes totalling 46,916 m.
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
In 2008, 354 holes were drilled (JA-08-105 to164, 166 to 170, 172 to 175, 177 to 182, 184 to 189 and 191 to 463) totalling 86,320 m
in  the  Hosco  sector.  Five  (5)  holes  were  drilled  (JA-08-165,  171,  176,183  and  190)  totalling  1,254  m  on  the  Heva  sector  and
three (3) holes (JA-08-464 to 466) totalling 561 m on the Henriksen sector for a total of 362 holes totalling 88,135 m drilled on the
Property.  Most  of  the  holes  were  in-fill  drilling  on  a  25  m  grid,  mainly  located  in  the  potential  open  pit  modelled  in  the  2008
preliminary economic assessment study done by BBA.
In 2009, Aurizon drilled 55 holes on the Property totalling 13,536 m. 32 holes were drilled on the Hosco sector (JA-09-467, 472 to
474, and 494 to 499 plus deepening of 22 previous holes) totalling 8,555 m. 15 holes (JA-09-468 to 471 and 483 to 493) totalling
3,415 m were completed along the Cadillac Fault to test the eastern extension of the Hosco mineralization in the Alexandria sector,
as well as a new mineralized trend (“Joanna South”) about 300 m south of the Cadillac Fault. 6 holes (JA-09- 475 to 480) totalling
1,185 m were drilled to test the mineralized trend (“Joanna North”) on the Heva sector about 1 km north of the Cadillac Fault.
2 holes (JA-09-481 to 482) totalling 381 m were also drilled on the Henriksen sector to test the same mineralized trend (“Joanna
North”) about 1 km north of the Cadillac Fault.
In  2010,  Aurizon  drilled  a  total  of  349  holes  on  the  Joanna  Property  including  the  different  sectors,  deepened  previous  holes,
exploration  and  condemnation  holes  totalling  70,916.5  m.  From  this  total;  56  holes  totalling  8,769.6  m  were  drilled  on  the
Alexandria sector, 14 holes totalling 3,492 m were drilled on the Heva sector, 236 holes were drilled on the Hosco sector totalling
52,081.4 m, and 43 holes totalling 6,573.5 m on the north and north eastern part of the Joanna Property were drilled.
In  2011,  Aurizon  drilled  a  total  of  115  holes  on  the  Joanna  Property  including  the  different  sectors,  deepened  previous  holes,
exploration and condemnation holes totaling 30,055.5 m.
From this, a total of 61 drillholes totalling 16,591.8 m were made on the Heva sector for resource increase purposes. The area
tested covers 1.5 km along a strike with targets between 0 and 200 metres below the surface. All the new drill holes confirm the
results from previous holes and the extension of the mineralized zones. Heva East is a new mineralized area,

intersected to date along a 200 metre strike with the possibility of extension in all directions. 20 holes totaling 5,798.3 metres were
drilled at 750 to 1,000 metres east of the former Heva workings. In this area, only scattered assays from historical holes indicated
the presence of a consistent gold-bearing mineralized system.
52 holes totaling 13,049.7 m were completed on the Hosco sector in order to increase the open pit indicated resources.
Two (2) additional drill holes (414 m) were done on the Alexandria sector corresponding to the eastern limit of the Hosco sector.
In  2012  (May  31st),  73  holes  totalling  23,388  m  have  been  completed  on  the  program  targeting  the  Heva  area  and  western
extension of the Hosco deposit between the surface and a depth of 200 meters. The objective of the program was to test, with an
initial  100  meter  spacing,  the  continuity  of  the  near  surface  mineralized  system  westward  from  the  Hosco  deposit,  which
corresponds to a 3.0 kilometer strike length along the Cadillac Fault.
9 holes totalling 3,002 m were realized in the west extension of Hosco in order to test the continuity of higher grades in depth. Initial
50-metre spacing has been used in this area and new drill holes confirm the continuity of higher gold value in depth. Higher gold
values  are  associated  with  a  high  level  of  alteration  (biotite-quartz-albite  and  locally  white  mica),  quartz  veins  and  sulphides
(arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite).
64 holes totalling 20,386 m were completed in the Heva area in order to increase inferred resources near the surface in the Heva
zone, Heva west and Heva east sectors. Drill holes confirm several gold enrichment trends along the Cadillac Fault.
The program is still in progress with a new objective to define gold potential at 200 m below the surface. The interpretation of the
higher  grade  trends  showing  a  defined  plunge  has  the  potential  to  move  the  project  toward  a  combination  of  surface  and
underground targets. The program supports the hypothesis that higher grade mineralization with continuity and metal

factors may support an underground mining operation along the Joanna portion of the Cadillac Fault.

11  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
 
11.1 Sample Preparation and Analyses
 
From  the  beginning  of  exploration  on  the  Joanna  gold  property  (“Property”  or  “Project”)  by  Aurizon  Mines  Ltd  (“Aurizon”  or
“Company”)  in  2007  until  early  2008,  the  drill  core  samples  were  sent  for  analysis  at  Laboratoire  Expert  Inc.  (“Lab  Expert”)  of
Rouyn-Noranda,  Quebec.  Since  then,  all  drill  core  samples  were  and  continue  to  be  assayed  at  ALS  Canada  Inc.  -  Chemex
laboratories (“ALS Chemex”) of Val d’Or, Quebec. As part of Aurizon quality assurance and quality control (“QA/QC”) protocol,
approximately 10% of crushed reject and pulp duplicates were sent for reanalysis at ALS Chemex for the 2007-early 2008 period
and are now sent for reanalysis at Laboratoire d’Analyse Bourlamaque Ltd (“Lab Bourlamaque”) of Val d’Or, Quebec.ALS Chemex
is a fully accredited laboratory under ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 17025 standards and Lab Bourlamaque is in the process of obtaining
ISO-9001 certification. Lab Expert is not an accredited laboratory.
The handling and transportation to ALS Chemex of the drill core samples is conducted by employees or contractors of Aurizon or
Services Technominex Inc. (“Technominex”), the principal consulting group managing the exploration work for the Company.
All  samples  received  at  ALS  Chemex  are  digitally  inventoried  using  a  bar-code  and  then  weighed.  Samples  having  excess
humidity are dried. Sample material is crushed in a jaw and/or roll crusher to 70% passing 9 mesh. The crushed material is split
with a rifle splitter to obtain a 250 g sub-sample which is then pulverised to 85% passing 200 mesh using a single component
(flying disk) or a two component (ring and puck) ring mill.
The analytical protocol used at ALS Chemex for gold is the trace level 30 g fire assay fusion and atomic absorption finish (code Au-
AA23) with a detection limit range of 0.005-10 g/t. For samples returning initial assay value greater than 10 g/t, a reanalysis using
ore grade 30 g fire assay fusion with gravimetric finish (code Au-GRA21) is completed.
Lab Bourlamaque uses similar sample preparation and analytical protocols for the reject and pulp duplicates which are 30 g fire
assay  fusion  and  atomic  absorption  finish  (code  AU020)  and  30  g  fire  assay  fusion  and  gravimetric  finish  (code  AU010)
respectively.

11.2 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedure
 
In  addition  of  the  standard  laboratory  QA/QC  programs,  Aurizon  implements  its  own  internal  QA/QC  protocol  consisting  of  the
insertion of certified and custom-made reference materials (analytical standards and blanks) and core duplicates in the Project
sample series. Aurizon also sends reject and pulp duplicates for reanalysis at a second laboratory for verification representing
approximately 10% of the samples assayed.
11.2.1  Analytical Standards
 
Twelve certified reference materials having different representative gold grades and two composite reference materials have been
used  as  analytical  standards  since  the  beginning  of  the  exploration  conducted  by  the  Company  on  the  Project.  The  analytical
standards are inserted in the sample series at a rate of one reference material for every 25 regular samples. Aurizon has defined
the tolerance of the different reference materials from their expected grade values to ±10%. When analytical values of reference
materials fall outside the determined tolerance range, verification is performed at the different steps -- from sampling at the core
logging facilities to the laboratory -- in order to locate and explain the potential source of any difference.
The thirteen certified reference materials OREAS 10Pb, 15Pa, 15Pb, 6Pa&Pc, 7Pb, 61Pa&Pb, 62Pa&Pb, 62c, 65a and 66a are
commercial  standards  from  Ore  Research  &  Exploration  Pty  Ltd,  Australia,  distributed  by  Analytical  Solutions  Inc.  of  Toronto,
Ontario,  Canada.  Certified  set  values  and  expected  standard  deviation  (“Std.  Dev.”)  values  are  reported  in  performance  gates
statistics for each certified reference material. The two composite reference materials JA-1 and JA-2 are custom-made from rejects
of 20 to 30 mineralised samples which are pulverised and homogenised to make 40 to 60 kg batches. The set values for the 2
composite standards are weighted average grades of the selected mineralized drill core intervals. Unfortunately, no expected Std.
Dev. values are defined for the composite reference materials. The expected Std. Dev. used in the current QA/QC analysis are
derived from the actual reported analytical values for each composite standard and calculated using analytical results having less
than a 50% difference relative to the expected value.
Figure 11.1 to Figure 11.15 are graphs showing the variation of the reported analytical results for each certified and composite
standard with time. The QA/QC data is taken from the Project database dated March 18, 2011. For each graph, the QC warning
(orange) and QC failure (red) intervals are shown along with the expected mean value (green). The values for the QC warning and
QC failure have been defined as 2 times and 3 times the expected Std. Dev. respectively. Table 11.1 shows the results of the
statistical analysis for each reference material.

Lab Expert was the main analytical laboratory for the Project from the beginning of exploration in 2007 to April 2008; ALS Chemex
was designated as the main laboratory following this. During the Lab Expert period certified standards OREAS 15Pa, 61Pa&Pb
and 62 Pa&Pb were the most utilised standards. The Company started inserting the certified standards OREAS 10Pb and 7Pb at
the  end  of  2007  and  then  decided  to  include  custom-made  composite  reference  material  in  March  2008  as  part  of  the  QA/QC
protocol, shortly before changing the laboratory to ALS Chemex. The Company has added five more analytical standards, 6Pa&Pc,
62c, 65a and 66a, to replace depleted certified materials since then.
Table 11.1 : Summary of the Statistical Analysis for Different Reference Materials
Certified standards OREAS 61Pa&Pb and 62Pa&Pb used in the early months have set values ranging from 4.46 g/t Au to 11.33 g/t
Au, which are significantly greater than the average grade of the mineralised samples for the Project (in the order of 1 to 2 g/t Au).
Reported  results  for  standard  61Pa  returned  an  average  value  2.8%  higher  in  comparison  to  the  expected  value  but  with  an
acceptable data variance (95% of values within the QC failure range). 61Pb returned an average value 1.5% lower but also with
acceptable variance (99% of values within the QC failure range). Standard 62Pa shows observed values comparable with the
expected value until roughly August 2008 when they returned consistently higher by more than 8% (on average), which could be
due to confusion with the higher grade 62Pb. Data variance for 62Pa is higher than the 61 series with only 88% of values within the
QC failure range although definitely influenced by the higher values observed after August 2008. Standard 62Pb values returned
significantly lower values (on average) when compared to the expected value by more than 6.8% but show an acceptable variance
with 92% of values within QC failure range.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Certified reference materials OREAS 15Pa, 10Pb and 7Pb were the most used standards since the start of exploration in 2007 and
15Pa is still being inserted in the samples series. 7Pb and 10Pb were discontinued late in 2009 and early in 2010 respectively.
Their set Au grades ranging from 1.02 g/t to 7.15 g/t Au are more in line with the Project mineralized samples. Reported values for
standard 15Pa display a good correspondence with the expected value with an acceptable data variance (93% of values within the
QC failure range) although the pattern of observed values prior to April 2008 show a relatively higher mean Au grade with more
data scattering. The same pattern is observed for standard 10Pb prior to April 2008 where mean grade is consistently higher. After
that period, reported values for 10Pb show good correspondence with expected value with an acceptable data variance (95% of
values within QC failure range). Observed values for standard 7Pb returned a good correspondence with the expected value but
are showing relatively more data scattering in comparison to the others standards with numerous low value outliers (overall 87% of
values fall with the QC failure range).
Certified analytical standards 6Pa, 6Pc, 62c, and 66a are relatively recent reference materials used in the Project. 6Pa was used
during a short period in late 2009. 6Pc, 62c and 66a have been used continuously since late 2009, late 2010 and early 2011
respectively. 6Pa, which has a set grade of 1.65 g/t Au, returned average results significantly lower than the expected value by
7.4% with a fair data variance (97% with QC failure but only 66% with QC warning). Reported values for standard 6Pc show a good
correspondence with the expected value with an acceptable data scatter (93% of values within the QC failure range). Reference
materials 62c and 66a returned average results in line with expected values with acceptable data variance (92% within QC failure
range  each).  Reported  values  for  composite  standards  JA-1  and  JA-2  are  more  strongly  scattered  compared  to  the  certified
standard, which is expected for custom-made reference materials. Observed results for JA-1 are consistently higher by 11.3% on
average versus the expected value with a definite bias for the results prior to April 2008. Data variance is significant with only 81%
of  the  values  falling  within  the  calculated  QC  failure  range.  Numerous  outliers  are  observed  with  values  30%  to  100%  higher
relative to the expected value. Standard JA-2, which replaced JA-1 in early 2009, also shows significant data scattering (70% of
values within the defined QC failure range) but returned values on average 5% lower than the expected value. Several high value
outliers are observed with some reaching more than 600% the expected value.

The QA/QC analysis outlined generally acceptable results for the analytical standards with significant improvement noticeable after
April 2008 when ALS Chemex became the main laboratory. The results of the certified reference materials show relatively good
consistency compared to the expected values and QC ranges. The results for the composite standards returned more scattered
values which can be expected for custom-made reference materials. Since We have observed a relatively high amount of QC
failure for standards 10Pb, 15Pa, 15Pb, 6Pc since October 2010 but the results for standards 62c and 66a are consistent with the
expected  values.    Aurizon  is  currently  reviewing  the  data  to  see  if  there  are  any  transcription  errors.  Also,  the  pulps  from  the
Certificates containing problematic QA/QC results from this period were sent back for re-assay. The results were pending during
the writing of this report.

11.2.2  Analytical Blanks
 
Blank reference material was composed of drill core from local barren rocks until the end of April 2010. Coarse calcareous material
used as decorative pebbles (¾” in size) and purchased at a nearby hardware store in Rouyn-Noranda has been used as blank
material since then. The blanks are inserted in the sample series at an average rate of 1 per 20 regular samples.

11-12
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
A total of 1,770 blanks were analysed as part of the sample stream since March 26, 2007. From the 1,770 blanks, 95% of them
returned less than 0.025 g/t Au, which is 5 times the detection limit of the most recent analytical method and 99% of the blanks
reported values less than 0.1 g/t Au. From the 17 blanks with analytical value greater than 0.1 g/t, only 6 have analytical values
greater than 0.5 g/t Au. Figure 11.16 shows the analytical results for blanks over time (results above 0.5 g/t Au are not shown in the
graph). It is apparent from the graph that prior to the use of the decorative pebbles in April 2010, a significant number of blanks
returned values above 5 times the detection limit. This can be explained by the fact that drill core samples thought to be barren
were used as analytical blanks (some may not have been barren of gold).

11.2.3  Core Duplicates
 
A total of 156 drill core duplicates were reported in the August 26, 2011 Project database provided by Aurizon. Drill core duplicates
consisting of half of the remaining second half of the drill core material (quarter core) were inserted in the sample series at an
average rate of 2 quarter core duplicates for every hole. The procedure of regularly inserting a drill core duplicate in the sample
series was conducted for the first half of 2008 only. The statistical analysis of the Core duplicates was done only on drillholes done
by  Aurizon.  Assay  results  from  re-analysed  older  and  historical  core  from  previous  owners  were  not  included  in  this  statistical
analysis. Figure 11.17 shows a correlation plot for the core duplicates and Table 11.2 summarises the results of the statistical
analysis.
Of the 156 core duplicates, the reproducibility of 72% of the assays returning values above 0.025 g/t Au was within ±20% and 76%
of  the  assays  returning  values  above  0.5  g/t  was  within  ±20%.  The  sign  test  did  not  highlight  any  bias  with  47%  of  the  core
duplicates returning a value greater than the original samples for Au grade above 0.025 g/t and 54% of the duplicates returning a
value greater than the original samples for Au grade above 0.5 g/t.

As part of the Company QA/QC protocol, preparation (or reject) and pulp duplicates representing approximately 10% of the total
samples are sent for reanalysis at a second analytical laboratory. Since the beginning of exploration by Aurizon until April 2008,
ALS Chemex served as the check laboratory. Since April 2008, ALS Chemex became the main laboratory and LAB Bourlamaque
was selected for the reanalysis of the reject and pulp duplicates. All rejects are re-analysed using fire assay fusion and atomic
absorption finish with lower detection limits of 0.005 g/t Au for ALS Chemex and 0.01 g/t Au for Lab Bourlamaque. All pulps are
processed using fire assay fusion and gravimetric finish with lower detection limits of 0.05 g/t Au for ALS Chemex and 0.1 g/t Au for
Lab Bourlamaque.

11.2.5  QA/QC Conclusion
 
Since the start of the exploration work on the Project in 2007, Aurizon implemented an internal QA/QC protocol consisting of the
insertion  of  reference  materials  in  the  sample  series  (certified  and  composite  analytical  standards  and  blanks).  The  QA/QC
program also included the reanalysis of sample reject and pulp duplicates in a second analytical laboratory for verification. Core
duplicates were taken as part of the protocol in the first half of 2008.
Reported results for the certified analytical standards since the beginning of the company exploration programs on the Property
show a relatively good correlation with expected mean values. The variance of the observed values is relatively high in comparison
to the specifications of the certified standards but is considered acceptable with a QC failure rate ranging from 1% to 13%. The
variance  of  the  observed  values  for  the  custom-made  composite  analytical  standard  is  significantly  higher  than  the  certified
standards  but  this  behaviour  is  expected  for  custom-made  reference  materials.  Reported  results  for  the  blanks  are  acceptable.
Observed results for the drill core, rejects and pulp duplicates show good correlation with the original analytical values and no
biases are observed. The variance of the observed values for the duplicates is in line with similar gold projects.
It is the author and SGS Geostat’s opinion that Aurizon is operating according to industry standard QA/QC protocol for the insertion
of  control  samples  within  the  sample  stream  of  the  Project.  The  data  is  considered  of  sufficient  quality  to  be  used  for  mineral
resource estimation.
11.3 Specific Gravity
 
In 2007, the Company conducted specific gravity (“S.G.”) measurements on mineralized drill core samples selected from six (6)
drillholes from the JA-07 series. The S.G. measurements were completed by Lab Expert laboratory using the water displacement
method. A total of 1,255 S.G. measurements were conducted on drill core samples selected from six (6) drillholes from the JA-07
series  located  in  the  Hosco  sector,  returning  an  average  S.G.  value  of  2.66  t/m3.  From  these  samples,  a  subset  of  107  core
samples having an analytical gold value above 0.5 g/t also returned an average S.G. value of 2.66 t/m3. Table 11.5 summarises
the statistics of the S.G. readings on the selected mineralized drill core samples.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Table 11.5: Summary of 2007 S.G. Measurements on Mineralised Core Samples
A new S.G. measurement program was completed in 2010 for the Hosco deposit following indication that the average S.G. values
for the mineralized rocks was significantly higher than the values reported in 2007 by Lab Expert. In reports dated October 27, 2009
and April 30, 2010, S.G. measurements conducted as part of SAG mill comminution (SMC) testworks under the supervision of SGS
Canada Inc. – Mineral Services (Lakefield) (“SGS Lakefield”) returned S.G. values between 2.72 and 2.76 t/m3 with an average
S.G. value of 2.74 t/m3.
In  order  to  confirm  the  average  S.G.  value  of  the  mineralized  material  from  Hosco,  Aurizon  conducted  additional  S.G.
measurements  on  selected  core  samples  from  the  Hosco  deposit.  These  additional  measurements  were  performed  by
Technominex of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. Aurizon also conducted validation measurements on selected samples at ALS Chemex
located in Val d’Or, Quebec. Aurizon mandated SGS Geostat to conduct audits of the S.G. methodologies used by Technominex
and ALS Chemex.
Two data verification programs were conducted to validate the work done by Technominex with the objective of validating the work
and verifying some of the S.G. values reported by Lab Expert in 2007. The first program includes the validation of S.G. values by
ALS Chemex of 185 drill core samples tested by Technominex. The second verification program was conducted by SGS Geostat
on 35 drill core samples tested by both Lab Expert in 2007 and Technominex in 2010.

Results from ALS Chemex data verification compared to Technominex S.G. data for the same drill core samples are shown in
Table 11.6 and Figure 11.20 below. The results obtained by ALS Chemex show a very strong correlation with Technominex S.G.
data and no difference in the mean S.G. value.

11.3.2  SGS Geostat S.G. Data Verification
 
SGS Geostat conducted an independent data verification program during the visit at Technominex work facilities on September
2010. The program included the verification of S.G. measurements from 35 NQ-size half-core samples selected from holes JA-07-
12, JA-07-17 and JA-07-19. The samples selected are part of the samples characterised by Lab Expert in 2007 and Technominex
in 2010. The methodology used by SGS Geostat is the water displacement method measured by a graduated cylinder. The method
consists of weighing the dry sample using a balance with a precision of ±0.5 g. Following this, the volume of water displaced by the
sample is measured by submerging the sample in water in a graduated cylinder precise to ±10 ml. The S.G. can then be calculated
using the following formula:
 
SG = weight in air (kg) / volume of water displaced (l)
 
Results of the SGS Geostat data verification program are summarised in Table 11.8 and Figure 11.22 below.

Figure 11.22: Charts Comparing Lab Expert and Technominex versus SGS Geostat SG Values
The data verification program conducted by SGS Geostat displays similar results to the verification done by ALS Chemex. The
correlation between Technominex and SGS Geostat S.G. data is generally good with a difference in the mean S.G. value of less
than 1%. The correlation between Lab Expert and SGS Geostat S.G. data is significantly less defined and shows a similar pattern
as with the ALS Chemex data. The difference between the mean S.G. values is more pronounced with a mean S.G. value for Lab
Expert 2.5% lower than SGS Geostat.
Based on the results of the data verification programs, we can conclude that the S.G. data collected by Technominex in 2010
correlated well with the check data returned by ALS Chemex, as well as the SGS Geostat verification program and can therefore be
characterised as reliable for use in mineral resource estimation process. The S.G. data gathered by Lab Expert in 2007 cannot be
validated  with  the  check  data  gathered  by  ALS  Chemex  and  SGS  Geostat.  The  Lab  Expert  S.G.  data  must  be  considered
unreliable and should not be used to calculate the average S.G. value for the Hosco deposit. Based on these conclusions, SGS
Geostat recommends defining a new average S.G. value for Hosco based on the Technominex 2010 S.G. data.

values  were  collected  from  16  different  drillholes.  Table  11.9  shows  the  summary  statistics  for  all  S.G.  values  collected  by
Technominex and S.G. values for samples above 0.5 g/t Au.
Table 11.9: Summary of S.G. Results from Technominex 2010
Based  on  the  S.G.  work  conducted  by  Technominex  in  2010  and  considering  the  S.G.  value  reported  by  SGS  Lakefield  from
metallurgical testing completed on composite samples, the author suggests updating the average S.G. value for the Hosco deposit
to 2.75 t/m3.
11.4 Conclusions
 
SGS Geostat completed a review of the sample preparation and analysis including the QA/QC analytical protocol implemented by
Aurizon for the Project. The Author visited the Company core logging facilities on August 24, 2011 to review the Company sample
preparation procedures. A statistical analysis of the QA/QC data for the Project did not outline any significant analytical issues.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
During 2010, the Company conducted a thorough review of the average S.G. value for the Hosco deposit including 1,490 new S.G.
measurements  conducted  on  core  samples  and  data  verification  completed  by  ALS  Chemex  and  SGS  Geostat.  The  new
measurements outlined a significantly higher average S.G. value for the Hosco deposit than previously thought. Based on the new
S.G. readings, the average S.G. value for Hosco has now been set to 2.75 t/m3.
The average S.G. value for mineralized rocks of the Alexandria deposit has also been changed to 2.75 t/m3 based on the new
average value for the Hosco deposit. The average S.G. value for the Heva deposit is set to 2.81 t/m3.
The author and SGS Geostat are of the opinion that the sample preparation, analysis and QA/QC protocol used by Aurizon for the
Joanna project follow generally accepted industry standards and that the Project data is of sufficient quality to be used for mineral
resource estimation.

12  DATA VERIFICATION
 
SGS Geostat completed analytical checks of drill core duplicate samples taken from selected Aurizon 2011 diamond drillholes on
the Hosco sector as part of the independent data verification program. SGS Geostat also conducted verification of the laboratories
analytical certificates and validation of the Hosco Sector database supplied by Aurizon for errors and discrepancies.
SGS Geostat also completed analytical checks of drill core duplicate samples taken from selected Aurizon diamond drillholes on
the Heva and Alexandria sectors as part of the independent data verification program described in previous reports starting in
2007. A total of 38 independent check samples (quarter core) in 2007 and an additional 147 in 2008 as part of the 2007 and 2008
were collected during the site visits done by SGS Geostat. Despite a fairly significant scatter of original and check values, that
second set of check sample data did not show any sign of bias with the average duplicate grade equal to the average original
grade (both are 1.55g/t). SGS Geostat considers the data verification done on the Heva and Alexandria sectors to be current and
reliable for resources estimation purposes. The 2007 and 2008 data verification full description is available in the April 7th, 2009
technical report from SGS addressed to Aurizon and available on www.sedar.com.
During the site visit conducted from August 24 to 26, 2011 by the author, Maxime Dupéré, P.Geo., a total of 38 mineralized core
duplicates from the Hosco sector were collected from holes JA-11-868, JA-11-879, JA-11-917, JA-11-918, JA-11-931 and JA-11-
935 by the author and submitted for Au analysis at SGS Minerals laboratory in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The duplicate samples
were processed using fire assay with ICP-OES finish (SGS code FAI323). Two blanks were inserted respectively at the beginning
and ending of the sample series. One certified reference material was also inserted in the samples series (OREAS 65a). Figure
12.1 shows correlation plots for the duplicate data versus the original data. A summary of the statistical analysis conducted on the
data is shown in Table 12.1.
A  statistical  analysis  of  the  original  and  duplicate  analytical  values  shows  comparable  results  with  39%  of  the  original  values
returning greater than the duplicate values for Au grades ranging between 0.005 g/t and 14.25 g/t.

Metallurgical testwork has been performed at the various study stages of the Joanna Project. This Section of the Report provides
an overview of the testwork as well as how the results were analyzed, interpreted and used to define the Process Flowsheet, mass
balances and other process design parameters and equipment sizing. Testwork was performed in the following areas:
§  Comminution
§  Gravity separation of gravity recoverable gold
§  Flotation
§  Sulphide oxidation
§  Cyanide leaching
§  Thickening
§  Cyanide destruction
13.1 Ore Sample Selection and Preparation for the FS
 
13.1.1  Samples from PFS Metallurgical Testing
 
Two (2) pallets of bags containing samples representing the North and South zones of the Joanna deposit were received at SGS
on July 2nd, 2008 (SGS October 2009). Five (5) composite samples as well as a Master Composite were made, as shown in
Figure 13.1. Most of the composite samples 1 to 5 were used for the PFS testwork however, a portion of each of these composite
samples was sent to Knelson in order to have gravity recoverable gold (GRG) testwork performed for the Feasibility Study (FS).
The Master Composite sample was used to perform flotation optimization testwork at SGS. The Master Composite sample head
assay is shown in Table 13.1.

13.1.3  Sample for FS Flotation Pilot Plant Testing (Albion)
 
A  shipment  comprising  22  pallets  of  drill  core  samples  from  the  Joanna  deposit  was  received  at  the  SGS  Lakefield  site  on
November 9th, 2009 (SGS March 2010). The total weight of the shipment was approximately 11 tonnes and contained samples
from two (2) different zones of the deposit. Approximately 10 tonnes originated from the South Zone was used in the pre-pilot plant
laboratory test program and the FS pilot plant for producing feed for subsequent Albion pilot plant testing. The remaining one tonne
of sample originated from the North Zone was not used in this test program. The head assay for the South Zone composite is
presented  in  Table  13.3.  The  primary  objective  of  this  test  program  was  to  produce  a  sufficient  quantity  of  concentrate  for
subsequent Albion Process testwork but also to evaluate flotation performance at a pilot scale for subsequent scale-up for process
development.  The  testwork  for  the  Albion  Process  development  was  under  the  responsibility  of  Core  Resources  and  Xsrata
Technologies.

Two (2) shipments, one (1) consisting of 19 tonnes of NQ drill half-core (referred to as DC) and the other consisting of 22 tonnes of
reverse  circulation  (referred  to  as  RC)  material  were  sent  to  Inspectorate  Exploration  &  Mining  Services  Ltd.  –  Metallurgical
Division’s Richmond Lab on November 16th and 17th,  2010  (Inspectorate  February  2011).  The  DC  and  the  RC  material  were
processed separately. The primary objective was to produce a representative flotation concentrate of sufficient quantity to be used
for testwork and process development in a pressure oxidation (POX) pilot plant. The testwork and process development for POX
was under the responsibility of Sherrit Technologies. The head assays of the DC and RC materials are presented in Table 13.4.

13.1.5  FS Grindability and Flotation Variability Testing Samples
 
Twelve (12) drill half-core samples were sent to SGS for grindability and flotation variability testing (SGS April 2012). The purpose
was to evaluate how ore variability affects grindability parameters and flotation behavior of the ore over the deposit. The head
assays of the variability composite samples are presented in Table 13.5.

The Au head grades were in the range of 0.67 g/t to 1.48 g/t. The average gold head assay was considerably lower than the
average LOM head grade.
13.1.6   Sample Locations and Representativity
Samples taken for SMC and Drop weight comminution tests originated from two fairly concentrated areas of the pit. The results
from  these  tests  were  used  to  determine  SAG  mill  and  Ball  mill  size  and  power.  Considering  that  these  samples  were  from
concentrated areas of the pit, twelve (12) additional samples were taken in a more spread out pattern in order to perform hardness
variability tests (done using the SPI test method). Considering the relatively small quantity of samples, it is recommended that more
samples be taken and additional full JK Drop Weight tests and SMC tests be performed to validate mill sizes and power. Samples
should be taken to match the mine plan phases in order to validate ore hardness in the first months and years of operation in a
more detailed manner.
The material used for making the flotation test pilot plant composites were generally well distributed within the pit shell and were
deemed to be a representative blend of the ore. The purpose of the flotation pilot testwork was to produce a sufficient quantity of
concentrate for performing subsequent POX testwork. In order to make enough material for the pilot scale testwork, about half of the
material came from RC material, which originated from only 3 concentrated areas near the pit surface. The balance of the material
came from DC material which was derived from a very large area of the pit, both in plan and in depth. During flotation, the two
materials  were  treated  separately  to  produce  separate  concentrates.  Subsequently,  the  two  concentrates  were  also  processed
separately in the POX testwork.

13.2 Comminution Testwork
 
13.2.1  PFS Comminution Testwork Results
 
As  part  of  the  PFS  testwork  program  and  flowsheet  development  process,  five  (5)  metallurgical  composites,  as  described  in
Section 13.1.1, were submitted for standard Bond ball mill grindability tests and SAG Mill Comminution (SMC) tests (SGS October
2009). The Bond ball mill work index (BWI) for the five (5) composites ranged between 12.2 and 14.3 kWh/t.
The SMC test generates an estimated Drop-Weight Index (DWI), which provides a measure of the strength of a rock when broken
under impact conditions. The DWI’s are directly related to the JK rock breakage parameters A and b, which are required for the
JKSimMet comminuting modeling. The DWI for the five (5) metallurgical Composite samples ranged from 7.0 - 8.0.
The value of A x b, which is also a measure of resistance to impact breakage, was calculated and compared to compiled values in
the  JKTech  DW  database.  According  to  this  database  of  2,304  recordings,  the  PFS  grindability  data  for  the  Joanna  Project
suggested that the ore is in the 28th percentile of hardest ore for SAG milling.

13.2.2  FS Testwork Results
 
As discussed in Section 13.1.2, seven (7) samples were prepared and were subjected to the following tests (SGS April 2010):
§  SMC test
§  Bond rod mill grindability test
§  Bond ball mill grindability test
§  Bond abrasion index
One (1) of these samples (GT-02) was also analyzed using the standard JKTech drop weight impact test and Bond low-energy
impact test in addition to the tests listed above, as much more material was available for this sample. The SMC test is a simplified
version of the standard JKTech drop-weight test performed on rocks from a single size fraction. The SMC test was performed on all
samples. The data from the JKTech drop-weight test performed on the GT-02 sample was interpreted by Contract Support Services
(CSS), the North-American agent for JKTech. The test results are presented in Table 13.6 and Table 13.7.
Based on the SGS database, the GT-02 sample was categorized as very hard with respect to resistance to impact (A x b) breakage
and hard in terms of resistance to abrasion breakage (ta). The SMC and DWT results for the GT-02 sample were in agreement
(about  3%  difference  in  A  x  b).  The  other  six  (6)  samples  were  characterized  as  hard  with  respect  to  the  SGS  database.  The
average relative density ranged from 2.73 to 2.76 g/cm3.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Table 13.6: Grindability Test Results
Table 13.7: Grindability Test Statistics
When comparing these test results to the results obtained in the PFS, it can be seen that the FS results indicate that the ore tested
is harder for both SAG and ball milling. The Ball Mill Work Index (BWI), which ranged from 12.2 and 14.3 kWh/t in the PFS ore
tested, ranged from 12.8 to 15.7 kWh/t in the FS ore tested. The DWI, which ranged from 7.0 - 8.0 in the PFS ore tested, ranged
from 8.1 - 10.0 in the FS ore tested.
It should be noted that additional drilling performed during the FS period increased the Joanna deposit resource, and samples for
the FS covered a larger pit shell than was the case in the PFS.
The Bond low-energy impact test determines the Bond crusher work index (CWI), which can be used with Bond’s Third Theory of
Comminution to calculate power requirements for crusher sizing. The CWI for sample GT-02 was found to be 16.2 kWh/t. When
compared to the SGS database, the sample GT-02 was categorized as hard.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The Bond rod mill grindability test was performed at a grind of 14 mesh (1,180 µm) on the seven (7) samples. The Rod Mill Work
Index (RWI) ranges from 15.7 to 17.6 kWh/t. The samples were generally categorized as moderately hard when compared to the
SGS database.
 
The Bond ball mill grindability test was performed on the seven (7) samples. The BWI varied from 12.8 to 15.7 kWh/t. The samples
were generally categorized as having a medium hardness when compared to the SGS database.
The seven (7) samples were submitted for the Bond abrasion test to determine the Abrasion Index (AI). The AI value varied from
0.268 g to 0.436 g. The samples mostly fell in the moderately abrasive range when compared to the SGS database.
13.2.3  Crusher Selection
 
The crusher selection for the FS was based on the CWI result obtained as part of the comminution tests performed (SGS April
2010). The CWI value used for equipment sizing was 16.2 kWh/t. The simulation software Bruno was used to size the crusher. The
crusher selected is a jaw-type crusher with a feed opening measuring 1,250 mm x 950 mm and an installed power of 200 kW. It is
fed ROM ore having F80 of 600 mm and generates product having P80 of 110 mm. The use of a gyratory crusher was evaluated
but for the size of the Joanna operation, it was determined that even the smallest gyratory crusher would be too big and much more
costly  than  a  jaw  crusher,  which  is  much  better  suited  for  the  application.  In  sizing  the  crusher,  the  crusher  availability  was
assumed to be in the order of 65% with a nominal capacity of 545 t/h. This would provide the nominal daily throughput of 8,500 t/d
and coupled with the crushed ore storage capacity, would assure continuous feed to the concentrator.
13.2.4  Grinding Circuit Modeling and Mill Selection
 
Based on the Joanna ore grindability test results, the grinding circuit for the Joanna ore was based on a conventional SAG/Ball Mill
grinding circuit. There are several simulation methods available for sizing the grinding circuit. Based on BBA experience on other
projects, the JKSimMet grinding circuit simulation method was adopted. The services of Contract Support Services (CSS) were
retained to perform the following scope of work under supervision of BBA (Contract Support Services October 2010):
 
July 2012
13-9
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
§  Analyze  available  grindability  testwork  data,  mainly  in  the  form  of  grindability  tests  performed  on  the  seven  (7)  Composite
samples tested, to derive the basis and the design parameters for mill capacity calculations.
§  Based on the design ore sample, using JKSimMet modeling software:
-  Determine optimum SAG and ball mill sizes for various grinding scenarios whereby ore hardness, throughput and final grind size
are varied within a design envelope.
-  Evaluate the impact of incorporating pebble crushing in closed circuit with the SAG mill.
-  Investigate the effects of the aforementioned parameters and variables on mill size and power requirements.
-  Determine the most cost effective solution for grinding at the required grind size.
It is important to note that the function of the grinding circuit is to efficiently grind crushed ore to the required particle size to allow for
cost effective gold recovery in the subsequent gravity gold recovery and sulphide flotation processing steps. The targeted final
grind particle size is therefore determined based on gravity and flotation performance. Grinding finer requires higher power and
bigger mills therefore there is an increase in both capital and operating costs as the grind gets finer. In general, finer grind provides
a  higher  overall  gold  recovery  but  at  some  point,  an  incremental  increase  in  grind  fineness  will  not  result  in  a  cost  effective
incremental increase in gold recovery. It stands to reason therefore, that the targeted (or nominal) grind size is determined by the
combined gravity and flotation gold recovery.
 
13.2.4.1  Selection of Design Basis Ore
 
Table 13.8  presents the A x b and BWI parameters for each sample as well as statistics for ore with and without dilution. The A x b
parameter is inversely proportional to ore hardness (resistance to impact breakage in the SAG mill). The sample designated as
"ZS2 JA-08 314 & 315" was selected as the “Design Basis Ore”. This sample has the highest BWI value and an average A x b
value. For the purpose of performing a sensitivity analysis of the grinding circuit to hard ore and soft ore, samples were selected as
follows. The GT-02 sample was chosen as the “Hard Ore” sample, based on having the lowest A x b value (indicating greatest
resistance  to  impact  breakage,  which  has  the  strongest  influence  on  SAG  mill  performance).  The  ZS3  JA-08  358  sample  was
chosen as the “Soft Ore” sample, because it has the highest A x b value (indicating least resistance to impact breakage). It should
be noted however that the Design Basis Ore sample BWI value of 15.7 is significantly harder than either the Hard Ore (GT-02) at
14.2 or the Soft Ore (ZS3 JA-08 358) at 13.1. This indicates that the ball mill will likely be conservatively sized.

13.2.4.2  Comminution Modeling Design Criteria
 
The size and power of the grinding circuit is determined by two (2) major factors; ore grindability and throughput. Ore grindability
has already been discussed. The throughput is determined as part of the plant design basis and is discussed further in Section 17
of this Report. In sizing the grinding circuit, it is important to define and to distinguish nominal conditions and design conditions.
The nominal throughput considered in the grinding circuit simulations were based on a throughput of 381 t/h, which corresponds to
the nominal daily throughput of 8,500 t/d at a 93% mill utilization rate. This is the same value used in the PFS.
In the FS, grinding circuit modeling was performed on a range of final product sizes of 75 µm to 135 µm. Testwork and modeling for
the gravity concentrator and for the flotation circuit was also performed on material in this size range. The results of this testwork are
presented later in this section.
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Simulations were conducted to determine the impact of incorporating a pebble crusher in closed circuit with the SAG mill. Although
there was a positive impact on overall energy consumption, it was determined that the benefit was not sufficient for the investment
required so this option was not pursued further in the FS.
 
13.2.4.3  Grinding Circuit Design
 
The grinding circuit design was based on a conventional SAG/Ball mill design. The SAG mill is in open circuit and the ball mill is in
a closed circuit with hydrocyclones. The final product from the grinding circuit comes from the hydrocyclone overflow. A portion of
the  ball  mill  discharge  is  directed  to  the  gravity  concentrator.  Grinding  circuit  modeling  and  simulations  were  conducted
accordingly.
As stated earlier, grinding simulations were conducted for a range of final particle sizes. The gravity concentration and flotation
testwork indicated that the most cost effective grind would be in the order of P80=90 microns. Based on the simulations conducted,
the SAG mill and ball mill were sized as shown in Table 13.9. This sizing was based on design ore (A x b of 30.4, BWI of 15.7),
nominal  throughput  of  381  t/h  nominal  grind  of  90  µm  SAG  mill  power  of  85%  of  maximum  and  Ball  mill  power  of  82.5%  of
maximum. The simulations indicated a Ball mill motor power lower that what was chosen was possible, but it was decided that the
same size motor should be used in the SAG mill and Ball mill to allow for common spares. Motor size can be further optimized in
the next engineering phase, in collaboration with the selected Vendor, to choose a motor size that is matched to the full power that
the mill is capable of drawing at full capacity.

13.2.4.4  Sensitivity of Selected Mills to Ore Variations
 
As mentioned earlier, the grinding circuit design was based on design ore and nominal throughput and grind. Simulations were
then carried out to determine the effect of ore hardness variability on throughput and on grind size. The maximum power utilization
was capped at 95% of available power for both mills in these simulations, and the minimum throughput was maintained at 381 t/h.
The results are presented in Table 13.10. The simulations show that for all ores, at nominal throughput, grinds that are finer than
90  µm  are  achievable.  Also,  throughput  considerably  higher  than  nominal  can  be  achieved  for  both  hard  and  soft  ore,  while
maintaining grind at 90 µm or finer.
During the second phase of the FS, when it was decided that the pressure oxidation (POX) would be used, the availability of the
plant was changed from 93% to 85% (the availability of the autoclave). At 85% utilization, the grinding circuit must process 417 t/h.
Based on the data shown above in Table 13.10, the grinding circuit can accommodate this new throughput, for all ore samples
tested in grindability testwork, at power draws lower than 95% of available power.

13.2.5  Comminution Variability Testing
 
The objective of this testwork was to obtain an ore hardness profile within the pit. Twelve (12) Variability Composite samples, were
submitted for this testwork (SGS April 2012). Following discussions with SGS, it was decided to perform SPI tests rather than SMC
tests in order to provide indications of ore grindability using a different method. The tests included the SAG Power Index (SPI®),
and CEET Crusher Index (CEET Ci) measurements. The SPI is a measure of the hardness. The CEET Ci, along with the SPI
value, can be used to predict the SAG feed size distribution of the ore, and is measured during the SPI feed preparation procedure.
The samples were categorized as moderately hard, to hard with respect to the SGS database. The testwork results are shown in
Table 13.11.
The Modified Bond (ModBond) ball mill grindability test was performed on each variability composite sample. The work index was
calibrated against the standard Bond work index. In order to calibrate the ModBond test the Bond ball mill grindability tests were
performed  at  150  mesh  of  grind  (106  μm).  Samples  from  the  previous  testing  program  were  used  for  the  calibration;  five  (5)
samples,  stored  at  the  SGS  Lakefield  facility  were  recovered  from  storage  and  submitted  for  Bond  ball  mill  and  ModBond
calibration testing. The results are shown in Table 13.11. The ModBond test was performed on the five (5) calibration samples and
all fifteen variability samples. The Variability samples were classified as soft to medium in terms of hardness.

In reviewing the SPI and ModBond test results, there does not seem to be excessive variability in ore hardness. The CEET Ci
exhibits a higher degree of variability much of which can be attributed to one (1) outlier.
13.3 Gravity Recoverable Gold
13.3.1  PFS Gravity Testwork
 
As part of the PFS, the potential for gold recovery by gravity concentration was evaluated by testing five (5) Composite samples at
a grind size of ~140 µm (average P80). Results from this testwork showed gold recovery varying between 16% and 40% (SGS
October 27 2009). A gold recovery of 28.3% in gravity was used for the purposes of the PFS.
13.3.2  FS Gravity Recoverable Gold (GRG) Tests
 
Five (5) Composite samples, each weighing about 30 kg, were prepared by SGS from samples used in the PFS and were sent to
Knelson Research & Technology Centre (Knelson January 2010). The objective of the testwork was to quantify GRG in the Joanna
ore as well as its amenability to be recovered through intensive leaching.
The GRG value of an ore sample provides an indication of the amenability of the ore to gravity concentration. The GRG testing
scheme is based on progressive particle size reduction, which allows recovery of gold as liberated while minimizing over grinding.
The GRG test consists of sequential liberation and recovery stages. The E-GRG test includes screen analysis on the concentrates
and last-stage tailings with assays on each size fraction. The total GRG results for each of the composites are shown in Table
13.12.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Table 13.12: GRG Results for Joanna Composites
Sub-samples of the composites were milled and then processed through a KC-MD3 gravity concentration unit to produce gravity
concentrates which were then subjected to 24-hour intensive leach tests. From these intensive leach tests, a gold extraction of
53.4% for Comp 1,2,4,5 and 69.4% for Comp 3 were achieved. These relatively poor results are in agreement with similar testwork
performed during the PFS testwork campaign and are attributed to refractory nature of the ore. Based on these results, the decision
was made not to use intensive cyanidation on the gravity concentrate, but rather upgrade the concentrate using a shaking table and
subject the table tails to oxidation pretreatment along with the flotation concentrate.
13.3.3  Gravity Concentrator Modeling and Equipment Selection
 
The results of the GRG tests for the five (5) Composite samples were used by Knelson to predict the gold recovery that can be
expected by the use of a gravity concentration circuit. Knelson has developed a size-by-size mathematical model to predict gravity
recovery within a grinding circuit. The model has been used numerous times for both greenfield as well as operating plants, which
has allowed Knelson to compare predicted results with actual results. The model is also a very powerful tool for determining the
dominant factor(s) affecting gravity performance, and for optimizing a gravity circuit once it is commissioned. The modeling results
are presented in Figure 13.2.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Figure 13.2: Knelson Gravity Concentration Modeling Results
From the results, it is apparent that over the range modeled, finer grinds and higher flows to gravity concentration yield higher gold
recoveries. Also, the incremental benefits become lower with higher flow rates. For this reason, Knelson recommended diverting
300 t/h or 400 t/h to the gravity concentrators. These flows correspond to two (2) XD-30 units or two (2) XD-40 units (Knelson
December 2009).
The tails from the Knelson concentrator are to be pumped back to the hydrocyclones and most are eventually processed in the
flotation circuit. There was a concern that some of the GRG may be lost in the flotation circuit, therefore it was decided that two (2)
XD-48 units, having the capacity to process 600 t/h, should be used in order to maximize GRG recovery. Furthermore, considering
the marked effect of grind size on GRG recovery, a finer grind was favoured, hence a P80 of 90 microns was the selected grind. By
interpolation, it was estimated that GRG recovery would be in the order of 34.8%. This value was used in the process flowsheet
mass balance.
 
A mass pull in the gravity concentrators of 0.015% was assumed in the process design for development of the mass balances,
based on discussions with Knelson. This figure is typical for the operation of the full-scale units.

13.4.1  PFS Testing
 
The results of the locked cycle flotation tests undertaken for the PFS are presented in Table 13.13 (SGS October 2009). The tests
were performed on the South Zone composite sample (as described in Section 13.1.1). The 5.5% weight recovery for the locked
cycle test was higher than the previous flotation test performed with a cleaner step in open circuit (+/-2.5%). Further optimization
tests to reduce the weight recovery and increase sulphur content, while maintaining gold recovery, were recommended for FS
testwork. Discussions between BBA and SGS indicate that the weight recovery could be decreased by optimizing the flotation
circuit.

13.4.2  Laboratory-Scale Testwork for the FS
 
13.4.2.1  Optimization Program
 
In  an  effort  to  improve  on  the  gold  recovery  and  the  flotation  selectivity  compared  to  the  PFS  testing,  the  Master  Composite
prepared  during  the  PFS  was  subjected  to  a  series  of  rougher  kinetics  and  batch  cleaner  tests  (SGS  March  2010).  Flotation
conditions that were varied included flowsheet configuration, primary grind size as well as reagent suite and dosages.
 
July 2012
13-19
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
A  total  of  four  (4)  rougher  kinetics  tests  were  completed  on  the  Master  Composite.  Based  on  the  results  of  these  tests,  it  was
recommended  that  the  strong  frother  DF250  be  substituted  with  MIBC  because  it  was  found  that  DF250  often  ends  up  in  the
circulating loads during closed circuit operation and creates a froth that is very wet and difficult to control. Furthermore, MIBC is less
expensive and more readily available. The rougher kinetics tests also revealed that between 65% and 85% of the Au units were
recovered during the first four (4) minutes of flotation at S grades between 14% S and 23% S.
A series of eight (8) open circuit batch cleaner tests were also completed on the Master Composite to evaluate different circuit and
reagent configurations. Two (2) main conclusions were drawn from the results of these tests:
§  The best batch-cleaner test results were obtained with a finer primary grind and no regrind stage.
§  As observed in the rougher kinetics tests, the concentrate of the first rougher stage contains a very high proportion of the gold
and  adequately  high  sulphur  content.  In  one  (1)  test,  the  first  incremental  rougher  concentrate  recovered  almost  76%  of  the
Au units and had a concentrate grade of over 20% S, which is well above the minimum grade target of 15% S for the Albion
Process.  This  suggested  that  the  concentrate  from  the  first  rougher  stages  can  bypass  the  cleaner  stages  in  operation  to
increase cleaning capacity for the remaining concentrate and minimize the risk of gold loss in cleaner stages.
13.4.2.2  Locked Cycle Testing
 
A total of ten (10) locked cycle tests (LCT) were completed on the five (5) composites from the PFS (SGS March 2010). Each
composite was subjected to a test at a fine grind size target of P80 = 85µm and a coarse grind size target of P80 = 135 µm. The two
(2) objectives of the LCTs were to evaluate the flotation response of the five (5) composites (i.e. evaluate effect of grind size) in a
closed circuit operation and to produce concentrates for downstream hydrometallurgical testing. The flotation conditions that were
developed in the optimization program were used for the LCTs.

Figure 13.3 compares S grade versus Au recovery for the 2nd cleaner concentrates. With the exception of Composite #5, the finer
grind size produced a superior flotation performance. This difference in performance was most pronounced for composites #1, #2,
and #4. This is in agreement with previous findings. It should be noted that this data was used in subsequent analysis to estimate
flotation performance at intermediate grind sizes.
Figure 13.3: S Grade Versus Au Recovery Points for Locked Cycle Tests
13.4.2.3  Pilot Plant Benchmarking Tests
 
As a prelude to pilot-scale testwork, three (3) batch cleaner tests were carried out on the pilot plant composite for benchmarking
purposes (SGS March 2010). The first two (2) tests used the flotation conditions that were employed in the locked cycle tests at
primary grind size targets of P80 = 85 µm  and P80 = 135 µm, respectively. In the third test, the frother MIBC was substituted by
Dowfroth 250 at the finer primary grind size. The highest Au recovery was obtained for the first test (finer primary grind and MIBC as
the frother). The Au recovery of the second test decreased by 3%, which was likely the result of an inferior liberation as a result of
the coarser primary grind size. The third test, (which used Dowfroth 250 as the frother) produced an inferior flotation selectivity and
the overall Au recovery into the final Au concentrate was lower than the other two (2) tests. The test results of the three (3) open
circuit batch cleaner tests on the pilot plant composites confirmed the choice of a finer primary grind size and the use of MIBC as
preferable flotation conditions for the pilot plant campaign.

13.4.3  Pilot Plant Tests for the Production of Albion Feed
 
The objectives of this testwork were twofold; first, the pilot plant was operated at a larger scale than previously done in order to see
if results previously obtained could be replicated on a larger scale to reduce risks for full plant scale-up and secondly, the pilot plant
was  to  produce  a  relatively  large  quantity  of  concentrate  for  feed  to  pilot  scale  Albion  testwork  (SGS  March  2010).  The  final
concentrate S level was targeted at a minimum 15%, as required for the Albion testwork. The tailings produced in flotation were
kept for subsequent environmental testwork.
The pilot plant composite sample was processed in a pilot-scale gravity separation circuit prior to feeding to the flotation pilot plant.
The gravity concentrate was further processed on a Wilfley table in an effort to upgrade the material. This step removed some of the
GRG from the flotation feed in order to replicate the process flowsheet envisaged.
The flotation pilot plant testwork performed at SGS processed approximately 8.6 tonnes of ore. The flowsheet that was used in the
flotation pilot plant campaign is shown in Figure 13.4.

The average grind feeding the flotation circuit over the course of the test period had a P80 of approximately 77 μm. The pilot plant
campaign used the reagent suite that was developed in the flotation optimization program as follows:
§  PAX – Potassium Amyl Xanthate – Sulphide collector – average 78 g/t;
§  208 – AERO 208 – Au co-collector (Dithiophosphate) – average 26 g/t;
§  MIBC - Methylisobutyl Carbinol – frother – average 127 g/t.
These were added to the rougher and cleaner stages.
The head assays of the last six (6) surveys are shown in Table 13.14. The average adjusted flotation circuit head grade for the
South Zone composite was 0.96 g/t Au. The relative standard deviation of the direct and adjusted head grades for Au was 14.0%
and 12.2%.

The kinetics curves, as shown in Figure 13.5, clearly illustrate that the recovery of Au is complete in the Rougher #5 cell and the
remaining three (3) flotation cells did not significantly improve the gold recovery. Based on the residence time calculations provided
earlier, a rougher flotation time of 20 minutes in the plant appears sufficient to achieve the maximum gold recovery.

13.4.4  Pilot Plant Flotation for the Production of POX Feed
 
Following  the  decision  by  Aurizon  Mines  to  pursue  a  more  detailed  evaluation  of  the  POX  process  for  flotation  concentrate
oxidation prior to cyanide leaching (as an alternative to the Albion Process), flotation concentrate needed to be produced in order to
undertake a pilot scale test program to assess the performance of the POX process on the Joanna ore concentrate. To produce the
quantity of concentrate required for the POX testwork, a pilot scale grinding/gravity/flotation circuit was required. Aurizon Mines
retained the services of Inspectorate to perform this work. A total of 41 t of ore was shipped to the laboratory with the objective of
producing 1.6 t of concentrate (Inspectorate February 2011).
The  flowsheet  for  this  testwork  was  similar  to  the  one  developed  by  SGS  to  produce  the  concentrate  for  the  Albion  pilot  test
program. The main difference between the SGS and Inspectorate flowsheet was that the latter, the second cleaner, was removed.
The  purpose  of  this  cleaner  was  to  assure  a  minimum  concentrate  sulphur  level  of  15%,  which  was  necessary  for  the  Albion
Process but not for POX. The pilot plant circuit set up by Inspectorate consisted of the integration of continuous rod mill grinding
followed by gravity concentration of the rod mill product in a pilot scale Knelson gravity concentrator. The Knelson tails constituted
the feed to the flotation circuit.

The average residence times achieved in the flotation circuit are presented in Table 13.16. It should be noted that flotation kinetics
were not evaluated in this work.
Table 13.16: Pilot Plant Flotation Residence Times
The Inspectorate pilot plant campaign used the same reagent suite that was used in the SGS pilot plant campaign. They are as
follows and were added as required:
§  PAX – Potassium Amyl Xanthate – Sulphide collector – average 50 g/t;
§  208 – AERO 208 – Au co-collector (Dithiophosphate) – average 30 g/t;
§  MIBC - Methylisobutyl Carbinol – frother – average 208 g/t.
As described previously, the ore for the production of the concentrate for POX development was derived from drill core material
(DC) and from reverse circulation material (RC). These were processed separately. The grind of the two (2) ores were similar with a
P80 of 83 µm for the DC ore and 81 µm for the RC ore. The flotation performance results for the DC and RC ores are presented in
Table 13.17 and Table 13.18. The average combined gold recovery for gravity and flotation for the DC material was 88.8% while
that of the RC was 92.3%. It is important to note that Inspectorate operated the gravity/flotation circuit differently than SGS in that
Inspectorate had a much higher mass pull in the gravity concentrator and a lower mass pull in flotation. Also, the behavior of the
DC material was found to be quite different than that of the RC material.

the Inspectorate RC value and all three (3) have similar gold grade at flotation feed. The DC material exhibited a lower flotation
gold recovery explained by the considerably lower flotation feed gold grade and higher gold concentration in the flotation tails.

Originally, the flotation circuit was designed for sulphide oxidation using the Albion Process. This required that design take into
consideration a plant utilization rate of 92.5% and flotation concentrate with a minimum of 15% sulphur. When it was decided that
POX  would  replace  the  Albion  Process,  plant  utilization  was  changed  from  92.5%  to  85%  (based  on  the  availability  of  the
autoclave) and the second cleaner column was removed. The flotation cells and columns were designed to provide the required
nominal residence times as indicated by the testwork results. Based on the flotation kinetics results, the rougher cell configuration
selected is deemed to be conservatively sized and provides flexibility for increased tonnage and/or higher residence time for more
difficult ore.

13.4.6  Flotation Variability Testing
 
The objective of this testwork was to subject ore samples from various areas in the Joanna deposit to similar flotation conditions
and to evaluate how flotation performance varies with ore variation. Each of the twelve (12) Variability Composite samples was
subjected  to  a  locked  cycle  test  (LCT)  using  the  flowsheet  that  is  shown  in  Figure  13.6  (SGS  April  2012).  This  flowsheet  and
reagent regime was based on previous testwork done at SGS. Although the commercial plant design is based on using a flotation
column as the first cleaner, a single stage of cleaning in a conventional cell was used in the LCTs.
Figure 13.6: Flowsheet for Locked Cycle Testing of Variability Samples
In order to generate a consistent feed for the flotation component of the locked cycle test, the entire sample that is required for the
LCT was subjected to a gravity separation stage before splitting it into the flotation test charges. After grinding the sample to a P80
of approximately 85 µm, the mill discharge was treated in a Knelson concentrator followed by upgrading of the Knelson concentrate
on a Mozley table. Mozley tails combined with the Knelson tails and directed to flotation. The results of the LCT on the Variability
samples are summarized in Table 13.20.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The  combined  gravity/flotation  Au  recovery  varied  between  88.9%  and  97.7%  indicating  that  even  with  varying  ore  conditions,
response  to  gravity/flotation  is  fairly  consistent.  Mass  pull,  as  expressed  in  Wt  %,  is  also  generally  well  controlled  however;
statistics are influenced by one (1) outlier, LCT5. Observations made during the test indicated that concentrate appeared to be
unusually slimy, which resulted in high mass pull of 9.5% and low concentrate grade at 8.8 g/t. Sulphur grade average was 14.8%
and ranged between 11.5% and 18.1%, which is well within POX design.
13.5 Cyanide Leaching Process Options Evaluated
13.5.1  Direct Ore Cyanidation
 
Whole ore cyanidation was briefly evaluated during the PFS testwork campaign on the South Zone Composite and the North Zone
Composite.  Results  as  a  whole  were  deemed  to  be  poor  for  both  the  South  Zone  and  North  Zone  Composites,  indicating  a
refractory association of a significant proportion of the contained gold values. North Zone Composite gold extraction (at ~61%) was
approximately 12% higher than South Zone Composite extraction (at 49%). The refractory nature of this material was verified in the
mineralogical evaluation. Based on these results, whole ore cyanidation was not considered further (SGS October 2009).
13.5.2  Fine Grinding of Flotation Concentrate Followed by Cyanidation
 
During the PFS testwork campaign, a program to evaluate the potential to recover gold from reground flotation concentrate was
initiated. The best gold extraction result achieved was 72% under intensive cyanide leaching conditions and at a P80 of 6 µm. This
result further confirmed the refractory nature of the ore and the need for an oxidative pretreatment prior to cyanidation (SGS October
2009).
13.5.3  Oxidation by Albion Process Followed by Cyanidation
 
The PFS for the Joanna Property development was based on using the Albion Process, developed by Xstrata Plc, to oxidize the
refractory concentrate prior to cyanidation. Preliminary testwork results were encouraging and it was recommended in the PFS to
pursue the FS based on the Albion Process (SGS October 2009). A pilot plant Albion test program was defined and undertaken
early during the FS using concentrate produced at SGS as part of the flotation pilot plant testwork.
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The Albion Process combines ultrafine grinding using an IsaMill with oxidative leaching at atmospheric pressure. This process was
deemed to be much more cost effective than the more conventional pressure oxidation process (POX).
During the PFS testwork campaign, a series of tests were carried out by SGS to determine the performance of this process on
samples for the Joanna deposit. The first series of Albion tests was run on rougher concentrate material giving a gold recovery of
about 83% by carbon in leach (CIL) cyanidation. Two (2) additional tests on cleaner concentrate (higher grade gold and sulphide)
gave an average recovery of 92.8% by CIL. This bench scale testwork indicated a high consumption of lime and cyanide however,
Xstrata Technology, based on their experience recommended that a lime consumption of 12 kg per tonne of concentrate and a
cyanide consumption of 6 kg per tonne of oxidized residue be used to estimate actual consumptions for a scaled-up operation.
Prior  to  undertaking  the  full  pilot  scale  testwork,  a  series  of  bench  scale  tests  were  conducted  to  identify  optimal  operating
parameters  by  which  to  conduct  the  pilot  testwork  (Hrltesting  May  2010).  Results  from  these  tests  were  not  encouraging  and
showed relatively low and inconsistent gold recoveries and high acid, lime and cyanide consumptions. The best gold Leachwell
recovery obtained was 90% with an associated 99% sulphide oxidation.
The pilot plant treated approximately 195 kg of concentrate in continuous mode (Hrltesting August 2010). Key parameters were
monitored  regularly  to  ascertain  stability.  Sulphur  oxidation  ranged  from  68  to  94%  and  the  (weight  adjusted)  mean  sulphur
oxidation was 82.5%. The LeachWell gold recoveries ranged from 70 to 96%. Disregarding values that were deemed outliers, for
sulphur oxidation levels in the range of 80.3% – 83.8%, Leach Well gold recovery ranged between 89.4% – 93.9%. The oxidized
product was forwarded to a neutralization reactor train for neutralization with limestone slurry. Gold (LeachWell) recovery from the
neutralized product ranged from 84.6 to 95.7%.
Following the pilot plant oxidation of the concentrate, an extensive test program was undertaken to evaluate and optimize gold
recovery  as  well  as  cyanide  consumption  (Core  Resources  2010).  The  initial  cyanidation  results  were  quite  poor,  with  gold
recovery varying between 70 and 80%. CIL (carbon in leach) was found to perform better than CIP, (carbon in pulp) indicating the
presence of “preg-robbing” constituents. The best results, which approached 90% gold recovery, were achieved by leaching at
higher temperatures, but this came with an extremely high cyanide consumption as well as very high lime consumption.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Considering  the  results  obtained  with  the  Albion  Process,  Aurizon  Mines  decided  to  delay  the  FS  to  allow  for  a  reorientation
towards the POX process.
13.6 Pressure Oxidation (POX) Followed by Cyanidation
 
Pressure  oxidation  (POX)  is  a  process  used  to  oxidize  the  sulphide  matrix  in  refractory  minerals  at  elevated  pressure  and
temperature, causing the contained gold to be more amenable to cyanide leaching. Unlike the Albion Process which relies on
ultrafine grinding followed by atmospheric oxidation, oxidation in the POX process is achieved in a high pressure autoclave, and
does not require ultrafine grinding.
13.6.1  PFS Testing
 
A series of baseline POX tests were initially carried out during the PFS testwork campaign on flotation concentrates to verify the
performance  of  the  POX  process  on  samples  from  the  Joanna  ore  body  (SGS  October  2009).  In  general,  the  POX  tests  were
successful and achieved gold extraction values above 95% by CIL leaching. Cyanide consumption was also considerably lower in
the POX residue leach tests compared to the direct leach of flotation concentrate. The POX option was however not retained for the
PFS  because  of  its  purported  higher  capital  and  operating  costs  relative  to  the  Albion  Process  and  also  because  of  the
encouraging  results  obtained  with  the  Albion  testwork.  One  driving  factor  for  this  decision  was  the  comparison  of  oxygen
consumption which was estimated to be 190 t/d for the POX process and only 26 t/d for the Albion Process, as had been estimated
by Xstrata Technology at the time.
13.6.2  High Level Assessment of the POX Process for the Joanna Ore
 
During the course of the FS Albion Process development, Aurizon Mines contracted a third party consultant with expertise in the
field to undertake an order-of-magnitude study on the applicability of the POX process to the Joanna ore concentrate based on
available testwork data (Hatch July 2010). No testwork specific to this study was undertaken therefore the study was based on data
from previous testwork.
 
July 2012
13-34
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The design basis for the aforementioned study considered a POX plant having a throughput of 350 t/d of flotation concentrate at
17% sulphur. The autoclave design was based on an operating temperature of 225 °C, a retention time of 60 min, an oxygen purity
of 99% and an oxygen partial pressure of 690 kPa(a). It was assumed that 85% sulphur oxidation would be required to achieve
acceptable gold recovery. Plant utilization of 85% was also assumed. Based on these design assumptions, an order of magnitude
estimate of CAPEX and OPEX was developed.
Based on this assessment, Aurizon Mines and BBA came to the decision that the Albion Process should not be pursued further
and that the FS should be based on POX.
13.6.3  Bench-Scale Testing Prior to Pilot Plant Testwork
 
For the FS, Aurizon Mines mandated Sherritt Technologies to undertake testwork and develop the process flowsheet and process
design for the POX area of the processing plant and concentrator (Sherritt May 2011). An advance sample of the Drill Core (DC)
flotation concentrate from the Inspectorate pilot plant testwork was tested initially in the batch test program by Sherritt to determine
the preferred operating conditions for the POX pilot plant campaign.
Chemical assays for the advance sample of DC flotation concentrate are provided in Table 13.21.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The  preliminary  testwork  results  indicated  that  the  concentrate  required  relatively  low  acid  additions  (20  to  50  kg/t)  and  the
concentrate tested in acidulation was highly reactive, resulting in the expected formation of elemental sulphur from the contained
pyrrhotite. Based on these results, Sherritt determined that acidulation was not required and therefore was not included as part of
the POX pilot plant flowsheet.
Thirteen batch POX rate tests were conducted, prior to the pilot plant campaign on the advance DC concentrate sample, in order to
investigate  the  effects  of  feed  particle  size,  pressure  oxidation  temperature,  oxygen  partial  pressure,  retention  time,  chloride
concentration in the leach solution, and solids recycle and to determine the preferred starting conditions in pressure oxidation for
the pilot plant campaign.
Batch pressure oxidation of the advance DC sample gave sulphide oxidations of over 98% within 40 minutes over a wide range of
operating conditions. Corresponding cyanide amenability (CAN) gold extractions from the POX product solids were typically over
96%. The following recommendations for the pilot plant campaign were made based on the results of the batch pressure oxidation
tests:
§  baseline operating conditions of 60 minutes retention time, 220ºC and 500 kPa O2 pressure were selected;
§  additional grinding of the concentrate was not required to achieve higher gold extraction;
§  no  indication  of  “preg-robbing”  behaviour  was  noted  during  pressure  oxidation  with  either  high  chloride  concentrations  in
solution or with a solids recycle;
§  no solids recycle was suggested in the pilot plant testing due to the limited duration of the pilot plant campaign and the decision
to test two feed materials;
§  no appreciable difference was noted between the CNA gold extraction or the sulphate content of the solids for solids before and
after conditioning for the DC materials and a relatively short conditioning time of 20 to 30 minutes was selected for continuous
testing.
Additional batch POX tests were performed prior to continuous testing to determine the behaviour of the pilot plant feed samples
from Inspectorate and table tails materials under the selected pressure oxidation conditions for the pilot plant campaign.
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Batch pressure oxidation of the pilot plant feed samples under the defined test conditions resulted in sulphide oxidation of over
97.5% within 40 minutes. Corresponding CNA gold extractions were typically over 96% for the DC concentrate and up to 92% for
the RC concentrate. The low gold extractions for the RC material led to the consideration of longer retention times in pressure
oxidation (i.e., greater than 60 minutes) and higher temperatures (230ºC) for the test conditions of the pilot plant campaign. The
CNA leaching conditions used for the batch test samples, including 24 h of leaching, were retained for the pilot plant campaign.
Two (2) solution neutralization batch rate tests were conducted on selected solutions that were produced in the POX batch tests.
Good removal of acid and metals from the POX solutions was achieved in the two solution neutralization tests using the staged
addition of limestone and lime. Based on the batch test results, a target final pH 9 and retention time of five to six hours were
selected for the solution neutralization circuit in the pilot plant.
The settling behavior of the feed concentrate and POX solids were evaluated in batch tests prior to continuous testing and were
both very good. The settled solids density from the POX batch settling test was used to determine initial target wash water flows to
the countercurrent decantation (CCD) wash circuit for the pilot plant campaign.
13.6.4  Pilot Plant
 
The pilot plant operations carried out by Sherrit commenced at 6:00 pm on February 22nd, 2011 and ended at 12:00 am on March
1st (Sherritt 2011). The analyses of the feed concentrates (DC and RC) are presented in Table 13.22.
The pressure oxidation pilot plant operation was divided into five (5) periods, based on concentrate type (DC or RC), autoclave
temperature (220 or 230°C), and retention time (60 or 75 min). Cyanidation tests were performed on selected POX solids samples
throughout the campaign. The block flow diagram for the pilot plant is shown in Figure 13.7.

13.6.4.1  Feed Material
 
Two (2) types of feed material were treated in the pilot plant campaign, which were generated from material produced by reverse
circulation  (RC)  drilling  near  the  top  of  the  Joanna  deposit  and  an  overall  composite  of  drill  core  (DC).  These  materials  were
processed at Inspectorate to produce flotation concentrate and table tails samples for both the RC and DC materials. Each of the
flotation concentrate and corresponding table tails were blended to produce a homogeneous feed for each concentrate type. The
compositions of each of the concentrate types, constituting the feed blends for the POX pilot plant are shown in Table 13.22. The
particle size of the feed blend was in the order of 74% to 83% passing 88 μm. The DC and RC concentrates were re-pulped to 66%
and 68% solids respectively.

Results indicate that for both the DC and RC concentrates, sulphide oxidation is superior at the higher retention time (75 min). For
RC, the combination of higher temperature and lower retention time (60 min) is equivalent to lower temperature combined with
higher retention time. Overall gold extraction was improved for the RC concentrate by operating at a longer retention time or higher
temperature,  but  average  gold  extraction  from  the  conditioning  tank  solids  was  typically  88  to  90%  when  treating  the  RC
concentrate under these conditions. Gold extraction was higher for the DC concentrate at 93 to 94% on average for the conditioning
tank solids. In both cases, lower gold extractions were obtained in cyanide leaching of the solids from continuous test solids, than
were obtained in the batch test program.
A  strong  relationship  between  the  extent  of  sulphur  oxidation  and  gold  extraction  was  observed  for  the  DC  concentrate.  This
relationship was not as clear for the RC concentrate and it appeared that a small quantity of organic carbon in the RC concentrate
was also affecting gold extraction. High gold extraction for the RC concentrate was not typically achieved until most of the sulphur
and organic carbon were oxidized in the autoclave. Organic carbon decomposition was enhanced at 230ºC.
Based on the results from this testwork, it was concluded that plant design should be based on a 70-minute retention time and
220ºC autoclave operating temperature.
 
13.6.4.3  Conditioning
 
The pilot plant autoclave discharge slurry passed through a conditioning tank with a retention time of 20 to 30 minutes. Samples of
this conditioned slurry were held at temperature in a small batch reactor during the pilot test campaign to investigate the effect of
extended conditioning time. Conditioning times of up to 4 h did not significantly affect the gold extraction from the conditioned
solids, but a longer retention time would be beneficial for decomposing more of the basic sulphates in the POX solids prior to the
CCD wash circuit. Sulphate in solids was overall quite low, at between 2.5 and 3.5%, resulting in relatively low lime consumption
in cyanidation of about 10 to 12 kg/t.
 
July 2012
13-40
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Based on the results, and the possibility of more sulphate in the pressure oxidation solids in commercial practice, for which the feed
is expected to have higher sulphur content, a conditioning tank retention time of 120 minutes was recommended for the commercial
plant.
13.6.4.4  Counter Current Decantation (CCD)
 
All of the conditioning tank discharge slurry from the pressure oxidation circuit was washed with water to start and neutralization
thickener overflow solution once steady state was achieved in a countercurrent decantation (CCD) wash circuit in order to remove
the bulk of the acid from the POX solids prior to cyanidation for gold recovery.
Overflow solution from the first wash thickener was forwarded to the solution neutralization circuit for neutralization of acid and
precipitation  of  contained  metals.  Subsamples  of  the  third  wash  thickener  underflow  slurry  were  taken,  further  washed  and
subjected to cyanidation tests to determine gold extractions.
The acid concentration in the wash circuit solutions depended on the feed acid and the wash ratio. The desired extent of washing
in the CCD circuit (i.e., to the target of 2.5 g/L H2SO4 in the final thickener underflow solution) was generally met or exceeded
using a wash ratio of about 2.8. If two (2) thickeners were to be used commercially, a higher wash ratio would be required.
The POX solids settled well in the CCD wash circuit to about 50% solids, with little difference observed between the final solids
content of the underflow slurry when processing POX slurry was produced from the RC and DC blends. Between 97 and 99% of
the sulphuric acid and metal salts were washed from the conditioning tanks discharge slurry during the pilot plant campaign. The
results are summarized in Table 13.24.

13.6.4.5  Neutralization
 
In the neutralization step, acid wash solution from the CCD was reacted with limestone and slaked lime in two (2) stages at 80°C
to neutralize the free acid and precipitate metals. The solution neutralization circuit consisted of a solution feed tank, slurry feed
tanks for limestone and lime, and a series of five (5) stirred tank reactors in series followed by a thickener.
Overflow  solution  from  the  neutralization  thickener  was  forwarded  to  the  CCD  wash  circuit  to  serve  as  wash  solution.  The
underflow from the solution neutralization thickener was collected in pails.
The solution neutralization (NE) wash circuit was operated for a total of 113 h. Circuit operation was divided into five (5) periods,
based on the changes in the POX operating conditions. Average values of the operating parameters and important results are
summarized by period in Table 13.25.

Once steady operation was achieved in Period 2, limestone consumption was between 90 and 200 kg of limestone per tonne of
feed to the POX circuit to give a pH in Tank 2 of 4.4 to 4.9. Limestone utilization was high, between 94 and 98%. Lime consumption
was between 36 and 47 kg per tonne of feed to the POX circuit, resulting in a pH in Tank 5 of 8.5 to 8.6.
Optimization in the control of the pH in the second stage of neutralization during commercial operation could allow for a better
balance between limestone and lime addition.
During the pilot plant campaign, all elements analyzed, except for calcium and magnesium, were precipitated to near or below the
detection limit. Arsenic in the thickener overflow solution was about 1 mg/L.
 
13.6.4.6  Cyanidation
 
Selected pressure oxidation and countercurrent decantation (CCD) wash circuit slurry samples were collected at regular intervals
throughout  the  pilot  plant  campaign  for  cyanidation  testing.  The  objectives  were  to  determine  gold  extractions  and  reagent
consumptions in the cyanidation of the oxidized solids.

CNA tests at low pulp density and without intermediate sampling provide information on the ultimate gold extractions achievable. A
total of 213 CNA tests were conducted, with excess  cyanide  relative  to  the  small  quantity  of  solids,  and  with  activated  carbon
present, in small roll bottles for 24 h.
Larger  scale  bottle-roll  cyanidation  rate  tests  in  CIL  or  CIP  modes  were  conducted  at  higher  pulp  density  and  with  cyanide
additions  more  representative  of  commercial  operation.  This  type  of  test  provides  more  accurate  information  on  reagent
requirements and consumption than do the smaller-scale CNA tests. A total of 22 CIL and 10 CIP tests were conducted during the
pilot plant campaign. Results are shown in Figure 13.8.
Figure 13.8: Comparison of CNA, CIL and CIP Gold Extraction Values
There was generally good agreement between the CNA, CIL and CIP extraction results. No significant difference in gold extraction
was observed between the CIL and CIP tests, indicating little, if any evidence of preg-robbing behavior of the POX solids.
Gold extraction typically reached between 88 and 90% for the RC concentrate and up to 94% for DC concentrate. Gold extraction
was nearly complete after 24 h during high pulp density CIL tests. Operating for extended cyanide leach times (i.e., up to 72 h)
increased  gold  extractions  between  0.5  and  2%,  but  required  significantly  higher  lime  and  NaCN  additions.  Higher  cyanide
concentrations in cyanide leaching did not significantly increase gold extraction, but increased cyanide consumption.

13.6.5  Post-Pilot Plant Batch Tests
 
Following the pilot plant campaign, two (2) additional batch POX tests were also conducted  in order to investigate the low gold
extractions  observed  for  the  RC  concentrate.  Additional  grinding  of  the  RC  concentrate  improved  the  CNA  gold  extraction  by
1 to 2%. Blending of the RC and DC concentrates resulted in lower overall CNA gold extraction than was obtained by treating the
materials separately, indicating that blending may not be a good option to try to improve the gold recovery for the RC concentrate.
13.6.6  POX Design Parameters
 
13.6.6.1  Sulphur Head Grade
 
The function of the POX process is to oxidize sulphur. Therefore, it is important to determine the sulphur content of the material to
be  processed  there.  To  do  so  the  sulphur  content  of  the  DC  and  RC  concentrates  were  analyzed.  Table  13.26  shows  the
distribution of sulphur in the two (2) concentrate types.

-  “Design;” sulphur content based on 80th percentile (1.0%);
§  Flotation recovery;
-  5% overall weight recovery;

It was decided against designing for high feed rate combined with high sulphur since this would be exceptional and would result in
needlessly overdesigning the oxygen plant. Design Case 1 has the highest throughput and is therefore used for vessel sizing (for
residence time) whereas Design Case 2 requires the highest rate of sulphur oxidation and is therefore used to size the oxygen
plant and the cooling systems.
 
13.6.6.2  POX Plant Design
 
Based on the positive pilot plant results, the POX process was retained as the oxidation technology for the purposes of this FS.
Table  13.28  summarizes  the  design  parameters  developed  by  Sherrit  for  the  POX  process  design.  It  should  be  noted  that  the
pressure  in  the  autoclave  during  the  pilot  testing  was  2,720  kPa(gauge),  while  in  the  commercial  plant  design  it  is  based  on
3,000 kPa(gauge) (Sherritt March 2012). This is because lower purity oxygen produced by a VPSA oxygen plant will be used in the
commercial plant and the higher autoclave pressure is required to maintain the same partial pressure of oxygen in the autoclave. A
high purity cryogenic oxygen plant was considered but the VPSA plant proved to be a more cost effective solution.

13.6.6.3  Cyanidation
 
The design of the cyanide leaching circuit was based on a CIP-type circuit as no “preg-robbing” behavior was exhibited in the
leaching tests on the pilot plant samples. The residence time in the cyanide leaching portion of the circuit was selected to be
48 hours. The Pumpcell technology by Kemix was selected for use as the activated carbon adsorption portion of the circuit. This
technology allows the circuit to be operated in a carousel mode of operation as described in detail in Section 17 of this Report. The
sizing of this portion of the circuit was performed by the Vendor based on operating parameters provided. The design parameters
for the leaching and CIP circuit are presented in the Table 13.29.

13.7 Thickener Testwork
 
13.7.1  Flotation Concentrate and Tailings Thickeners
 
Testwork  was  undertaken  by  Outotec  in  May  2010  using  samples  from  SGS  to  determine  design  parameters  for  the  flotation
concentrate and flotation tailings thickeners.
The Flocculant Flomin 905 MC showed the most efficient flocculation and fastest settling at dosages of 50 and 15 g/t for both
tailings and concentrate samples, respectively.
The tailings sample exceeded the targeted underflow density, achieving 60.8% w/w solids at a solids loading rate of 0.81 t/m2h.
The overflow clarity of 200 ppm TSS was achieved.
The concentrate sample achieved the highest underflow density of 64.6% w/w solids at a solids loading rate of 0.25 t/m2h.
13.7.2  POX Area Thickeners
 
Liquid  solid  separation  tests  were  carried  out  by  Pocock  Industrial,  on  behalf  of  Sherritt,  on  the  POX  discharge  slurry  and  the
solution neutralization discharge slurry during the pilot plant campaign (Sherrit May 2011).
Thickening tests from four (4) operating periods were performed on POX discharge slurries in order to determine the recommended
maximum hydraulic design basis for high rate thickener design. There appeared to be relatively minor effects of POX parameter
variations on the thickening characteristics. Results are summarized in Table 13.30.

13.8 Cyanide Destruction
 
Various cyanide destruction options, including Caro’s acid, SO2/Air and CombinOx processes, were investigated on a laboratory
scale  for  treatment  of  slurry  effluent  samples  from  the  Joanna  Project.  The  ore  sample  was  shipped  to  Cyanco  Corporation’s
laboratory in Piscataway, New Jersey in June 2011 (Cyanco August 2011).
Performance and reagent consumption data for each process were compared using a weak acid dissociable cyanide (CNWAD)
treatment target of 20 ppm or less, while also recognizing the 20 ppm total cyanide (CNT) limit. All three (3) of the processes tested
(Caro’s Acid, SO2/AIR and CombinOx) were successful in reducing the CNWAD to levels at or below the target.
The 20 ppm CNT limit could be met using all the processes tried when treating more typical effluents with soluble iron levels
around 1 ppm. However, due to the elevated iron cyanide levels in one (1) of the feed samples, over 10 ppm Fe, the CNT limit
could not be met using the same processes. By adding more copper and reducing the pH, it was possible to meet the CNT limit for
the high iron sample for both Caro’s Acid and SO2/AIR.
OPEX  and  CAPEX  estimates  were  prepared  by  Cyanco  for  the  three  (3)  processes  based  on  the  results  of  the  testwork.  The
SO2/Air process was recommended by Cyanco because although it was the least economical in terms of OPEX, it had a much
lower CAPEX than the other processes. For plant design, the SO2/Air system was designed with a residence time of 4 hrs.

13.9 Gold Recovery
13.9.1  Effect of Particle Grind Size on Overall Gold Recovery
 
An analysis was performed to quantify the effect of particle grind size on gold recovery. The results of the gravity circuit modeling
performed by Knelson and flotation tests, show that the grind size has an important effect on recovery in these process areas.
Modeling of the gravity circuit predicted that at a 600 tph feed rate, the gravity gold recovery at a P80 of 135 µm would be in the
order of 26.4% while a P80 of 85 µm  gravity gold recovery would be 35.7%. When comparing flotation locked cycle test results at a
feed P8 0 in  the  range  of  73-83  µm  to  test  results  in  the  range  of  100-127  µm  ,  it  was  observed  that  for  the  finer  grind  range,
approximately 1% higher gold recovery is achieved.
As  the  gold  recovery  in  the  gravity  circuit  varies,  the  head  grade  to  the  flotation  circuit  varies  accordingly.  Therefore,  the  gold
recovery model needs to take this into consideration. Because of the complexity of the interactions between these two (2) process
areas and the rest of the process, simulations were carried out to estimate the impact of grind size on overall recovery. Simulations
were carried out at various P80 product sizes between 75 and 135 µm. The following assumptions were made to estimate the
recovery in the individual process areas:
§  A head grade of 1.3 g/t
§  The modeled gold recovery in the gravity circuit was interpolated linearly between 85 µm and 135 µm, and extrapolated to 75 µm
using the same slope.
§  The gold recovery in the shaking tables treating the Knelson concentrate to achieve further concentration was assumed to be
60%. The tails from the shaking tables are sent directly to the oxidation stage by-passing flotation.
§  The concentration of gold obtained in the pilot plant tailings was used as a reference. This result was then corrected for coarser
grinds by taking an equivalent feed grade to flotation. The recovery for 135 µm primary grind was assumed to be 1% lower than
for 75 µm, (based on locked cycle testing results). The resulting flotation tails concentration was then taken and used to calculate
the recovery for that grind size based on the feed grade obtained from the gravity concentrator. The same method was applied to
the intermediate grinds, however, the 1% correction was interpolated towards zero at 75 µm.

§  Recovery in oxidation and cyanidation was assumed to be 92.5%.

The results of the simulation show that the overall recovery may vary by 1% over the range of grind sizes evaluated.
Following a high level analysis of incremental capital and operating costs associated with finer grinding, a decision was taken to
choose a P80 of 90 µm as the grinding circuit product size.

13.9.2  Gravity Circuit Gold Recovery
 
In order to estimate the gold recovery in the gravity circuit for the selected throughput of 600 t/h and grind size P80 of 90 µm, the
average recoveries generated from the Knelson modeling results previously presented in this section were interpolated linearly
between the points at 85 and 135 µm. A gold recovery of 34.8 % in the gravity concentration circuit was determined and used for
the FS.
It was further assumed that the Knelson product will be further concentrated using shaking tables and gold recovery in the shaking
table concentrate is in the order of 60% of the gold in the shaking table feed. Shaking table concentrate is directed to the melting
furnace where 100% of the gold is assumed to be recovered. The shaking table tails contain the gold not recovered in the shaking
table concentrate, this stream is directed to the POX feed.
13.9.3  Flotation Gold Recovery
 
The gold which is not extracted by the aforementioned gravity circuit is directed with the ground ore to the flotation circuit. As was
previously indicated, the average gold recovery in the SGS flotation pilot plant was 90.7% at 4.33% weight recovery. In order to
establish the gold recovery at nominal conditions, it was necessary to adjust gold recovery for the following factors:
§  The average gold concentration of the pilot plant feed ore was 1.34 g/t versus the average head grade in the mine plan for the
LOM, which is 1.26 g/t.
§  In the SGS pilot plant, gold recovery at the gravity circuit was 27% while the value adopted for the FS was 34.8%.
§  Average P80 of the feed in the pilot plant was 77 µm versus the adopted plant design P80 of 90 µm.
§  To achieve the required sulphur concentration in the Albion concentrate , the pilot plant was operated using two-stage cleaning
resulting in a 4.33% weight recovery and 88.9% gold recovery. Considering that sulphur target for POX is lower, plant design
requires only one-stage cleaning. It was estimated that the weight recovery would be in the order of 5% and gold recovery would
increase slightly to 89.15%.

13.9.4  POX Gold Recovery
 
As  previously  discussed,  testwork  results  indicated  that,  at  the  sulphide  oxidations  achieved,  gold  extraction  in  cyanidation
following POX typically reached up to 94% for the DC concentrate and between 88 and 90% for the RC concentrate. Considering
that the majority of the Joanna ore deposit is better represented by the DC ore, it was determined that in the commercial operation,
under  stable  conditions,  recoveries  will  approach  the  higher  end  of  what  was  observed  in  the  pilot  plant  operation.  For  the
purposes of the FS, it was estimated that the gold recovery in the CIP stage following POX will be in the order of 92.5%.
13.9.5  Overall Gold Recovery
 
By consolidating the gold recoveries for the individual process areas previously mentioned, the overall gold recovery at nominal
conditions was estimated to be in the order of 87.5%. Figure 13.9 presents gold recoveries in the various process areas for nominal
operating conditions.
July 2012
Figure 13.9: Overall Gold Recovery
13-55
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The previous analysis was performed to estimate gold recovery under nominal conditions, including and average LOM gold head
grade of 1.26 g/t. In reality however, the head grade is not constant and varies with the mine plan. In order to adjust overall gold
recovery to varying mine head grade, a gold recovery versus head grade curve was developed and is presented in Figure 13.10.
To generate this curve, it was assumed that the recovery in gravity and in post-POX CN leaching is constant. Flotation recovery
was not assumed to be constant but rather, for flotation it was assumed that the flotation tailings had a fixed gold concentration of
0.10 g/t.
It should be noted that this curve is only considered to be valid for gold head grades above approximately 1.0 g/t; below this value,
gravity gold recovery may not be constant.

14  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE
 
14.1 Introduction
 
This section reports the results of a mineral resource estimate for the Hosco deposit updated to September 22, 2011, which is
based on new analytical data sampled from the drilling completed since the previous mineral resource estimate. The previous
mineral resource estimate was completed by SGS Geostat and was disclosed in the Company news release dated June 13, 2011..
The  new  mineral  resource  estimate  is  now  defined  based  on  two  distinct  mining  scenarios,  open-pit  and  underground,  using
distinct base case gold cut-off grade.
As described in the Company’s June 13, 2011 news release, as the updated resource outline of the Hosco deposit disclosed in the
news release crossed over the Alexandria claim boundary, all the resources of the Alexandria sector were restated. However, the
Alexandria resource estimate was not updated in June 2011. The restated mineral resource estimate for the Alexandria sector
disclosed by the Company on June 13, 2011 is used in this Report.
Also as described in the Company’s June 13, 2011 news release, the mineral resources of the Heva deposit were not updated at
that time but were restated using a modified cut-off grade for the mineral resources located below 300 m from surface. The Heva
deposit mineral resources were restated as disclosed by the Company on June 13, 2011 (date of restatement: May 31, 2011) to
better reflect the reasonable prospect of economic extraction in relation to the advanced stage of exploration of the Hosco deposit
located to the east. The restated mineral resource estimate for the Heva deposit disclosed by the Company on June 13, 2011 is
used in this Report.
The mineral resource has been estimated by Maxime Dupéré P.Geo., Geologist for SGS Geostat. Mr. Dupéré is a professional
geologist registered with the Ordre des Géologues du Québec and has worked in exploration for gold and diamonds, silver, base
metals and iron ore. The author has been involved in mineral resource estimation work over different gold deposits on a continuous
basis since he joined SGS Canada Inc. in 2006, which includes the participation in mineral resource estimate for the Joanna gold
project in 2011. Mr. Dupéré is an independent Qualified Person as per Section 1.4 of the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for
Mineral Projects with respect to the owner of the mineral titles included in the Property.

14.2 Hosco Deposit Resource Estimate
 
SGS Geostat conducted the current mineral resource estimate for the Hosco sector using historical underground channels and
drillholes,  selected  historical  surface  drillholes  and  updated  surface  drillhole  data  compiled  from  the  2007  to  2011  exploration
programs conducted by Aurizon. The database used to produce the mineral resource estimate is derived from a total of 755 recent
surface drillholes, 109 historical surface drillholes and 3,243 historical underground channels or drillholes and contains the collar,
survey,  lithology,  and  analytical  results  information.  The  database  cut-off  date  is  August  26,  2011.  The  database  includes  21
additional surface drillholes from the previous resources estimation disclosure dated June 13th, 2011 located in the Hosco West
sector  between  7000  mE  and  7650  mE.  Please  refer  Section  12 for  a  summary  of  the  records  contained  in  the  final  drillhole
database.
The lateral extension (east-west direction) of the Hosco block models has been modified since the last mineral resource estimation
and is now defined within sections 7,000 mE and 10,000 mE of the Project. The mineral resource estimate for the Hosco deposit is
derived from two distinct computerised resource block models: a constrained high grade block model and a residual low grade
block model. The construction of the high grade block model begins with the modelling of 3D wireframe envelopes or solids of the
mineralization  based  on  defined  mineralised  intercepts  from  channels  and  drillholes.  Once  the  modelling  is  complete,  the
analytical data contained within the wireframe solids is normalised to generate fixed length composites. Composite data capped to
a defined Au grade is used to interpolate the grade of blocks regularly spaced on a defined grid that fills the 3D wireframe solids.
The interpolated blocks located below the bedrock/overburden interface and outside known barren geological features comprise
the high grade mineral resources. For the low grade model, the blocks are interpolated using composite data located outside the
3D wireframe solid defined for the high grade block model. Mineral resources of the low grade block model are defined using the
same process as with the high grade model. The final mineral resources comprise both high and low grade block models. The
blocks for both models are then classified based on confidence level using proximity to composites, composite grade variance and
mineralised solids geometry. The 3D wireframe modelling, block models and mineral resource estimation were conducted by SGS
Geostat based on information provided by Aurizon.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The mineral resources of the Hosco deposit have been reported with two distinct mining scenarios: open-pit and underground
mining perspectives. The open-pit mineral resources are reported within a Whittle pit shell optimised using the measured, indicated
and inferred categories of the estimated global block model. The pit optimisation parameters have been supplied by Aurizon Mines
and  are  based  on  the  parameters  used  in  the  project’s  Prefeasibility  Study.  The  base  case  cut-off  grade  for  the  in-pit  mineral
resources using a gold price of US$1,000 per oz Au is 0.33 g/t Au. The base case cut-off grade for the underground (“U/G”) mineral
resources at Hosco has been set at 2.0 g/t Au and is based on a conceptual U/G mining model completed by SGS Geostat. The
reported U/G mineral resources are exclusive of the in-pit mineral resources.
Important Note: During the mineral resource estimation process, different assumptions were made. These assumptions were used
in  order  to  calculate  modelling  cut-off  grades  and  resources  cut-off  grades  following  the  “reasonable  prospect  for  economic
extraction” stated by the NI 43-101 regulation. A Whittle optimised shell was done with the same parameters as described in Table
14.5.  The  term  in-pit  refers  to  the  resources  within  the  optimised  shell  according  to  the  different  cut-off  grades.  The  term
underground  (U/G)  refers  to  a  conceptual  U/G  mining  model  completed  in-house  by  SGS  Geostat.  The  terms  in-pit  and
Underground (U/G) do not imply that any pit design and underground mining scenarios were done by SGS Geostat. Furthermore, it
should not imply that the resources stated herein have demonstrated economic viability.
14.2.1  Exploratory Data Analysis
 
14.2.1.1  Analytical Data
 
Most of the drillhole intervals defining the modelled mineralised solids have been sampled continuously. The sampling gaps where
no  analytical  data  is  reported  relates  to  early  exploration  holes  from  the  historical  drilling  programs.  The  sampling  gaps  in  the
mineralised intervals were considered having zero grade for the purpose of the block model interpolation process. There are a total
of 127,773 assay intervals with an assigned Au value reported in the database used for the current mineral resource estimate. The
grade distribution of the Au assay data is lognormal with more than one Au grade population observed in the data. Table 14.1
summarises the statistics of the Au assays reported in the drillhole database. Figure 14.1 shows the histogram of the Au assay
data. Assays containing -1 and 0 grade values were not considered in this histogram.

14.2.1.2  Composite Data
 
Block model grade interpolation is conducted on composited assay data. A composite length of 2 m has been selected to reflect the
5  m  N-S  thickness  of  the  block  size  defined  for  the  resource  block  model.  Compositing  is  conducted  from  the  start  of  each
mineralized intercept (HG mineralization) or in bedrock (LG mineralization) of drillholes or channels. The last composite kept at the
end  of  the  mineralised  Intercept  (HG  mineralization)  or  the  hole  (LG  mineralization)  has  a  minimum  length  of  1  m.  Composite
grades were capped at 15 g/t which represent a gold loss of 5.2% from 73 composites capped. The first 1% of the highest Au grade
final capped composites (190 composites) represents 8.0% of the contained metal versus 13.3% before capping.

At total of 19,214 composites were generated for the high grade block model and 84,980 composites for the low grade block model
for a total of 104,194 composites. The modeled 3D wireframe envelopes of the high grade mineralization were used to constrain
the high grade composites. The low grade composites are generated outside the 3D wireframe envelopes. Table 14.2 summarises
the statistics of the capped high grade and low grade composite data. Figure 14.2 shows the histogram of the composites for the
low grade and high grade composite. Figure 14.3 shows cumulative frequency plots of the high grade composite data with the

14.2.2  Geological Interpretation
 
SGS Geostat conducted the interpretation and modelling of the 3D wireframe envelopes of the high grade Au mineralization in
collaboration  with  Aurizon  personnel.  The  interpretation  was  first  completed  on  sections  to  define  mineralised  prisms  using
Au assays and based on observed mineralised zones. A minimum Au grade of 0.5 g/t over a minimum drillhole interval length of
4  to  5  m  was  generally  used  as  guideline  to  define  the  width  of  the  mineralised  prisms.  The  final  3D  wireframe  model  was
constructed on a bench by bench basis by connecting the defined mineralised prisms based on geological interpretation. A bench
height of 8 m was used for the wireframe model which corresponds to the thickness of the blocks in the resource block models.
 
A  bedrock-overburden  interface  3D  surface  has  been  generated  by  triangulating  the  lower  intercepts  of  the  overburden-coded
lithology field of the drillhole database. Finally, 3D wireframe solids of known barren late intrusive units observed crossing the
deposit were modelled. Resource blocks located above the bedrock-overburden interface and falling within the wireframe solids
defining the late intrusive units were removed from the final mineral resource estimate. The barren late intrusives correspond to
two, 10 to 60 m wide, NNE-SSW to NE-SW diabase dykes, steeply dipping to the WNW. The easternmost dyke is encountered
around 9400 mE with varying direction from NNE-SSW to NE-SW and another is encountered from around 7475 mE to 7600 mE.
The westernmost dyke is cut by the regional Cadillac fault with a sinistral displacement of approximately 200 m. The trace of these
dykes is shown on Figure 14.7, Figure 14.11, and Figure 14.13
Figure 14.6 and Figure 14.7 shows the contour of the final mineralized solids and the mineralized intervals used for the modelling
on representative sections and plan levels (late intrusive units shown in orange).

14.2.3  Spatial Analysis
 
In June 2011, the spatial continuity of the high grade Au composites was assessed by variography. Experimental correlograms,
which are the calculated correlation coefficient of grade from composite pairs separated by a given distance for a given direction,
have  been  generated  for  2  m  composite  data.  Table  14.3  presents  the  June  2011  experimental  variogram  model.  The  spatial
continuity outlined by the variography is characterised by: 1) a relative nugget effect of 40%, 2) a relatively strong anisotropy with
the best continuity along the dip direction (up to 25-30 m range) corresponding to the general dipping orientation of the high grade
3D envelopes, and worst continuity in the north-south direction across deposit.

In September 2011, as before, correlograms were computed for the cut grade of the 19,214 of 2 m composites in the high grade
envelope. They are computed in all directions together (average variogram with lag of 2 m) as well as along the principal directions
of the mineralized zones i.e. (1) the average direction of surface drillholes (dip of 45° to south with lag of 2m) (2) the average
horizontal strike (azimuth N80° with 5m lags) (3) the average dip (dip of 50° to N350° with 5m lags) (4) the horizontal NS (azimuth
N0° with lags of 5m).
Experimental curves and fitted models are shown on Figure 14.8. As expected, they closely resemble those of the previous study
i.e., relative nugget effect is 40% and continuity is better along dip and strike than across. Like before, the fitted model is the sum of
that nugget effect of 40% plus a short range (local) component of 40% magnitude and a long range (regional) component of 20%
magnitude. Ranges of the local component are about 15 m along dip, 10 m along strike and 5 m across dip and strike (vs. 10 m,
10 m and 5 m in the previous model) while the ranges of the regional component are about 90 m along dip, 60 m along strike and
15 m across dip+strike (vs. 90 m, 15 m and 10 m in the previous model). In other words, the long distance continuity along strike is
more extensive in comparison to the previous study in which correlograms were computed on the uncapped grade of composites.

14.2.4  Resource Block Modelling
 
A block size of 8 m (E-W) by 5 m (N-S) by 8 m (vertical) has been selected for the resource block models based on drillhole
spacing,  width  and  geometry  of  mineralization,  and  mining  bench  height  defined  in  the  Prefeasibility  Study.  The  high  grade
resource block model which is constrained by the 3D wireframe solids contains a total of 93,509 blocks located outside the defined
intrusive units and below the bedrock-overburden surface. The maximum volume of the high grade block model totals more than
29,923,000  m3.  The  low  grade  block  model  defines  the  area  located  outside  the  high  grade  3D  wireframe  solids,  below  the
bedrock-overburden surface and outside the defined intrusive unit limits. The low grade block model has not been constrained by
other  3D  wireframe  envelopes  but  is  limited  to  the  defined  block  model  maximum  extent  limits  shown  in  Table  14.5.  The
coordinates used relate to the old mine grid parameters.
Table 14.5: Resource Block Model Parameters
14.2.5  Grade Interpolation Methodology
 
The  grade  interpolation  for  the  Project  resource  block  models  was  completed  using  Ordinary  Kriging  methodology  (“OK”).
Anisotropic search ellipsoids were selected for the grade interpolation process based on the analysis of the spatial continuity of
capped high grade Au composites using variography. Limits are set for the minimum and maximum number of composites to be
used for the interpolation and restrictions are applied on the number of composites used from each drillhole.
The interpolation process for the high grade block model was conducted using three (3) successive passes with relaxed search
conditions from one pass to the next until all blocks were interpolated. The orientation of the search ellipsoid, which is identical for
each interpolation pass is N350° azimuth, negative -55° dip and 0°spin. Figure 14.9 shows the different ellipsoids used during the
interpolation process.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Figure 14.9: Different Search Ellipsoids Used for the Interpolation Process
In the first pass, the search ellipsoid dimension was 50 m (long axis) along strike, 35 m (intermediate axis) along dip and 10 m
(short axis) along the direction perpendicular to strike and dip. The shape of the ellipsoid corresponds to the anisotropy of the
correlogram.  Search  conditions  required  to  estimate  each  block  were  defined  by  a  minimum  of  seven  (7)  composites  and  a
maximum of 30 composites with a maximum of three (3) composites selected from each hole or channel. Sixty-three percent (63%)
of the blocks were estimated in the first pass.
In the second pass, the search ellipsoid dimension was increased to 100 m by 100 m by 30 m with a reduction of the anisotropy.
The search conditions were the same as the first pass interpolation. The second pass resulted in the interpolation of 30% of the
blocks.
The third interpolation pass estimated the remaining blocks (7% of total). The ellipsoid dimension for the last pass was increased to
200 m by 200 m by 100 m with search conditions defined as a 30 composite maximum and a three (3) composite minimum with a
maximum number of composites per hole set to three (3).

The  interpolation  process  for  the  low  grade  block  model  was  limited  to  two  (2)  successive  passes  using  the  same  ellipsoid
dimensions and search conditions as defined for the high grade block model. A total of 310,824 blocks were interpolated during the
first pass and a total of 838,481 blocks were populated after the second pass. The low grade block model resulted in only 154,927
blocks having Au grades above 0.1 g/t. Figure 14.10 and Figure 14.11 show the interpolation results on representative sections
and plan levels (late intrusive units shown in orange outline).

14.2.6  Mineral Resource Classification
 
The mineral resources at Hosco are classified into measured, indicated and inferred categories. The parameters used to determine
the  mineral  resources  classification  follow  the  CIM  requirements  and  guidelines.  The  mineral  resources  were  classified  in  two
successive stages: automated classification followed by manual editing of the final resource categories.
 
July 2012
14-16
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The  first  classification  stage  is  conducted  by  applying  an  automated  classification  process  around  each  block  that  selects  a
minimum number of composites from a minimum number of holes located within a search ellipsoid of a given size and orientation.
For the measured resource category, the search ellipsoid dimension is 30 m (along strike) by 30 m (dip direction) by 5 m. The
search conditions for the measured category are a minimum of seven (7) composites located in at least four (4) different drillholes
or channels. For the indicated category, the ellipsoid dimension is increased to 60 m by 60 m by 10 m with ellipsoid orientation and
search criteria similar to the measured category. The second classification stage involves the delineation of coherent zones for the
measured and indicated resource categories based on the results of the automated classification. The objective is to homogenise
or “smooth” the results of the automated process by removing the “Swiss cheese” or “spotted dog” patterns typical of the automated
classification results. This stage is conducted by defining 3D envelopes on a bench by bench basis for the measured and indicated
categories. Figure 14.12 and Figure 14.13 show the block model final classifications in section and plan level views respectively
(Categories: measured – red, indicated – blue, and inferred – grey).

14.2.7  Mineral Resource Estimation
 
The mineral resources of the Hosco deposit are defined using two distinct mining scenarios: open-pit and underground mining
perspectives. The open pit mineral resources are reported within a Whittle pit shell optimised using the measured, indicated and
inferred categories of the estimated global block model. The pit optimisation parameters supplied by Aurizon and validated by SGS
Geostat  are  based  on  the  parameters  used  in  the  Project’s  Prefeasibility  Study.  Table  14.6  summarises  the  optimisation
parameters. The base case cut-off grade for the in-pit mineral resources using a gold price of US$1,000 per oz Au is 0.33 g/t Au.
The base case cut-off grade for the underground (“U/G”) mineral resources at Hosco has been set at 2.0 g/t Au and is based on a
conceptual U/G mining model completed by SGS Geostat. The reported U/G mineral resources are exclusive of the in-pit mineral
resources. SGS Geostat considers that mineral resources defined at Hosco meet the requirement of a reasonable prospect for
economic extraction.
Table 14.6: Parameters Used for the Whittle Open-Pit Optimisation
The  mineral  resource  estimate  includes  the  results  of  both  high  grade  and  low  grade  Au  block  models.  The  mineral  resource
tonnage  has  been  calculated  from  the  volumetric  estimates  of  the  resource  block  models  using  an  average  bulk  density  of
2.75 t/m3.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The updated mineral resources for the Hosco deposit are as follows: The in-pit mineral resources using a base case cut-off grade
of  0.33  g/t  Au  totals  30,690,000  tonnes  grading  1.33  g/t  Au  for  1,311,000  oz  Au  in  the  measured  category,  27,150,000  tonnes
grading  1.18  g/t  Au  for  1,033,000  oz  Au  in  the  indicated  category  with  an  additional  7,050,000  tonnes  grading  1.18  g/t  Au  for
267,000 oz Au in the inferred resources category. The U/G mineral resources using a base case cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au totals
50,000 tonnes grading 2.65 g/t Au for 5,000 oz Au in the indicated category with an additional 590,000 tonnes grading 2.54 g/t Au
for 48,000 oz Au in the inferred resources category. Table 14.7 summarises the in-pit mineral resources for Hosco for cut-off grades
of 0.33 g/t Au (base case), 0.5 g/t Au, and 1.0 g/t Au. Table 14.8 reports the U/G mineral resources for Hosco for cut-off grades of
2.0 g/t Au (base case), 2.5 g/t Au, and 3.0 g/t Au.

14.2.8  Sensitivity Analysis
During  March  2011,  some  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  high  grade  block  model  was  conducted  using  two  other  interpolation
methodologies  from  the  previous  resources  and  was  updated  as  stated  in  the  Company’s  June  13,  2011  press  release.  The
interpolation methods used for the analysis are inverse distance to the power square (“ID2”) and nearest neighbour (“NN”). The
block  model,  ellipsoid  and  search  conditions  parameters  are  the  same  as  with  the  OK  interpolation  methodology.  Table  14.9
compares the results of the sensitivity analysis to the OK mineral resource estimate for an Au cut-off grade of 0.33 g/t. Sensitivities
analysis  using  ID2  and  NN  returned  relative  differences  for  Au  metal  of  less  than  2%  with  the  exception  of  the  NN  inferred
resources where the relative difference for Au metal returned 9%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are typical for the data
distribution of the Hosco deposit where relatively high Au grade analytical data occurs in clusters where underground channel
sampling was historically conducted in the old mining levels. OK is known to have de-clustering properties which can lower the
effect of the high density channel data observed on the Project.

14.2.9  Mineral Resource Validation
 
A validation of the mineral resource Au grade was conducted as part of the verification process. The validation includes: 1) a visual
comparison of the color-coded block values versus the composite data in the vicinity of the interpolated blocks on random sections
and plan views, and 2) a validation of the blocks of the different mineralised envelopes that were used for the final block model.
The author also verified that blocks did not belong to two distinct mineralised envelopes within the final block model and that no
blocks belonging to the late intrusive [dykes] were included in the final block model.
14.3 Alexandria Deposit Resource Estimate
 
The mineral resources of the Alexandria deposit were restated as disclosed in the Company’s June 13, 2011 news release to
reflect the modification of the limit separating the eastern end of the Hosco deposit and the western end of the Alexandria deposit.
The mineral resource estimate was also restated at that time by adjusting the average bulk density of the mineralised lithologies in
the area.
 
July 2012
14-23
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
As described in the previous sections, the easternmost limit of the Hosco deposit has been moved from 9,700 mE to 10,000 mE,
which is now selected as the limit defining Hosco versus Alexandria. Since the current mineral resources of Alexandria (November
2009)  range  from  9,700  mE  to  approximately  11,500  mE,  an  adjustment  of  the  mineral  resource  estimates  for  Alexandria  was
necessary. The restated resources estimates for Alexandria exclude the previous mineral resources located between 9,700 mE
and  10,000  mE.  No  additional  drilling  data  was  included  in  the  mineral  resource  estimates  for  Alexandria  and  no  new  grade
interpolation  was  completed.  Since  the  mineral  resources  at  Alexandria  are  all  located  within  175  m  below  surface  and  thus
potentially mineable by open pit, the base case cut-off grade has been set at 0.5 g/t Au. This corresponds to approximately twice
the cut-off grade defined for Hosco. No pit optimisation was conducted on the Alexandria mineral resources.
The mineral resources for the Alexandria deposit were estimated by QP Michel Dagbert, P.Eng. in November 2009 using analytical
data from 12 recent surface drillholes and six (6) historical surface drillholes. The mineral resource estimate was completed using a
2D polygonal modelling in which mineralised intervals identified along drillholes were projected onto the east-west vertical long
section. The mineral resources volume is estimated using the length of each mineralised interval and limited to an area of influence
of 25 m by 25 m squares. In the restatement disclosed in the Company’s June 13, 2011 news release, the average bulk density
used to calculate tonnage from the volumetric estimates of the 2D polygonal model for the Alexandria deposit was changed to
2.75 t/m3. The new average bulk density is based on the average bulk density for the Hosco deposit, which is located to the west,
adjacent to the Alexandria deposit.
The restated mineral resources for the Alexandria deposit use a base case cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au totals 980,000 tonnes grading
1.2 g/t Au for 37,000 oz Au in the inferred category. No mineral resources were defined in the measured and indicated categories.
Table 14.10 summarises the mineral resources for Alexandria for cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t Au (base case), 1.0 g/t Au, and 1.5 g/t Au.

14.4 Heva Deposit Resource Estimate
 
The  only  modification  to  the  reporting  of  the  mineral  resources  of  the  Heva  deposit  made  in  the  restatement  disclosed  by  the
Company on June 13, 2011 was the adjustment of the cut-off grade for the mineral resources located at depth. Based on results
from the open-pit optimisation for the Hosco mineral resources, it was decided that a different cut-off grade should be applied to the
mineral  resources  located  at  depth  versus  the  resources  closer  to  surface.  The  elevation  of  4,700  m  (which  corresponds  to
approximately 300 m below surface) was selected as the threshold between the resources having open-pit potential compared to
the  resources  accessible  only  by  an  underground  mining  operation.  The  mineral  resources  for  Heva  were  not  updated  using
additional  drilling  information  and  the  average  bulk  density  remains  the  same  as  the  previous  estimate  of  2.81  t/m3.  No  pit
optimisation was conducted on the Heva mineral resources.
The mineral resources for the Heva deposit were estimated by QP Michel Dagbert, P.Eng in November 2009 using analytical data
from  47  recent  surface  drillholes  and  466  historical  drillholes  or  channels.  The  analytical  data  was  normalised  to  2  m  long
composites and high grade values were capped at 15 g/t Au. The mineral resource estimate was completed using 3D modelling
and block model interpolation methods. The interpolation was done by Ordinary Kriging. The block model covers a strike length of
2,800 m between 4,200 mE and 7,000 mE of the local grid and reaches a maximum depth of 650 m below surface. The block
model were defined by block size of 8 m east-west, 5 m north-south and 5 m elevation. An average bulk density of 2.81 t/m3 was
used to calculate tonnage from the volumetric estimates of the block model.

The restated mineral resources for the Heva deposit are as follow: The mineral resources located above 4,700 m elevation and
using a base case cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au totals 4,410,000 tonnes grading 1.91 g/t Au for 270,000 oz Au in the indicated category
with  an  additional  7,680,000  tonnes  grading  1.71  g/t  Au  for  421,000  oz  Au  in  the  inferred  resources  category.  The  mineral
resources  located  below  4,700  m  elevation  and  using  a  base  case  cut-off  grade  of  2.0  g/t  Au  totals  650,000  tonnes  grading
2.83 g/t Au for 59,000 oz Au in the inferred resources category. Table 14.11 summarizes the in-pit mineral resources for Heva for
cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t Au (base case), 1.0 g/t Au and 1.5 g/t Au for the resources located above 4,700 m elevation, and 2.0 g/t Au
(base case), 2.5 g/t Au and 3.0 g/t Au for the resources located below 4,700 m elevation.

14.6 Comments about the Mineral Resource Estimates
 
There are no known factors or issues related to environment, permitting, legal, mineral title, taxation, marketing, socio-economic or
political settings that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate.
Important note: Different assumptions were made during the mineral resource estimation process. The assumptions were used in
order to calculate modelling cut-off grades and resources cut-off grades following the “reasonable prospect for economic extraction”
stated by the NI 43-101 regulation. A Whittle optimised shell was done with the same parameters as described in Table 14.6. The
term in-pit refers to the resources within the optimised shell according to the different cut-off grades. The term underground (U/G)
refers to a conceptual U/G mining model completed in-house by SGS Geostat. The terms in-pit and Underground (U/G) do not
imply that any pit design and underground mining scenarios were done by SGS Geostat. Furthermore, it should not imply that the
resources stated herein have demonstrated economic viability.

15  MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES
 
The reserves for the detailed pit design have been calculated in accordance with the definitions and guidelines adopted by the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves) in August, 2000.
The mineral reserves (with dilution and ore loss) contained within the Main Pit and West Pit amount to 41.1 Mt of ore at an average
grade of 1.26 g/t Au using a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au, for a total of 1.66M oz of in-situ gold and 1.45M oz of recovered gold. Total
waste,  including  rock,  inferred  material  and  overburden,  is  184.6  Mt  for  a  stripping  ratio  of  4.49.  The  detailed  mineral  reserve
estimate is shown in Table 15.1.

16  MINING METHODS
16.1 General Description
 
Mining of the Joanna Hosco deposit will follow the standard practice of an open-pit operation with conventional drill and blast, load
and haul cycle using a drill/truck/shovel mining fleet. The overburden and waste rock material will be hauled to the designated
overburden and waste disposal areas. The run-of-mine ore will be drilled, blasted and loaded by hydraulic shovels and delivered
by trucks to the primary crusher or stockpile near the crusher. Mining operations will support the nominal milling throughput rate of
8,500 tpd.
Aurizon Mines will use its own employees to operate mining equipment. It is planned however that overburden removal will be
carried out by a local mining contractor.
16.2 Resource Block Model
 
The  mining  engineering  work  required  for  the  Study,  such  as  the  pit  optimization,  engineered  pit  design,  mine  planning  and
economic analysis, is based on the resource block model prepared by SGS Geostat. The block model was provided in a CSV file
named Hosco_Oct_2011HG-LGclassFINAL.csv and was transferred by BBA into the mining software MineSight. Aurizon provided
BBA with topographical and bedrock mapping data. A local coordinate system named GML was used. The unit block size in the
model is 8 m (East by West) x 5 m  (North by South) x 8 m (Height).
The following data was provided by SGS Geostat in the model:
§  GML Coordinates;
§  Density;
§  Classification ( Measured, Indicated or Inferred);
§  Au (gold in g/t, i.e. grade item).
Additional variables were added to BBA’s model in MineSight in order to perform calculations and to determine block value.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Following the import of the block model into MineSight, a verification of the total mineral resources by category was performed in
order to ensure conformity with the results provided by SGS.
16.3 Pit Optimization
 
The  objective  of  pit  optimization  and  mine  design  is  to  convert  the  resources  in  the  block  model  into  mine  reserves  for  this
Feasibility Study in order to serve as a basis for mine scheduling and economic analysis.
Given  the  operating  costs,  gold  recovery,  gold  price,  and  other  design  parameters,  the  pit  optimization  is  used  to  generate  an
optimal pit shell to maximize the undiscounted cash flow of the project. BBA has used the MineSight Lerchs-Grossman 3D (“LG
3D”) routine named MS-EP – a widely accepted standard in the mining industry - to generate the pit shell for the Hosco deposit.
The LG 3D is a true pit optimizer based on dynamic programming of graph theory to generate an optimized pit shell from a 3D block
model. The basic optimization principle of the algorithm operates on a net value calculation for each ore block in the model, i.e.,
revenue from sales less total operating costs, i.e., mining, crushing, processing, G&A, and other costs.
Based on the requirement of the Canadian NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, only ore blocks classified in the
Measured and Indicated categories are used to drive the pit optimizer for a Feasibility Study, and as such, the Inferred resource
blocks bear no economic value and are not used in the pit optimization process.
16.3.1   Pit Optimization Criteria and Parameters
 
Operating costs and design parameters used for the LG 3D shell were developed by BBA based on information from the ‘’Pre-
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit’’ on the Joanna Gold Project (December 2009), and on available results and assumptions
on crushing and processing from BBA. The technical and economic parameters used to conduct the pit optimization are outlined in
Table 16.1.

16.3.2  Theoretical Pit Shells
 
Using the technical and economical parameters presented above, the LG 3D pit optimizer was carried out to generate an optimum
pit shell having the highest undiscounted cash flow. A plan view of the LG 3D pit shell is shown in Figure 16.1.
The theoretical pit shell resulting from the LG 3D optimization is only preliminary and does not represent a practical design for
mining. This optimized pit shell will be used to serve as a guide for the detailed mine design with the required operational haulage
ramp, proper pit slope, and benching arrangement, as presented in this section.
In order to optimize the operational stripping ratio in the early years of the project and to increase the net present value of the
project, a series of optimized pit shells were generated using the LG 3D MineSight routine by varying the price of gold. These pit
shells served as a guide for the pit phases design, as presented later in this section.

16.4.1  Specific Gravity
 
The specific gravity of waste rock and ore is 2.75t/m3, and specific gravity of overburden is 2.00t/m3.
16.4.2  Mill Cut-Off Grade
 
The break-even cut-off grade or the milling cut-off grade (CoG) is used to classify the material inside the pit limits as ore or waste.
Since the material is located inside the pit, the break-even cut-off is the grade required to cover the costs for processing, G&A, and
those related to gold refining and transport only.
Using the economic and technical parameters shown in Table 16.1, the mill cut-off grade was calculated at 0.50 g/t Au, including
an average dilution rate of 5%.
16.4.3  Detailed Pit Design
 
The slope configuration in overburden is based on LEQ’s recommendations as discussed in Section 20 of their report (LEQ, 2012).
The  pit  slopes  and  benching  arrangement  in  fresh  rock  are  based  on  Golder’s  recommendations  (Golder,  2009).  For  the  rock
slopes, Golder recommends the following:
§  Bench face angle (BFA) of 65° and inter-ramp angle (IRA) of 49° for Northeast to Northwest walls (including the South wall) and
BFA of 70° and IRA of 53° for the North wall.
§  At the current study level, it would not be appropriate to apply the recommended slope angles over extended wall heights due to
the  uncertainty  regarding  fabric  continuity  inherent  in  slope  designs,  based  upon  drillhole  information.  It  is  therefore
recommended that flexibility be added to the designs by the sub-division of the final and phase walls into a series of bench
stacks,  no  greater  than  120  m  high,  separated  by  either  haul  road  traverses  or  the  inclusion  of  “geotechnical”  berms  at
100 m – 120 m vertical intervals. The geotechnical berms should be at least 15 m wide and would also act to protect personnel
from potential major rock falls, allow for horizontal drain hole water controls, provide some flexibility in wall development and
allow for periodic clean-up.

Triple benching arrangement is used to form 24 m high benches.
All in-pit ramps will be 24 m wide to accommodate the operation of 100-ton capacity off-highway class rear-dump trucks. This ramp
width is sufficient to support uninterrupted 2-way haulage cycle traffic. The final ramp width also includes an external safety berm
as well as an internal drainage ditch. In order to reduce the volume of waste stripping during the final phases, the ramp width is
reduced to 18 m for the last benches at the bottom of the pit. The ramp gradient is 10% for all mine ramps. Temporary ramps will be
used in the early years of mine operations to shorten haulage distances to the primary crusher or to the overburden and waste
dumps.
The final ramp and temporary ramp exits are located on the north side of the pit to minimize the haulage distances towards the
primary crushing, as well as the overburden and waste dumps.
The detailed pit design work was carried out using the LG 3D outlines described in this section. The ultimate pit design includes
the  entire  practical  geometry  required  in  a  mine  including  pit  access  and  haulage  ramp  to  all  pit  benches,  pit  slope  design,
benching configurations, smoothed pit walls, catch berms and geotechnical berms as described previously.
Based on the optimization pit shells, the Hosco deposit will be mined using two distinct pits: the Main pit and the West pit. The
design pits are approximately 2,190 m in length by 660 m wide and 280 m deep for the Main pit, and 660 m in length by 450 m wide
and 120 m deep for the West pit.
The  detailed  open-pit  design  is  shown  in  Figure  16.2  and  Figure  16.3.  Also,  Figure  16.45  and  present  cross-sections  of  the

16.4.4  Mine Reserves
 
Using the resource block model, the dilution rate and the mining recovery were estimated for the mine. In the estimation, it was
assumed that the selected mining method will be optimum, i.e., good blasting practice as well as a good practice of dilution control.
Under this best case scenario, it was assumed that the main source of dilution and ore loss will be at the contact between the ore
and waste using the following parameters:
§  The minimum mining width is 5 m (1 block);
§  Contact dilution of 0.65 m at the ore/waste contact;
§  The “orphan” blocks are not mined.
The estimation of the contact dilution was carried out on 5 selected benches equally spaced, and the results are presented in Table
16.2.

the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves) in August 2000,
and are presented in Section 15 of this Report.

16.5 Mine Production Schedule
 
A total production rate of 8,500 tpd is planned for mining the Hosco deposit. The West Pit will be mined using a production rate of
1,500 tpd, and the Main Pit will be mined using a production rate of 8,500 tpd or 7,000 tpd, depending of the West Pit production.
In order to maximize cash flow and to minimize the stripping ratio in the initial years, the Hosco deposit will be mined in phases
using a push-back technique. The push-backs are designed and based on a series of nested LG 3D pit shell simulations. The
Hosco final pit was divided into four (4) mining phases presented in 3D view in Figure 16.6. Phase 1 (starter pit), Phase 2, Phase 3
(final Main Pit) and West Pit are indicated. All phases are designed in accordance with the design criteria, as previously presented.
Pit phases served as a guide to develop the life-of-mine schedule.

A  pre-production  period  of  at  least  six  (6)  months  is  included  in  the  mining  schedule  to  provide  access  to  ore  and  to  provide
material for the site preparation. As the ore body is near the surface, little pre-production stripping will be required in preparation for
mining.
In order to increase the average grade in the early years, a cut-off grade strategy approach is used as follows:
§  In Year 1: ore between 0.5 and 0.8 g/t Au will be stockpiled;
§  In Year 2: ore between 0.5 and 0.7 g/t Au will be stockpiled.
Mining of ore will start in Phase 1 (starter pit) during Year 1 through the beginning of Year 5. West Pit stripping will begin in Year 4
and production will occur from Year 5 to Year 9. Overburden removal and pre-stripping in Phases 2 and 3 will begin during Year 1
and Year 3 respectively. Mining of ore in Phase 2 will start during Year 3 through the end of Year 11. Mining of ore in Phase 3 will
occur from Year 8 until Year 14.
The  total  material  stockpiled  during  Year  1  and  Year  2  is  in  the  order  of  975  kt  at  an  average  grade  of  0.77  g/t  Au.  Of  this,
404k tonnes will be reclaimed in the first year of mill production, and the remaining 571kt is assumed to be reclaimed at the end of
the open-pit life, but can be reclaimed on an as-need basis.
A total amount of 2.3 Mt of low grade ore (between 0.3 and 0.5 g/t Au) at an average grade of 0.37 g/t Au will be stockpiled and can
be reclaimed at the end of the mine life if market conditions make it economically profitable at that time.
Based on the mine phases described above, a total mine life of 13.4 years at a nominal production rate of 8,500 tpd is foreseen for
mining the Joanna Hosco pits. A production schedule, including dilution and mine recovery, is presented in Table 16.3.

16.6 Pile Design
 
The location of the different piles is shown on the site plan in Section 18 of this Report.
16.6.1  Waste Rock Pile
 
Waste rock material represents the material containing 0.3 g/t Au or less. According to SGS Geostat’s block modeling analysis of
the As content, a total of 10% of the waste material could leach arsenic and requires environmental protection measures. The
two (2) portions of waste material will be managed separately to reduce initial and restoration costs. The larger portion of the waste
material (90%) will be stockpiled on the main waste dump and does not require any special environmental considerations. The
remaining waste material (10%), which is potentially problematic, will be stockpiled on the secondary waste dump and requires an
appropriate design, as developed by Roche and described in Section 20 of this Report. The material from grade 0.3 g/t Au to 0.5 g/t
Au will also be stockpiled on the secondary dump. The total amount of low grade ore is 1.5 million m3 (2.3 Mt). If the price of gold,
at that time, makes it profitable, the low grade will be reclaimed at the end of the mine life.
The waste dumps have been designed for the LOM waste generated, and are located around the periphery of the mine to optimize
the haulage distance and to minimize costs. The main waste dump and secondary waste dump, located north of the pit on the north
side  of  the  Stitchman  Creek,  will  have  a  total  capacity  of  69.1  million  m3  (146.1  million  tonnes)  and  8.8  million  m3  (16.2
million tonnes of waste and 2.3Mt of low grade), respectively.
The capacities of the dumps have been estimated using a swell factor of 30%. The design parameters are as follow:
§  Face angle: 33°;
§  Bench height: 10 m;
§  Berm width: 10 m;
§  Number of bench: 7 (main waste dump), 5 (secondary waste dump);
§  Minimum distance from Stitchman Creek = 100 m.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
16.6.2  Overburden and Topsoil Pile
 
Digging the pit will require the removal of a quantity of overburden estimated at about 22.3 Mt, mainly made up of clay. Because of
its water content, the overburden cannot be used directly as construction backfill material for the various facilities. It will therefore be
stored on two (2) piles located near the pit and will be used later for the restoration.
Overburden material will be removed from Year 0 to Year 4. The overburden clay dump, located north-east of the Main Pit, will
have a capacity of 11.3 million m3 (18.9 million tonnes and the topsoil dump located north of the West Pit will have a capacity of
2.1 million m3 (3.4 million tonnes) using a swell factor of 20%. The overburden dump design parameters are as follows:
§  Face angle: 22°;
§  Height: Overburden (clay) = 7.5 m, Topsoil = 5 m;
§  Minimum distance from Stitchman Creek = 100 m.
16.6.3  Ore Stockpile
 
In addition to the waste dumps and overburden dumps, a 1Mt ore stockpile is required on the crusher pad to store the ore material
discarded during Year 1 and Year 2.
16.7 Mining Operations
 
The ore of the Joanna Hosco deposit will be mined using conventional open-pit mining methods based on a truck/shovel operation.
All the equipment will be diesel-powered.
The production plan, presented in Table 16.3, was used as the basis in determining the mobile equipment fleet requirements. All
the  equipment  is  assumed  to  be  owned  by  Aurizon  Mines  Ltd.  and  operated  by  Aurizon  Mines  Ltd.  personnel.  The  mine  will
operate on 2 x 12-hour shifts per day, 7 days per week and 365 days per year with crews rotating on a 1-week in, 1-week out
schedule. The selection of the primary mining fleet is based on cycle time estimations, mechanical availability and utility factors, as
well as average yearly haulage profiles.
It is assumed that the overburden removal will be conducted by a contractor.

16.7.1  Drilling
 
Blast holes will be carried out by diesel-powered down-the-hole drills with the following parameters:
§  Diameter blast hole: 6.25 inches;
§  Drilling pattern: 5.2 m by 5.2 m pattern in ore and on a 5.8 m by 5.8 m pattern in waste;
§  Sub drill: 1 m;
§  Re-drill: 10%;
§  Penetration rate: 25 m/hr.
The  net  productive  time  for  drilling  is  based  on  a  12-hour  shift  with  a  total  of  75  minutes  of  scheduled  delays.  The  operator
efficiency for the drilling operation has been established at 45 minutes per hour (75%) to account for the time required for the drill to
move between holes. Thus the remaining available productive time is estimated at 484 minutes (8.1 hours) per 12-hour shift. The
operating parameters for drilling are summarized in the following Table 16.4:

16.7.2  Blasting
 
Blasting  will  be  executed  under  contract  with  an  explosives  company  that  will  supply  the  blasting  products  and  technology,
portable storage facility with silo and equipment to deliver explosives to the hole. The explosives supplier will also be responsible
for providing a down-the-hole service. Blasting will be conducted using an emulsion-type explosive with an average density (in the
hole) of 1.25 kg/m3. Based on a drilling pattern of 5.2 m x 5.2 m in ore and 5.8 m x 5.8 m in waste, the design powder factors are
0.24 kg and 0.2 kg of explosives per tonne of rock for ore and waste material respectively. After mining commences, fragmentations
will be evaluated and the drill and blast parameters may be further refined to optimize results.
16.7.3  Loading and Hauling
 
For the Main Pit area, loading and hauling will be conducted using a fleet of 100-ton capacity trucks (for both ore and waste) in
combination with an 11 m3 capacity hydraulic front shovel in ore and waste. This combination will allow 4-pass loading of trucks.
The truck loading time has been estimated at 2 minutes for ore and waste. The maximum shovel productivity has been estimated at
18,926 tonnes of ore or waste per shift.
Due to the lower production rate, the West Pit will be excavated using a 50-ton class truck in combination with a 5.7 m3 capacity
hydraulic shovel. This combination will allow 3-pass loading of trucks. The truck loading time has been estimated at 1.5 minutes for
ore and waste. The maximum shovel productivity has been estimated at 8,399 tonnes of ore or waste per shift.
A 10 m3 capacity wheel loader will also be used to complement the hydraulic shovels in an effort to maximize the flexibility and
blending capacity of the operation. The wheel loader will be used in Year 14 to load haul trucks with ore reclaimed from the ore
stockpile.
Net Productive Time
 
Productivity  parameters  have  been  established  based  on  a  net  productive  time  of  9.3  hours  per  12-hour  shift.  This  time
incorporates  a  total  scheduled  non-productive  time  of  75  minutes  per  shift  to  account  for  shift  change,  routine  inspection  and
lubrication, coffee and lunch breaks, as summarized in Table 16.5.

Loading Parameters
 
The in-situ material densities average 2.75 tonnes/m3 of ore and waste over the mine life. Blasting will result in a swell factor of
approximately 30%, which will yield a loose density of 2.12 tonnes/m3 in both ore and waste. It is anticipated that the use of high
precision detonators for blasting initiation will yield good fragmentation. Based on these parameters and the annual mine plan, the
yearly shovel/loader requirements were calculated. The loading parameters are summarized in Table 16.6 and 16.7.

Hauling Parameters
 
Average  annual  haul  profiles  were  created  based  on  the  annual  mine  plan.  Haul  routes  were  traced  in  MineSight  software
according to the mining centroid for each year, and for each respective haul route (i.e., ore, waste, low grade and overburden). Haul
truck travel speeds were based on an internal database and were compared to manufacturer rimpull charts used to determine the
average  annual  cycle  times,  including  an  allowance  factor  of  approximately  10%  to  account  for  additional  cycle  delays,  e.g.,
queuing and waiting. These cycle times were then used to determine the annual haulage fleet size.  A summary of the annual
average cycle time for ore, waste, low grade material, and overburden can be found in Table 16.8 and 16.9.

16.7.5  Mine Labour
 
Labour requirements were determined according to equipment requirements. For more details, see Section 21.
16.7.6  Mining Services
 
Dewatering
 
It  is  recommended  to  construct  a  drainage  ditch  around  the  perimeter  of  the  pit  to  collect  run-off  water.  In  addition,  a  suitable
pumping system will be included in the design for the dewatering of the pit.
Aggregate Requirement
 
Considering the size of the mine and the availability of aggregate in the vicinity of the mine, there will be no aggregate plant at the
Joanna mine site.
Contract Mining
 
The Feasibility Study assumes that mining would be carried out using the owner’s equipment and personnel. However, contract
mining submissions should be requested from mining contractors to provide a comparison for the owner’s mining scenario.
The Feasibility Study assumes that the overburden removal will be executed by a local contractor using the contractor’s equipment
and personnel.

17  RECOVERY METHODS
 
Section 13 of this Report describes the metallurgical testwork performed and how the results were used to determine and develop
the optimal method of recovering gold from the Joanna ore. In this section of the Report, a process design basis is established and
the  flowsheets,  the  mass  and  water  balance  and  the  process  design  criteria  considered  for  the  Feasibility  Study  (FS)  are
presented. The selection and sizing of the process equipment was performed based on this information and is presented in this
section as well. Equipment sizing was based on a combination of the following types of information:
§  Testwork results;
§  Handbook references;
§  BBA’s experience on other projects (reference projects);
§  Vendor information.
A description of the processing plant is also presented.
17.1 Process Design Basis
 
Design is based on an average daily ore throughput of 8,500 t/d or 3.1 Mt/y. Based on this target and the results of the metallurgical
testwork performed, a mass balance was developed, which forms the basis of design of the mineral processing plant. The major
design  criteria  for  the  plant  are  presented  in  Table  17.1  and  a  summary  of  the  major  flows  entering  and  exiting  the  plant  is
presented in Table 17.2.

The  plant  utilization  rate  of  85%  was  based  on  the  availability  of  the  autoclave,  which  was  specified  by  Sherritt  who  was
responsible for the testwork, process flowsheet and plant design for the Pressure Oxidation (POX) area. The average gold head
grade was derived from the block model and optimized pit design of the Joanna Hosco deposit.
17.2 General Flowsheet, Mass and Water Balances
 
The results of the metallurgical testwork as well as the aforementioned process design basis were used to develop a flowsheet and
a mass and water balance, which are presented in Figure 17.1 and Figure 17.2. The water balance was first developed to establish
process requirements and subsequently incorporated climatic factors such as rainfall and evaporation, which were

17.3 Process Description
 
17.3.1  Summary
 
The following is a summary of major processing steps and design criteria:
§  The general location of the crusher, crushed ore storage silo, concentrator, tailings disposal areas, waste disposal areas and
other infrastructure are presented in the site plan, presented in Section 18.
§  Operations run 365 days per year with a total of 14 days for scheduled maintenance shutdown required for the autoclave. The
overall plant utilization rate is in the order of 85% (310 days). The crusher utilization rate is in the order of 65%.
§  Ore is crushed using a single jaw crusher. Crushed ore is stored in a concrete silo from which it is reclaimed with vibrating
feeders onto a belt conveyor, which then feeds the SAG mill.
§  The grinding circuit comprises a single pinion SAG mill with a variable speed drive operated in an open circuit, which feeds a
ball mill with a fixed speed drive. The ball mill is operated in a closed circuit with a hydrocyclone cluster. The product of the ball
mill circuit is then fed to a flotation circuit to be concentrated.
§  A  portion  of  the  ball  mill  discharge  is  fed  to  a  pair  of  gravity  concentrating  units  operated  in  parallel,  which  recover  gravity
recoverable gold. The gravity circuit tailings are returned to the ball mill feed. The concentrate from the gravity circuit is upgraded
using a shaking table (as a batch operation). The shaking table concentrate is directed to the melting furnace and the tailings are
combined with the flotation concentrate, which in turn are sent to the Pressure Oxidation (POX) area.
§  The ground ore from the grinding circuit is directed to the flotation area. The flotation circuit is made up of a roughing stage
comprised of eight (8) mechanical tank cells in series, a cleaning column and a cleaner-scavenger column.
 
- 
The flotation tails are thickened using a high rate thickener and pumped to the flotation tailings pond for final disposition. These
 
tailings are classified as neutral and non-acid generating so no special design features are required for this tailings impoundment
area.

-  The flotation concentrate is thickened using a high rate thickener and is directed to the POX area.
§  The POX area consists of the following steps:
-  The first step in the POX process consists of pressure oxidation in the autoclave. In this stage, the concentrate slurry is exposed
to  a  high  pressure  oxygen  atmosphere,  which  results  in  a  high  degree  of  oxidation  of  the  sulphide-bearing  minerals  in  the
concentrate.
-  Oxygen is produced on-site with a vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) plant, which will be owned and operated by an
industrial gas Vendor.
-  The oxidized solids are washed in a series of two high rate thickeners in the counter current decantation (CCD) stage to separate
it from the acidic solution generated in the POX stage. The washed concentrate constitutes feed to the cyanide leaching area.
-  The aforementioned acidic solution is directed to the neutralization stage, which is made up of a series of stirred vessels that
serve  to  neutralize  the  solution  with  additions  of  limestone  and  lime.  The  neutralization  reaction  causes  the  precipitation  of
dissolved metals to occur. The precipitated solids (neutralization tails) are thickened in a high rate thickener and are combined
with the cyanide leaching tailings (after cyanide destruction) for final disposition.
§  The oxidized concentrate is leached in a cyanide solution in a series of four (4) agitated and aerated tanks in order to dissolve
the contained gold.
§  From the leach tanks, the slurry is then fed to a series of ten (10) carousel-type carbon-in-pulp (CIP) tanks. At this stage, the
slurry is brought into contact with activated carbon, which adsorbs the gold in solution.
§  The gold-loaded activated carbon is sent to the stripping stage where the gold is desorbed from the activated carbon into a
concentrated solution. The gold is then electrodeposited in an electro-winning cell. Lastly, the gold is melted in an induction
furnace and cast into bars that constitute the final product from the Joanna gold extraction process.
§  The leached slurry is sent from the CIP stage to a cyanide destruction stage comprised of an agitated vessel to which SO2 gas,
CuSO4 and air are added. Following the cyanide destruction stage, this tailings slurry, combined with the neutralization slurry, is
pumped to the POX tailings pond. These tailings contain a high level of As. The water also contains some residual cyanide,
which  must  be  destroyed  before  being  released  to  the  watershed.  As  a  result,  the  POX  tailings  impoundment  area,  which
contains the tailings and the water, requires a special design in order to prevent contact with other surroundings.

17.3.2  Primary Crushing and Ore Handling
 
The run-of-mine ore, which has a F80 of 600 mm, is transported to the crusher area using 100-ton capacity haul trucks. The trucks
dump onto a static grizzly discharging into a 270-tonne capacity hopper. The grizzly retains material larger than 850 mm, and a
hydraulic rock breaker is in place to break the oversize material. When the crusher is not available, the mining trucks dump into the
ROM stockpile located nearby, as indicated on the site plan. This ore is subsequently reclaimed as required using a front-end
loader and mining truck.
An apron feeder feeds material from the hopper onto a belt conveyor, which discharges into a chute and into the primary crusher,
thus assuring a controlled and optimal feed rate to the crusher. The primary crusher is a jaw-type crusher with a feed opening
measuring 1,250 mm x 950 mm and an installed power of 200 kW. Crusher product has a P80 of 110 mm. The crusher was sized
assuming a utilization rate of 65%.
The  crusher  product  is  discharged  onto  a  discharge  belt  conveyor,  which  is  equipped  with  a  magnet  to  remove  metal  scraps.
During normal operation, this conveyor discharges into a chute, which in turn discharges onto the main conveyor, which feeds the
crushed ore silo. A belt scale measures the feed rate to the silo. During periods when the main conveyor belt is not available or
when  the  silo  is  full,  crusher  operations  can  be  maintained  by  diverting  crushed  ore  to  an  emergency  stockpile  via  a  transfer
conveyor. Material going in and out of this stockpile is handled by loader. A hopper is located on the main conveyor to allow for
reclaiming ore from the stockpile.
The  crusher  area  is  equipped  with  an  overhead  crane  with  a  20-tonne  capacity  and  an  air  compressor  for  the  operation  of
instruments. Dust is controlled in the primary crushing area using a baghouse-type dust collector.
The  crushed  ore  silo  has  a  live  capacity  of  2,360  tonnes  which  corresponds  to  approximately  five  and  a  half  (5.5)  hours  of
concentrator operation. It acts as a buffer between the crushing plant and the concentrator and assures a constant ore flow to the
grinding mill.
 
July 2012
17-8
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Four (4) vibrating pan feeders reclaim material from the silo and feed it onto the mill feed conveyor. A belt scale monitors ore flow to
the mill.
17.3.3  Grinding and Gravity Separation
The mill feed conveyor feeds material to the primary grinding mill, which consists of a single pinion Semi-Autogenous mill (SAG
mill). A trommel screen at the mill discharge keeps oversized material in the mill so the mill is operated in open circuit. The SAG
mill has a diameter of 9,144 mm and an effective grinding length (EGL) of 2,896 mm (30’ D x 9.5’ EGL) and has an installed power
of 5,040 kW. The SAG mill receives feed material with an F80 of 110 mm and produces material with a P80 of 1,753 µm.
The SAG mill product is discharged into a pump box from which the slurry is pumped to the secondary grinding circuit. The circuit is
comprised of a cluster of 500 mm hydrocyclones (3 operating and 2 installed spares), two parallel Knelson gravity concentrators
and a ball mill having a diameter of 5,486 mm, an effective grinding length of 8,534 mm (18’ D x 28’ EGL) and an installed power of
5,040 kW. The ball mill is equipped with a trunnion magnet to remove metal scraps from the ball mill discharge.
The grinding area is equipped with an overhead crane with a capacity of 45 tonnes and an auxiliary hoist having a capacity of
25 tonnes.
The ball mill discharge product, which has a P80 of 473 μm, is combined with the SAG mill product in a pump box which feeds the
hydrocyclone  cluster.  Approximately 73% of the ball mill product is directed by gravity to the Knelson concentrators, which are
preceded by two screens. The portion not fed to the gravity concentrators is returned to the hydrocyclone feed pump box.
The Knelson gravity concentrators produce a concentrate and a tail. The tail is returned to the hydrocyclone feed pump box. The
concentrate  is  flushed  from  the  Knelson  units  approximately  every  60  minutes  during  a  period  of  about  2.5  minutes.  The
concentrate is collected in a stock tank with a 96-hour capacity. The stock tank has a conical shaped bottom and is designed to
reduce the water content of the concentrate. The Knelson concentrate is further concentrated in a batch operation shaking table.
The shaking table concentrate is directed to the gold room induction furnace for melting. The shaking table tail is collected in a tank
and is subsequently combined with the flotation concentrate in the holding tank ahead of the POX area.
 
July 2012
17-9
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The grinding circuit produces a final product through the hydrocyclone overflow, having a P80 of 90 μm, which constitutes the
targeted nominal grind. The hydrocyclone overflow is directed by gravity to the flotation area conditioning tank. The hydrocyclone
underflow is recycled to the ball mill.
The gravity area is equipped with an overhead crane with a capacity of 7.5 tonnes.
17.3.4  Flotation
 
The hydrocyclone overflow discharges into the flotation conditioning tank, an agitated vessel with a residence time of 2 minutes, to
which is added the gold collector Aero 208.
From the conditioning tank, the slurry overflows into the bank of rougher cells, comprised of eight (8) mechanical tank cells of
100 m3 each, which provide a total residence time of approximately 37 minutes. The gold collector, Aero 208, the frother, MIBC,
and the sulphide collector, PAX, are added to the rougher cells.
The tails from the rougher stage overflow into a pump box and are pumped to the tailings thickener for dewatering prior to pumping
to the tailings pond. The flocculant used in this thickener is Flomin 905MC. The thickener overflow flows by gravity to the process
water  tank.  The  concentrate  from  the  rougher  stage  is  collected  in  a  launder  and  is  combined  with  the  cleaner-scavenger
concentrate  and  is  pumped  to  the  cleaner  column,  which  is  10  m  high  and  3.05  m  in  diameter  and  has  a  residence  time  of
approximately 13 minutes. The frother, MIBC, and the sulphide collector, PAX, are added to the column.
The tails from the cleaner column are pumped to the cleaner scavenger column, which is 8.5 m high and 2.44 m in diameter and
has a residence time of approximately 8.5 minutes. The frother, MIBC, and the sulphide collector, PAX, are added to the column.
The concentrate from the cleaner scavenger flows by gravity to the rougher concentrate pump box and is recycled back to the first
cleaner  column.  The  tails  of  the  cleaner  scavenger  overflow  into  a  pump  box  from  where  they  are  combined  with  the  rougher
tailings and pumped into the flotation tailings thickener mentioned earlier.
 
July 2012
17-10
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The  final  concentrate  from  the  flotation  circuit,  produced  by  the  first  cleaner  column,  is  directed  to  the  concentrate  dewatering
thickener, which is 11 m in diameter. The flocculant used in this thickener is Flomin 905MC. The thickener overflow flows by gravity
to the process water tank. The thickened concentrate is pumped to the flotation concentrate surge tank, ahead of the POX area.
The surge tank has a residence time of 24 hours and will normally operate half full in order to provide 12 hours of buffer capacity. In
the event of an emergency shutdown in the POX area, grinding and flotation operations could be maintained for up to 12 hours.
Blower air is forced through the flotation cells and columns. It is estimated that the overall gold recovery of the flotation circuit is
89.15%.
The flotation area is equipped with an overhead crane with a capacity of 15 tonnes.
17.3.5  Pressure Oxidation (POX)
 
17.3.5.1  Autoclave
 
The flotation concentrate is pumped from the surge tank to the pressure oxidation circuit which consists of a high pressure slurry
feed system, autoclave vessel and agitators, conditioning tank, and vent gas handling system. The autoclave system also includes
an  agitator  seal  system,  steam  boiler  (for  start-up  only),  and  high  pressure  cooling  water  (quench  water)  pumps  for  autoclave
temperature control.
The  autoclave  is  a  refractory  lined,  multi-compartment,  horizontal  vessel  and  operates  at  220°C  and  3,000  kPa  (gauge),  with
design retention time of 75 min. Oxygen required for the oxidation reactions in the autoclave is provided from an on-site vacuum
pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) oxygen plant.
The  purpose  of  the  pressure  oxidation  system  is  to  oxidize  sulphides  and  arsenopyrite  in  the  flotation  concentrate,  thereby
rendering the gold amenable to subsequent recovery by cyanide leaching.  The reactions that occur in the autoclave are highly
exothermic, so cooling is required to maintain the desired temperature. The temperature in each compartment is controlled through
direct injection of process water as quench water.

The autoclave slurry from the final compartment is discharged into a flash tank where the steam and slurry are separated. The
steam flows through the vent line to a scrubber system while the slurry drains into the conditioning tank. Basic iron sulphates,
which would otherwise consume lime in the cyanide leach circuit, are decomposed in the conditioning tank. The conditioning tank
discharge slurry is pumped to the CCD wash circuit.
 
17.3.5.2  Counter Current Decantation (CCD)
 
The  counter  current  decantation  (CCD)  wash  circuit,  which  is  located  outside  of  the  main  building,  consists  of  two  high  rate
thickeners, with repulp tanks, overflow tanks, and associated pumps.
The oxidized residue is sent to the CCD wash to remove sulphuric acid and metal sulphates from the oxidized slurry before it is
sent to the cyanide leaching circuit. The CCD wash also aids in cooling the slurry. The washed slurry from the CCD is pumped to
the cyanide leaching circuit while the wash solution is pumped to the neutralization circuit.
 
17.3.5.3  Neutralization
 
The neutralization circuit is located outside of the main building and adjacent to the CCD circuit. The two stage circuit consists of
six (6) agitated tanks connected in series, a neutralization thickener and an overflow solution pump.
The solution generated from washing the oxidized concentrate is pumped to the neutralization circuit where the acid in solution is
neutralized and the soluble metals in the solution, such as aluminum, arsenic and iron are precipitated. The neutralizing agents
used in this process are limestone and lime. The final neutralized slurry exits the circuit at 65°C and a pH of 8. This slurry is
thickened to 50% solids in a high rate thickener. A portion of the overflow is recirculated to the CCD wash circuit and the remainder
is combined with the thickener underflow and pumped to the tailings pumping station.

Limestone for neutralization is delivered to the site and is ground to the required size in a package limestone grinding plant. The
ground limestone slurry is pumped to the first stage neutralization tanks at a controlled rate.
Lime is delivered to the site in pneumatic discharge tanks and stored in a silo. Lime is prepared in a slaking circuit and pumped to
the second stage neutralization tanks at a controlled rate.
17.3.6  Cyanide Leaching and CIP and Cyanide Destruction
 
17.3.6.1  Leaching Circuit
 
Four  (4)  leaching  tanks  and  an  associated  conditioning  tank  are  located  outdoors,  adjacent  to  the  CCD  wash  thickeners.  The
washed POX residue from the CCD area is pumped from the underflow of the second wash thickener to the cyanide leaching
conditioning tank, which has a residence time of approximately 30 minutes. Slaked lime is pumped from the aforementioned lime
storage and slaking system into the conditioning tank in order to adjust the pH of the slurry to approximately 10.5 to prevent HCN
gas formation in the downstream leaching tanks.
The CCD slurry is then pumped from the conditioning tank to a series of four (4) agitated leaching tanks, which provide a total
residence time of approximately 48 hours. Each tank has a diameter of 8.1 m. A solution of NaCN is pumped into the first leaching
tank from the NaCN storage tank. Compressed air is fed into each tank using gas diffusers to optimize the gold leaching rate. The
heights of the four (4) leaching tanks are 9.0 m, 8.7 m, 8.4 m and 8.1 m, which allows the slurry to overflow from one stage to the
next. Each tank is equipped with a launder arranged in such a way that any one tank can be bypassed without having to shut down
the entire train of leaching tanks. The overflow of the fourth and final leaching tank flows by gravity to the CIP carousel circuit,
located inside the plant building.

17.3.6.2  CIP
 
The gold-containing solution is directed to the CIP (carbon in pulp) circuit (Kemix AAC pumpcell system) where the gold in solution
is allowed to adsorb onto the carbon. The circuit includes ten (10) tanks (10 x 20 m3) in series, one of which is on standby. Each
tank contains one (1) tonne of activated carbon.
 
The pumpcell mechanism combines the functions of agitation, interstage screening, and slurry transfer in one unit. The suspension
of the carbon and slurry mixture is maintained by the hydrofoil mixer. The interstage screen surface is kept free of carbon buildup by
means of wiper blades attached to the rotating cage. The pumping action of the interstage screen generates a head differential, so
that all the adsorption tanks can be placed at the same level and it becomes relatively simple to provide common feed and tailings
launders to allow the plant to operate in a carrousel mode.
The CIP tanks are fed by a common launder, which, via a series of plug and gate valves, allows the feed slurry to be fed to any
tank, depending on which tank is first in the carousel sequence at any particularly time. The first tank has the highest gold-on-
carbon loading in the sequence. When the carbon in this tank has reached the required gold-on-carbon loading, it is isolated from
the circuit and the second tank becomes the first, third becomes second and so on. The loaded carbon in the isolated tank is
separated from the slurry by pumping the contents of the entire tank over a linear screen (loaded carbon screen) to separate the
carbon from the slurry. The carbon is diverted to either acid wash or strip vessels. The screened slurry flows back by gravity to the
CIP feed launder. The design carbon concentration in the CIP tanks is 50 g/L.
After the first pumpcell in the carrousel sequence is drained and its contents are sent to the stripping circuit, this pumpcell becomes
the last cell in the carrousel sequence. Regenerated carbon is pumped to this tank via one of two carbon sizing screens located
above the carousel circuit, depending on the location of the tank to be fed. To avoid carbon abrasion, reactivated carbon can be
transferred to the pumpcell when the CIP tank is filled with half of its volume with the slurry tails of the upstream cell in the series.
The sizing screen is used to separate any carbon fines from the carbon stream before it is introduced into the CIP circuit. The fines
flow by gravity to the carbon fines settling tank in the regeneration area while coarse carbon flows by gravity to the appropriate CIP
tank.

After the adsorption circuit, the CIP tailings stream flows by gravity to the carbon safety screen to recover fine carbon attrited or
worn down in the CIP circuits. The slurry flowing through the safety screens discharges into a pump box from where it is pumped to
the cyanide destruction tank, which is located outside, adjacent to the CIP area.
 
The CIP area is equipped with an overhead crane with a capacity of four (4) tonnes.
 
17.3.6.3  Cyanide Destruction
 
The  cyanide  destruction  tank  is  an  agitated  vessel  with  a  residence  time  of  four  (4)  hours.  The  selected  method  of  cyanide
destruction is the Inco SO2/Air process. The system uses SO2 in combination with air, sparged into the tank, to destroy the cyanide
in the tailings slurry. CuSO4 is added, as required, to catalyze the cyanide destruction reaction. The target total cyanide content in
the slurry at the discharge of the destruction system is less than twenty (20) ppm. The discharge of the cyanide destruction tank
overflows into a pump box, from which it is pumped to the POX tailings pumping station. The tailings discharged from the cyanide
destruction tank are combined with the neutralization tails for final disposal in the POX tailings pond.
17.3.7  Carbon Stripping and Regeneration
 
The carbon regeneration and stripping circuit has the capacity to treat one (1) t/d of carbon.
The loaded carbon from the CIP adsorption circuit is pumped to the loaded carbon screen. The oversize (loaded carbon) flows by
gravity to the loaded carbon tank and onto the acid wash column.
The acid wash is required to remove any organic material or carbonates which may have been adsorbed on the activated carbon
during the CIP process. A solution of 1% hydrochloric acid is circulated by pump from the diluted acid tank into the bottom of the
acid washing vessel and from the top of the tank back to the diluted acid tank, while the pH is monitored. Once the acid wash cycle
is completed, the spent acid is neutralized by adding caustic soda, drained, and pumped to the flotation tailings pump box for
disposal.
An exhaust fan is connected to the diluted acid tank and acid wash vessel to remove fumes. After the acid wash treatment, the
carbon is flushed with water and then rinsed again with a small amount of caustic soda to ensure neutralization. The carbon is then
pumped to the carbon stripping vessel.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
In the stripping vessel, the gold is stripped from the carbon by circulating a strip solution at high temperature (130°C) and pressure
(65 psig). The solution is heated up by an electric heater via a heat exchanger. Once the strip cycle is complete, the loaded strip
solution is cooled using heat exchangers and is sent to the electrowinning cell (Section 17.3.8). The barren solution discharged
from the electrowinning cell is returned to the barren strip solution tank. Caustic soda and cyanide are added as needed to the
barren strip solution tank to adjust the chemistry and conductivity of the strip solution to the appropriate levels.
At the end of the elution cycle (8 hours to 10 hours), part of the barren solution is bled to the CIP circuit to control solution quality
and to add reagents (i.e., caustic and cyanide solution), prior to the next stripping cycle. The carbon is cooled down and rinsed with
fresh water in the stripping column.
The stripped and cooled carbon is then pumped to the stripped carbon dewatering screen where the water used to transport the
carbon and any fine carbon are separated and sent to the carbon fines settling tank. The dewatered carbon from the screen is
stored in a one (1) tonne capacity hopper in front of the kiln, which ensures a steady feed during the kiln operation. The electric
carbon regeneration kiln has a capacity to process one (1) tonne of carbon per day. The kiln discharges the regenerated carbon
into a quench tank filled with water to simultaneously cool and wet the carbon. From the quench tank, the regenerated carbon is
pumped to a storage tank where it is combined with conditioned fresh carbon.
The carbon fines settling tank receives screened fine carbon from the carbon sizing screens and the stripped carbon dewatering
screen. The carbon fines are then pumped to the carbon fines filter, a plate and frame type filter. The filtered carbon fines are stored
in bags and sold for their gold content.
Fresh carbon is introduced into the system to make up for the loss of attrited carbon. The fresh carbon is conditioned prior to use in
order to remove sharp edges and to thoroughly wet the particles in the carbon attrition tank. The conditioned fresh carbon is then
pumped to a storage tank where it is combined with the regenerated carbon. This mixture of carbon is then pumped to the carbon
sizing screen, to remove fines, and is then introduced into the CIP adsorption circuit.

17.3.8  Electrowinning and Refining
 
In the gold room, gold is recovered from the pregnant solution using an electrowinning cell with a capacity of 1.4 m3 (50 ft3). The
loaded stainless steel cathodes are periodically cleaned in-situ with a high-pressure washer. The sludge collected at the bottom of
the cell is directed to a sludge pump feeding a recessed plate filter for dewatering. The filtered solids are discharged from the
recessed plate filter onto trays and dried in the electric oven. The filtrate is fed back to the electrowinning discharge pump box
along with the barren solution from the electrowinning cell and pumped to the barren strip solution tank.
The  dry  solids  are  cooled  and  mixed  with  an  appropriate  amount  of  flux  for  smelting  in  the  induction  furnace.  Refined  gold  is
poured from the furnace into a series of moulds and the slag is poured into a slag pot. The barren solution discharged from the
electrowinning cells is collected and pumped back to the barren solution tank in preparation for the next strip cycle.
The  electrowinning  cell  and  the  oven  are  vented  to  the  atmosphere  using  a  blower.  The  induction  furnace  is  equipped  with  a
cartridge dust collector and the exhaust is vented to the atmosphere using a fan.
The refinery area is equipped with an overhead crane with a capacity of one (1) tonne.
17.3.9  Reagents
 
Caustic Soda and HCl, used in the carbon stripping process, and the flotation reagents Aero 208 and MIBC, are delivered in totes.
Pumps are connected directly to the totes, which are used to feed the reagent to the appropriate process areas. The individual feed
lines are equipped with flow meters and control valves to ensure the appropriate dosage are achieved.

The flotation reagent PAX, as well as the flocculants Flomin 905MC and 4240SSH, as well as the cyanide destruction reagent
CuSO4, are delivered in solid form and are dissolved in batches in a mixing tank using filtered water. The batch is then pumped to
a storage tank from where the reagent is pumped continuously to the appropriate process area.
Quick lime, used in the neutralization and cyanide leaching processes, is delivered by truck and is transferred pneumatically to the
lime storage silo. A screw conveyor transfers the quick lime from the silo to the slaker, where it is wetted with filtered water. The
slaked lime passes through grit separators and into the quick lime mixing tank, to which more filtered water is added to create slurry
of the appropriate density. Grit is removed from the separator and disposed of using a screw conveyor. Parallel lines of slakers and
grit separators are installed so that operations can continue in the event that one of these pieces of equipment fails. The quick lime
slurry is pumped from the mixing tank continuously to the appropriate process areas.
A VPSA (vacuum pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plant is installed on site and operated by an industrial gas Vendor to supply
high purity (92.5%) oxygen to the autoclave.
Sodium Cyanide (NaCN), used in the cyanide leaching and carbon stripping processes, and sulphuric acid, used in the cyanide
destruction process, are delivered to site in solution in tanker trucks. The solutions are transferred from the tanker truck to a storage
tank, from which they are distributed to the appropriate process areas by pump.
Limestone  is  used  in  the  neutralization  process.  It  is  delivered  to  site  by  truck  and  stored  in  an  outdoor  stockpile.  From  the
stockpile, the limestone is fed using a front-end loader to a hopper, which is equipped with a static grizzly to reject any large waste
material. A vibrating feeder transfers limestone to a belt conveyor from the hopper. The belt conveyor feeds limestone to a ball mill
operated in closed circuit with a hydrocyclone, and sump tank and a pump. Filtered water is added to the limestone grinding circuit
in  order  to  achieve  the  appropriate  slurry  density.  The  target  product  size  of  the  limestone,  exiting  the  grinding  circuit  by  the
hydrocyclone overflow, is P90 of 100 microns. This stream flows by gravity to the agitated limestone slurry distribution tank. From
this tank, the limestone slurry is pumped to the neutralization circuit.

SO2 is used in the cyanide destruction process. It is delivered to site by tanker truck and is stored outdoors, adjacent to the cyanide
destruction system, in a pressurized storage tank.
Nitrogen gas is used in seal water system for the autoclave. Small gas cylinders of nitrogen gas are delivered to site and are
replaced as needed.
17.3.10  Common Services
 
An  air  compressor  is  used  to  provide  compressed  process  air  for  the  plant,  which  is  used  for  the  operation  of  instruments,  air
addition to the flotation columns, the neutralization circuit, the cyanide leach tanks and the cyanide destruction system.
A set of five (5) blowers operated in parallel, supply air to the flotation rougher cells.
A steam boiler package will supply steam to the autoclave as required. Steam is only used to restart the autoclave, and is therefore
used intermittently.
17.3.11  Process, Filtered and Fire Protection Water
 
The process water tank which has a diameter of 15 m and a height of 5 m, receives water from the flotation tailings and concentrate
thickeners. Water is also reclaimed from the flotation tailings pond polishing basin and from the process water pond. The level in
the  process  water  tank  is  controlled  by  pumping  water  from  one  of  these  two  sources.  Process  water  is  circulated  by  pump
throughout the plant from the process water tank.
Water is pumped from the process water tank to the sand filter to remove fine particles, and stored in the filtered water tank. Filtered
water is used for the preparation of reagents and in the pump gland seals. There are two gland seal water circuits; high pressure for
the high pressure tailings pumps, and low pressure for all other pumps requiring seal water.
Water is also pumped from the process water tank to a cooling water circuit, used to cool motors and electrical components.
A small portion of the filtered water is fed to a water demineralization package, in order to provide demineralized water to the
autoclave seal water system.

18  PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
 
This section describes the major infrastructure required to support the Joanna Project.
18.1 General Joanna Site Plan
 
The general Joanna site plan is presented in Figure 18.1. In close proximity to the Property, there is a Hydro Quebec 120 kV power
line to the north and to the south there is a CN railway and further south the Highway No.117, all running in an east-west direction.
Site infrastructure generally lies between these lines with the exception of the POX tailings pond which lies directly to the north of
the  power  line.  The  main  site  access  road  connects  to  Highway  117  to  the  south  of  the  Property.  The  main  site  infrastructure
includes the following:
§ There are two mine pits included in the design; the Hosco pit, which is the main pit, and the much smaller West pit. The pits are
oriented east-west directly to the north of the railway line. The design of pit shell was performed considering geotechnical
information (Golder, 2009) and the position of the railway line, therefore the relocation of the rail line is not required. Once fully
developed, the Hosco pit is designed to be approximately 2,190 m long by 660 m at its widest point and a maximum depth of
280 m. The West pit, approximately 200 m to the west of the Hosco pit is approximately 660 m long by 450 m wide and a
maximum depth of 120 m.
§ The mine development plan provides that topsoil be segregated and stored in a dedicated stockpile, which will be located to the
north of the West pit. It is oriented in the east-west axis and will measure 1,400 km long by 500 m wide by 5 m in height once fully
developed.
§ The main waste pile is located to the north of the Hosco pit and is triangular in shape. The design of the waste pile took into
consideration the prevailing geotechnical conditions in the area as well as the objective of minimizing the environmental impact.
Once fully developed, the overall surface area will be approximately 163 hectares. The projected height is 70 m.
§ A much smaller waste pile for material containing Nickel and Arsenic (Ni/As) will be located to the north of the main waste pile. It
will measure approximately 550 m by 550 m by 45 m in height for an overall surface area of 29 hectares once fully developed.
This material will be segregated due to environmental considerations, as described in Section 20 of this Report.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
§ The overburden pile will be located to the east of the main waste pile and will measure approximately 2 km by 700 m by 7.5 m in
height. The characteristics of the overburden material limits the height of the pile. Therefore this pile occupies a relatively large
footprint on the site plan (approximately 167 hectares).
§ A network of mine roads, restricted in access to only authorized vehicles, connects the open pits to the crusher, waste piles, and
the mine services area. These roads are generally 35 m in width, allowing for two-way traffic. Total length of the mine road
network is approximately 3.5 km.
§ The crusher building is located to the north-west of the Hosco pit, between the main waste pile and the topsoil pile. A mine road
connects the open pit to the crusher building. The footprint of the crusher building is approximately 25 m by 16 m and lies within a
larger cleared area. Design provides that a trailer facility having toilets and a lunch room area  for approximately 15 people be
located in proximity of the crusher to allow for mine operating personnel to take their breaks.
§ An open area to the west of the crusher building has been provided for stockpiling ROM ore as well as for emergency stockpiling
of crushed ore. Environmental considerations were made in design for this stockpile.
§ A conveyor having a length of approximately 500 m feeds crushed ore to the storage silo. The silo has a live capacity of 2,360 t or
5.5 hours. It consists of a concrete structure measuring 11 m in diameter and 20 m in height. A service road runs the length of this
conveyor.
§ Crushed ore from the storage silo is conveyed to the SAG mill within the concentrator building by a conveyor having a length of
approximately 200 m.
§ The ore processing area incorporates the concentrator building as well as various other processing areas located outside.
Grinding, gravity concentration, flotation, the autoclave, CIP carousel tanks, the carbon area and the gold room are all within a
building. Thickeners, holding tanks, leaching tanks, lime storage, etc. are all located outside. The limestone storage area is
outside and the limestone grinding area is located within an enclosed area. Employee facilities and offices for employees
assigned to the concentrator are located within the concentrator building. The ore processing area is located directly to the
north of the crusher building and to the west of the Ni/As waste pile and has a footprint of approximately 90 m by 90 m.

§ The mine services area is located on a cleared pad adjacent to the processing area. The mine services area consists of the
following:
- The mine garage and truck wash station are megadome type structures having a surface area of approximately 1,200m2.
Considering the type and size of the mining fleet, the design provides that this facility be used only for performing normal
maintenance. Major maintenance or overhauls will require that equipment components be transported to equipment vendor
maintenance facilities in Val-d’Or.
- One 100,000-liter reservoir for storing diesel is provided. Diesel fuel is delivered directly to the site by tanker trucks owned and
operated by local fuel suppliers. The fueling station is only used to fill mobile mining equipment. In-pit equipment such as drills
and shovels are filled directly by on-site fuel/lube truck.
- Mine employee facilities, administration offices, core shack and laboratory as well as other service areas are designed using
trailer-type facilities. A parking area for light vehicles and employee vehicles is provided in the mine services area. Also, a parking
and staging area for mine vehicles, separate from that of light vehicles, is provided.
§ Power will be supplied by Hydro Quebec, who will install a 120 kV line over a distance of approximately 2,000 m and tie into the
site’s main substation, located adjacent to the concentrator building.
§ Given environmental considerations and tailings characteristics, process tailings will be disposed of within two separate tailings
ponds. A detailed description is provided in Section 20.
-Flotation tailings, representing about 95% of the tailings produced are considered neutral and non-acid generating. The flotation
tailings pond is located in the northwest corner of the site, 1,400 m to the west of the concentrator and will have a surface area of
208 hectares and a height of 23.8 m when it is fully developed. Process water pumped with the tailings as well as surface water is
collected within a polishing pond measuring approximately 650 m by 350 m.
-Tailings generated from the POX and cyanide leaching areas have a high arsenic content and are disposed of separately in order
to minimize the project’s environmental footprint. The POX tailings pond is located approximately 1.1 km to the north of the
concentrator and will have a surface area of 37 hectares and a height of 13 m when it is fully developed. Water pumped with the
POX tailings as well as surface water is collected within a polishing pond located directly to the west of the POX tailings pond and
has a footprint of approximately 100 m by 100 m.

§ The process water pond is located to the west of the concentrator building and has a footprint of approximately 17 hectares. This
pond is used to store process water for periods of low precipitation. It provides make-up water for the process during periods
when the flotation tailings polishing pond water level is low. It is also used as a fire protection water reservoir.
§ The process water polishing pond serves as a collection point for all excess water or for water streams that cannot be used for the
process. As such, this pond effluent is the single process water effluent from the site. It measures approximately 110 m by 140 m.
§ The site access road is approximately 4 km long. It branches off of Highway 117 at the south of the property and travels north. It
passes to the west of the topsoil pile, between the flotation tailings pond and the process water pond to the concentrator.
§ Site access will be controlled by a guard house and a security gate at a location to be determined along the main site access
road. The guard house will be a pre-fabricated structure.
§ Tailings in slurry is pumped from the concentrator to the two tailings ponds. Surface water is collected from the various areas on
site and directed to a designated basin for use as process water or for effluent to the local watershed. Potable water is obtained
as required from a nearby esker. A piping network constructed mainly of HDPE pipe is designed for this purpose. Table 18.1 lists
the various pipelines included in the design.

18.2 Electricity
 
A load list was developed once site-wide electrical power requirements were estimated for process and mechanical equipment in
the various areas of the plant and the site. Crushing and grinding power requirements were estimated based on ore grindability
data obtained from the testwork. Power requirements for pumping, conveying, and other process equipment were estimated based
on flow rates developed in the mass and water balance as well as from BBA’s reference projects database. All mining equipment
in the open pit are diesel powered, therefore there is no electric power loop going to the mine. Power requirements for infrastructure
and  service  buildings  were  also  estimated  from  BBA’s  reference  projects.  Table  18.2  presents  the  site-wide  estimated  power
requirements as well as the estimated annual electrical consumption for the various sectors of the facility. As can be seen, the
projected annual electrical consumption is in the order of 168 GWh and the power demand is estimated at 23.5 MW. These results
have  been  used  to  estimate  operating  costs  as  presented  in  Section  21  of  this  Report.  Furthermore,  the  load  list  was  used  to
develop the preliminary electrical Single Line Diagram and to size major electrical equipment and components. The facility power
requirements were provided to Hydro Quebec in order to allow them to plan for providing power to the facility on a timely basis,
which will then be used to orient a study conducted by BBA to evaluate the options available for power transmission to the Joanna
mine site.
A plan for providing emergency power to the facility in the case of a power failure was developed. Equipment requiring emergency
power was identified and an emergency diesel powered generator of 1,500 kW is provided in the plant design.

20.1 Jurisdictions and Applicable Laws and Regulations
 
The  legal  framework  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  projected  facilities  is  a  combination  of  provincial,  national,  and
municipal policies, regulations and guidelines. The design and the environmental management of the Project must be done in
accordance with this legal framework.
20.1.1  Québec Procedure relating to the Environmental Assessment of the Project
 
20.1.1.1  Overview
 
Section  31.1  of  the  Environment  Quality  Act  (EQA)  states  that  “No  person  may  undertake  any  construction,  work,  activity  or
operation, or carry out work according to a plan or program, in the cases provided for by regulation of the Government without
following  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  review  procedure  and  obtaining  an  authorization  certificate  from  the
Government.”
Moreover,  Section  2  of  the  Regulation  respecting  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  Review  provides  the  list  of  projects
subject to the Environmental Impact Assessment and review procedure, namely:
“(n.8) the construction of an ore processing plant for metalliferous ore or asbestos ore, where the processing capacity of the plant is
7,000 metric tons or more per day, or any other ore1, where the processing capacity of the plant is 500 metric tonnes or more per
day;
(p) the opening and operation of a metals mine2 or an asbestos mine that has a production capacity of 7,000 metric tonnes or more
per day, or any other mine3 that has a production capacity of 500 metric tonnes or more per day.”
 
 
1           Other than metalliferous, asbestos or uranium ore.
 
2           “Mine” means all the surface and underground infrastructures used for the extraction of ore.
 
3           Other than a metal, asbestos or uranium mine.

Under the Joanna Project, the milling rate is planned at 8,500 tpd; therefore, the evaluation process and review of environmental
impacts will apply. Note also that the Québec Mineral Strategy, released on June 29, 2009, sets a recommendation lower than
3,000 tpd for the threshold to trigger an EIS.
According  to  the Regulation on Assessment and Review of Environmental Impacts, following the filing of the Project notice, the
Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) sets 15 months as the maximum period within which the
Minister must submit the application record to the Government for approval. It is, however, noted that the period of 15 months does
not include the time taken by the ‘’proponent’’ to draft the EIA report, the time between requests for information by the MDDEP and
transmission responses by the ‘’proponent’’, nor the time taken by the Government (Cabinet) to make its decision. Note that the
MDDEP intends to reduce this time period to 12 months. Figure 20.1 shows the steps involved in the procedure.
For the Joanna Project, it is likely that public hearings will be required given the relative proximity of a biodiversity reserve and
residential areas, and the fact that environmental groups have raised concerns about the mining industry. It should be noted that
Aurizon Mines Ltd. has already initiated active and participative discussions with local stakeholders and that such an approach will
be  continuing  as  the  Project  progresses.  This  approach  aims  at  establishing  and  maintaining  a  sustainable  dialogue  with
stakeholders in order to identify specific issues associated with the Project.

A  project  notice  was  filed  on  September  2,  2010,  with  the  MDDEP.  A  week  later,  following  the  study  of  the  project  notice,  a
Directive defining the required scope and contents of the Environmental Impact Assessment of the project was sent by the MDDEP
to Mines Aurizon. The Directive specific to the Joanna Project received in September 2010 is identical to the document entitled
Directive for an Environmental Impact Assessment of a Mining Project (in French only) (MDDEP, August 2005).
 
Given that infrastructure changes were made as part of the Feasibility Study, an addendum to the project notice will be submitted to
the MDDEP. A revised version of the Directive for an Environmental Impact Assessment of a Mining Project was released by the
MDDEP in January 2012; however no significant changes were made in this new Directive.
 
20.1.1.2  General Contents of an Environmental Impact Assessment Statement
 
Section 3 of the Regulation respecting Environmental Impact Assessment and Review defines the contents of an Environmental
Impact Assessment statement:
a) A description of the project mentioning, in particular, the desired objectives, the site [...], the project timetable, any subsequent
operation and maintenance activities, the amounts and characteristics of types of borrowed materials required, power sources,
methods of management of waste or residue other than road construction residue, transportation activities inherent in the
construction and subsequent operation of the project, any connection with land use planning and development plans, urban
zoning plans or agricultural zoning and reserved areas within the meaning of the act to preserve agricultural land [...];
b) A qualitative and quantitative inventory of the aspects of the environment which could be affected by the project, such as fauna,
flora, human communities, the cultural, archaeological and historical heritage of the area, agricultural resources and the use
made of resources of the area;
c) A list and evaluation of positive, negative and residual impacts of the project on the environment, including indirect, cumulative,
latent and irreversible effects [...];
July 2012
20-4
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
d) A description of the different options to the project, in particular regarding its location, the means and methods of carrying out and
developing the project, and all other variables in the project as well as reasons justifying the option chosen;
e) A list and description of measures to be taken to prevent, reduce or attenuate the deterioration of the environment, including [...]
In particular, any equipment used or installed to reduce the emission, deposit, issuance or discharge of contaminants into the
environment, any control of operations and monitoring, emergency measures in case of accident, and reclamation of the area
affected.
20.1.1.3  Summary of the Environmental Impact Assessment Statement
 
Section  4  of  the Regulation  respecting  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  Review  indicates  that  an  Environmental  Impact
Assessment statement prepared pursuant to Section 31.1 of the Environment Quality Act must be accompanied by a non-technical
summary of the main elements and conclusions of the studies, documents or research. The summary is published separately.
 
20.1.1.4  Evaluation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
 
A well-defined project is essential to producing an EIA report that takes the project to be carried out into account and that will be
considered acceptable by the authorities early on in the procedure. Upon receipt of the EIA report, the MDDEP will determine its
admissibility. This evaluation involves consultations with many government departments and agencies. Generally, the proponent
should expect to receive questions and comments to be addressed before the EIA report can be determined admissible. Following
the response to this first set of questions, a second set of questions may be issued. To avoid delays associated with this procedure,
it is essential to produce an Environmental Impact Assessment that covers as specifically as possible every aspect raised in the
Directive issued by the MDDEP.
 
20.1.1.5  Public Consultations
 
Section 31.3 of the EQA states that “After receiving the Environmental Impact Assessment statement, the Minister shall make it
public  and  indicate  to  the  proponent  of  the  project  to  initiate  the  stage  of  public  information  and  consultation  provided  for  by
regulation of the Government.”
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Once the impact study is found to be admissible, the Minister will then direct the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement
(BAPE) to prepare the case for public consultation. This consultation process extends for 45 days (Section 11 of the Regulation
respecting Environmental Impact Assessment and Review).
 
20.1.1.6  Public Hearings
Section 31.3 of the EQA also states that “Any person, group or a municipality may, within the time prescribed by regulation of the
Government, apply to the Minister for the holding of a public hearing in connection with such a project. Unless he considers such
application to be frivolous, the Minister shall direct the Bureau to hold a public hearing and report its findings and its analysis
thereof to him.”
Public hearings are governed by the Rules of Procedure relating to the Conduct of Public Hearings (Q-2, r. 45).
Following the public hearings, the BAPE commission files its report with the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment
and Parks. The commission is required to complete its mandate and file its report within four (4) months.
The Minister then has 60 days to publicly release the BAPE report.
 
20.1.1.7  Government Decision
 
On  the  basis  of  the  BAPE  report  and  the  MDDEP’s  evaluation  of  the  EIA,  the  Minister  analyses  the  case  and  makes  a
recommendation to the Government. As specified in Section 31.5 of the EQA4, the Government makes its decision by Decree: it
authorizes the project, with or without changes and conditions, or rejects it. The maximum period between the publication of the
BAPE report and the Government's decision is not specified either in the EQA or its regulations.
 
 
4           Section 31.5: Where the Environmental Impact Assessment statement is considered satisfactory by the Minister, it is
submitted  together  with  the  application  for  authorization  to  the  Government.  The  latter  may  issue  or  refuse  a  certificate  of
authorization  for  the  realization  of  the  project  with  or  without  amendments,  and  on  such  conditions  as  it  may  determine.  That
decision  may  be  made  by  any  committee  of  ministers  of  which  the  Minister  is  a  member  and  to  which  the  Government  has
delegated that power.

20.1.2  Federal Procedure
 
The objective of and various steps involved in the federal environmental assessment and review procedure are similar to those
associated with the Québec procedure. In most cases, Québec’s environmental review process is the only process that applies to
projects  to  be  conducted  within  its  boundaries.  In  some  cases,  federal  government  representatives  are  also  involved  in  an
environmental review of a project.
Federal environmental review procedures are governed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (1992, C. 37) and its four
main regulations:
a)  
b)  
c)  
d)
Law List Regulations (SOR/94-636);
Inclusion List Regulations (SOR/94-637);
Comprehensive Study List Regulations (SORS/94-638);
Exclusion List Regulations (SORS/94-639).
According to Section 5 of the Act, one of the following conditions is required for the application of the federal procedure:
A federal authority is the project proponent ;
e)  
f)  A  federal  authority  “has  the  administration  of  federal  lands  and  sells,  leases,  or  otherwise  disposes  of  those  lands  or  any
interests in those lands,” or;
g)  A federal authority provides financial support, i.e., “makes or authorizes payments or provides a guarantee for a loan or any
other form of financial assistance to the proponent”;
h)  A federal authority issues a permit or license, grants approval, or takes any other action for the purpose of enabling the project to
be carried out in whole or in part.
From our understanding of the project, the first two conditions obviously do not apply, nor does the third one since neither a loan
nor financial assistance has been or will be provided by a federal authority for the development of this project.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Many provisions of various federal acts and related regulations have a bearing on the last condition. The Fisheries Act  is  one
judicial element that could be a trigger. Section 35 of the Fisheries Act specifies that:
“(1) No person shall carry on any work or undertaking that results in the harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction of fish habitat.
(2) No person contravenes subsection (1) by causing the alteration, disruption, or destruction of fish habitat by any means or under
any conditions authorized by the Minister or under regulations made by the Governor in Council under this Act.”
As mentioned in Section 20.7, all mine infrastructures are located within only one sub-watershed, namely Stitchman Creek. In fact,
the  POX  Tailings  Management  Facility  (POX-TMF)  is  located  outside  that  area,  but  all  waters  coming  from  that  facility  will  be
managed in such a way that it will be pumped to the Process Water Polishing Pond (PWPP) and then discharge with the final
effluent  within  the  Stitchman  Sub-Watershed.  No  water  discharge  is  located  outside  the  Stitchman  Sub-Watershed.  Therefore,
within that area and where there was potential to locate any of the required surface infrastructures, a comprehensive Fisheries and
Fish Habitats Assessment Program was performed to precisely locate all sections of the Stitchman Creek and its affluents, which
are to be considered as fish habitats according to Canada’s Fisheries Act.
The objective of such work was to limit the ecological footprint of the Project to areas located out of those habitats. Among other
things, the use of thickened tailings was also prioritized in order to minimize the footprint of the Tailings Management Facility.
As depicted in Section 20.3, the performed Fisheries Assessment Program showed that the Stitchman Creek and its affluents,
where considered as fish-bearing creeks, host species such as brook stickleback, pearl dace (about 99%) and catfish. None hosts
fish species of importance to any ongoing productivity of commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fisheries. Such information might
be of interest in line with the most recent Bill C-38 which enumerates factors to be taken into account before recommending to the
Governor in Council that a regulation be made in
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
respect of Section 35 of the Fisheries Act. Among those are “the contribution of the relevant fish to the ongoing productivity of
commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fisheries and whether there are measures and standards to avoid, mitigate or offset serious
harm to fish that are part of a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery, or that support such a fishery.” Such further analysis
will have to be done with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) as part of the Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment process.  In any case, considering the proposed site general arrangement plan, only the location of the proposed
Hosco and West pits will require the deviation of existing fish-bearing watercourses. Among those is a ditch implemented as part of
the  past  operating  Hosco  Mine.  In  both  cases,  following  preliminary  discussion  with  the  DFO,  the  deviation  of  those  two
watercourses is not expected to require a license under Section 35 of the Fisheries Act. Indeed, works proposed by Aurizon Mine
and Roche Ltd to deviate those watercourses have for now been considered sufficient to mitigate/offset the impact on fish.
Finally, results depicted in Section 20.3.1.1 show that the most recent hydrogeology assessment works indicate that rocks within
the pit area are lowly permeable and that the anticipated drawdown would not result in decreased water flows/levels within the
nearby Stitchman Creek.
Within the context of the current study, fish habitat was not considered a trigger for the federal environmental review procedure. A
project notice in compliance with the Project Proposal Guide Submitted to Fisheries and Oceans Canada for Analysis Under the
Provisions  of  the  Fisheries  Act  Respecting  Fish  Habitat  Protection  will  need  to  be  submitted  to  the  Canadian  Environmental
Assessment Agency for a final decision.
The Explosives Act can  also  be  a  trigger  for  major  mining  projects.  Indeed,  for  certain  large-scale  mining  projects,  it  might  be
cheaper to manufacture explosives directly at the mine site. However, the manufacturing of explosives requires a license issued by
Natural Resources Canada, which triggers a federal environmental assessment. In the case of the Joanna Project, explosives will
be neither manufactured nor stored on site in large quantities.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Until 2010, when a trigger led to the application of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the Act applied only to the trigger
element and not the entire project. However, a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in January 2010, clarified the framework for
the application of the Act. From now on, as a result of this ruling, when a trigger element leads to the application of the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act, the Act must be applied to the entire project and not just the trigger element.
If the Joanna Project is subject to the federal environmental assessment procedure, it would be subject to a comprehensive study
under Section 10: “The proposed construction, decommissioning or abandonment of a facility for the extraction of 200,000 m3/a or
more of ground water or an expansion of such a facility that would result in an increase in production capacity of more than 35 per
cent” and Section 16 c) “The proposed construction, decommissioning or abandonment of a gold mine, other than a placer mine,
with an ore production capacity of 600 t/d or more” of the Comprehensive Study List Regulations
We  should  also  mention  that  in  the  case  where  the  federal  procedure  was  to  apply,  provincial  and  federal  governments  have
signed a cooperative agreement for the joint review of studies of environmental impacts. This agreement applies to projects located
in Québec, south of the 49th parallel and will reduce delays related to the involvement of both levels of government. The agreement
provides for the holding of joint public hearings.
Moreover,  the  federal  government  recently  introduced  recommendations  made  by  a  committee  that  is  reviewing  the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Act. These recommendations are:
“Improving Timelines: The Standing Committee endorsed the concept of environmental assessments (EAs) being carried out by
the "best-placed regulator", which at the federal level should be the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEA Agency).
The Committee also recommended eliminating the consideration of "alternatives to" a project under the CEAA, as EAs should not
include a review of the proposed project's business case. Finally, while the Committee noted the recent regulations under the
CEAA  that  provide  mandated  timelines  for  comprehensive  study-level  assessments,  the  Committee  recommended  further
amendments to the CEAA framework to provide for binding timelines for all EAs under the Act.
 
July 2012
20-10
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Reducing  Duplication:  The  Standing  Committee  recommended  that  the  CEA  Agency  should  be  empowered  to  determine  that
another jurisdiction's EA process fulfills the requirements of the CEAA and is thus "equivalent". The Committee suggested that
specific pieces of provincial legislation deemed "equivalent" should be identified in a Schedule to the CEAA and that the CEAA
should be amended to exempt projects subject to EAs under those provincial laws from the requirements of the CEAA. In addition,
the Standing Committee recommended moving the CEAA away from a trigger-based approach to EA (i.e., if there is a "trigger"
under Section 5 of the CEAA, then an EA is required) to a project list approach whereby projects requiring federal EAs are clearly
enumerated in advance, subject to the discretion of the Minister of Environment to require an EA for a non-listed project.
Aboriginal Consultation: The Standing Committee recommended that Aboriginal consultation be more fully integrated into the EA
process. The Committee recommended that the federal government work with the provinces, territories and Aboriginal groups to
develop a single Aboriginal consultation process applicable to all EAs under the CEAA.
Certainty of Outcomes: While the Standing Committee noted that improving the EA process was important, it also recognized that
improvements were needed to yield positive, measurable outcomes in federal EAs. To that end, the Committee recommended that
EAs be conducted early in the planning stages of a project, which will facilitate cooperation with other jurisdictions and enhance
the ability of Aboriginal groups to participate in project planning. The Committee recommended that EAs under the CEAA consider
positive environmental effects of proposed projects, not just adverse environmental effects. Greater reliance on follow-up programs
was also recommended by the Committee.”

20.1.3  Schedule
 
A  period  of  about  20  months  is  anticipated  for  the  preparation  of  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  obtaining  the
government decision. This period will include the time needed for the preparation of the Environmental Impact Assessment, the
evaluation of the study by the authorities, the preparation of answers to questions, the holding of public hearings, the preparation
and filing of BAPE’s report, the minister’s recommendation to the government and the release of the government decree.
Figure 20.2 illustrates the various stages involved in obtaining the Decree, along with the time required for each step.
20.2 Environmental Permitting
 
Even if the Project underwent Environmental Impact Assessment and was authorized by the Government pursuant to Section 31.5
of  the  Act,  it  would  still  be  subject  to  Section  22  of  the Environmental  Quality  Act and  must  therefore  obtain  a  certificate  of
authorization as stated in Section 6 of the Regulation Respecting the Administration of the Environment Quality Act.
“6. Notwithstanding Sections 1 to 3 of this Regulation, any project arising from a project authorized by the Government pursuant to
Section 31.5 of the Act is subject to the application of Section 22 of the Act.”
In addition to the mitigation measures set out as part of the environmental and social impact assessment, the final project design
must comply with all applicable standards for the proposed infrastructure and equipment.
The issuance of the certificate of authorization should only be a formality, as the certificate issued pursuant to Section 31.5 of the
Act binds the Minister as to where he exercises the powers provided in Section 22, as specified in Section 31.7 of the Act.

“31.7. Every decision rendered under Section 31.5 or 31.6 is binding on the Minister, where he subsequently exercises the powers
provided in Section 22, 32, 55, 70.11 or in Division IV.2.”
In addition to the certificate of authorization required under Section 22 of the Environment Quality Act, the proponent must obtain
permits,  authorizations,  approvals,  certificates  and  leases  required  from  the  appropriate  authorities  that  are  described  in  the
following sections.
The  authorization  application  and  permitting  process  is  expected  to  take  one  year  (Table  20.1.2).  Applications  may  be  filed
concurrently with the construction work and should therefore not impact the critical project schedule.
20.2.1  Certificates of Authorization
 
Certificates of Authorization
 
To carry out the Joanna Project, one or more certificates of authorization (CAs) will be required from the MDDEP under Section 22
of the Environment Quality Act (EQA). A CA application includes a form that is attached to the documents and information set out in
Sections 7 and 8 of the Regulation Respecting the Application of the Environment Quality Act (c. Q-2, r. 3). For mining activities,
CA applications must also comply with Directive 019 requirements.
In addition, because the Joanna Project involves discharges into the aquatic environment, it will be necessary to complete the
effluent  discharge  objectives  application  form  (Demande  d’objectifs  environnementaux  de  rejet  (OER)  pour  les  industries)  and
attach  it  to  the  CA  application.  The  CA  application  forms  and  all  required  documents  must  be  sent  to  the  MDDEP’s  Abitibi-
Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec regional branch. The time required to analyse an application for a certificate of authorization
directly depends on the complexity of the Project. Under the Declaration of Services to the Public, the Department is committed to
providing an official response within 75 days following receipt of the application for a certificate of authorization or approval.
 
July 2012

The number of CA applications to prepare will depend on the timeline for the Project activities and the associated work items.
Dividing the Project into predefined items will enable a step-by-step implementation process.
Under the Ministerial Order Concerning the Fees Payable Under the Environment Quality Act, fees are payable by the enterprise
seeking authorization under the Act. The fees established in the Ministerial Order are approximately $1,000 to $5,000 for each
request for authorization under Sections 22, 31, 32, 48 and 70.8 of the Act.
Authorization to Establish Water Supply Intakes and Devices for the Treatment of Drinking Water and Wastewater
 
Authorization under Section 32 of the EQA is needed to establish drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities. Two forms
must be completed and signed by the project engineer,  and  the  required  documents  must  be  attached.  The  two  forms  are  the
application  for  authorization  to  carry  out  a  water  or  wastewater  system  project  (Demande  d’autorisation  pour  réaliser  un  projet
d’aqueduc  et  d’égouts)  and  the  submission  of  applications  for  authorization  for  domestic  wastewater  treatment  systems
(Présentation des demandes d’autorisation pour les systèmes de traitement des eaux usées d’origine domestique). The required
documents  include  administrative  documents  and  a  technical  document  signed  by  the  project  engineer.  The  application  for
authorization must be submitted to the MDDEP regional branch.
Authorization to Install Apparatus or Equipment to Prevent, Reduce or Cause the Cessation of the Release of Contaminants into
the Atmosphere
 
Under Section 48 of the EQA, an application for authorization must be submitted for the installation of apparatus or equipment to
prevent, reduce or cause the cessation of the release of contaminants into the atmosphere. The application for the authorization of
an industrial project (Demande d’autorisation pour un projet industriel) must be completed and submitted to the MDDEP regional
branch. The documents to be attached to the application are listed on the form.

Under  Section  240  of  the Mining Act,  “Any  person  who  intends  to  operate  a  mill  for  the  preparation  of  mineral  substances,  a
concentration plant, a refinery or a smelter shall, before commencing operations, have the site approved by the Minister or, where
the Project is subject to the Environmental Impact Assessment and review procedure provided for in (Division IV.1 of Chapter I of
the Environment Quality Act Chapter Q-2), by the Government.” Section 241 of the same Act also states, “Every person responsible
for the management of a concentration plant, refinery or smelter shall, before commencing activities, have the site intended as a
storage yard for tailings approved by the Minister. The same applies to every holder of a mining right, owner of mineral substances
or operator who intends to establish a mine tailings site.” Consequently, a request for approval must be submitted to the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Wildlife (MRNF) before activities begin at the Joanna Mine. This request must include the information and
documents set out at Sections 124 and 125 of the Regulation Respecting Mineral Substances other than Petroleum, Natural Gas
and Brine.
20.2.3  Attestation
 
Depollution Attestation
 
In accordance with Order in Council 515-2002 issued on May 1, 20025, the Joanna Mine project requires a depollution attestation
from the MDDEP. This certificate, which is renewable every five (5) years, identifies the environmental conditions that must be met
by the industrial establishment when carrying out its activities. The certificate compiles all the environmental requirements relating
to the operation of an industrial establishment. The depollution attestation differs from the certificate of authorization issued under
Section 22 of the Environment Quality Act. The latter is a statutory instrument issued prior to the implementation of a project or
activity, whereas the former applies strictly to the operation of an industrial establishment. The steps in the depollution attestation
process are described below.
Order in Council
 
The process for issuing a depollution attestation is implemented through the adoption by the Government of Québec of an order in
council  that  subjects  certain  categories  of  industrial  establishments  to  Subdivision  1  of  Division  IV.2  of  Chapter  1  of  the
Environment Quality Act. This Subdivision of the Act establishes the legal framework for the depollution attestation.

Application for a Depollution Attestation
 
The operator of an industrial establishment subject to an order in council must apply to the Ministry for a depollution attestation
within a month of the start-up date. This application must be made using the form provided by the Ministry that identifies all of the
required information.
First draft of depollution attestation:
The Ministry prepares and submits a first draft of the depollution attestation to the industrial establishment. The establishment then
has 30 days to provide comments, as stipulated in the regulation.
Public Consultations
 
As stipulated in the regulation, the Ministry must publish a notice of public consultation in a daily or weekly newspaper within
90 days of the mailing date of the first draft of the depollution attestation. The Ministry must also make the request and attestation
project accessible for public consultation. These consultations must take place over a period of at least 45 days. The establishment
is also informed of the attestation project being submitted for public consultation.
Second Draft of Depollution Attestation
 
Following  the  public  consultations,  the  Ministry  reviews  the  comments  that  were  received  and  prepares  a  second  draft  of  the
depollution attestation. The second draft is submitted to the industrial establishment, which has 30 days to provide comments.
Issuing of Depollution Attestation
 
The Ministry reviews the final comments provided by the industrial establishment and prepares the final version of the depollution
attestation, which is issued to the industrial establishment for a period of five (5) years.

The establishment for its part is responsible for requesting a renewal of its depollution attestation six (6) months before it expires.
The original certificate will remain in effect until a new certificate is issued.
20.2.4  Permits
 
Forest Management Permit for Mining Activities
 
Under Section 20 of the Forest Act, holders of mining rights can obtain forest management permits for mining activities in order to
exercise their rights under the Mining Act. This permit authorizes the holder to cut timber on the land covered by the holder’s mining
rights for the construction of buildings or any other operations necessary to the holder’s mining activities, in compliance with the
Forest Act and its regulations. The applicant must have already obtained the right to operate the site for mining purposes, a right
which is granted by the Mines Section of the MRNF. Prior to proceeding with timber cutting operations, the holders of mining rights
must submit a written request to the MRNF forest management unit in order to obtain a permit for mining operations. The request
can be for the clearing of a site for mining activities, the exploratory boring of a gravel bed or the clearing of a gravel or sand pit.
It is important to note that the holder of a forest management permit for mining activities must scale all timber harvested in forests in
the domain of the State according to the standards prescribed by Government regulation as specified in Section 26 of the Forest
Act.  The  holder  is  responsible  for  paying  the  prescribed  dues  as  stipulated  in  Section  6  of  the Regulation  Respecting  Forest
Royalties.
High-Risk Petroleum Equipment Operating Permit
 
Under Section 120 of the Safety Code, “The owner of a petroleum equipment installation that includes at least one component that
is high-risk petroleum equipment must obtain a permit for the use of all the high-risk petroleum equipment situated at the same
address, until the equipment is removed from its respective place of use”.
“High-risk” petroleum equipment is defined in Section 8.01 of the Construction Code as having one of the following characteristics:
 
July 2012

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
§  For underground storage systems:
-  Capacity of 500 or more litres, used to store gasoline or diesel;
-  Capacity of 4,000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel oil except for equipment used for heating a residential
single-family dwelling;
§  For above-ground storage systems:
-  Capacity of 2,500 or more litres, used to store gasoline;
-  Capacity of 10,000 or more litres, used to store diesel;
-  Capacity of 10,000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel oil except for equipment used for heating a residential
single-family dwelling;
-  Storage tanks used to store gasoline, diesel, heating oil and heavy fuel oil for profit, regardless of their capacity.
 
The “Application for a Permit for the Use of High-Risk Petroleum Equipment” form must be completed and submitted to the Régie
du bâtiment. The application must include all of the information and documents identified in Section 121 of the Safety Code. A
permit is valid for 24 months. The issuing and renewal of a high-risk petroleum equipment permit is subject to compliance and
performance monitoring under the provisions of the Construction Code and the Safety Code.
Explosives Permit
 
Under the Act Respecting Explosives, no person shall possess, store, sell or transport explosives unless he holds a permit for such
purpose.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  their  use,  several  permits  are  required  for  the  possession  of  explosives  for  industrial  or
commercial purposes. Division II of the Regulation under the Act Respecting Explosives describes the different types of permits
that are required. A general explosives permit entitles the holder to have explosives in his possession. Only the holder of a general
permit can obtain a magazine, sales or transport permit. A magazine permit entitles the holder of a general permit to purchase and
store explosives in a container or a building that complies with the regulations. A transport permit entitles the holder of a general
permit to transport explosives.
To obtain these permits, the “Application for a General Explosives Permit” and “Application for a Sales, Magazine or Transport
Permit” forms, available from the Sûreté du Québec, must be completed. The required documents and fees must be submitted to
the Sûreté du Québec. Permits are valid for a period of five (5) years.

20.2.5  Leases
 
Mining Leases
 
Under Section 100 of the Mining Act, “no person may mine mineral substances, except surface mineral substances, petroleum,
natural gas and brine, unless he has previously obtained a mining lease from the Minister […]”. In order to obtain a mining lease, a
claim holder must establish the existence of indicators of the presence of a workable deposit. Applications must be submitted to the
Registrar’s  Office  or  the  regional  office.  The  initial  term  of  a  mining  lease  is  20  years.  The  lease  can  then  be  renewed  every
10 years for the duration of the mining operations. The procedure for obtaining a mining lease is described in the MRNF’s online
publication “Mining Leases and Concessions”.
Non-Exclusive Lease for the Mining of Surface Mineral Substances
 
According to Section 109 of the Mining Act, “a lessee or a grantee may use, for their mining activities, sand and gravel that is part of
the domain of the State except where the land that is subject to the lease is already subject to an exclusive lease to mine surface
mineral substances in favour of a third person”. The mining of sand and gravel located outside of mining leases requires a non-
exclusive lease for the mining of surface mineral substances, under Section 140 of the Mining Act. The applicant must make a
request  for  a  non-exclusive  lease  by  completing  the  “Application  for  Non-Exclusive  Lease  (BNE)  for  Mining  Surface  Mineral
Substances” form and include the documents identified in Section 3 of the form.
Lease for the Occupation of the Domain of the State
 
Under Section 239 of the Mining Act, “the holder of mining rights or the owner of mineral substances may, in accordance with the
Act respecting the lands in the domain of the State (Chapter T-8.1), obtain that public lands be transferred or leased to him to
establish a storage site for tailings, or a site for mills, shops or facilities necessary for mining activities”. Several components of the
Joanna Project might be located outside of the lands covered by the mining leases. Since the project is located on public lands, the
land in question will need to be leased under Section 47 of the Act Respecting the Lands in the Domain of the State.

20.3 Environmental Baseline Studies
 
Several  comprehensive  assessments  were  performed  from  2007  to-date  in  order  to  define,  in  compliance  with  all  applicable
guidelines,  policies,  regulations  and  laws  in  Québec  and  Canada,  the  state  of  reference  of  the  Joanna  Project  receiving
environment. The following subsections aim at briefly presenting those works and associated results.
20.3.1  Physical Environment
 
A review of all existing information on local topography, regional hydrography (watershed) and geomorphology was done in order
to precisely define the physical context in which the Joanna project will be implemented. Geotechnical investigations were also
completed (see Section 20.6). The area is relatively flat as a result of past glacial activity which led to the deposition of a vast
amount of clay (Ojibway-Barlow Lake). Soils are therefore essentially made of glaciolacustrine deposits (luvisols, gleysols). Those,
combined with a flat topography and a relatively cold climate, have favoured the development of important peatlands. Surface clay
deposits being subject to erosion and re-suspension, local and regional waters commonly have high turbidity. In some other areas,
thin glacial (till) and/or glaciofluvial deposits are observed, on which grow tree species such as black spruce and jack pine. Soil
quality analyses were also performed to assess baseline conditions. None of the sampled soils, which were located where surface
infrastructures will be implemented, showed results exceeding applicable criteria for industrial use.
Groundwater  quality  was  assessed  by  sampling  water  in  existing  wells  used  for  drilling  or  as  observation  wells  as  part  of  the
Hydrogeology Assessment Program. Results are presented in Section 20.3.1.1.6.
All waters from the mine site area run towards the Stitchman Creek. Downstream, waters flow to the Kinojevis River, a 140-km long
river which flows south to the Ottawa River. Surface water quality was assessed from 2007 to-date by annual sampling stations
implemented in order to cover the entire Stitchman Creek Sub-Watershed and downstream. Results were compared to applicable
provincial  and  federal  criteria  and  showed  that  surface  waters  are  generally  of  good  quality  for  the  protection  of  aquatic  life.
However, some natural exceedances were noted for some metals,  all  of  which  are  not  surprising  in  an  area  with  such  mining
potential.  Sediment  quality  was  also  assessed  by  annual  sampling  at  those  same  stations.  Results  were  also  compared  to
applicable criteria and showed some exceedances in metal content, all of which, again, are not surprising in the area.

20.3.1.1  Hydrogeology Assessment Program
 
As for any typical mining project, the Joanna Mine Project is expected to influence the groundwater system in the vicinity of the
project site. The magnitude and extent of the influence must be evaluated prior to the beginning of the project, since the site is
located in an area where groundwater is used as a source of water supply, and because it may be linked to sensitive surface-water
ecosystems.
 
20.3.1.1.1  Site Hydrogeological Investigation
 
In order to characterize the groundwater flow regime, detailed geotechnical and hydrogeological studies were conducted as part of
the project in the pit area, and at the sites where the development of associated mining infrastructure is foreseen. Aurizon Mines
mandated  TechnoRem  Inc.  to  perform  a  hydrogeological  study  of  the  Joanna  Mine  site  for  the  present  Feasibility  Study
(TechnoRem, 2010). In summary, the work carried out in 2010 consisted in:
§  drilling of 12 deep boreholes in the bedrock;
§  four (4) short-term and five (5) long-term pumping tests in the boreholes;
§  four (4) variable-head hydraulic tests in the boreholes; and
§  an exhaustive groundwater sampling and analysis program in the boreholes and surrounding private wells.
The objectives of the program were to collect data, primarily on the bedrock hydrogeological system, in order to model and predict
mine dewatering rates and the impact of operations on residential water wells, an esker located 4 km east, and the Vaudray and
Joannès Lakes Biodiversity Reserve.
A  supplementary  program  was  carried  out  in  2012  in  order  to  collect  additional  data,  this  time  on  the  spatial  distribution  and
hydraulic properties of the surface geological deposits in the vicinity of the proposed pits. The work consisted in:

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
§  drilling and installation of 9 shallow monitoring wells in the surface geological deposits;
§  variable-head hydraulic tests (slug tests) in each new monitoring well;
§  groundwater level survey.
The data collected on groundwater levels in the shallow deposits was intended primarily to improve the prediction of groundwater
surface configuration for pit slopes design.
 
20.3.1.1.2  Hydrostratigraphy
 
The information available on the project area shows the occurrence of two (2) main hydrogeological systems. The first system, of a
confined to semi-confined type, is encountered deep in the bedrock formations, while the second system is encountered near the
surface, and presents potentially semi-confined to unconfined conditions.
Hydrogeological System in Bedrock
 
As previously described, the bedrock in the project area is part of the Superior Geological Province of the Canadian Shield (Abitibi
and Pontiac sub-provinces). The rock formations consist in volcano-sedimentary rocks with some intrusive rocks (granitoids, mafic
and ultramafic dykes and sills). At the project site, the main geological units consist in a greywacke including beds of siltstone,
argillite,  and  arkose;  and  a  greywacke  including  polygenetic  conglomerate  units.  The  sedimentary  rocks  have  experienced
metamorphism.
The  regional  Cadillac  Fault  crosses  the  project  site  at  the  pit  location.  Observations  in  drillholes  intersecting  the  faults  and
mineralogy of the latter suggest that it does not act as a significant groundwater flow corridor.
The type of rock formations encountered at the project site are typically considered as low-permeability rocks. These rocks display
little  primary  porosity  in  the  matrix,  but  a  more  important  secondary  porosity  associated  with  fracture  and  joint  systems.
Groundwater flow within the rock mass is controlled primarily by the fracture network patterns and connectivity. At the pit location,
the surface of the bedrock is weathered over 10 to 20 m deep, but of good quality deeper.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The bedrock formations are the main aquifer6 in the project area. They typically allow the installation of low-yield wells that can
supply water for private homes. These conditions are found in the project area.
Hydrogeological System in Surface Geological Deposits
 
The  project  area  is  covered  by  glacial  deposits  from  the  Wisconsinian  geological  period,  notably  till  deposits.  Mostly  in  the
southern area of the proposed pit, and also in the northern part of the project area, the bedrock outcrops, as numerous small hills.
Additionally,  glaciolacustrine  deposits  are  widespread  in  the  project  area.  They  consist  in  successive  layers  of  fine  to  coarse
sediments overlaid by peat deposits. An esker is also reported some four (4) km east of the proposed pit. Because of the coarse
nature of the sediments typically found in eskers, it is assumed that it acts as a source of recharge of Vaudray and Joannès lakes.
At the project location, geological data has allowed the determination of the site stratigraphy (TechnoRem, 2010). Typically, peat
deposits  of  less  than  2  m  thick  overlay  an  interbedded  clayey  silt  to  silty  clay  layer.  This  layer  was  intersected  almost  in  all
boreholes, and the thickness of these clay and silt deposits can reach up to 60 m in some areas. A slightly coarser layer of about 10
m thick, composed of silt and sandy silt, is often encountered beneath the clay and silt deposits. Little data is available on the
spatial distribution of this layer. Lastly, a discontinuous coarser layer of silty sand, which directly overlies the bedrock, was found in
some boreholes.
The shallow hydrogeological system is located in the more permeable layers of the surface geological deposits, encountered near
the surface and the contact with the bedrock. The bulk porosity and hydraulic conductivity of sandy and silty deposits are often
higher than those measured in bedrock formations. Groundwater flow within the deposits mass is controlled by the primary porosity
of the matrix, which can allow storage of significant quantities of water.
In order to act as an aquifer, the sand and silt deposits must have significant thicknesses and extents. This does not seem to be the
case in the vicinity of the project site. No private wells were reported to be installed in sand or silt deposits in the project area.
However, the more permeable silt layers near the surface may play a significant role in the local surface hydrology, since they can
be connected with surface water bodies, such as the Stitchman Creek.

In contrast, the clay layer near the surface acts as an aquitard7. When present, it confines and protects the bedrock aquifer.
 
20.3.1.1.3  Hydraulic Properties
 
The  results  of  the  various  hydraulic  tests  performed  at  the  site  were  used  to  estimate  the  main  hydraulic  properties  of  surface
deposits and bedrock formations, i.e., the hydraulic conductivity (permeability), transmissivity and storage coefficient. The results
confirm the low hydraulic potential of the sandy-silt and bedrock formations, and values are comparable to those generally reported
in the literature for such units (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). Table 20.1 summarizes the results of the various hydraulic tests.

The bedrock formations display hydraulic conductivities ranging between 3.6 x 10-8 m/s and 3.2 x 10-6 m/s. Transmissivity values
are in the range of 1.3 m²/d to 29.8 m²/d.  Storage coefficients are estimated between 1.2 x 10-4 and 2.2 x 10-3. These results
indicate  that  the  bedrock  formations  are  under  confined  to  semi-confined  conditions,  and  that  the  low  transmissivity  is
representative of a small-capacity aquifer.
The hydraulic testing performed in the shallow wells has also allowed the evaluation of the hydraulic properties of the surface
deposits. Hydraulic conductivity values ranging between 3.8 x 10-6 m/s and 5.2 x 10-4 m/s are estimated in the deposits. The
variation in the results is probably related to the nature of the deposit tested, i.e. according to the variable proportions of clay, silt
and sand, characteristic of these heterogeneous deposits.
 
20.3.1.1.4  Groundwater Flow Regime
 
The  results  from  the  hydrogeological  investigations  carried  out  at  the  project  site  were  used  to  define  the  components  of  the
groundwater flow (TechnoRem, 2010). Knowledge of the different groundwater flow components at the project site will allow the
identification of sensitive areas, such as recharge and discharge zones, and the evaluation of the migration paths for potential
contaminants in the groundwater.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Drilling activities performed in 2010 in the pit area showed that the depth of the water table was between 0.40 m and 2.04 m in the
bedrock  aquifer  (TechnoRem,  2010).  Data  collected  in  the  new  shallow  wells  in  2012  have  shown  groundwater  level  depths
ranging between 0.91 m and 2.39 m. These results suggest that the piezometric surface follows relatively well the topography of
the site, with respect to the shallow and deep hydrogeological systems.
Data collected during the water level survey conducted in July and August, 2010 were used to prepare a preliminary groundwater
piezometric  map  for  the  bedrock  aquifer  (TechnoRem,  2010).  The  piezometric  map  suggests  that  regional  groundwater  flow
direction is mainly towards the west; following the natural course of the Stitchman Creek. At the project site, groundwater flow is
concentric, and flows naturally from higher-elevation grounds surrounding the sites towards the proposed pits location. With such a
pattern, the flow is presumably controlled by the groundwater level, where the recharge is done directly by precipitation in bedrock
outcrop areas and/or permeable surface deposits setting topographic highs and hills.
 
20.3.1.1.5  Classification of Hydrogeological Units
 
The status of a groundwater resource and its relative value varies depending on a number of criteria related to its hydrogeological
properties and potential uses. The MDDEP groundwater classification system is a tool to ensure the reconciliation of the uses of
the territory with those of groundwater resources according to the following classes (MENV, 1999).
The main classes defined within this system are:
§  Class I: Aquifer that is an irreplaceable source of water (single source of water supply or supplying a community);
§  Class II: Aquifer that is a common source (II a) or a potential source (II b) of water because of its acceptable quality (drinking
water with usual treatment) and sufficient quantities (transmissivity greater than 1 m²/d);
§  Class III: Aquifer that, although saturated with water, cannot constitute a water supply (III a and III b: poor quality, insufficient
quantity or non-economic extraction).
July 2012
20-27
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
According to these definitions, the bedrock aquifer at the mine site is a Class II aquifer that can be used to supply small wells. The
source of water for the residents, mainly located south of the site along provincial road 117, is provided by bedrock private wells.
Surface geological deposits could represent aquifers of Class I or II, insofar as they are of sufficient thickness and extent to serve
as a source of supply of interest. This is certainly not the case at the project site, but the esker located four (4) km west could be a
Class I aquifer although it is beyond the area influenced by the project.
 
20.3.1.1.6  Geochemical Characteristics of the Groundwater
 
The geochemical characteristics of the groundwater were established from the results of an exhaustive sampling campaign and
analytical program (TechnoRem, 2010). Groundwater samples were collected in private wells, as well as in the test and monitoring
wells specifically installed for the current project.
The samples were analyzed for the following physico-chemical parameters: pH, temperature, electric conductivity, hardness, Eh
Potential, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, colour, odour, major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO3, Cl, SO4), minor ions (Fe, F, Mn, nitrates and
nitrites), metals (Al, Sb, As, Ba, B, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se); and cyanides. Groundwater from private wells was also analyzed for
microbiological parameters. The results of the chemical analyses are described, hereafter.
The results of the groundwater samples collected in all monitoring and test wells, five (5) at the site location, present concentrations
below all criteria included in Guideline 019 of the MDDEP for the mining industry, except for iron and arsenic that are exceeding
the criteria in two (2) wells. All other physico-chemical parameters present concentrations well below the criteria.
Groundwater was also sampled in eleven (11) private wells. The results were compared against Québec drinking water regulation
(Règlement sur la qualité de l’eau potable – RQEP)  and  Canadian  standards.  Groundwater  respects  the  criteria  for  almost  all
parameters, except for iron and hardness. In one case, arsenic criterion for drinking water was exceeded; such exceedance is not
surprising considering that other natural exceedances were observed in the past for private wells in the region. Hardness is very
high, which explains the use by owners of water-softener systems.
 
July 2012
20-28
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Groundwater  samples  collected  in  a  well  installed  in  the  esker  located  four  (4)  km  east  of  the  site  was  also  analyzed.  The
groundwater  chemical  content  exhibits  concentrations  below  the  MDDEP  drinking-water  criteria  (RQEP)  for  all  parameters
analyzed, except iron, manganese and hardness. In this case, the hardness is very low.
The groundwater sampled in the private wells and the wells drilled for the project is representative of the groundwater quality in the
bedrock  aquifer.  The  well  in  the  esker  presents  the  geochemical  characteristics  of  a  distinct  hydrogeological  system.  Iron,
manganese and hardness do not represent a hazard for human health, but are rather esthetical criteria. Only the occurrence of
arsenic, detected in a few samples, represents a threat for health, and should be monitored if groundwater is intended to be used
as a source of drinking-water supply.
 
20.3.1.1.7  Groundwater Vulnerability
 
The assessment of groundwater vulnerability to a potential contamination from human activities is an approach used to implement,
if necessary, measures for the protection of the resource. One of the approaches suggested by the MDDEP to assess groundwater
vulnerability is the DRASTIC method (Aller et al., 1989). The method is applied for the protection of an aquifer, which is the bedrock
aquifer in the current project.
The vulnerability of groundwater in the bedrock aquifer depends highly on the nature and hydrogeological characteristics of the
overlying  surface  deposits.  Indeed,  many  of  the  parameters  required  to  estimate  the  DRASTIC  index  are  associated  with  the
geological layer overlying the aquifer. There is currently little information on the spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties of the
surface deposits. Accurate data on hydraulic characteristics and thickness of the deposits are required to calculate the DRASTIC
index. The information collected at the site is primarily related to the bedrock, although it will be completed for surface deposits in
the current year (2012). However, it is possible to obtain a first qualitative estimate of the vulnerability, namely when using a map
showing the distribution of surface deposits.
 
July 2012
20-29
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Areas characterized at the surface by the occurrence of low-permeability clayey and silty deposits will typically present a lower
vulnerability.  A  higher  vulnerability  will  characterize  areas  of  bedrock  outcrops  and  those  where  the  thickness  of  the  deposits
above the rock is low. A better knowledge of the spatial distribution of groundwater vulnerability will be obtained as a result of the
complementary  hydrogeological  characterization  work  to  be  carried  out  in  2012,  which  will  address  geotechnical  issues
concerning hydraulic characteristics of surface deposits and groundwater depth.
 
20.3.1.1.8  Users of the Resource
 
The project site is located along Provincial road 117, some 20 km east of Rouyn-Noranda. About 50 private homes have been
identified along the road within a 5-km radius around the project site. Some of them are located less than 1.5 km from the site.
Since there is no aqueduct in the vicinity of the project site, all private homes are assumed to be equipped with an individual well.
Groundwater is used for these homes as the main drinking-water source, as well as for cooking, washing, and laundry. Several
houses are equipped with a water-softener system.
As described earlier, the quality of the groundwater is generally good. High content in iron and manganese are measured in the
groundwater, as well as a very high hardness.
 
20.3.1.1.9  Impact and Issues on Groundwater Resources
Mine Dewatering
 
The development of the mine will required the dewatering of the pits. The occurrence of pit deposits and potentially saturated silt
and sand layers may represent a challenge for dewatering. Pumping activities will influence the groundwater system, notably the
groundwater level elevation in the vicinity of the mining pits. The results will be to lower down the water table, which can affect
nearby private wells and baseflow in surrounding streams and lakes.

performed to estimate the daily flow rate required to keep the pits dry and to evaluate the area and extent of the zone affected by the
groundwater drawdown (TechnoRem 2010 and 2012). The modeling results indicated that an average rate of 8,100 m³/d should be
maintained for operation of the mine. The radius of influence of the dewatering activities will potentially affect an area of up to
approximately 1 km from the pit limits.
Impact of Operations on Residential Water Wells
 
Dewatering impact on residential wells is sensitive to stakeholders. According to the results of the hydrogeology study performed in
2010 and 2012 by TechnoRem, the operation of the Joanna mine should not impact residential water wells in the area, in terms of
either water supply or quality.
Moreover, groundwater quality and level will be monitored to ensure residential wells are not affected by mining operations.
Impact of Operations on the Esker
 
A north-south trending esker is located 4 km east of the future pit location. It represents a potential link between the two protected
land areas, a potential resource of freshwater, and the contingency plan for the water source of the Rouyn-Noranda community. As
a result, the possible impact of the operation on the esker is a sensitive point for the stakeholders.
According to the results of the hydrogeological study (TechnoRem 2010 and 2012), the operation of the Joanna mine will have no
impact on the esker.
§  The esker is upstream from the operation;
§  All infrastructure and future pit operations are currently located along a different watershed than the esker.
Impact of Operations on the Vaudray-and-Joannès-Lakes Biodiversity Reserve
 
The Vaudray-and-Joannès-Lakes Biodiversity Reserve is located about 1.2 km south of the future pit. As a result, the possible
impact of the operation on this protected area is a sensitive point for stakeholders.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The hydrogeological study established the piezometric map  for the project area. A watershed boundary separates Joannès Lake
and the Joanna site. Joannès Lake and the Joanna site are therefore located in two separate watersheds and there is no hydraulic
link between the two locations. The drawdown of the water table from mining operations will not impact the water level of Joannès
Lake.
Impact on Groundwater Quality
 
In addition to a local change around the pit itself, no effect is expected on the groundwater quality. Dewatering activities will also
act as a hydraulic trap that will prevent the migration from the site of any potential contaminant in the area influenced by pumping.
Water from the pit will be treated before being returned into the environment.
Furthermore, a groundwater monitoring network will be implemented at the mining site in the vicinity of the potential source of
contamination.
20.3.2  Biological Environment
 
A  study  area  covering  the  entire  Property  was  established  in  order  to  assess  biological  conditions  prevailing  prior  to  the
implementation of the Project. Plant communities were mapped within that area; results indicate that the Property is essentially
covered by softwood stands (about 55%; mainly black spruce moss stands) followed by wetlands (about 25%; mainly bogs). No
special-status plant species were found within the Property, even if special attention was paid to their presence.
Most  recently,  the  Government  of  Québec  adopted  Bill  71,  namely  the Loi  concernant  des  mesures  de  compensation  pour  la
réalisation de projets affectant un milieu humide ou hydrique (published in French only) which states that:
“[...] the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks [MDDEP] can require the project proponent to implement
compensation  measures  aiming  at,  among  other  things,  restoring,  protecting  or  valorizing  a  wetland,  an  aquatic  or  a  terrestrial
environment.” [Translation done by the author]

Therefore, Aurizon Mines Ltd will have to compensate for losses of wetlands caused by the implementation of its Joanna Project.
Further  discussions  with  the  MDDEP  are  necessary  in  order  to  establish  how  those  losses  will  be  compensated,  but  to-date,
several  scenarios  were  proposed  and  some  were  deemed  acceptable  by  the  MDDEP.  However,  the  precise  evaluation  of  the
selected scenario will be completed as part of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process.
A vast review of all existing information on wildlife in the study area was also completed. That led to the mapping of all legally-
protected wildlife habitats (i.e. white-tailed deer yard, waterfowl gathering area, fish habitats, etc.). Additional field surveys were
done to precisely map all fish habitats within the Property limits. A list of wildlife species occurring or potentially occurring within the
study area was established; about 30 mammal species and 35 waterfowl and grouse species have the potential to be present
within the Property limits according to this information. More detailed surveys with regards to forest birds are now ongoing. Among
those species are special-status wildlife species with the potential to appear in the area, such as the bald eagle, peregrine falcon,
short-eared owl, least weasel, two bat species and two micromammal species. It is however important to note that none of those
species was ever observed in the area.
 
20.3.2.1  Fisheries and Fish Habitats
 
As  previously  mentioned,  and  in  Section  20.7,  all  mine  infrastructures  are  located  within  only  one  (1)  sub-watershed,  namely
Stitchman Creek. In fact, the POX Tailings Management Facility (POX-TMF) is located outside that area, but all waters coming from
that  facility  will  be  managed  in  such  a  way  that  it  will  be  pumped  to  the  Process  Water  Polishing  Pond  (PWPP)  and  then
discharged with the final effluent within the Stitchman Sub-Watershed. No water discharge is located outside the Stitchman Sub-
Watershed. Therefore, within that area and where there was the potential to locate any of the required surface infrastructures, a
comprehensive Fisheries and Fish Habitats Assessment Program was performed to precisely locate all sections of the Stitchman
Creek and its affluents which are to be considered as fish habitats according to Canada’s Fisheries Act.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The objective of such work was to limit the ecological footprint of the Project to areas located outside those habitats. Among other
things, the use of thickened tailings was also prioritized in order to minimize the footprint of the Tailings Management Facility.
As depicted in Section 20.1, the performed Fisheries Assessment Program showed that the Stitchman Creek and its affluents,
where considered as fish-bearing creeks, host species such as brook stickleback, pearl dace (both totalling about 99%) and catfish.
None  host  fish  species  of  importance  to  any  ongoing  productivity  of  commercial,  recreational  or  Aboriginal  fisheries.  Such
information might be of interest in line with the most recent Bill C-38 which enumerates factors to be taken into account before
recommending to the Governor in Council that a regulation be made in respect of section 35 of the Fisheries Act. Among those are
“the contribution of the relevant fish [species] to the ongoing productivity of commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fisheries and
whether  there  are  measures  and  standards  to  avoid,  mitigate  or  offset  serious  harm  to  fish  that  are  part  of  a  commercial,
recreational or Aboriginal fishery, or that support such a fishery.” Such further analysis will have to be done with the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) as part of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process. Still, considering the
proposed  site  general  arrangement  plan,  only  the  location  of  the  proposed  Hosco  and  West  pits  will  require  the  deviation  of
existing  fish-bearing  watercourses.  No  other  encroachment  in  fish-bearing  watercourses  is  required.  Among  those  two  (2)
watercourses that will have to be deviated is a ditch implemented as part of the past operating Hosco mine. Following preliminary
discussions  with  the  DFO,  the  deviation  of  those  two  (2)  watercourses  would  not  require  a  license  under  Section  35  of  the
Fisheries  Act.  Indeed,  works  proposed  by  Aurizon  Mine  and  Roche  Ltd  to  deviate  those  watercourses  have,  for  now,  been
considered sufficient to mitigate/offset the impact on fish.
Results depicted in Section 20.3.1.1 show that the most recent hydrogeology assessment works indicate that rocks within the pit
area are lowly permeable, and that the anticipated drawdown would not result in decreased water flows/levels within the nearby
Stitchman Creek.

20.3.3  Past Environmental Impact Assessment Works
 
Following the issuance by Aurizon Mines of a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS), several works were completed in order to further assess
the potential impact of the Project, as described in the PFS. Among those were the impact on soils, surface water, sediments,
groundwater,  air  quality,  noise  levels,  vibrations,  landscape,  fisheries  and  fish  habitats,  terrestrial  habitats  and  wetlands,
amphibians and reptiles, waterfowls, prey and forest birds, and terrestrial wildlife. This information will be updated using the Project
Description included in the present Study as part of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment process. Most information
will  be  used  without  any  major  modification,  while  others  will  have  to  be  significantly  updated  to  fit  in  with  the  actual  Joanna
Project.
20.4 Tailings Characteristics and Management
20.4.1  Considerations for Tailings Management
 
Directive  019  outlines  MDDEP  requirements  with  regards  to  mine  tailings  characteristics  (low  risk,  leachable,  acid-generating,
cyanide-containing, and high risk).
The requirements specify leak-proofing measures to be applied to mine tailings management facilities in terms of the materials
stockpiled, thereby ensuring groundwater protection. Figure 20.3 specifies the criteria to be considered in determining the leak-
proofing measures.
The results of total metal analyses and leaching tests conducted on ore show that it is acidogenic and leachable, especially for
arsenic, which is found in high concentrations in the ore. The tailings produced from ore processing are therefore also acidic and
leachable under Directive 019.
Processing this type of ore occurs in two stages. The first stage entails the flotation of sulphides associated with gold, and aims to
produce a sulphide concentrate. The second stage involves treating sulphide concentrates by way of cyanidation to recover gold.
Normally, the waste produced at each stage is combined and placed in tailings.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
For the Joanna Project, the objective is to incorporate environmental protection measures in a context of sustainable development
as soon as the initial phase of the Project is complete. It has, therefore, been decided to manage tailings separately. Since arsenic
and sulphur are directly related to gold principally in the form of arsenopyrite, the goal is to produce de-sulphurized tailings through
step flotation of sulphides (~95% of tailings). These tailings contain little arsenic and sulphur and can therefore be disposed of in a
conventional tailings facility, which can be restored by way of conventional methods. The other type of tailings (~5% of tailings) is
leachable and requires protective measures specified under Directive 019.
The goal is to avoid having a small amount of tailings that represent an environmental risk from making all the tailings a risk to the
environment.  Laboratory  tests  have  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of  recovering  gold  optimally  by  producing  both  desulphurized
(flotation) and sulphurized (POX) tailings in a proportion of about 95% and 5% respectively.

20.4.2  Flotation Tailings
 
20.4.2.1  Characterization of Flotation Tailings
 
Samples
 
Eleven samples of flotation tailings were collected and characterized at the SGS Lakefield pilot plant in 2012. The samples were
generated following ore processing from various locations in the deposit. The mean values can therefore be calculated in order to
obtain a good representation of the whole flotation tailings.
Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) Potential
 
The average sulfides and sulfur contents were 0.05% and 0.07%, respectively. The tailings are therefore de facto classified as non-
ARD according to the Directive 019 criterion (0.3%). The average neutralization potential (NP) is 19.2 kg CaCO3/t and the average
net  neutralization  potential  (NNP)  is  +  17.7  kg  CaCO3/t,  which  is  slightly  below  the  Directive  019  criterion  (+  20  kg  CaCO3/t)
applying to mine waste with sulfur content > 0.3%.  However, the average NP/AP ratio (13.1) is largely higher than the Directive
019 criterion (3.0).
Leaching Potential
 
The average concentrations measured in the leachates obtained with the TCLP, SPLP and CTEU-9 leaching tests were largely
lower  than  the  groundwater  quality  protection  criteria  for  most  of  the  parameters,  with  the  exception  of  arsenic,  aluminum  and
manganese.
The average arsenic concentrations measured with the TCLP test (0.22 mg/L), the SPLP test (0.24 mg/L) and the SFE test (0.33
mg/L) were lower than the groundwater protection criterion (0.34 mg/L). Flotation tailings are thus not classified as "leachable" for
arsenic because the average concentration measured with the TCLP test was lower than the groundwater protection criterion.
The average aluminum concentrations measured with the TCLP test (0.83 mg/L) and the SPLP test (1.27 mg/L) were higher than
the groundwater protection criterion (0.75 mg/L). However, the average aluminum concentrations obtained with the SFE test (0.66
mg/L) were lower than the groundwater protection criterion.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
During the tests carried out at the Unité de recherche et de service en technologie minérale de l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue (URTSM)
in 2011 on the same type of flotation tailings (sulfur content = 0.5%, NP = 22.6 kgCaCO3/t), the aluminum concentration measured
in the leachate from the TCLP test was 0.475 mg/L. However, leachates collected from the kinetic test (column) were always lower
than 0.01 mg/L. The results from the kinetic test are more representative of the natural field conditions. Considering results from the
kinetic test and the SFE static test, it can be concluded that flotation tailings are not likely to leach aluminum.
The  average manganese  concentrations  measured  with  the  TCLP  test  (2.2  mg/L)  were  slightly  higher  than  the  groundwater
protection criterion (1.9 mg/L). However, the average concentrations obtained with the SPLP test (0.015 mg/L) and the SFE test
(0.006 mg/L) were largely lower than the groundwater protection criterion.
During the tests carried out at the URTSM in 2011 on the same type of flotation tailings, the manganese concentration measured in
the leachate from the TCLP test was 3.62 mg/L.  However, leachates collected from the kinetic test (column) were always lower
than 0.01 mg/L and these results are more representative of the natural field conditions. Considering the results from the kinetic test
as well as those from the TCLP and SFE static tests, it can be concluded that flotation tailings are not likely to leach manganese.
 
20.4.2.2  Flotation Tailings Management Facility Design
 
Aurizon Mines decided to thicken the mine tailings so as to limit the area required for the tailings management facility, and to avoid
encroaching upon streams considered to be a fish habitat.
As noted earlier, tailings resulting from the flotation step are considered low risk under Directive 019, which means no leak-proofing
measures are required, as specified in Section 2.9.4 of Directive 019:
”Low-risk tailings accumulation areas do not require any leak-proofing measures for the protection of groundwater.”
The  tailings  management  facility  capacity  was  estimated  at  38  Mt  (40  Mt  x  95%).  At  an  estimated  density  of  1.35  t/m³,  this
represents a volume of 28.2 Mm³.

The dikes will be built with crushed neutral waste rock. These permeable dikes will allow water to filter through and be collected in
ditches around the tailings pond. Additional studies are required to validate the use of mine tailings and particle sizes required to
meet filtering criteria.
The drainage ditch encircling the tailings pond will be connected to a 450,000 m³ pond. Pond water will be recirculated to the
concentrator. The pond will also be equipped with an emergency spillway.
Given the lack of adequate geotechnical data, a dike slope of 2.5: 1 was considered, but this slope will also need to be validated at
the detailed engineering stage by geotechnical studies.
To minimize construction costs, the Flotation Tailings Management Facility will be developed in three stages. Given the lack of
adequate  geotechnical  data,  the  downstream  construction  method  was  selected.  Construction  costs  for  that  infrastructure  are
estimated at $53.5 million. Table 20.2 summarizes construction costs for each step.

20.4.3  Tailings Produced by POX Process
The gold, arsenic and sulphur concentrate produced in the flotation stage will be treated using the POX process. Cyanide will be
directly  destroyed  in  the  concentrator  to  reduce  the  cyanide  concentration  to  less  than  20  ppm  prior  to  discharge  in  the  POX
Tailings Management Facility.
 
20.4.3.1  Characterization of POX Tailings
 
Samples Description
 
Four  (4)  samples  of  POX  tailings  (liquid  and  solid)  have  been  collected  at  the  Sherritt  International  Corporation  installation  in
Alberta and characterized at Maxxam and Corem laboratories in 2011. Two (2) samples have been submitted to a neutralisation
process in which part of the sulfide is oxidized to sulphate.
 
July 2012
20-41
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Liquid Phase of the Tailings
 
Liquid samples showed high mean concentrations of arsenic (4.9 mg/L), molybdenum (2.43 mg/L), cobalt (0.30mg/L) and copper
(0.20 mg/L).
Solid Phase of the Tailings
 
Metal content
 
The  mean  arsenic  content  is  especially  high  (26  500  mg/kg).  Other  metals  showing  mean  content  exceeding  Criteria  A  of  the
Politique de protection des sols et de réhabilitation des terrains contaminés (PPSRTC) includes cobalt (182 mg/kg), copper (633
mg/kg) and nickel (617 mg/kg).
Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) Potential
 
The mean sulfides and sulfur contents were 2.98% and 1.48%, respectively. The mean acidification potential is 46.9 kgCaCO3/t
and  the  average  neutralization  potential  (NP)  is  79.5  kgCaCO3/t.  The  average  net  neutralization  potential  (NNP)  is  +  32.6
kgCaCO3/t, which is above the Directive 019 criterion (+ 20 kgCaCO3/t).  However, the average NP/AP ratio (1.7) is lower than the
Directive 019 criterion (3.0). According to Price (2009) classification, this waste would be in the uncertainty zone.
Leaching Potential
 
The average arsenic concentrations measured with the TCLP test (4.14 mg/L) is below the criteria (5,0) found in Appendix II, Table
1, of Directive 019 and is therefore not classified as "high risk". However, the concentrations obtained with the SPLP test (5.48
mg/L) and the CTEU-9 test (8.03 mg/L) are higher than the criteria.
The average nickel concentrations measured with the TCLP test (11.4 mg/L) is also very high, but there are no criteria for this
parameter in Appendix II, Table 1, of Directive 019.
Directive 019 stipulates that, for a given parameter, if the content is higher than Criteria A of the PPSRTC, and if the TCLP leachate
shows concentrations higher than the groundwater quality protection criteria, the sample is classified as "leachable".  Considering
the groundwater quality protection criteria of 0.34 mg/L for arsenic and 0.22 mg/L for nickel, it can be concluded that POX tailings is
a "leachable" mining waste.
 
July 2012
20-42
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Moreover, arsenic content (26 500 mg/kg) is largely higher than Criteria C of the PPSRTC (50 mg/kg) and arsenic concentrations in
the liquid phase (4.9 mg/L) are largely higher groundwater quality protection criteria (0.34 mg/L). In this context, this material must
be managed as a high risk mining waste.
These  tailings  will  therefore  be  disposed  of  in  a  separate  tailings  management  facility  that  meets  level  B  leak-proofing  criteria
indicated in Directive 019.
 
20.4.3.2  POX Tailings Management Facility Design
 
To comply with Level B leak-proofing criteria specified in Directive 019, the bottom and walls of the POX Tailings Management
Facility shall be protected by two (2) synthetic watertight liners.
The required POX Tailings Management Facility capacity is estimated at 3.75 Mt (40 Mt x 5% x 1.88 [increased tonnage factor for
autoclave process]). At a density of 1.2 t/m³, this represents a volume of 3.1 Mm³.
The  infrastructure  is  located  in  an  area  for  which  no  detailed  topographical  information  is  available,  and  where  very  little
geotechnical drilling has been done. A topographical survey of the area and additional geotechnical studies would help optimize
its location and management.

20.5 Waste Rock, Overburden and Top Soil Management
20.5.1  Waste Rock Characterization
 
20.5.1.1  Methodology
 
Comprehensive Geochemical Characterization
 
A comprehensive geochemical characterization of waste rock and ore has been carried out in 2011. A total of 154 samples of
waste  and  15  samples  of  ore  have  been  selected  by  geologists  working  for  Mines  Aurizon  Ltd.  The  sampling  locations  were
selected using a grid in order to obtain a representative proportion of samples from the various geological types. The number of
samples for the various geological types were as follow: Cadillac fault (20), amphibolite (2), wacke + amphibolite (2), wacke (120),
conglomerate  (5),  wacke  +  conglomerate  (3)  and  mafic  intrusion  (2).  Near  80  %  of  the  samples  are  from  the  wacke  type.
Amphibolite and Cadillac fault samples represent nearly 15 % of the samples.
All the samples from the characterization campaign have been subjected to the following tests:
§  Element content for Al, Sb, Ag, As, Ba, Be, Bi, B, Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Sn; F, Mn, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Th, U and Zn by partial digestion
using aqua regia;
§  U.S. EPA-1311 (TCLP) leaching test;
§  U.S. EPA-1312 (SPLP) leaching test;
§  Shake Flask Extraction (SFE) leaching test (ASTM, D3987);
§  Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) potential by the Modified Sobek method.
X-ray diffraction (for mineralogical identification) and X-ray fluorescence following borate digestion (for total content of SiO2, Al2O3,
Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, P2O5, Cr2O3 and V2O5) have also been carried out on 21 of the 154 waste samples.
Other less important characterization programs have been previously carried out. In 2010, kinetic tests (column) have been carried
out at the Unité de recherche et de service en technologie minérale de l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue (URSTM) on three (3) composite
samples of waste showing high to very high arsenic content: two (2) wacke type composites with total arsenic content of 4 800
mg/kg and 620 mg/kg, and an amphibolite type composite with a total arsenic content of 532 mg/kg. Arsenopyrite (FeAsS) has
been identified as the main mineral containing arsenic, with Gersdorffite (NiAsS) sometimes present in spatial relation with the
Cadillac Fault. The objective of this program was to develop a better understanding of the geochemical behavior of arsenic in
waste. Finally, three (3) field test pads with large waste tonnage have been monitored since 2008.

20.5.1.2  Mineralogical Description and Metal Contents
 
Mineralogical Description and Metal Contents (total digestion)
 
Amphibolite  and  Cadillac  fault  samples  showed  high  contents  of  chlorite,  talc,  micas,  amphibole  (hornblende)  and  carbonate.
Wacke and conglomerate samples showed higher quartz and feldspath contents and lower carbonate contents. High total calcium
and  magnesium  contents  have  been  observed  for  amphibolites  and  Cadillac  fault  samples,  which  indicate  the  presence  of
carbonates.
Metal Contents (partial digestion) and Soil Criteria
 
Table 20.4 shows mean metal contents for the various waste types and the ore as well as Criteria A, B and C of the Politique de
protection des sols et de réhabilitation des terrains contaminés (PPSRTC). Average content of arsenic, cobalt, chromium, copper,
mercury, molybdenum and nickel generally exceeded Criteria A.
 
20.5.1.3  Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) Potential
 
Table 20.5 outlines the summary of results for the acid rock drainage (ARD) potential study. The main conclusions are:
Average sulfur content for amphibolite (0.14 %), mafic intrusion (0.17 %), wacke + amphibolite (0.26 %) and wacke + conglomerate
(0.30  %)  that  were  lower  than  the  Directive  019  criterion  (0.3  %).  These  types  of  waste  are de  facto  classified  as  non-ARD
generating according to Directive 019;

§  Average sulfur content for the Cadillac fault (0.43 %), wacke (0.34 %), and conglomerate (0.33 %) exceeding the Directive 019
criterion. Waste from these geological types are not de facto classified as non-ARD generating;
§  Wastes from the Cadillac fault are non-ARD generating because the net neutralisation potential (NNP) (+ 145.8 kgCaCO3/t) is
higher  than  the  Directive  019  criterion  (+  20  kgCaCO3/t)  and  the  neutralization  potential/acidification  potential  ratio  (NP/AP)
(12.8) is higher than the Directive 019 criterion (3.0);
§  Waste from conglomerate are non-ARD generating because the NNP (+ 28.3 kgCaCO3/t) and the NP/AP ratio (3.71) are higher
than the Directive 019 criteria;
§  Waste  from  wacke  is  potentially  ARD  generating  because  the  sulfur  content  (0.33%),  the  NNP  (+  16.7  kgCaCO3/t)  and  the
NP/AP ratio (2.61) do not respect the corresponding Directive 019 criteria.
However, it should be noted that the Directive 019 criteria are based on the William Price report (1997) entitled Guidelines and
Recommended Methods for Prediction of Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage at Mine sites in British Columbia, Draft. BC
Ministry of Employment and Investment. According to the author, this document is obsolete.
In 2009, Mr. Price prepared an updated version of this report entitled “Prediction Manual for Drainage Chemistry from Sulphidic
Geologic  Materials”  (NEDEM  Report  1.20.1)  for  the  Canadian  Mining  Association,  Natural  Resources  Canada,  and  the
governments of British Columbia, Ontario and the Yukon.
Based on the literature available since 1997, Price (2009) concluded that sulfur content and NNP are useless to predict the ARD,
and only the NP/AP ratio must be used for this purpose. He proposed the following classification: rocks with NP/AP > 2 are not
potentially ARD; rocks with NP/AP < 1 are potentially ARD and rocks with 1 < NP/AP < 2 are in the uncertainty zone.
According to Price’s classification, only wacke + conglomerate waste type (< 2 % of waste tonnage) could be potentially ARD,
since the NP/AP ratio (1.75) is in the upper portion of the uncertainty zone.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
During  the  kinetic  tests  performed  over  52  weeks  on  two  (2)  composite  samples  of  wacke  and  one  (1)  composite  sample  of
amphibolite,  the  pH  of  the  leachates  remained  between  7.5  and  8.5.  The  URSTM  concluded  that  the  three  samples  were  not
potentially ARD-generating. It should be noted that one (1) composite sample of wacke showed a sulfur content of 0.88 %, which is
significantly higher than the average content of the 120 samples of wacke studied in the comprehensive characterization (0.33%).
Moreover, the pH measured in the leach pads remained between 7 and 8.
In conclusion, results from the kinetic tests (column and leach pads) confirm that waste from the wacke geological type are not
potentially ARD as predicted by the Price (2009) classification. All other waste is also non ARD-generating based on the Directive
019 classification.
 
20.5.1.4  Leaching Potential
 
Table 20.6 outlines the summary of results for all waste types and leaching tests (TCLP, SPLP and SFE). For all parameters and
waste types, leachate concentrations obtained with the TCLP test were lower than the criteria found in Appendix II, Table 1, of
Directive 019. All waste types are therefore not classified as "high risk".
According to Directive 019, a sample is classified as "low risk" if, for a given parameter, the content is lower than Criteria A of the
PPSRTC, or if the TCLP leachate shows concentrations lower than the Québec groundwater quality protection criteria. If the TCLP
leachate shows concentrations higher than the groundwater quality protection criteria, the sample is classified as "leachable".
The main results from the various tests and the main geological types are:
Cadillac Fault: the average concentration of aluminum for the TCLP test was 1.11 mg/L, exceeding the groundwater protection
criterion (0.75 mg/L). However, the average concentrations were lower than the criterion for the SPLP test (0.26 mg/L) and the SFE
test (0.64 mg/L). There are no criterion for aluminum in the PPSRTC.
The average concentrations of manganese for the TCLP test was 10.1 mg/L, exceeding the groundwater protection criterion (1.9
mg/L). However, the average concentrations were lower than the criterion for the SPLP test (0.014 mg/L) and the SFE test (< 0.005
mg/L). The average manganese content is higher than the Criteria A of the PPSRTC.

Finally,  arsenic  concentrations  in  leachates  for  the  TCLP  test  (0.07  mg/L),  the  SPLP  test  (0.23  mg/L)  and  the  SFE  test  (0.10
mg/L) are lower than the groundwater protection criterion (0.34 mg/L). However, these concentrations are higher than the Québec
drinking water criterion (0.01 mg/L). The average concentration for the SPLP test also exceeds the effluent discharge criterion of
Directive 019 (0.2 mg/L). The average content is higher than criteria C of the PPSRTC.
Amphibolite: the average arsenic concentrations in leachates for the TCLP test (0.85 mg/L), the SPLP test (0.79 mg/L) and the SFE
test (0.48 mg/L) are all higher than the groundwater protection criterion (0.34 mg/L), the Québec drinking water criterion and the
effluent discharge criterion of Directive 019. The average content is higher than Criteria C of the PPSRTC.

The average concentrations of nickel for the TCLP test were 0.69 mg/L, exceeding the groundwater protection criterion (0.22 mg/L).
However, the average concentrations were lower than the analytical method detection limit for the SPLP test (< 0.01 mg/l) and the
SFE test (< 0.005 mg/L). The average nickel content is higher than Criteria A of the PPSRTC.
The average concentrations of manganese for the TCLP test were 9.11 mg/L, exceeding the groundwater protection criterion (1.9
mg/L). However, the average concentrations were lower than the criterion for the SPLP test (0.007 mg/L) and the SFE test (< 0.005
mg/L). The average manganese content is higher than Criteria A of the PPSRTC.
Finally, the average concentrations of aluminum were lower than the groundwater protection criteria for the three (3) tests.
Wacke: the average concentrations of aluminum for the TCLP test (1.9 mg/L), the SPLP test (1.78 mg/L) and the SFE test (1.78
mg/L) exceed the groundwater protection criterion (0.75 mg/L). There is no criterion for aluminum in the PPSRTC.
The average concentrations of manganese for the TCLP test were 2.25 mg/L, exceeding the groundwater protection criterion (1.9
mg/L). However, the average concentrations were lower than the criterion for the SPLP test (0.003 mg/L) and the SFE test (0.003
mg/L). The average manganese content is higher than Criteria A of the PPSRTC.
The average concentrations of barium for the TCLP test were 0.49 mg/L, slightly exceeding the groundwater protection criterion
(0.47 mg/L). However, the average concentrations were lower than the criterion for the SPLP test (0.01 mg/L) and the SFE test
(0.01 mg/L). The average manganese content is lower than Criteria A of the PPSRTC.
Finally, the arsenic concentrations in leachates for the TCLP test (0.07 mg/L), the SPLP test (0.23 mg/L) and the SFE test (0.10
mg/L) are lower than the groundwater protection criterion (0.34 mg/L). However, these concentrations are higher than the Québec
drinking water criterion. The average concentration for the SPLP test also exceeds the effluent discharge criterion of Directive 019.
The average content is higher than Criteria C of the PPSRTC.

Natural Aluminum, Barium and Manganese Leachability: the kinetic tests are more representative of the natural site conditions than
the static tests (TCLP, SPLP and SFE). Static tests require fine grinding, low liquid/solid ratio and, in some cases (TCLP and
SPLP), the addition of acid. In fact, static tests usually overestimate the leaching potential of materials.
In this project, concentrations of aluminum, barium, nickel and manganese measured in the kinetic tests (columns and leach pads)
were always lower than the corresponding groundwater quality protection criterion. In this context, it can be concluded that these
metals are not likely to leach from any of the types of waste rock.
Real  Leachability  of  Arsenic:  arsenic  has  been  observed  in  relatively  high  concentrations  in  all  leaching  tests  performed  on
amphibolite and wacke + amphibolite samples. The column test performed on an amphibolite composite sample has also shown a
significant concentration of arsenic. The latter has also been observed in significant concentrations in leachates from the SPLP test
for the Cadillac fault samples. In this context, it is safe to state that amphibolites, wacke + amphibolites and Cadillac fault types of
waste could potentially leach arsenic.

This  first  waste  stockpile  would  show  an  average  sulfur  content  of  0.4%  for  an  AP  of  12.3  kgCaCO3/t  and  a  NP  of  158.2
kgCaCO3/t. The NNP and NP/AP ratio would be + 145.8 kgCaCO3/t and 12.8, respectively. This dump will clearly be non-ARD.
This  second  waste  dump  would  present  an  average  sulfur  content  of  0.33%.  The  NNP  and  NP/AP  ratio  would  be
+ 17.1 kgCaCO3/t and 2.65, respectively. This dump will clearly be non-ARD as per Price’s (2009) classification. The percentage
of sulfur, the NNP and the NP/AP ratio are also very close to the Directive 019 criteria.
20.5.2  Waste Rock Management
 
The waste rock found on the Joanna Property consists of: wacke, conglomerate, mafic intrusions, amphibolite and the Cadillac
fault.
According to the waste rock geochemical characterization results, the wacke, conglomerate and mafic intrusions are low-risk under
Directive 019, whereas the amphibolites and Cadillac fault are considered leachable for arsenic.
Waste rocks will therefore be stockpiled in separate piles. The mine plan includes waste rock segregation.
Low-risk waste rock (wacke, conglomerate and mafic intrusions) account for about 85-90% of all waste rocks. The area used for
stockpiling  this  rock  will  simply  be  cleared.  It  will  be  encircled  by  a  drainage  ditch  connected  to  two  polishing  ponds  to  settle
suspended solids. These ponds will drain into two different branches of the Stitchman Creek so as to maintain adequate water
levels in the stretches considered to be fish-bearing watercourses. The cost of constructing this stockpile is assessed at $0.37
million. Construction costs are detailed in Table 20.7.
Leachable waste rock (amphibolite and Cadillac fault) represent about 10-15% of all waste rocks. The area where this waste rock
is stockpiled will be protected with a geo-membrane to prevent groundwater contamination.
 
July 2012
20-55
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Once  the  area  is  cleared,  a  30-cm  thick  layer  of  draining  sand  will  be  placed  in  the  waste  rock  accumulation  areas.  A  geo-
membrane will then be installed and covered with another 30-cm layer of draining sand. A one (1)-metre layer of crushed waste
rock (0-150 mm) will then be installed to protect the geo-membrane.
The stockpile will be encircled by a geo-membrane-lined drainage ditch that is connected to a retention basin, from which the water
will be pumped into the process water basin either for recirculation to the concentrator or treatment before being released into the
environment. The cost of constructing this stockpile is assessed at $9.2 million. Construction costs are detailed in Table 20.8.

20.5.3  Low-Grade Ore Stockpile
A low-grade ore stockpile will be set up near the crusher. Since the ore is considered acidogenic and leachable under Directive
019,  the  low-grade  ore  stockpile  pad  will  be  similar  to  the  leachable  waste  rock  stockpile  one.  The  construction  cost  of  this
stockpile is assessed at $1.6 million. Construction costs are detailed in Table 20.8.
20.5.4  Topsoil and Overburden Stockpiles
 
The topsoil and overburden that is removed to allow for pit operations will be stockpiled in two (2) separate piles and used for site
restoration.
The areas used to stockpile these materials will be cleared and encircled by drainage ditches connected to polishing ponds to
settle suspended solids. The water in the ponds will flow by gravity to Stitchman Creek. The construction cost of the topsoil and
overburden stockpiles is assessed at $0.22 million and $0.38 million respectively. Construction costs are detailed in Table  20.8.
20.6 Site Geotechnical Assessment
20.6.1   Summary of Field Work
 
In 2007, a field campaign was conducted by Géolab. It consisted of 9 borings in the area of the Hosco pit. Since 2010, a total of 191
borings and 133 exploration pits were completed on the Property by Laboratoires d’Expertises de Québec Ltée. These different
probes allowed for a better understanding of both the soil distribution as well as the groundwater conditions. These probes and the
results from both field and laboratory tests have allowed the definition of potential geotechnical issues. Other field campaigns will
be required in order to get a clearer picture of the soil distribution, as well as certain geotechnical properties of the soil and rock.
20.6.2  Properties and Nature of Materials
 
The probes identified the presence of the following materials:
§  Surface organic soil (Lichen, peat, topsoil)
§  Cohesive soils (clay)
July 2012
20-58
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
§  Granular soils (silt, sand, and gravel)
§  Bedrock
The probes also indicated that the thickness of the different layers of soil varies from one area to another on the Property. In fact, in
some places, such as the northern part of the Property close to the Hydro-Québec power lines, the bedrock is flush with the surface.
In other places however, such as the area south of the West pit, the soil layer can attain approximately 30 meters in thickness.
Figure 20.4 shows the distribution of the different layers of soil encountered during the campaigns held in 2010 and 2011.

The cohesive soils generally have a medium to stiff consistency, except in the area of the Hosco pit, where they are rather soft to
very  soft,  especially  in  the  northwestern  sector  of  the  West  pit.  It  is  important  to  note  that  laboratory  tests  showed  that  these
cohesive soils are sensitive to disturbance.
As for the granular soils, they consist mainly of fine soils (silts). They generally have a loose to medium density. The bedrock
consists mainly of siltstone and greywacke. The quality of the rock is generally fair to good, based on the rock quality designation
values.
20.6.3  Groundwater
 
With respect to the groundwater level, the different readings made in the boreholes and exploration pits indicate that it is located at
the surface, or less than one meter below the surface.
20.6.4  Bearing Capacity
 
In general, the northern area, between the Stichman Creek and the Hydro-Québec power lines has an adequate bearing capacity
for  the  construction  of  buildings  with  superficial  foundations.  Nevertheless,  the  northwestern  extremity  is  preferable,  as  the
presence of rock close to the surface would allow for the heavy loads associated with the concentrator, crusher and other buildings
of sort. Figure 20.5 shows the different areas of the Property where these types of foundations are possible.

20.6.5  Pit Excavation
 
Preliminary analysis at the Hosco and West pits indicates that excavation slopes in the overburden should be within 1.0 vertically
for 4.0 horizontally (1.0V: 4.0H) and 1.0V: 5.5H depending on the location. Figure 20.6 shows the approximate position of these
preliminary slopes. A more specific analysis will be required to further specify the pit slopes.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The presence of the groundwater table and the sensitivity to disturbance of the clayey soils will need to be considered for the
excavation  of  the  pits.  Certain  field  tests  revealed  that  these  soils  have  a  tendency  to  be  liquid-like  after  their  excavation  and
transportation. This particularity complicates their excavation and storage on other parts of the Property.
Another particularity is the presence of the CN railway situated south of the West pit. The drawdown of the groundwater table
associated with the excavation of the pit might lead to ground settlement beneath the railway. Also, the pit excavation might require
some additional slope stability analysis. This point will need to be evaluated at the detailed engineering stage, including a dynamic
stability analysis of the soft soil in that area.
20.6.6  Waste and Overburden Dumps
 
Because of the changing nature and geotechnical properties of the soil beneath the footprint of the waste and overburden piles, the
construction of the dumps will be limited in height in some areas. Construction of the dumps in stages might also be required, as
well as some monitoring in order to ensure safety against bearing soil failure. This aspect is not problematic, but will limit the final
height of the dumps.
20.6.7  Neutral Tailings and POX Ponds
 
Two (2) potential sectors were considered for these ponds: the western sector of the Property for the flotation tailings pond, and the
sector directly to the north of the Hydro-Québec power lines for the POX pond. Some geotechnical borings have been done to
verify the compatibility of these sites. Additional geotechnical studies will be required at the detailed engineering stage in order to
complete the dike and pond conceptions.
20.7 Water Management Plan
20.7.1  Mine and Process Water
 
On the Site General Arrangement Plan (see Figure 20.7), all surface infrastructures are located as well as associated ditches (pink)
and pipelines (orange) which will be used to adequately manage water on the mine site. Tables 20.9 to 20.11 depict data on which
the following Water Management Plan is based.

Weather data from the Kinojevis River Station was used to estimate rain and snowfall in the area. The annual average rainfall is
estimated at 648 mm, while snowfall is 235 cm annually.  Total precipitation is therefore estimated annually at 883 mm on average.
Evapotranspiration rates were used considering land types (tailings, waste rock, open pit, etc.; Table 20.10). Those rates were
determined  following  numerical  simulations  performed  for  a  different  mine  project  located  in  a  region  with  similar  weather
conditions
The Project Area is mainly flat and globally badly-drained with several peatlands (bogs) occupying major parts of the Property. All
mine infrastructures are located within only one (1) sub-watershed, namely Stitchman Creek. In fact, the POX Tailings Management
Facility (POX-TMF) is located outside that area, but all waters coming from that facility will be managed in such a way that they will
be pumped to the Process Water Polishing Pond (PWPP) and then discharge with the final effluent within the Stitchman Sub-
Watershed. No water discharge is located outside the Stitchman Sub-Watershed. The POX-TMF effluent will be controlled and is
estimated at 91 m³/d. Owing to its characteristics, that effluent cannot be re-introduced in the flotation section of the mill. No effluent
will  be  directly  released  into  the  environment  from  the  POX-TMF  Pond  since  its  effluent  will  be  pumped  to  the  PWPP  prior  to
discharge with the final effluent.
Following Québec’s Directive 019 issued by the MDDEP (Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks), only one
final effluent is to be considered (at 0.15 m³/s). According to Directive 019, final effluent is defined as an effluent which needs no
further treatment before being discharged into the environment. Equipment will be implemented to measure pH and flow. Also, the
final effluent will be monitored as specified in Directive 019. The final effluent discharge criteria prescribed in Directive 019 consists
of  maximum  limit  values.  The  environmental  discharge  objectives  (EDO)  to  be  imposed  by  the  MDDEP  may  well  be  far  more
stringent than those specified under Directive 019 and the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER). The EDOs will be based on
water volumes discharged as well as water quality, the minimum annual flow, and usages of the receiving stream.
Based on the evaluation depicted in Table 20.9, the final effluent flow will be similar to the maximum flow measured during the
2010 low-flow period (July/August 2010) in the section of the Stitchman Creek where it is to be discharged, i.e. it is well within the
natural range of that creek. Additional hydrological samples are now being collected to adequately assess any potential impact on
the environment.

Three other water discharges were also considered:
§  Top Soil Pile: two (2) discharge points (two (2) basins), totalling 1,093 m³/d;
§  Overburden Pile: one (1) discharge point, at 3,075 m³/d;
§  Main Waste Rock Pile: two (2) discharge points (two (2) basins), totalling 2,769 m³/d.
These will help maintain sufficient water levels and flow within the upstream sections of Stitchman Creek so that fish habitats will
most  likely  not  be  impacted  by  the  proposed  Water  Management  Plan,  i.e.  they  will  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  proposed
infrastructures on local natural drainage.
On the other hand, it is planned to collect water running off the As-Ni Waste Rock Pile, the Ore Stockpile and the Mill Area by
pumping it from a collecting basin towards the Process Water Pond (using pipelines).
Mine water will also be pumped to the Process Water Pond. Mathematical modelling of the successive mine operation phases was
performed  to  estimate  the  daily  flow  rate  required  to  keep  the  pit  dry.  Based  on  the  hydrogeological  study  performed  by
TechnoRem (2010), due to low hydraulic conductivity, the pit cannot be kept dry with dewatering wells. Therefore, infiltration and
precipitation water will be accumulated in a catch basin at the bottom of the pit and then pumped to the Process Water Pond. The
modelling indicated that an average rate varying from 2,500 m³/d to 8,100 m³/d should be maintained for operation of the mine, as
the pit excavation will advance. The latter rate was considered for this Water Management Plan.
Water from the Flotation Tailings Pond will be recirculated to the mill. Make-up water required at the mill is estimated at 83 m³/h
(1,992 m³/d). In order to guarantee this input during the first years of mill operation, the first construction phase will include the
implementation  of  the  Process  Water  Pond  (350,000  m³),  i.e.  prior  to  production  at  the  mine  so  that  enough  water  can  be
accumulated for use as process water.

All water accumulated in the Process Water Pond that will not have been recirculated to the mill will be discharged with the final
effluent following treatment.
 
20.7.1.1  Treatment Units
 
Two (2) water treatment units will be implemented – one at the end of the POX-TMF and another at the end of the Process Water
Pond – to ensure their effluent complies with all applicable criteria/guidelines. The following information was considered:
§  Volume:
-  2,400 m³/d at 3.0 mg As/L for the POX-TMF;
-  3,000 m³/d at 0.5 mg As/L for the Process Water Pond.
-  Objectives : 0.1 mg As/L;
§  Assumptions :
-  Total Suspended Solids (TSS) content is unknown (might influence type of treatment, assays, etc.);
-  Water quality analyses and assays will help refine the proposed treatment;
-  The proposed treatment is similar to what has been proposed by ASDR Environment in one (1) other project (similar flow and As
content).
The following treatment unit was considered:
§  Treatment Line
-  Water flows from the POX-TMF treatment unit to the adjacent 5,000 m³ basin;
-  5,000 m³ basin (POX Polishing Pond) with a 2-days retention time;
-  Water pumped from the POX-TMF Polishing Pond to the PWPP;
-  Water flows from the Process Water Pond treatment unit to the PWPP;
-  Gravity flowing (ditch) from the PWPP to the Stitchman Creek.
§  Treatment Unit:
-  Ferrous sulphate (12%): up to 96 L/h (ref. ASDR);
-  Polymers: up to 22,5 L/h (ref. ASDR);
-  POX-TMF:
Ò  Mixing is done along a pipeline; water is then pumped to geotubes which act as filters. The supernatant, which complies with
applicable criteria/guidelines, then flows towards the 5,000 m³ basin. Geotubes are periodically cleaned and replaced.

The Mining  Act  (RSQ,  c.  M-13.1)  is  another  important  piece  of  provincial  legislation  concerning  the  management  of  mining
activities in the Province of Québec. “The object of this Act is to promote prospecting, mineral exploration, and development and
operation of underground reservoirs, taking into account other possible uses of the land in the territory” (s.17).
Section  232.1  of  the  Act  states  that  “Land  rehabilitation  and  restoration  work  must  be  carried  out,  in  accordance  with  the  plan
approved by the Minister. The obligation shall subsist until the work is completed or until a certificate is issued by the Minister
under Section 232.10.”
The land rehabilitation and restoration work to be conducted must be planned and approved by the MRNF (Ministry of Natural
Resources  and  Wildlife).  According  to  Section  232.2  of  the  Act,  “Every  person  to  whom  Section  232.1  applies  must  submit  a
rehabilitation and restoration plan to the Minister for approval before commencing mining activities.”
Hence, as part of the project, a rehabilitation plan will have to be prepared (and approved by the MRNF). The rehabilitation and
restoration plan should be elaborated in accordance with the provincial Guidelines for Preparing a Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan
and  General  Mining  Site  Rehabilitation  Requirements  (MRNF  and  MDDEP,  1997)  which  provide  the  proponents  with  the
rehabilitation  requirements.  The  financial  feasibility  of  the  project  will  have  to  account  for  the  cost  of  all  work  required  for  the
rehabilitation of the mining site.
Moreover,  Bill  14  “An  Act  respecting  the  Development  of  Mineral  Resources  in  keeping  with  the  Principles  of  Sustainable
Development”  will  increase  the  financial  guarantee  from  70%  to  100%  of  projected  costs  for  the  work  required  under  the
rehabilitation  and  restoration  plan.  According  to  this  Bill,  the  guarantee  must  be  paid  in  three  (3)  annual  instalments.  The  first
instalment  corresponds  to  50%  of  the  total  amount  of  the  guarantee  and  must  be  paid  within  90  days  following  receipt  of  the
approval of the plan. The second and third instalments each represent 25% of the guarantee.

20.8.1  General Principles
 
The main objective of mine site rehabilitation is to restore the site to a satisfactory condition by:
 
a)   Eliminating unacceptable health hazards and ensuring public safety;
b)  Limiting the production and circulation of substances that could damage the receiving environment and, in the long-term, trying
to eliminate maintenance and monitoring;
c)   Restoring the site to a condition in which it is visually acceptable to the community;
d)   Reclaiming the areas where infrastructures are located (excluding the accumulation areas) for future use.
Specific objectives are to:
 
e)
Restore degraded environmental resources and land uses;
f)  Protect  important  ecosystems  and  habitats  with  rare  and  endangered  flora  and  fauna,  which  favours  the  re-establishment  of
biodiversity;
 
g)
Prevent or minimize future environmental damage;
 
Enhance the quality of specific environmental resources;
h)
i)   Improve the capacity of eligible organizations to protect, restore and enhance the environment; and
j)   Undertake resource recovery and waste avoidance projects, and prevent and/or reduce pollution.
The general guidelines of a rehabilitation plan include:
 
a)   Favouring progressive restoration to allow for rapid re-establishment of biodiversity;
b)
c)
d)
Implementing a monitoring and surveillance program;
Maximizing recovery of previous land uses;
Establishing new land uses;
e)   Promoting habitat rehabilitation using operational environmental criteria;
f)
Ensuring sustainability of restoration efforts.
The  mine  site  rehabilitation  plan  focuses  on  land  reclamation,  reclamation  of  the  tailings  area  and  water  basins,  and  surface
drainage  patterns  to  prevent  erosion.  The  successful  completion  of  a  rehabilitation  plan  will  ensure  that  the  project  incurs  a
minimum of disturbance. Site inspections will be carried out before the Property is returned to the Government.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
The rehabilitation concept for the current project is described below and complies with the requirements set out in the Guidelines
for Preparing a Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan and General Mining Site Rehabilitation Requirements and current legislation.
20.8.2  Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan Concept
 
Progressive Rehabilitation and Restoration
 
Progressive restoration is always favoured in order to rapidly achieve the objectives of the rehabilitation program, promote early
habitat re-establishment and increase biodiversity.
 
Progressive restoration will be possible as waste rock piles (or sectors in it) reach their maximum capacity. The same applies to the
overburden and topsoil piles, provided the materials can be used.
Final Rehabilitation and Restoration
 
The final rehabilitation and restoration plan concept is summarized as follows:
Tailings Accumulation Cells and Waste Rock Piles
 
a)  Exposed surfaces of the accumulation areas (tailings accumulation cells, waste rock and overburden piles) will be covered with
a layer of topsoil/overburden and re-vegetated.
b)  Flotation  Tailings  Management  Facility  and  the  accumulation  areas  will  be  covered  with  a  layer  of  topsoil/overburden  and
seeded so that vegetation will cover and stabilize the surfaces and prevent erosion.
c)  Given that tailings from the POX process are considered high risk under Directive 019, rehabilitation should help eliminate the
oxidation and arsenic release process. The POX Tailings Management Facility will therefore be covered with two (2) synthetic,
watertight membranes (or a 1.2-m layer of clay and one (1) synthetic, watertight membrane) plus a 60 cm layer of draining sand.
The entire area will be covered with 15 cm of overburden and then re-vegetated.
d)  Waste  rock  accumulation  areas  will  be  contoured  to  flatten  them  out  and  to  further  stabilize  them  against  erosion,  hence
promoting re-vegetation, that is, by creating berms and a gentler slope than the natural slope on a rock pile, in compliance with
MRNF safety criteria. The surface of the dump will remain unchanged. No rock pile stability work will therefore be required. The
restoration will involve covering the waste rock pile with a layer of about 40 cm of overburden as a substratum for re-vegetation,
seeding plant species and self-sustaining nutrients. The restoration plan should be discussed with all the stakeholders and
approved  by  MDDEP.  Given  the  proximity  of  the  airport  and  runway  position,  NAVCAN  will  be  consulted  regarding  the
rehabilitation principles, especially concerning height and types of vegetation.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
e)  The leachable waste rock pile may leach arsenic. The pile will be covered with a layer of clay 1.2 m thick (monolayer system) to
halt the oxidation process, and will then be re-vegetated.
f)  Water  in  the  ponds  will  be  treated  before  being  released  into  the  environment.  The  sludge  from  the  various  ponds  will  be
recovered and disposed of in the POX Tailings Management Facility. The ponds will be filled in and re-vegetated.
g)
Industrial wastewater treatment unit will be dismantled.
Haul Roads
 
A one (1) metre layer of material will be removed from the haul roads and disposed of on the leachable waste rock pile. The surface
will be scarified and re-vegetated.
Industrial Complex and Buildings
 
a)  No  building  will  be  left  in  place.  Whenever  possible,  buildings  will  be  sold  with  the  equipment  they  contain,  completely  or
partially. During the dismantling process, beneficiation/recycling of construction material will be maximized. Remaining waste
will be disposed of in an appropriate site. Owing to high arsenic levels, materials that may be contaminated with arsenic will first
be tested and, if applicable, decontaminated or disposed of at an authorized site or, if permitted, placed in the POX tailings
pond.
All equipment and machinery will be sold or recycled off-site.
b)  
 
c)   Explosives magazine and related facilities will be dismantled.
 
d)  The drinking water supply and domestic wastewater treatment facilities will either be transferred to a competent administrative
authority or dismantled.
e)   Infrastructure relating to the supply and distribution of electricity will be dismantled if of no use to other parties.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
All  underground  services  (power  lines,  pipelines,  water  and  sewer  pipes,  etc.)  shall  remain  in  place  since  they  are  unlikely  to
cause any environmental damage. Openings and access to such pipelines, however, shall be sealed.
Open Pit
 
Surface exploitation of materials is common in Québec. Many open pits created to extract materials or ore are therefore found
throughout  the  province.  Unlike  quarries  that  are  essentially  developed  on  rock  outcrops,  ore  deposits  are  located  below  the
surface of the soil, which means that pits are filled with groundwater. In many open pit mines, water rises up to the overburden; this
is particularly true when there is a thick layer of overburden, as in the area of the Joanna pit.
Once mining activities cease, the pit will gradually fill up to its equilibrium level with rainfall and groundwater. The pit overburden
slope around the pit will have been set out safely from the beginning in order to avoid any risk to workers. No special work in this
regard will be required upon cessation of mining activities.
To permanently close the pit access roads, two (2)-meter high embankments will be built along with an equivalent crest line using
blocks of waste rocks. A ditch two (2) metres wide and one (1) metre deep will be excavated in front of the embankment.
Discussions should be undertaken as required with the relevant authorities, environmental groups and research centers who could
take part in developing the final pit restoration plan...
Environmental Aspects
 
Drainage
 
§  Whenever  possible,  a  surface  water  drainage  pattern  will  be  re-established  to  conditions  similar  to  the  original  hydrological
system.
Topsoil Management
 
§  During site construction and ore body stripping, overburden and topsoil will be salvaged separately and used for re-vegetation
purposes. Slopes of the overburden storage area and flat surfaces will be seeded and re-vegetated.
Waste Management
 
July 2012
NI 43-101 Technical Report
20-76
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
§  Demolition waste will be:
-  Decontaminated when required;
-  Recycled when cost-effective;
-  Buried in an appropriate site.
-  All non-contaminated waste will be sent to an appropriate site.
Hazardous Materials
 
§  Facilities containing petroleum products, chemicals, solid waste, hazardous waste, and/or contaminated soil or materials will be
dismantled and managed according to regulatory requirements.
§  All hazardous waste will be managed according to existing laws and regulations and will be transported off-site.
Characterization Study
 
T h e Land  Protection  and  Rehabilitation  Regulation,  which  came  into  force  on  March  27,  2003,  applies  several  provisions
concerning land protection in the new Section IV.2.1 of the Environmental Quality Act. The term land also includes groundwater
and  surface  waters.  The  Regulation  sets  limit  values  for  a  range  of  contaminants,  and  specifies  the  categories  of  targeted
commercial or industrial activities. The mining industry is one of the categories governed by the Regulation.
For  the  mining  industry,  this  generally  entails  undertaking  a  site  characterization  study  within  six  (6)  months  following  the
termination  of  mine  operations.  In  cases  where  contamination  exceeding  the  criteria  set  in  the  Regulation  is  observed,  a
rehabilitation  plan  specifying  the  environmental  protection  measures  to  be  undertaken  must  be  submitted  to  the  MDDEP  for
approval.
Waste rocks and mine tailings are not soils and are not covered by the Regulation. The characterization study will address the
areas that are likely to have been contaminated by human activities, specifically the handling of petroleum products.
Schedule and Costs
 
Final restoration of the mine site will be completed within three (3) years of the end of commercial production.

20.8.3  Monitoring Program and Post-Closure Monitoring
 
20.8.3.1  Physical Stability
 
The physical stability of the tailings dams and the waste rock piles will be assessed, and signs of erosion will be noted. This
surveillance will be conducted on an annual basis for a minimum of five (5) years following closure of the mine.
 
20.8.3.2  Environmental Monitoring
 
Geotechnical and hydrogeological monitoring of tailings ponds and overburden piles will be carried out for a five (5)-year period.
Monitoring of water quality (surface and groundwater) will continue for five (5) years after completion of the restoration work. This
monitoring period will be 20 years for the POX Tailings Management Facility.
 
20.8.3.3  Agronomic Monitoring
 
The  agronomic  monitoring  program  is  designed  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  re-vegetation  done  as  part  of  mining
rehabilitation efforts.
To  document  the  success  of  the  re-vegetation  efforts  over  the  accumulation  areas,  agricultural  monitoring  will  be  undertaken
following the establishment of a vegetative cover on the areas subject to the progressive restoration program. Monitoring will be
conducted annually for three (3) years following the implementation of vegetation.
Once the mine site closes, the restoration plan will be implemented and the vast majority of the site will be re-vegetated.
Re-vegetation success will be monitored for five (5) years. Re-seeding will be carried out, as required, in areas where re-vegetation
is deemed unsatisfactory.

20.9 Community and First Nations Relations
 
In  2008,  Aurizon  updated  the  company’s  mission  to  focus  on  global  development  and  set  out  12  guiding  principles  aiming  to
consolidate economic, environmental and social considerations.
Since a positive pre-feasibility study was obtained in November 2009, in participation with Joanna’s stakeholders, Aurizon has
engaged  in  an  ongoing  information,  consultation  and  feedback  approach.  Continuous  information  activities  were  undertaken
involving local population, regional stakeholders and governmental agencies using fact sheets distribution, presentations, plenary
sessions and public open houses. Interests and concerns were addressed during specific meetings, in thematic workshops and
through existing land users’ committees. Alist of stakeholders is presented in Table 20.13.
Joanna’s  project  lies  within  the  Algonquin  Nation  territory.  In  an  effort  to  build  and  uphold  a  long-term  relationship  with  the
Anishinabeg, Aurizon appointed an Algonquin Community Facilitator/Consultant. The primary objective is to enable members of
Pikogan, Lac Simon, Timiskaming and Long Point First Nations to voice their opinions and concerns trough public presentations
and ongoing community-based relational committees.

21  CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
The Joanna Gold Project scope covered in this Feasibility Study (FS) is based on the construction of a greenfield facility having a
nominal ore processing capacity of 8,500 t/d. The Capital and Operating Cost estimates related to the mine, concentrator, and the
site infrastructure, have been developed by BBA. Costs related to environmental and tailings management and site Closure Plan
have  been  developed  by  Roche.  BBA  consolidated  cost  information  from  all  sources.  Table  21.1  presents  a  summary  of  total
estimated initial and sustaining capital costs for the Project. All Cost estimates are expressed in constant April 2012 Canadian
Dollars, with an exchange rate at par with the US dollar.

21.1 Basis of Estimate and Assumptions
 
The Capital Cost Estimate pertaining to the processing areas and Joanna site infrastructure within the BBA scope was performed
by a professional estimator in BBA’s estimation team. Capital costs for the mine were estimated by BBA’s mining group. Capital
costs for the tailings ponds, environmental management, waste rock disposition areas and site rehabilitation and closure costs
were developed by Roche.
21.1.1  Type and Class of Estimate
 
The Cost Estimate Classification System as defined by BBA, maps the phases and stages of asset cost estimating following these
guidelines:
§  Provides  a  common  basis  of  the  concepts  involved  with  classifying  project  cost  estimates,  regardless  of  the  type  of  facility,
process or industry the estimates relate to;
§  Fully defines and correlates the major characteristics used in classifying cost estimates so that companies may unambiguously
determine how their practices compare to the guidelines;
§  Uses a measured degree of project definition and degree of engineering completion as the primary characteristic to categorize
estimate classes; and;
§  Reflects generally accepted practices in the cost engineering profession.

21.1.2  Dates, Currency and Exchange Rates
 
This Capital Cost Estimate is expressed and presented in constant April 2012 Canadian Dollars (CAD$). The exchange rate was
assumed at par; $1 CAD = $1 US.
21.1.3  Construction Labour Rates and Labour Productivity Factors
 
For the purpose of defining the “Work Week”, all estimated costs for labour are based on ten (10) hours per day, through five (5)
days per week, plus two and a half (2.5) hours per week considered as occasional overtime, for a total of fifty-two and a half (52.5)
hours  per  week.  There  is  no  allowance  for  an  accelerated  construction  scheme  (night  shift,  or  week  end  work).  The  present
estimate is structured and based on the philosophy that contracts will be awarded to reputable contractors on a lump-sum basis,
within a normal construction labour availability.
The hourly Crew Rates used in the present estimate have been derived from Quebec construction collective agreements dated
April 29, 2012. Crew Rates include a mix of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour for each trade, as well as the fringe benefits
on top of the gross wages. The supervision by the foremen and surveyors is built into the direct costs. The indirect costs consist of
items such as small tools, consumables, supervision by the general foremen, management team, contractors on site temporary
construction  facilities,  mobilization  /  demobilization,  contractor’s  overhead  and  profit.  They  also  include  the  cost  related  to  the
transportation  of  the  employees  to  and  from  their  residence  to  the  construction  site,  as  well  as  room  and  board  (if  required,
applicable at 35% of the work force) for the duration of the construction activities. The Construction Equipment rates are based on
the tariff proposed by “La Direction Générale des Acquisitions du Centre de Services Partagés du Québec”, as per edition dated
April 1, 2012 and by the “Ontario Provincial Standard Specifications (OPSS)” schedule of rental rates for construction equipment.
The cost of fuel (diesel) associated to the construction equipment in the present estimate is estimated at 1 $/litre and considers
reimbursements of certain taxes.
A specific Crew Rate was developed for activities related to the construction and installation of equipment within the POX area for
hours estimated by Sherritt, based on their experience. This rate insured that there was no duplication of cost components already
incorporated within Sherritt’s estimate.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Construction Project Performance is an important concern for project owners, constructors, and cost management professionals.
Project cost and schedule performance depend largely on the quality of project planning, work area readiness, preparation and the
resulting productivity of the work process made possible in project execution. Labour productivity is often the greatest risk factor
and source of cost and schedule uncertainty to owners and contractors alike.
Many terms are used to describe productivity in the construction industry: performance factor, production rate, unit person-hour rate
and others. Traditionally, productivity has been defined as the ratio of input / output, i.e., the ratio of the input of an associated
resource (usually expressed in person-hour) to real output (in creating economic value). To restate this definition for use in the
construction industry: labour productivity is the physical progress achieved per person-hour, e.g., person-hours per linear meter of
conduit laid or person-hours per cubic meter of concrete poured. The two most important measures of labour productivity are:
§  the effectiveness with which labour is used in the construction process;
§  the relative efficiency of labour, doing what it is required, at a given time and place.
Labour productivity factors have been developed for each discipline and applied as a productivity loss factor to the base man-hours
developed for each discipline.
21.1.4  General Direct Capital Costs
 
This Capital Cost Estimate is based on the construction of a greenfield facility having a nominal capacity to process 8,500 t/d of
ore. The design of the crusher area, the crushed ore silo area and the concentrator area has been developed by BBA and has
largely been based on BBA’s experience on other projects. General Arrangement drawings developed in this Study have been
used to estimate quantities and generate MTO’s for all commodities. Equipment costs have been estimated using vendor prices
based on budget proposals for major process equipment and some mechanical equipment packages. Labour rates have been
estimated  as  described  previously  in  this  section.  Related  infrastructure  has  been  estimated  by  BBA  based  on  the  site  plan
developed.  The  Capital  Cost  Estimate  for  areas  requiring  special  environmental  considerations  (waste  stockpiles  and  tailings
ponds) have been developed by Roche.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
BBA has developed this Capital Cost Estimate based on the following assumptions and estimation methodology:
§  Mining equipment quantities and costs have been developed by BBA’s mining group based on the mine plan developed in this
Study. Equipment costs were estimated from vendor budget proposals and from BBA’s recently updated database of vendor
pricing.
§  Pre-stripping costs including overburden and waste rock removal, incurred in the pre-production period, have been capitalized.
This Capital Cost Estimate is based on pre-stripping tonnage as defined in the mine plan and includes costs associated with the
mining and hauling of overburden, waste rock and ore. It is assumed that overburden removal will be contracted out.
§  The mining equipment fleet is based on 100 t capacity haul trucks. This size truck allows for undertaking major overhauls in a
local  vendor  maintenance  facility,  which  greatly  reduces  on-site  requirements  for  the  mining  equipment  maintenance  facility.
Therefore, based on this, the garage facilities consist of a mega-dome type enclosure for performing regular maintenance of the
mining equipment. An allowance of six (6) million dollars is projected for the installation related to servicing mining equipment.
This amount was agreed to be between Aurizon and BBA representatives.
§  Mining roads were estimated by BBA’s mining department, based on using waste rock from the pre-stripping operation and an
assumed unit cost from an outside contractor to crush and screen rock for the application.
§  Tasks dedicated to tree clearing including royalties were estimated by Technominex Services. First class excavation represents
122,300 m3, while second class is estimated at 118,000 m3. Backfilling materials are evaluated around 320,000 m3 and it was
assumed that all backfill constituents will be available from gravel pits, esker or other sources located within a radius of 5 km.
§  The capital cost for the crusher, crushed ore silo and concentrator areas were estimated based on engineering quantities and
MTO’s developed by the various disciplines. Major process equipment was sized by BBA and budget prices were obtained from
vendors or from recently updated BBA database.

§  Other mechanical and related equipment quantities and sizes were developed by BBA engineering. Major equipment packages
were developed and budget prices were obtained from vendors.
§  Site  electrical  includes  all  infrastructure  to  connect  to  the  local  power  grid,  to  build  a  new  main  substation  and  to  distribute
electrical power to the main site areas. Costs of major electrical components identified on the single line diagram were estimated
using BBA’s electrical engineering group based on recent vendor prices.
§  Unit costs for commodities such as concrete, structural steel, metal works and architectural finishes were estimated from local
suppliers and BBA’s internal database. Concrete quantities are estimated at 16,800 m3, and structural steel elements represent
3,100 MT.
§  Sherritt  Technologies  developed  the  flowsheet  and  major  equipment  list  for  the  POX  area  and  provided  the  Capital  Cost
Estimate for this area. BBA consolidated the cost estimate within its cost estimate and made sure that construction Crew Rates
were adjusted as required to avoid gaps and duplications. The total direct cost estimate associated with the Sherritt POX area is
in the order of $28.7M.
§  The Capital Cost Estimate for Environmental and Tailings Management were developed by Roche. Quantities and unit costs for
each  of  the  areas  (waste  stockpiles,  tailings  ponds,  processing  areas,  etc.)  were  developed  based  on  prices  obtained  from
vendors and from experience on other similar projects.
§  The cost estimate for Site Rehabilitation and Mine Closure were developed by Roche. Quantities and unit costs for each of the
areas (waste stockpiles, tailings ponds, processing areas, etc.) were developed based on prices obtained from vendors and from
experience  on  other  similar  projects.  These  costs  cover  only  items  related  to  environmental  closure  of  waste  stockpiles  and
tailings  ponds.  They  do  not  include  costs  for  dismantling  infrastructure  which  are  assumed  by  BBA  to  be  neutral  when
considering salvage value of equipment and structures.

21.1.5  Indirect Costs
 
Indirect Costs for areas under BBA’s responsibility for capital cost estimation were factored by BBA based on experience on other
projects as described below. It is important to note that these factors were estimated based on the assumption that Aurizon Mines
will execute the project using an internal PCM (Procurement and Construction Management) team rather than contracting a major
PCM firm. Total indirect costs amount to 20% of direct costs.
§  Owner’s costs are estimated as a percentage of total direct costs. For this Study, BBA used 4%. Owner’s costs include items
such  as  Owner’s  team  salaries  and  expenses,  insurance,  authorization  certificates  and  permits,  geotechnical  and  surveying
costs, laboratory testwork, etc.;
§  Engineering  services  including  procurement,  commissioning,  and  training  activities  performed  by  Sherritt  Technologies,  are
estimated at ± 8.25% of direct costs;
 
§  Temporary construction facilities were estimated as 2.5% of direct costs;
§  Operations of temporary construction facilities are capitalized and were estimated at 1.25% of direct costs;
§  Cost of sub-consultants and other third parties were estimated at 0.3% of direct costs;
§  Costs for pre-operational acceptance of mechanical equipment were estimated at 0.2% of direct costs;
§  Costs for plant mobile equipment used during construction were estimated at 0.15% of direct costs;
§  Other indirect costs and add-ons were estimated at 0.5% of direct costs;
§  Costs for spare parts, freight, vendor’s reps and other such items were estimated at 8.5% of equipment value;
§  For the estimates provided by Roche, indirect costs were included within the direct costs.
21.1.6  Contingency
 
Contingency provides an allowance to the Capital Cost Estimate for undeveloped details within the Scope of Work covered by the
estimate. Contingency is not intended to take into account items such as labour disruptions, weather related impediments, changes
in the scope of the Project from what is defined in the Study, nor does contingency take into account price escalation or currency
fluctuations.  A  contingency  of  10%  of  the  sum  of  direct  and  indirect  costs  has  been  attributed  to  the  Capital  Cost  Estimate
developed  in  this  Study  for  areas  estimated  by  BBA.  A  contingency  of  20%  has  been  attributed  to  the  Capital  Cost  Estimate
developed  by  Roche  for  the  Environmental  and  Tailings  Management  areas  under  their  responsibility.  No  contingency  was
included in the cost estimate for rehabilitation and mine closure developed by Roche.

21.2 Estimated Capital Costs
 
The initial capital cost for the Project is estimated to be in the order of $422.2M. In addition, an initial amount in the order of $20.3M
needs to be allocated as sustaining capital, as required by Provincial regulations, for restoration and site rehabilitation. Sustaining
capital requirements to support operations over the LOM have been estimated to be in the order of $70.2M. This excludes a further
amount estimated at $6.8M required to be put in escrow for site rehabilitation, subsequent to the initial payment mentioned earlier.
These costs are used as the basis for the financial analysis of the Project.
21.2.1  Mining Capital Costs
 
The Capital Cost Estimate pertaining to the mining operation, as developed by BBA, includes costs for mining equipment, pre-
stripping costs that have been capitalized, and costs related to the construction of mine roads. Total initial capital cost for the mine
is estimated at $39.0M. Sustaining capital required to support the mine plan and ongoing operations is estimated to be in the order
of $24.7M.
Costs for the construction of the initial mine roads, estimated at $1.5M, were developed based on using waste rock from the pre-
stripping  operation  that  would  be  crushed  and  screened  by  a  contractor.  Costs  for  clearing  have  been  estimated  based  on  a
proposal from a contractor. Costs for removal of overburden during the pre-production period were assumed at $2.50/t based on
past experience. Pre-stripping costs were estimated using the mining operating cost model and were capitalized. The total initial
capital cost associated with clearing, overburden removal, and pre-stripping, is in the order of $21.8 M. Costs for mining equipment
were developed from vendor budget proposals. Initial costs for mining equipment were estimated at $15.8M. Sustaining capital for
additions to the fleet as well as for replacement of certain equipment over the LOM was estimated at $24.4M.
21.2.2  Processing Plant and Site Infrastructure Capital Costs
 
The estimated capital cost for the various processing areas and major site infrastructure is in the order of $301.6M. Included in site
infrastructure are the following major items:
 
July 2012
21-10
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
§  Mine garage and mine equipment maintenance facility;
§  Employee facilities;
§  Site access road;
§  Main electric substation;
§  Civil works including all site pipe works;
§  Communications and telecom system;
§  Domestic sewage treatment system.
For the processing plant and major site infrastructure, sustaining capital was estimated to be in the order of $1M and is mainly
associated with costs for adding pumping capacity for pit dewatering.
21.2.3  Environmental and Tailings Management Capital Costs
 
The capital cost for Environmental and the Tailings Management Facility was developed by Roche. The total initial capital cost
was estimated to be in the order of $81.5M. Sustaining capital estimated to be in the order of $44.6M is required in Years 4 and 8 of
the mine life, mainly to increase the capacity of the flotation tailings pond disposal area.
21.2.4  Rehabilitation and Mine Closure Capital Costs
 
The cost for site rehabilitation and mine closure was developed by Roche. These costs are mainly related to the permanent closure
of tailings ponds and stockpiles. They do not include costs for dismantling of the processing plant and site infrastructure.
Proposed regulatory guidelines require that Financial Assurance be posted up front as part of the Rehabilitation and Closure Plan.
For the purpose of this Study, it was assumed that $20.3M will be escrowed by Aurizon in the pre-production year and $ 6.8M in the
first year of operation. This cost is considered a sustaining capital cost and is treated as such in the Financial Analysis.
21.3 Operating Costs
 
The average operating cost over the life of the mine has been estimated at $25.32/t of ore milled or $716/oz of gold produced. This
excludes transport and refining of gold produced at Joanna as well as contractual royalties to be paid by Aurizon.
 
July 2012
21-11
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
Mining operating costs vary from year to year based on the mine plan. Mining pre-stripping costs incurred in the pre-production year
(PP)  have  been  estimated  using  the  mining  operating  cost  model  but  have  been  capitalized,  and  therefore  are  excluded  from
operating costs.
These costs were based on 41.1 Mt of ore milled and 1,453,510 oz of gold produced over the LOM.
21.3.1  Mining Operating Costs
 
The average mining operating cost is estimated at $2.23/t mined (including overburden), $11.92/t of ore milled or $337/oz of gold
produced. The major cost elements consist of equipment operating costs (which include cost of fuel and cost of maintenance for
owned  equipment  as  well  as  costs  for  equipment  rental  for  equipment  which  is  required  occasionally),  blasting,  labour  and
overburden removal (assumed contracted out). The relative percentage of each of these mining operating cost items (over the life of
mine), are also indicated in Figure 21.1

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The major mining OPEX cost components are as follows:
EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE
 
Equipment maintenance costs have been estimated by BBA based on experience, historic data on similar projects and vendor
information. Maintenance costs include the costs of repairs, spare parts, consumables, etc., and are compiled on a maintenance
cost per hour of operation basis for each equipment type. It should be noted that equipment maintenance costs exclude the cost of
maintenance personnel, which are accounted for in mining labour costs.
EQUIPMENT FUEL
Diesel fuel is used to operate all mining equipment. Fuel consumption was estimated for each year of operation based on vendor
equipment specifications and equipment utilization on a dollar per operating hour basis. The price of diesel fuel was estimated at
$0.90, which includes rebates of certain taxes. Fuel is readily available from local suppliers in the Rouyn area.
BLASTING
 
Blasting costs for ore and waste rock have been estimated based on parameters and powder factors presented in Section 16 of this
Report. Blasting unit costs were estimated at $0.228/t for ore and $0.184/t for waste rock based on a budget price obtained for bulk
emulsion. Blasting costs also include fuel for mixing, detonators, boosters and connectors.
LABOUR
 
Labour requirements and ensuing costs have been determined on an annual basis to support the mine plan developed in this
Study. Labour rates have been estimated from data supplied by Aurizon Human Resources Department based on local labour
conditions. Labour headcounts have been estimated as previously presented in Section 16 of this Report.
OTHER
 
Other OPEX items are as follows:
 
July 2012
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
21-13
§  Costs for additional handling of ore stockpiled when reclaimed were estimated at $0.81/t;
§  Cost for removal of overburden by contractor was estimated at $2.50/t;
§  An allowance was taken for costs related to mine dewatering. An annual cost of $250,000 was assumed;
§  Concentrator, Processing and Infrastructure Operating Costs.
The  annual  and  unit  operating  costs  for  processing  of  the  Joanna  ore  were  derived  from  nominal  operating  conditions.  The
estimated processing cost is in the order of $12.37/t of ore milled and includes costs related to site infrastructure. Averaged over the
LOM,  this  represents  a  cost  of  $349.73/oz  of  gold  produced.  This  includes  all  processing  from  crushing  to  the  production  of
unrefined gold bars inclusively, as well as the costs of labour and maintenance of equipment. Figure 21.2 presents a breakdown of
the operating cost estimate by cost category.
Figure 21.2: Joanna Concentrator Operating Cost By Category
REAGENTS
 
The cost of reagents is estimated to be in the order of $4.38/t of ore milled. Almost 60% of reagents (which include limestone, lime
and oxygen) are associated with the POX area. The consumption of reagents in the various process areas was estimated based on
test  work  results,  and  unit  costs  of  reagents  were  based  on  vendor  budgetary  quotations  and  from  Aurizon’s  Casa  Berardi
operation.

ELECTRICITY
 
Electric power consumption was estimated by BBA and a load list was developed for the Joanna site previously presented in
Section 18 of this Report. The power consumption for the grinding mills, which represents approximately 40% of the total site power
consumption, was estimated based on ore grindability data and grinding circuit modelling. The power consumption for the oxygen
plant was estimated based on oxygen requirements by a vendor which provided technical and commercial information within a
budget proposal. The power consumption for the remainder of the concentrator and for site infrastructure was estimated by BBA
based  on  the  mechanical  equipment  selection  and  sizing.  The  total  annual  power  consumption  for  the  concentrator  and  site
infrastructure is estimated to be 168.2 GWh at a demand of 23.5 MW.
LINERS AND GRINDING MEDIA
 
Liner and grinding media consumptions were estimated by BBA based on the ore’s abrasion index adjusted to experience of other
operating  plants  within  BBA’s  database.  Unit  costs  were  obtained  from  vendors.  The  cost  of  liners  and  grinding  media  for  the
crusher and the grinding mills was estimated to be $2.68/t of ore milled.
BUILDING HEATING AND SERVICES
 
For  this  Study,  it  was  assumed  that  the  buildings  would  be  heated  using  natural  gas,  which  is  readily  available  from  a  main
pipeline passing in the vicinity of the Property. A portion of the heating requirements in the concentrator building is provided by the
heat generated within the POX area which produces significant amounts of heat during operations.
OXYGEN
 
A budget proposal was received from two oxygen plant vendors. For this type of application, vendors have proposed a VPSA type
oxygen  plant  of  the  required  capacity  to  support  operations,  including  a  limited  quantity  of  liquid  oxygen  emergency  back-up.
Vendors  will  build,  own  and  operate  the  oxygen  plant  and  Aurizon  will  supply  electrical  power  and  clean  water  as  well  as  a
designated area ready to receive the equipment. Commercial terms would include a long-term supply contract (for the LOM) with
fixed monthly take-or-pay rate.

MAINTENANCE MATERIAL
 
The annual cost of maintenance materials was estimated using a typical factor of about 2% of equipment value and represents
about $0.59/t of ore milled. This excludes maintenance labour costs which have already been accounted for in labour costs.
21.3.2  Administration
 
Administration  costs  consist  mainly  of  on-site  personnel  required  to  support  operations  as  well  as  some  incremental  corporate
Aurizon costs to support the Joanna operation. The estimated total annual administration cost was estimated to be in the order of
$1.82M. Of this, $1.53M is attributed to on-site administrative personnel as indicated in Table 21.4. This represents $0.49/t milled.
Labour  unit  costs  are  ‘all-in’  and  include  base  wages,  fringe  benefits,  social  costs  to  the  employer  and  other  bonuses  and
premiums in line with local conditions and other Aurizon operations.

21.5.2  Royalties
 
Aurizon has a contractual obligation to pay royalties to 90569 Canada Inc. Royalties are calculated based on 2% of net revenues
(revenues less transport and refining costs). For this Study, the royalty was based on a gold price of $1,350/oz. The obligation
toward  90569  Canada  Inc.  is  for  Aurizon  to  pay  the  amount  of  $500,000  upon  completion  of  a  feasibility  study  and  receipt  of
decision by a financial institution to finance development of the property to commercial production. This amount is subsequently
discounted on the first royalties due, once operations commence.

22  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
 
The economic evaluation of the Joanna Gold Project was performed by BBA using the discounted cash flow model on a before-tax
basis. The Capital and Operating Cost Estimates input into the Financial Analysis model were based on the mine plan developed
in this Study to process 8,500 t/d of ore. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on total investment was calculated based on 100%
equity financing. The Net Present Value (NPV), based on a discounting rate of 0% and 5% (Base Case) resulting from the net cash
flow  generated  by  the  Project  was  also  calculated.  The  payback  period  is  also  indicated  as  a  financial  measure.  A  sensitivity
analysis was also performed and presented. The following assumptions were made for the financial analysis:
§ A production life of 13.4years for the Hosco deposit, based on the resource estimate;
§  A gold price of $1350/oz based on a 36 month moving average to the end of May 2012;
§ Production startup 44 months after initiation of environmental permitting process;
§ No escalation or inflation factor has been taken into account (constant 2012 $);
§ US Dollar at par with Canadian Dollar.
Table 22.1 presents the undiscounted cash flow projection for the Project. BBA assumed that initial capital disbursement takes
place over a two year period (year -1 and 0) prior to production startup. Production starts in Yr 1.

A  discount  rate  is  applied  to  the  cash  flow  to  arrive  at  a  NPV  and  payback  period.  The  NPV  calculation  was  done  at  0%
(undiscounted Cash Flow) and at 5% discount rate (Base Case). The discount rate selected is a reflection of the cost of capital and
the project risk. Table 22.2 presents the results of the financial analysis for the Project based on the assumptions and cash flow
projections previously presented.

As can be seen, the Project is forecasted to provide an IRR of 8.66% (before tax). At the Base Case discount rate of 5%, NPV is
$111.6 M. The Payback period is 10.3 years after the start of production.
22.1 Sensitivity Analysis
 
A sensitivity analysis was done on parameters that are deemed to have the biggest impact on project financial performance. The
following sensitivity analysis was performed and results are presented in Figure 22.1 and Figure 22.2:
§ Base Case CAPEX +/- 20% of initial capital cost;
§ Base Case Price of Gold +/- 20%;
§ Base Case OPEX estimate +/- 20% per year.
Figure 22.1 and Figure 22.2 show a graphical representation of the sensitivity analysis. As is indicated, IRR and NPV at a 5%
discount rate are more sensitive to variations in operating cost than to variations in initial capital cost. Variations in the gold price
affect the IRR and NPV to a much greater extent than variations in operating costs and capital costs.

A further sensitivity analysis, present in Table 22.3 was performed to assess the impact of a higher dilution rate on project return. It
was determined that an increase in the dilution rate from 6.5% to 15% would result in a reduction in NPV (5% discount rate) of 28.8
M$ and a reduction of IRR of -1.2%.

22.2.1  Scope
 
BBA’s approach to Risk Management in the context of this Study is to identify major risks associated with this Project in terms of
the following categories:
§ Technology and technical risk;
§ Risk related to meeting the targeted project schedule;
§ Risk affecting CAPEX;
§ Risk affecting OPEX;
§ Risk affecting Profitability;
§ Risk affecting Closure Costs.
Risk Management is a continuous process that is performed over the full life-cycle of a project; therefore, Risk Management is only
complete when the project is complete. Consequently, the data and information presented in this Report is a snapshot of the project
major risk profile as understood on the effective date of this Report. It will be noted that because of the continuous nature of the
Risk Management process, many open risk issues exist at this time. A review of the Risk Register will show that not all risks have
been fully evaluated nor are they accompanied by well-defined mitigation plans or actions since these are to be updated regularly.

22.2.2  Risk Assessment Methodology
 
Risk identification is the process of examining the various project areas and each critical process in order to identify and document
any associated potential risks. A risk review meeting was held at BBA’s offices on April 10th, 2012 with the participation of BBA,
Roche and Aurizon.
For this Study, risk assessment was conducted on a qualitative basis. The Probability of Occurrence was assessed and qualified
on three levels. The Manageability of the risk, which indicates how effectively the risk may be mitigated, was also qualified on three
levels. These are indicated in Table 22.4. The consequence associated with the risk was qualified in the Risk Register but only as
a description.

Label
High
Medium
Low
Probability
Likely to Occur
May Occur
Unlikely to Occur
Manageability

From this table it is understood that a risk with a High Probable Consequence and a Low Manageability should receive a high
priority for mitigation activities and resources.
Table 22.5 presents a summary of the risk items identified and the risk category for each risk item and should be used in the next
engineering phase of the Project.

24  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
 
24.1 Project Implementation Schedule
 
The implementation schedule for the Joanna Project is presented in Figure 24.1. It was developped based on the following
assumptions:
§  The schedule begins with Aurizon Mines issuing the project notice to the authorities;
§  The environmental permitting process is projected to last 21 months;
§  The construction period is assumed to last 20 months and will not begin until the environmental permit is received.
 
§  The purchase order for long lead items will be issued so as not to impact the construction schedule. As of the effective date of
this report, the main long lead items are as follows:
- Autoclave delivery time is 18 months;
- Oxygen plant delivery time is 24 months.
Based on the preliminary schedule developed, it is expected that plant operations will begin about 44 months after the
environmental permitting process is initiated.

25  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
 
Much  progress  has  been  made  in  the  development  of  the  Joanna  Project  since  the  publishing  of  the  Pre-Feasibility  Study  in
December  2009.  Additional  drilling  has  allowed  for  a  significant  increase  of  mineral  reserves  (in  the  order  of  67%)  and  in-pit
mineral reserves have now been established at 1.45 million ounces of gold recoverable in the Hosco deposit. During the course of
the Feasibility Study, a detailed analysis of numerous mine plan options was performed by BBA and the most cost effective plan
was retained as the Base Case mine plan for this Study. Extensive metallurgical testwork highlighted the complexity of the Joanna
deposit  mineralization  and  resulted  in  reorienting  the  oxidation  step  in  the  Process  Flowsheet  from  the  Albion  Process  to  the
Pressure Oxidation (POX) Process. Furthermore, all environmental aspects and impacts were studied in great detail and allowed
for  the  development  of  a  solid  environmental  management  plan  for  tailings  and  waste  disposal.  The  increase  in  the  level  of
engineering  detail  developed  during  the  course  of  the  Feasibility  Study  allowed  for  significant  de-risking  of  the  Project  when
compared to the Pre-Feasibility Study. As such, the capital cost and operating cost estimates associated with the Project have
been developed to a much better degree of accuracy.
25.1 SGS Geostat Interpretations and Conclusions on Mineral Resources
 
As part of the independent verification program, SGS Geostat conducted a review of the exploration methodology used by Aurizon
Mines  including  sampling  methodology,  sample  preparation  and  analysis,  and  QA/QC  protocol.  Data  verification  consisting  of
validation of the digital database used for the Project and collection of independent duplicate samples from recent mineralized core
samples drilled by Aurizon Mines was also completed as part of the verification program.
SGS Geostat completed an updated mineral resource estimate of the Hosco deposit based on additional surface diamond drilling
done  by  Aurizon  Mines  since  the  last  mineral  resource  estimate  of  June  2011.  The  results  of  this  updated  mineral  resource
estimate, as reported in the NI 43-101 Technical Report published in March 2012, constitute the current resource estimate for the
Hosco  deposit  and  were  used  in  the  development  of  this  Feasibility  Study  NI  43-101  Technical  Report.  The  current  mineral
resource estimate for the Hosco deposit is defined,

based on two distinct mining scenarios, in-pit and underground, using distinct Base Case gold cut-off grade although only the in-pit
resources were considered for this Feasibility Study. Also, as described in the June 13, 2011 Company news release, the mineral
resources  of  the  Heva  deposit  were  not  updated  at  that  time  but  were  restated  using  a  modified  cut-off  grade  for  the  mineral
resources located below 300 m from the surface. The restatement of the Heva deposit mineral resource disclosed on June 13,
2011 was made to better reflect the reasonable prospect of economic extraction in relation to the advanced stage of exploration of
the Hosco deposit located to the east. The restated mineral resource estimate for the Heva deposit disclosed in June 2011 is used
in this Report. As described in the Company’s June 13, 2011 news release, as the updated resource outline of the Hosco deposit
disclosed  in  the  news  release  crossed  over  the  Alexandria  claim  boundary,  all  the  resources  of  the  Alexandria  sector  were
restated.  However, the Alexandria resource estimate was not updated in June 2011. The restated mineral resource estimate for the
Alexandria sector disclosed by the Company on June 13, 2011 is used in this Report.
This Feasibility Study only considers resources classified as reserves for the Hosco deposit. It should be understood that mineral
resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
The final updated mineral resources for the Hosco deposit are as follows: The in-pit mineral resources using a Base Case cut-off
grade of 0.33 g/t Au totals 30,690,000 tonnes grading 1.33 g/t Au for 1,311,000 oz Au in the measured category; 27,150,000 tonnes
grading  1.18  g/t  Au  for  1,033,000  oz  Au  in  the  indicated  category  with  an  additional  7,050,000  tonnes  grading  1.18  g/t  Au  for
267,000 oz Au in the inferred resources category. The U/G mineral resources using a Base Case cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au totals
50,000 tonnes grading 2.65 g/t Au for 5,000 oz Au in the indicated category with an additional 590,000 tonnes grading 2.54 g/t Au
for 48,000 oz Au in the inferred resources category. Table 25.1 and Table 25.2 summarise the mineral resources for the Hosco
deposit using cut-off grades of 0.33 g/t Au (Base Case), 0.5 g/t Au and 1.0 g/t Au for the in- pit scenario and cut-off grades of
2.0 g/t Au (Base Case), 2.5 g/t Au and 3.0 g/t Au for the underground scenario.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
The  updated  mineral  resources  of  the  Hosco  deposit  were  estimated  from  two  distinct  block  models:  one  for  high  grade  gold
mineralization and one for the low grade mineralization, most of which is located in the surroundings of the high grade model. The
high grade block model has been interpolated from 2 m interval composite data constrained within 3D wireframe solids defined
from the channel and drillhole mineralized intercepts. The low grade block model was estimated from composite data of similar
length located outside the defined high grade wireframe solids. Both block models are defined by a block size of 8 m (E-W) by 5 m
(N-S) by 8 m (vertical) and cover an area located with sections 7050mE to 10,000mE of the Project to a maximum depth of more
than 980 m below surface. The interpolation of the block grades was completed using OK methodology with multiple passes using
search ellipsoids that increased in size from one interpolation pass to another. The final updated mineral resources correspond to
the estimated blocks from both block models located below the bedrock-overburden interface as well as outside known barren late
intrusive units observed in the deposit area. The updated mineral resources were finally classified into measured, indicated and
inferred  using  an  automated  classification  process  followed  by  a  manual  smoothing  to  produce  coherent  mineral  resource
categories. A bulk density of 2.75 t/m3 was used to calculate the final tonnages of the mineral resources based on the volumetric
estimates of the block models.
SGS Geostat validated the core sampling and QA/QC procedures used by Aurizon Mines as part of an independent verification
program and concluded that the drill core handling, logging and sampling protocols, including the insertion control samples into the
sample  stream  for  the  Project,  are  at  conventional  industry  standard  and  conform  to  ‘generally  accepted’  best  practices.  SGS
Geostat is confident that the system is appropriate for the collection of data suitable for the estimation of a NI 43-101 compliant
mineral resources.
As part of the verification program, SGS Geostat validated the Project’s digital database and conducted independent sampling of
mineralized core duplicates from recent drillholes done by the Company. The author and SGS Geostat are of the opinion that the
database provided for the current resource estimate is valid and the data is acceptable for estimation of mineral resources.

25.2 Mining (Mineral Reserves)
 
The reserves for the detailed pit design have been calculated in accordance with the definitions and guidelines adopted by the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves) in August, 2000.
The mineral reserves (with dilution and ore loss) contained within the Main pit and West pit amount to 41.1 Mt of ore at an average
grade of 1.26 g/t Au using a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au, for a total of 1.66 Moz of in-situ gold and 1.45 Moz of recovered gold. Total
waste,  including  rock,  inferred  material  and  overburden,  is  184.6  Mt  for  a  stripping  ratio  of  4.49.  The  detailed  mineral  reserve
estimate is shown in Table 25.4.

Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
Conventional open pit mining methods will be used. The mining equipment selection is based on the use of 100-ton class haul
trucks,  hydraulic  excavators,  production  drills  and  various  ancillary  equipments.  Mine  operations  were  designed  to  support  an
average daily production rate of 8,500 tonnes of ore. Initial production will start from a smaller pit and will be extended in two
additional pushbacks; mining of the West Hosco pit is expected to begin in Year 4. The overburden consists of silt and clay and
varies in thickness between six (6) and 15 metres. It is planned that the overburden will be removed during winter seasons.
The pits were designed with a triple benching arrangement and include a 15-metre geotechnical safety berm at every 120 metre
vertical height. Based on the results of rock mechanic studies, (Golder Associates, June 2009), the recommended inter-ramp pit
slope will be 53° for the hanging wall (north), 49° for the footwall (south) as well as both east and west sectors.
25.3 Metallurgy and Ore Processing
 
Gold  mineralization  in  the  Hosco  deposit  is  associated  with  disseminated  sulphides,  mostly  arsenopyrite  (main  gold  bearing
mineral)  and  pyrrhotite.  As  the  material  is  partially  refractory,  the  selection  of  an  oxidation  method  before  the  cyanidation  of  a
flotation concentrate became necessary to improve and optimize the level of gold recovery. The consistency of the results obtained
at  the  pilot-plant  level,  combined  with  higher  recoveries,  led  to  the  selection  of  the  conventional  Pressure  Oxidation  (POX)
technology utilizing an autoclave as the preferred method of oxidation for the Hosco ore. This technology is well established and
proven for this application. Sherritt Technologies performed all testwork and process development for the POX area of the plant.
Metallurgical testwork provided data for the following:
§  The  ore  competency  is  considered  to  be  hard  to  very  hard  with  respect  to  the  SGS  database,  thus  the  grinding  energy
requirement is an important design and operating factor.
§  Determining gold deportment, gold recovery at each processing step and the derivation of the gold recovery curve as a function
of gold head grade. Nominal overall gold recovery was estimated at 87.5% for the average LOM head grade of 1.26 g/t of gold.

§  Sizing of major process equipment as well as ancillary equipment. This information was used for estimating the project capital
costs.
§  Determining reagent and consumables consumptions for the various processing steps. Also, power consumption was estimated
based on ore grindability data and on sizing of ancillary equipment, including the oxygen plant. This information was used for
estimating project operating costs.
The testwork results and ensuing process flowsheet provide a solid basis for processing the Joanna ore.
25.4 Environmental and Permitting
 
The development of the Joanna Project poses certain significant challenges with respect to environmental management. These
challenges are brought about mainly by the presence of arsenic bearing minerals in the ore body. Much effort has been made to
design the operation in order to allow for segregating and separating higher arsenic grade waste and tailings from that which is
lower arsenic grade material. This allowed for reduced footprints of the arsenic waste rock pile and tailings pond as well as for
improved water management. Despite these efforts, capital costs associated with design of the waste piles, tailings ponds and
water management system are a significant contributor to overall capital costs. Although environmental design was performed for
diligent management of waste, tailings and water, the environmental approval process for the Project may require further design
features, over and above those required by the regulation, which may add further costs to the Project.
25.5 Conclusions
 
Based on the overall results obtained in this Feasibility Study, the following conclusions can be drawn:
§  The Joanna Project Hosco deposit consists of a low grade, arsenic bearing refractory gold mineralization.
§  Mining at a rate of 8,500 t/d classifies this operation as a low tonnage operation.
§  Ore processing requires crushing, grinding, gravity, flotation, pressure oxidation, cyanide leaching and CIP gold extraction.

NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
§  The arsenic content of the ore has significant repercussions on environmental management, namely in the design of the higher
grade arsenic bearing waste rock and tailings. This also adds to the complexity of managing water and effluent on site. Despite
incorporating diligent design techniques to minimize environmental risks, the mere presence of arsenic bearing waste rock and
tailings on site may affect the Environmental Permitting process.
§  The  pre-production  (initial)  capital  cost  for  the  Project  was  estimated  at  $422.2M.  Site  closure  and  restoration  costs  were
estimated at $27.1M. Sustaining capital required over the life of the operation has been estimated to be in the order of $70.2M.
§  The  average  operating  cash  cost  is  estimated  at  US$716  per  ounce  of  gold  and  $25.32  per  tonne  milled.  This  excludes
transportation, refining and royalties.
§  The financial analysis, using a price of gold of US$1,350 per ounce indicates a pre-tax Net Present Value ("NPV") (using a 5%
discount rate) of $112 million with a pre-tax internal rate of return ("IRR") of 8.7%. The undiscounted payback period is 8.2 years.
The  results  of  the  Feasibility  Study  indicate  that  although  Project  economics  are  positive  (based  on  the  financial  assumptions
used), the potential financial returns are however marginal and small fluctuations in gold price (and to a lesser extent capital and
operating costs) can significantly impact the economic viability of the Project.
At this time, given the exploration potential elsewhere on the property, Aurizon Mines may want to consider further development of
the Heva deposit and evaluate if a joint Hosco/Heva mining operation would improve project economics. Furthermore, considering
that the Environmental Permitting process for this Project may be more complex and longer than planned, Aurizon Mines may want
to consider proceeding with obtaining permits and authorizations for the Project so that if and when project economics become
more favorable, they can proceed quickly with execution.

26  RECOMMENDATIONS
 
Based on the results obtained in this Feasibility Study, it is recommended that Aurizon Mines perform the following activities as part
of the final design development for the Joanna Project.
26.1 Drilling Recommendations
 
The  drilling  programs  completed  by  Aurizon  since  the  last  reported  mineral  resource  estimate  successfully  outlined  additional
resources  in  the  measured  and  indicated  categories  located  mostly  below  the  open  pit  shell,  previously  defined  in  the  Pre-
Feasibility  Study,  but  including  a  new  small  mineral  resources  core  located  near  the  surface  between  sections  7225mE  and
7425mE. Based on the Project’s updated Hosco deposit mineral resources and discussions with Aurizon personnel, SGS Geostat
recommends the following exploration work in the Hosco and other sectors of the Property:
Delineation drilling – Hosco West sector:
1)  
 
§Increase the inferred resources (50 m X 50 m drill pattern) from surface to 200 m below the surface between sections 7000mE and
7800mE;
§Complete the conversion of inferred resources into measured and indicated resources (25 m X 25 m drilling pattern) to 200 m
below surface around significant results;
§ Delineation drilling: 15,000 m (2.1M$ budget).
 
2)  
 
§Increase inferred resources (100 m X 100 m drill pattern) from the surface to a depth of 200m below the surface between sections
Exploration and delineation drilling – Heva sector:
4200mE and 5000mE and between sections 5500mE and 7000mE; 14,000m of drilling
§Complete the conversion of inferred resources into indicated resources around significant results (50 m X 50 m drill pattern) from
the surface to a depth of 200m below the surface between sections 4200mE and 7000mE; 30,000m of drilling.
§ Exploration and delineation drilling: 44,000 m (6.2M$ budget).
 
3)  
 
§Build a comprehensive structural model of the higher grade mineralization identified in the South and North Zones to help the
planning of deeper drilling, with the objective of defining potential underground mineral resources.
Exploration drilling – Hosco sector:
July 2012
26-1
NI 43-101 Technical Report
Feasibility Study of the Hosco Deposit
 
§Increase inferred resources (100 m X 100 m drill pattern) between 300 m to 600 m below the surface to test higher grade for
potential underground mineral resources.
§ Exploration drilling: 12,000 m (1.7M$ budget).
 
4)  
 
§Investigating the continuity at depth and in the extension of showings discovered in 2009-2010 during the prospection and drilling
program;
Exploration drilling – Alexandria:
§Compilation of historical works (drilling, geophysics survey, and mapping) with the objective to generate new targets in the overall
Alexandria sector;
Exploration drilling and field works – Henriksen:
§ Exploration drilling: 10,000 m (1.4M$ budget).
 
5)  
 
§ Investigating the continuity in the extension of significant results from the 2008 drilling program;
 
§ Increase understanding of the gravimetric survey (2010) in order to generate new drilling targets;
 
§Surface mapping and sampling in “oreille ouest” sector to understand structural and mineralization controls of the area;
 
§ Exploration drilling (5000 m) and field works (0.8M$ budget).
26.2 Testwork and Process Recommendations
 
There may be some opportunities for optimizing grinding or for increased gold recovery, which can be assessed by performing
further testwork as part of the final design. This would help create a more robust design. The following activities are recommended:
§  Considering  the  relatively  small  quantity  of  grindability  samples  tested,  it  is  recommended  that  more  samples  be  taken  and
additional full JK Drop Weight tests and SMC tests be performed to validate the chosen mill sizes and power. Samples should
be taken to match the mine plan phases in order to validate ore hardness in the first months and years of operation in a more
detailed manner.
§  Further chemical analysis (QEMSCAN) of the ore to better under the mineralogy of the deposit.
§  Investigate the possibility of using flash flotation to increase recovery through a reduction in over grinding of the sulphide.

26.3 Environmental and Geotechnical Recommendations
 
§  Realize kinetic tests on representative composite samples of wacke waste rock type.  The arsenic content (partial digestion) of
the composite samples must be ± 115 mg/kg.  The results should  confirm the non-ARD potential and the non-leaching potential
of wacke;
§  In  order  to  proceed  with  detailed  engineering,  additional  geotechnical  studies  must  be  carried  out  at  the  location  of  all
infrastructures and along the CN railway.  This program must include drilling, surveys as well as laboratory analysis and soil
dynamic stability studies.
§  Realize geotechnical surveys at the location of the dams in order to confirm the slope of the dams for the tailings and the various
ponds;
§  Realize topographic surveys in the projected area for the POX tailings north of the hydroelectric line to optimize infrastructure
location;
§  Confirm location of the POX tailings using detailed topography and geotechnical surveys;
§  Data  collected  at  the  project  site  has  allowed  the  definition  of  the  local  hydrogeological  setting  and  the  identification  of
groundwater protection issues. It was found that the relationship between some surface water bodies, and shallow and deep
groundwater systems that could potentially be influenced by dewatering activities could be better documented, more specifically,
in  the  Stitchman  Creek  area  where  a  thin  overburden  layer  was  encountered.  Detailed  work,  including  monitoring  well
installation, hydraulic testing and groundwater sampling and analysis, is currently carried out to complete existing information.
Regular monitoring of stream flow in the Stitchman Creek and water levels in some shallow and deep monitoring wells could
also be performed in order to document seasonal fluctuations;
§  Pursue discussions with Québec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks concerning compensation for
wetlands destruction;
§  Presentation of the existing fish habitat compensation program to Canada Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans for the ditch and the
small stream which will be diverted by the establishment of the open-pit.  This program will allow confirmation that those works
will not trigger the federal environmental assessment procedure;

§  Given the new location and size  of the infrastructure, update of noise and visual modelling will have to be carried out in due
course;
26.4 Estimated Budget for Further Work
 
It is BBA’s understanding that Aurizon Mines does not expect to move forward with the development of the Joanna Project at this
time. BBA also understands that, despite this decision, Aurizon Mines will allocate sums in the vicinity of $4.2M for further drilling in
the Hosco and Heva areas.
