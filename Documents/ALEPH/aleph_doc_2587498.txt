FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT
OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
THIS FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF HI-CRUSH PARTNERS
LP dated as of August 20, 2012, is entered into by and between Hi-Crush GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, as the General Partner, and Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the
Organizational Limited Partner, together with any other Persons who become Partners in the Partnership or parties
hereto as provided herein. In consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
Section 1.1 Definitions. The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the
contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.
“Additional Book Basis” means the portion of any remaining Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property that is attributable
to positive adjustments made to such Carrying Value as a result of Book-Up Events. For purposes of determining the
extent that Carrying Value constitutes Additional Book Basis:
(a) Any negative adjustment made to the Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property as a result of either a Book-Down
Event or a Book-Up Event shall first be deemed to offset or decrease that portion of the Carrying Value of such
Adjusted Property that is attributable to any prior positive adjustments made thereto pursuant to a Book-Up Event or
Book-Down Event.
(b) If Carrying Value that constitutes Additional Book Basis is reduced as a result of a Book-Down Event and the
Carrying Value of other property is increased as a result of such Book-Down Event, an allocable portion of any such
increase in Carrying Value shall be treated as Additional Book Basis; provided, that the amount treated as Additional
Book Basis pursuant hereto as a result of such Book-Down Event shall not exceed the amount by which the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments after such Book-Down Event exceeds the remaining Additional Book
Basis attributable to all of the Partnership’s Adjusted Property after such Book-Down Event (determined without
regard to the application of this clause (b) to such Book-Down Event).
“Additional Book Basis Derivative Items” means any Book Basis Derivative Items that are computed with reference to
Additional Book Basis. To the extent that the Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the Partnership’s Adjusted
Property as of the beginning of any taxable period exceeds the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments as of
the beginning of such period (the “Excess Additional Book Basis”), the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items for
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
1
such period shall be reduced by the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items determined without regard to this sentence as the Excess Additional Book Basis bears to the
Additional Book Basis as of the beginning of such period. With respect to a Disposed of Adjusted Property, the
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items shall be the amount of Additional Book Basis taken into account in computing
gain or loss from the disposition of such Disposed of Adjusted Property.
“Adjusted Capital Account” means the Capital Account maintained for each Partner as of the end of each taxable
period of the Partnership, (a) increased by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the standards
set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is deemed obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5)) and (b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and deductions that, as of the
end of such taxable period, are reasonably expected to be allocated to such Partner in subsequent taxable periods
under Sections 704(e)(2) and 706(d) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and (ii) the amount
of all distributions that, as of the end of such taxable period, are reasonably expected to be made to such Partner in
subsequent taxable periods in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or otherwise to the extent they exceed
offsetting increases to such Partner’s Capital Account that are reasonably expected to occur during (or prior to) the
taxable period in which such distributions are reasonably expected to be made (other than increases as a result of a
minimum gain chargeback pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i) or 6.1(d)(ii)). The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital
Account is intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. The “Adjusted Capital Account” of a Partner in respect of any Partnership Interest
shall be the amount that such Adjusted Capital Account would be if such Partnership Interest were the only interest in
the Partnership held by such Partner from and after the date on which such Partnership Interest was first issued.
“Adjusted Operating Surplus” means, with respect to any period, (a) Operating Surplus generated with respect to such
period; (b) less (i) the amount of any net increase in Working Capital Borrowings (or the Partnership’s proportionate
share of any net increase in Working Capital Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with
respect to that period; and (ii) the amount of any net decrease in cash reserves (or the Partnership’s proportionate
share of any net decrease in cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) for Operating
Expenditures with respect to such period not relating to an Operating Expenditure made with respect to such period;
and (c) plus (i) the amount of any net decrease in Working Capital Borrowings (or the Partnership’s proportionate share
of any net decrease in Working Capital Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with respect
to that period; (ii) the amount of any net increase in cash reserves (or the Partnership’s proportionate share of any net
increase in cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) for Operating Expenditures with
respect to such period required by any debt instrument for the repayment of principal, interest or premium; and (iii) the
amount of any net decrease made in subsequent periods in cash reserves for Operating Expenditures initially
established with respect to such period to the extent such decrease results in a reduction in Adjusted Operating
Surplus in subsequent periods pursuant to clause (b)(ii). Adjusted Operating Surplus does not include that portion of
Operating Surplus included in clause (a)(i) of the definition of Operating Surplus.

a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as
nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding
Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such

sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a Certificate,
and subject to the provisions hereof, the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of Certificates evidencing Limited Partner Interests, the
Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or
transferees, as required pursuant to the holder’s instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the
same aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so

(d) Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.5, (ii) Section 4.3, (iii) Section 4.7, (iv) with respect
to any class or series of Limited Partner Interests, the provisions of any statement of designations or an
amendment to this Agreement establishing such class or series, (v) any contractual provisions binding on
any Limited Partner and (vi) provisions of applicable law including the Securities Act, Limited Partner
Interests shall be freely transferable.

HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the General Partner of all or any part of its
General Partner Interest to another Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss
of limited liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited Partner or cause the Partnership to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(to the extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees to purchase all (or the
appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the partnership or membership interest held by the General
Partner as the general partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the case of a
transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this Section 4.6, the transferee or successor (as the case may be)

Partner effective immediately prior to the transfer of the General Partner Interest, and the business of the
Partnership shall continue without dissolution.
Section 4.7 Restrictions on Transfers.
(a) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall be
made if such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and
regulations of the Commission, any state securities commission or any other governmental authority with
jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the Partnership under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not
already so treated or taxed).
(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership Interests if it determines, with
the advice of counsel, that such restrictions are necessary or advisable to (i) avoid a significant risk of the
Partnership becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or (ii) preserve the uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof). The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending this Agreement; provided, however,
that any amendment that would result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner
Interests on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is
then listed or admitted to trading must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders
of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.
(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement, other than Section 4.7(a), shall preclude the settlement of any
transactions involving Partnership Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading.

Section 4.8 Eligibility Certificates; Ineligible Holders.
(a) If at any time the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that:
(i) the U.S. federal income tax status (or lack of proof of the U.S. federal income tax status) of one or more
Limited Partners or their beneficial owners has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
rates that can be charged to customers by any Group Member with respect to assets that are subject to
regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or similar regulatory body (a “Rate Eligibility
Trigger”); or
(ii) any Group Member is subject to any federal, state or local law or regulation that would create a substantial
risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the
nationality, citizenship or other related status of a Limited Partner (a “Citizenship Eligibility Trigger”);
then, the General Partner may adopt such amendments to this Agreement as it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to (x) in the case of a Rate Eligibility Trigger, obtain such proof of the U.S. federal income tax
status of the Limited Partners and, to the extent relevant, their beneficial owners, as the General Partner
determines to be necessary or appropriate to reduce risk of the occurrence of a material adverse effect on the
rates that can be charged to customers by any Group Member or (y) in the case of a Citizenship Eligibility
Trigger, obtain such proof of the nationality, citizenship or other related status of the Limited Partner and, to
the extent relevant, their beneficial owners as the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate
to eliminate or mitigate a significant risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any properties or interests therein of a
Group Member.
(b) Such amendments may include provisions requiring all Partners to certify as to their (and their beneficial
owners’) status as Eligible Holders upon demand and on a regular basis, as determined by the General
Partner, and may require transferees of Units to so certify prior to being admitted to the Partnership as a
Partner (any such required certificate, an “Eligibility Certificate”).
(c) Such amendments may provide that any Partner who fails to furnish to the General Partner within a
reasonable period requested proof of its (and its beneficial owners’) status as an Eligible Holder or if upon
receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or other requested information the General Partner determines that a
Limited Partner (or its beneficial owner) is not an Eligible Holder (an “Ineligible Holder”), the
Partnership Interests owned by such Limited Partner shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the
provisions of Section 4.9. In addition, the General Partner shall be substituted and treated as the owner of all
Partnership Interests owned by an Ineligible Holder.

(d) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of Partnership Interests held by it on
behalf of Ineligible Holders, cast such votes in the same manner and in the same ratios as the votes of
Partners (including the General Partner and its Affiliates) in respect of Partnership Interests other than those
of Ineligible Holders are cast.
(e) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Holder shall have no right to receive a distribution in
kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall
provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible Holder’s share of any distribution in kind. Such
payment and assignment shall be treated for purposes hereof as a purchase by the Partnership from the
Ineligible Holder of the portion of his Partnership Interest representing his right to receive his share of such
distribution in kind.
(f) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible Holder, an Ineligible Holder may,
upon application to the General Partner, request that with respect to any Partnership Interests of such
Ineligible Holder not redeemed pursuant to Section 4.9, such Ineligible Holder be admitted as a Partner, and
upon approval of the General Partner, such Ineligible Holder shall be admitted as a Partner and shall no
longer constitute an Ineligible Holder and the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the owner in
respect of such Ineligible Holder’s Partnership Interests.
Section 4.9 Redemption of Partnership Interests of Ineligible Holders.
(a) If at any time a Partner fails to furnish an Eligibility Certificate or other information requested within the
period of time specified in amendments adopted pursuant to Section 4.8 or if upon receipt of such Eligibility
Certificate, the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Partner is an Ineligible Holder,
the Partnership may, unless the Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Partner
is an Eligible Holder or has transferred his Limited Partner Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Holder and
who furnishes an Eligibility Certificate to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for redemption as
provided below, redeem the Partnership Interest of such Partner as follows:
(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date fixed for redemption, give notice of
redemption to the Partner, at his last address designated on the records of the Partnership or the Transfer
Agent, as applicable, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to have
been given when so mailed. The notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption,
the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon redemption of the Redeemable
Interests (or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the
Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests) and that on and after the date fixed for redemption no further
allocations or distributions to which the Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable
Interests will accrue or be made.

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an amount equal to the Current Market
Price (the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Partnership Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Partnership Interests of each such class included
among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner,
in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price,
bearing interest at the rate of 8% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together
with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.
(iii) The Partner or his duly authorized representative shall be entitled to receive the payment for the
Redeemable Interests at the place of payment specified in the notice of redemption on the redemption date
(or, if later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender by or on behalf of
the Partner at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable
Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank).
(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute issued and Outstanding
Limited Partner Interests.
(b) The provisions of this Section 4.9 shall also be applicable to Partnership Interests held by a Partner as
nominee of a Person determined to be an Ineligible Holder.
(c) Nothing in this Section 4.9 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of redemption from transferring his
Partnership Interest before the redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement.
Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the notice of redemption,
provided the transferee of such Partnership Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that he
is an Eligible Holder. If the transferee fails to make such certification, such redemption will be effected from
the transferee on the original redemption date.

provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either as to the return of
Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to

Section 5.5 Capital Accounts.
(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a
nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner) owning a
Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with
the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the
amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest and
(ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in
accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1,
and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or
property made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss
computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant
to Section 6.1.
(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction that is to be
allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be reflected in the Partners’ Capital Accounts, the determination,
recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and
classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or
amortization used for that purpose), provided, that:
(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.5, the Partnership shall be treated as owning directly its proportionate
share (as determined by the General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member
Agreement) of all property owned by (x) any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability company, unincorporated business
or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes of which a Group Member is,
directly or indirectly, a partner, member or other equity holder.
(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership
Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes
of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time such fees and other expenses
are incurred and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.
(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all
items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code that may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or
705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are
neither currently deductible nor capitalized for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent an adjustment
to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required,
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
36
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment
in the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.
(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any Partnership property shall be
determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to
the property’s Carrying Value as of such date.
(v) Any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any Contributed Property or
Adjusted Property shall be determined under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)(2)
as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately
following such adjustment.
(vi) The Gross Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such times as provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to
Carrying Values. The amount of any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss
(if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the
adjustment decreases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership).
(c) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.5(c), a transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed
to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred.
(ii) Subject to Section 6.7(b), immediately prior to the transfer of a Subordinated Unit or of a Subordinated
Unit that has converted into a Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.7 by a holder thereof (in each case, other
than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this subparagraph 5.5(c)(ii) apply), the
Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated
Units will (A) first, be allocated to the Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units to be transferred in
an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated
Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining
balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any
Subordinated Units or converted Subordinated Units. Following any such allocation, the transferor’s Capital
Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Subordinated Units or retained converted
Subordinated Units, if any, will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) above, and the
transferee’s Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Subordinated Units or transferred
converted Subordinated Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (A) above.

(iii) Subject to Section 6.8(b), immediately prior to the transfer of an IDR Reset Common Unit by a holder
thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this subparagraph 5.5(c)
(iii) apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its IDR Reset Common Units will
(A) first, be allocated to the IDR Reset Common Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the product of
(x) the number of such IDR Reset Common Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the
transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any IDR Reset Common Units. Following any such allocation,
the transferor’s Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained IDR Reset Common Units, if
any, will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the transferee’s
Capital Account established with respect to the transferred IDR Reset Common Units will have a balance equal
to the amount allocated under clause (A) above.
(d) (i) Consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership
Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the
provision of services, or the conversion of the Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to
Section 11.3(b), the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of
maintaining Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an
amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such issuance and had been allocated among the
Partners at such time pursuant to Section 6.1 in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually
recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated;
provided, however, that in the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of cash
or Contributed Property, or in the event of an issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as
consideration for the provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such adjustments are
unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership. In determining such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash
equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall be determined by the
General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt. In making its determination of the fair
market values of individual properties, the General Partner may determine that it is appropriate to first
determine an aggregate value for the Partnership, based on the current trading price of the Common Units,
and taking fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time, and
then allocate such aggregate value among the individual properties of the Partnership (in such manner as it
determines appropriate).
(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or
deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
38
upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership
property, and any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be treated, for purposes of maintaining
Capital Accounts, as if it had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to
such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated among the Partners, at
such time, pursuant to Section 6.1 in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized
following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated. In determining
such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including
cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual or deemed
distribution other than a distribution made pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined in the same manner as
that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be
determined by the Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt.
Section 5.6 Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests and Derivative Instruments.
(a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Interests and Derivative Instruments for any Partnership
purpose at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and
conditions as the General Partner shall determine, all without the approval of any Limited Partners.
(b) Each additional Partnership Interest authorized to be issued by the Partnership pursuant to Section 5.6(a)
may be issued in one or more classes, or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing classes and series of Partnership
Interests), as shall be fixed by the General Partner, including (i) the right to share in Partnership profits and
losses or items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may or
shall be required to redeem the Partnership Interest (including sinking fund provisions); (v) whether such
Partnership Interest is issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership
Interest will be issued, evidenced by Certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining
the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership Interest; and (viii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership
Interest to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and
privileges of such Partnership Interest.
(c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection
with (i) each issuance of Partnership Interests and Derivative Instruments pursuant to this Section 5.6, (ii) the
conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the issuance of
Common Units pursuant to Section 5.11, (iv) reflecting admission of such additional Limited Partners in the
books and records of
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
39
the Partnership as the Record Holders of such Limited Partner Interests and (v) all additional issuances of
Partnership Interests. The General Partner shall determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the
holders of the Units or other Partnership Interests being so issued. The General Partner shall do all things
necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to
be necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of Partnership Interests or in connection
with the conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including
compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency
or any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to
trading.
(d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership.
Section 5.7 Conversion of Subordinated Units.
(a) All of the Subordinated Units shall convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis on the first Business
Day following the distribution pursuant to Section 6.4(a) in respect of the final Quarter of the Subordination
Period.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all of the then Outstanding Subordinated Units
may convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis as set forth in, and pursuant to the terms of,
Section 11.4.
Section 5.8 Limited Preemptive Right. Except as provided in this Section 5.8 or as otherwise provided in a
separate agreement by the Partnership, no Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar
right with respect to the issuance of any Partnership Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or
hereafter created. The General Partner shall have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or
in part to any of its Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Interests from the Partnership whenever, and on the
same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to Persons other than the General Partner and
its Affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its
Affiliates equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such Partnership Interests.
Section 5.9 Splits and Combinations.
(a) Subject to Section 5.9(d), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to all
Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests so long as, after any such
event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any
amounts calculated on a per
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
40
Unit basis (including any Common Unit Arrearage or Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage) or stated as a
number of Units are proportionately adjusted retroactive to the beginning of the Partnership.
(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests is declared, the General
Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective
and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not
less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent
public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Interests to be held by each Record
Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be
entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such
calculation.
(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue
Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership Interests as of the applicable Record Date representing the
new number of Partnership Interests held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such
other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such
combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Interests Outstanding, the Partnership shall
require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the surrender of any
Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date.
(d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of
Units. If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but
for the provisions of Section 5.6(d) and this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest
whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit).
Section 5.10 Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner Interests. All Limited Partner Interests
issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-
assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be affected by
Section 17-607 or 17-804 of the Delaware Act.
Section 5.11 Issuance of Common Units in Connection with Reset of Incentive Distribution Rights.
(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.11, the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is
more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive
Distribution Rights) shall have the right, at any time when there are no Subordinated Units outstanding and
the Partnership has made a

distribution pursuant to Section 6.4(b)(v) for each of the four most recently completed Quarters, to make an
election (the “IDR Reset Election”) to cause the Target Distributions to be reset in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.11(e) and, in connection therewith, the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution
Rights will become entitled to receive their respective proportionate share of a number of Common Units (the
“IDR Reset Common Units”) derived by dividing (i) the amount of cash distributions made by the Partnership
for the Quarter immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice in respect of the Incentive Distribution
Rights by (ii) the cash distribution made by the Partnership in respect of each Common Unit for the Quarter
immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice (the “Reset MQD”) (the number of Common Units
determined by such quotient is referred to herein as the “Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units”).
The making of the IDR Reset Election in the manner specified in Section 5.11(b) shall cause the Target
Distributions to be reset in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.11(e) and, in connection therewith, the
holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will become entitled to receive Common Units on the
basis specified above, without any further approval required by the General Partner or the Unitholders, at the
time specified in Section 5.11(c) unless the IDR Reset Election is rescinded pursuant to Section 5.11(d).
(b) To exercise the right specified in Section 5.11(a), the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there
is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the
Incentive Distribution Rights) shall deliver a written notice (the “Reset Notice”) to the Partnership. Within 10
Business Days after the receipt by the Partnership of such Reset Notice, the Partnership shall deliver a written
notice to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights of the Partnership’s determination of the
aggregate number of Common Units that each holder of Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to
receive.
(c) The holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to receive the Aggregate Quantity
of IDR Reset Common Units on the fifteenth Business Day after receipt by the Partnership of the Reset Notice;
provided, however, that the issuance of Common Units to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution
Rights shall not occur prior to the approval of the listing or admission for trading of such Common Units by
the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Common Units are then listed or admitted for
trading if any such approval is required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National Securities
Exchange.
(d) If the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Common Units are then traded has not
approved the listing or admission for trading of the Common Units to be issued pursuant to this Section 5.11
on or before the 30th calendar day following the Partnership’s receipt of the Reset Notice and such approval is
required by the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange, then the holder of the Incentive
Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a
majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights) shall have the right to either rescind the IDR Reset
Election or elect to receive other Partnership Interests having such terms as the
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
42
General Partner may approve, with the approval of the Conflicts Committee, that will provide (i) the same
economic value, in the aggregate, as the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units would have had at
the time of the Partnership’s receipt of the Reset Notice, as determined by the General Partner, and (ii) for the
subsequent conversion (on terms acceptable to the National Securities Exchange upon which the Common
Units are then traded) of such Partnership Interests into Common Units within not more than 12 months
following the Partnership’s receipt of the Reset Notice upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions that are
reasonably acceptable to the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of
the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights).
(e) The Target Distributions shall be adjusted at the time of the issuance of Common Units or other
Partnership Interests pursuant to this Section 5.11 such that (i) the Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be
reset to be equal to the Reset MQD, (ii) the First Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 115% of the Reset
MQD, (iii) the Second Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 125% of the Reset MQD and (iv) the Third
Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 150% of the Reset MQD.
(f) Upon the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units pursuant to Section 5.11(a) (or other Partnership Interests
as described in Section 5.11(d), the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Incentive Distribution
Rights shall (A) first, be allocated to IDR Reset Common Units (or other Partnership Interests) in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units (or other Partnership Interests)
and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in
such Capital Account will be retained by the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights. If there is not a
sufficient Capital Account associated with the Incentive Distribution Rights to allocate the full Per Unit Capital
Amount for an Initial Common Unit to the IDR Reset Common Units in accordance with clause (A) of this
Section 5.11(f), the IDR Reset Common Units shall be subject to Sections 6.1(d)(x)(B) and (C).
ARTICLE VI

(i) First, to the Unitholders, Pro Rata; provided, that Net Loss shall not be allocated pursuant to this
Section 6.1(b)(i) to the extent that such allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable period (or increase any existing deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account); and
(ii) The balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.
(c) Net Termination Gains and Losses. Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss for each taxable period
shall be allocated in the manner set forth in this Section 6.1(c). All allocations under this Section 6.1(c) shall
be made after Capital Account balances have been adjusted by all other allocations provided under this
Section 6.1 and after all distributions of cash and cash equivalents provided under Section 6.4 and
Section 6.5 have been made; provided, however , that solely for purposes of this Section 6.1(c), Capital
Accounts shall not be adjusted for distributions made pursuant to Section 12.4.
(i) Except as provided in Section 6.1(c)(iv), Net Termination Gain (including a pro rata part of each item of
income, gain, loss, and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain) shall be allocated:
(A) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net Termination Gain allocated to the General
Partner pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(i)(A) or Section 6.1(c)(iv)(A) and the Net Income allocated to the General
Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i) for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to the aggregate
of the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii) for all previous taxable periods
and the Net Termination Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(D) or Section 6.1(c)
(iii)(B) for all previous taxable periods;

Common Unit then Outstanding is equal to the sum of (1) its Unrecovered Initial Unit Price, (2) the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution for the Quarter during which the Liquidation Date occurs, reduced by any distribution
pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(i) or Section 6.4(b)(i) with respect to such Common Unit for such Quarter (the

(iv); and
(G) Finally, 50% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, and 50% to all Unitholders, Pro

until the Capital Account in respect of each Subordinated Unit then Outstanding has been reduced to zero;
(B) Second, to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of each
Common Unit then Outstanding has been reduced to zero;
(C) Third, to the Unitholders, Pro Rata; provided that Net Termination Loss shall not be allocated pursuant to
this Section 6.1(c)(ii)(C) to the extent such allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in
its Adjusted Capital Account (or increase any existing deficit in its Adjusted Capital Account); and
(D) Fourth, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.
(iii) Any Net Termination Loss deemed recognized pursuant to Section 5.5(d) prior to the Liquidation Date
shall be allocated:
(A) First, to the Unitholders, Pro Rata; provided that Net Termination Loss shall not be allocated pursuant to
this Section 6.1(c)(iii)(A) to the extent such allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in

Capital Account); and
(B) The balance, if any, to the General Partner.
(iv) If a Net Termination Loss has been allocated pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(iii), any subsequent Net
Termination Gain deemed recognized pursuant to Section 5.5(d) prior to the Liquidation Date shall be
allocated:
(A) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate Net Termination Gain allocated to the General Partner
pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(iv)(A) is equal to the aggregate Net Termination Loss previously allocated
pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(iii)(B);
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
46
(B) Second, to the Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the aggregate Net Termination Gain allocated pursuant to this
Section 6.1(c)(iv)(B) is equal to the aggregate Net Termination Loss previously allocated pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(iii)(A); and
(C) The balance, if any, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.1(c)(i).
(d) Special Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, the following special
allocations shall be made for each taxable period:
(i) Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, if there is
a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the
manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or
any successor provision. For purposes of this Section 6.1(d), each Partner’s Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior
to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) with respect to such taxable period
(other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(vi) and Section 6.1(d)(vii)). This Section 6.1(d)(i) is
intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(ii) Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(d)(i)), except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if
there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any
Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall
be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in
the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any
successor provisions. For purposes of this Section 6.1(d), each Partner’s Adjusted Capital Account balance
shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the
application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d), other than Section 6.1(d)(i) and other than
an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(vi) and Section 6.1(d)(vii), with respect to such taxable period. This
Section 6.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(iii) Priority Allocations.
(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed (except cash or property
distributed pursuant to Section 12.4) with
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
47
respect to a Unit for a taxable period exceeds the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property
distributed with respect to another Unit within the same taxable period (the amount of the excess, an “Excess
Distribution” and the Unit with respect to which the greater distribution is paid, an “Excess Distribution
Unit”), then there shall be allocated gross income and gain to each Unitholder receiving an Excess
Distribution with respect to the Excess Distribution Unit until the aggregate amount of such items allocated
with respect to such Excess Distribution Unit pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) for the current taxable
period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the amount of the Excess Distribution.
(B) After the application of Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A), the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for
the taxable period, if any, shall be allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, until the
aggregate amount of such items allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to this
Section 6.1(d)(iii)(B) for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the cumulative
amount of all Incentive Distributions made to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights from the Closing
Date to a date 45 days after the end of the current taxable period.
(iv) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or
distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-
1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an
amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such
adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 6.1(d)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made
as if this Section 6.1(d)(iv) were not in this Agreement.
(v) Gross Income Allocation. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of
any taxable period in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, that an
allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(v) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have a deficit balance in its Capital Account after all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have
been tentatively made as if Section 6.1(d)(iv) and this Section 6.1(d)(v) were not in this Agreement.
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
48
(vi) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners
Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines that the Partnership’s Nonrecourse Deductions should be
allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is authorized to revise the prescribed ratio to the
numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.
(vii) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be
allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse
Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner
Nonrecourse Debt, the Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such Economic Risk of Loss.
(viii) Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree
that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum
Gain and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among the Partners Pro Rata.
(ix) Code Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership
asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as a result of a
distribution to a Partner in complete liquidation of such Partner’s interest in the Partnership, the amount of
such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) taken into account pursuant to Section 5.5,
and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with the
manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury
Regulations.
(x) Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law.
(A) At the election of the General Partner with respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the
termination of the Subordination Period, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income
or gain for such taxable period, after taking into account allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii), shall be
allocated 100% to each Partner holding Subordinated Units that are Outstanding as of the termination of the
Subordination Period (“Final Subordinated Units”) in the proportion of the number of Final Subordinated
Units held by such Partner to the total number of Final Subordinated Units then Outstanding, until each such
Partner has been allocated an amount of gross
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
49
income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Final Subordinated Units
to an amount that after taking into account the other allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction to be
made with respect to such taxable period will equal the product of (A) the number of Final Subordinated Units
held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit. The purpose of this allocation
is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Final Subordinated Units and the Capital
Accounts underlying Common Units held by Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates
immediately prior to the conversion of such Final Subordinated Units into Common Units. This allocation
method for establishing such economic uniformity will be available to the General Partner only if the method
for allocating the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Subordinated Units between the transferred
and retained Subordinated Units pursuant to Section 5.5(c)(ii) does not otherwise provide such economic
uniformity to the Final Subordinated Units.
(B) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership property pursuant
to Section 5.5(d) during any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or after, the issuance of IDR Reset
Common Units pursuant to Section 5.11, after the application of Section 6.1(d)(x)(A), any Unrealized Gains and
Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that to the nearest extent possible
results in the Capital Accounts maintained with respect to such IDR Reset Common Units issued pursuant to
Section 5.11 equaling the product of (A) the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and (B) the Per
Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit.
(C) With respect to any taxable period during which an IDR Reset Unit is transferred to any Person who is not
an Affiliate of the transferor, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for
such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the transferor Partner of such transferred IDR Reset Unit until
such transferor Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital
Account maintained with respect to such transferred IDR Reset Unit to an amount equal to the Per Unit Capital
Amount for an Initial Common Unit.
(D) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited
Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it
deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions;
(ii) make special allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and
(iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of
Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
50
(y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof). The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such
amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.1(d)(x)(D) only if such conventions, allocations
or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes
of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests or the Partnership.
(xi) Curative Allocation.
(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the Required Allocations, the Required
Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the
net amount of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to the
Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that
would have been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations
and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this Section 6.1. In exercising its discretion
under this Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A), the General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that,
although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations previously made. Allocations pursuant
to this Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General
Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among
the Partners.
(B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(xi)
(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) among the Partners in a
manner that is likely to minimize such economic distortions.
(xii) Corrective and Other Allocations. In the event of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
or any Book-Down Event or any recognition of a Net Termination Loss, the following rules shall apply:
(A) Except as provided in Section 6.1(d)(xii)(B), in the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under Section 5.5(d) hereof),
the General Partner shall allocate such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to (1) the holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights to the same extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to them pursuant to Section 5.5(d) and (2) all
Unitholders, Pro Rata, to the extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional
Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to any Unitholders pursuant to Section 5.5(d).
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
51
(B) In the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation of
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under Section 5.5(d) hereof or an allocation of Net Termination Gain or
Net Termination Loss pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof) as a result of a sale or other taxable disposition of any
Partnership asset that is an Adjusted Property (“Disposed of Adjusted Property”), the General Partner shall
allocate (1) additional items of gross income and gain (aa) away from the holders of Incentive Distribution
Rights and (bb) to the Unitholders, or (2) additional items of deduction and loss (aa) away from the
Unitholders and (bb) to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, to the extent that the Additional Book
Basis Derivative Items allocated to the Unitholders exceed their Share of Additional Book Basis Derivative
Items with respect to such Disposed of Adjusted Property. Any allocation made pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)
(xii)(B) shall be made after all of the other Agreed Allocations have been made as if this Section 6.1(d)(xii)
were not in this Agreement and, to the extent necessary, shall require the reallocation of items that have been
allocated pursuant to such other Agreed Allocations.
(C) In the case of any negative adjustments to the Capital Accounts of the Partners resulting from a Book-
Down Event or from the recognition of a Net Termination Loss, such negative adjustment (1) shall first be
allocated, to the extent of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments, in such a manner, as
determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible the aggregate Capital Accounts of the Partners
will equal the amount that would have been the Capital Account balances of the Partners if no prior Book-Up
Events had occurred, and (2) any negative adjustment in excess of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive
Adjustments shall be allocated pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof.
(D) For purposes of this Section 6.1(d)(xii), the Unitholders shall be treated as being allocated Additional Book
Basis Derivative Items to the extent that such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items have reduced the amount
of income that would otherwise have been allocated to the Unitholders under this Agreement. In making the
allocations required under this Section 6.1(d)(xii), the General Partner may apply whatever conventions or
other methodology it determines will satisfy the purpose of this Section 6.1(d)(xii). Without limiting the
foregoing, if an Adjusted Property is contributed by the Partnership to another entity classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “lower tier partnership”), the General Partner may make
allocations similar to those described in Sections 6.1(d)(xii)(A)–(C) to the extent the General Partner
determines such allocations are necessary to account for the Partnership’s allocable share of income, gain,
loss and deduction of the lower tier partnership that relate to the contributed Adjusted Property in a manner
that is consistent with the purpose of this Section 6.1(d)(xii).
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
52
(xiii) Special Curative Allocation in Event of Liquidation Prior to End of Subordination Period.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1 (other than the Required Allocations), if the
Liquidation Date occurs prior to the conversion of the last Outstanding Subordinated Unit, then items of
income, gain, loss and deduction for the taxable period that includes the Liquidation Date (and, if necessary,
items arising in previous taxable periods to the extent the General Partner determines such items may be so
allocated), shall be specially allocated among the Partners in the manner determined appropriate by the
General Partner so as to cause, to the maximum extent possible, the Capital Account in respect of each
Common Unit to equal the amount such Capital Account would have been if all prior allocations of Net
Termination Gain and Net Termination Loss had been made pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section 6.1(c)(ii),
as applicable.
Section 6.2 Allocations for Tax Purposes.
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss
and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of “book”
income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.
(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property,
items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
U.S. federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under Section 704(c) of the
Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined
appropriate by the General Partner (taking into account the General Partner’s discretion under Section 6.1(d)
(x)(D)); provided, that the General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)
in all events.
(c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of an adjustment under
Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the
unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or amortization
method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity of such property, despite any
inconsistency of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations
thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the
General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring
Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based
upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnership’s property. If the
General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
53
method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the
uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as such conventions
would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes
of Limited Partner Interests.
(d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and 1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the
Partners upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this Section 6.2, be characterized as
Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in
interest) have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as
Recapture Income.
(e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined
without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership; provided,
however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General
Partner) to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.
(f) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be
determined for each taxable period and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as
of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to
trading on the first Business Day of each month; provided, however, such items for the period beginning on
the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the month in which the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in
full or the expiration of the Over-Allotment Option occurs shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening
of the National Securities Exchange on which Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the
first Business Day of the next succeeding month; and provided, further, that gain or loss on a sale or other
disposition of any assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction
as determined by the General Partner, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National
Securities Exchange on which Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day
of the month in which such item is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may
revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation to the extent permitted or required by Section 706
of the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.
(g) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the provisions of this Article VI shall
instead be made to the beneficial owner of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which
the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of
the Code or any other method determined by the General Partner.
Section 6.3 Distributions; Characterization of Distributions; Distributions to Record Holders.
(a) The General Partner may adopt a cash distribution policy, which it may change from time to time without
amendment to this Agreement. Distributions will be made as and when declared by the General Partner.
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
54
(b) All amounts of cash and cash equivalents distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source shall
be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of cash and cash equivalents theretofore
distributed by the Partnership to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.4 equals the Operating Surplus from the
Closing Date through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter. Any remaining amounts of cash and
cash equivalents distributed by the Partnership on such date shall, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.5, be deemed to be “Capital Surplus.” All distributions required to be made under this Agreement
or otherwise made by the Partnership shall be made subject to Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware
Act.
(c) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(b), in the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all
Partnership assets shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, Section 12.4.
(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by the Partnership, directly or through
any Transfer Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership
Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full payment and
satisfaction of the Partnership’s liability in respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of any Person

(a) Except with respect to the right to vote on or approve matters requiring the vote or approval of a
percentage of the holders of Outstanding Common Units and the right to participate in allocations of income,
gain, loss and deduction and distributions made with respect to Common Units, the holder of a Subordinated
Unit shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Unitholder holding Common Units hereunder; provided,
however, that immediately upon the conversion of Subordinated Units into Common Units pursuant to
Section 5.7, the Unitholder holding Subordinated Units shall possess all of the rights and obligations of a
Unitholder holding Common Units hereunder with respect to such converted Subordinated Units, including
the right to vote as a Common Unitholder and the right to participate in allocations of income, gain, loss and
deduction and distributions made with respect to Common Units; provided, however, that such converted
Subordinated Units shall remain subject to the provisions of Section 5.5(c)(ii), Section 6.1(d)(x), and
Section 6.7(b) and (c).
(b) A Unitholder shall not be permitted to transfer a Subordinated Unit or a Subordinated Unit that has

(c) The Unitholder holding a Common Unit that has resulted from the conversion of a Subordinated Unit

Units are evidenced by Certificates, and shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Unit to a Person that
is not an Affiliate of the holder until such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel,
that each such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income
tax characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of
an Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.7(c), the General Partner
may take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such Common Units in preparation
for a transfer of such Common Units, including the application of Sections 5.5(c)(ii), 6.1(d)(x) and 6.7(b);

(b) A Unitholder holding an IDR Reset Common Unit shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Unit to a
Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder until such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice
of counsel, that upon transfer each such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic
economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics to the transferee, in all material respects, to the intrinsic
economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit to such transferee. In
connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.8(b), the General Partner may apply Sections 5.5(c)
(iii), 6.1(d)(x) and 6.8(a) or, to the extent not resulting in a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding

Section 6.9 Entity-Level Taxation. If legislation is enacted or the official interpretation of existing legislation is
modified by a governmental authority, which after giving effect to such enactment or modification, results in a
Group Member becoming subject to federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or withholding taxes in excess
of the amount of such taxes due from the Group Member prior to such enactment or modification (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the rate of such taxation applicable to the Group Member), then the
General Partner may, in its sole discretion, reduce the Target Distributions by the amount of income or
withholding taxes that are payable by reason of any such new legislation or interpretation (the “Incremental
Income Taxes”), or any portion thereof selected by the General Partner, in the manner provided in this
Section 6.9. If the General Partner elects to reduce the Target Distributions for any Quarter with respect to all
or a portion of any Incremental Income Taxes, the General Partner shall estimate for such Quarter the
Partnership Group’s aggregate liability (the “Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount”) for all (or the
relevant portion of) such Incremental Income Taxes; provided that any difference between such estimate and
the actual liability for Incremental Income Taxes (or the relevant portion thereof) for such Quarter may, to the
extent determined by the General Partner, be taken into account in determining the Estimated Incremental
Quarterly Tax Amount with respect to each Quarter in which any such difference can be determined. For each
such Quarter, the Target Distributions, shall be the product obtained by multiplying (a) the amounts therefor
that are set out herein prior to the application of this Section 6.9 times (b) the quotient obtained by dividing
(i) cash and cash equivalents with respect to such Quarter by (ii) the sum of cash and cash equivalents with
respect to such Quarter and the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for such Quarter, as determined
by the General Partner. For purposes of the foregoing, cash and cash equivalents with respect to a Quarter
will be deemed reduced by the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for that Quarter.

Partnership Interest or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement, or (b) to constitute a waiver or

direct competition with the business and activities of any Group Member. No such business interest or
activity shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, any fiduciary or other duty existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, or obligation of any type whatsoever to the Partnership or other Group Member, any Partner, any
Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any Person who is otherwise bound by this
Agreement.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any
analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner). No
Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction,
agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership, shall have any duty to
communicate or offer such opportunity to any Group Member, and such Unrestricted Person (including the
General Partner) shall not be liable to the Partnership or any other Group Member, any Partner any person
who acquires a Partnership Interest or any other Person who is otherwise bound by this Agreement for breach

Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all threatened pending or completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and including appeals,
in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason
of its status as an Indemnitee and acting (or refraining to act) in such capacity; provided, that the Indemnitee
shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by
a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is
seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or, in the case of a
criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful. Any indemnification
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the
General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to
contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by an
Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 7.7(a) in appearing at, participating in or defending any
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of
the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized by this Section 7.7.
(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an
Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited
Partner Interests, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both

as to actions in the Indemnitee’s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity, and shall
continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.
(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General Partner or its Affiliates for the cost
of) insurance, on behalf of an Indemnitee and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine,
against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that may be incurred by, such Indemnitee in
connection with the Partnership’s activities or such Indemnitee’s activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Indemnitee against such
liability under the provisions of this Agreement.
(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to
serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership
also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the
plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable
law shall constitute “fines” within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken or omitted by an Indemnitee
with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed
by it to be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a
purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.
(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.
(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.7 because the
Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees and their heirs, successors,
assigns, executors and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any
other Persons.
(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall in any manner
terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the
Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the
Indemnitee acted in bad faith or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee’s
conduct was criminal. In the case where an Indemnitee is liable for damages, those damages shall only be

with the Partnership’s business or affairs shall not be liable, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the
Partnership, the Partners, any Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or is otherwise bound
by this Agreement, for its reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.
(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall be prospective
only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8 as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or
relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless
of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
Section 7.9 Standards of Conduct and Modification of Duties.
(a) Whenever the General Partner, the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors (including
the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any Affiliates
of the General Partner cause the General Partner to do so, in its capacity as the general partner of the
Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then, unless another express standard
is provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, the Board of Directors, such committee or such
Affiliates causing the General Partner to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take such
other action in good faith and shall not be subject to any higher standard contemplated hereby or under the
Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity.

FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

A determination, other action or failure to act by the General Partner, the Board of Directors of the General
Partner or any committee thereof (including the Conflicts Committee) will be deemed to be in good faith
unless the General Partner, the Board of Directors of the General Partner or any committee thereof (including
the Conflicts Committee) believed such determination, other action or failure to act was adverse to the
interests of the Partnership. In any proceeding brought by the Partnership, any Limited Partner, or any Person
who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement
challenging such action, determination or failure to act, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding
shall have the burden of proving that such determination, action or failure to act was not in good faith.
(b) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any
of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner
of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise,
then the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any fiduciary duty or
other duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited
Partner, any other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other Person who
otherwise is bound by this Agreement, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall
not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard
imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any
other law, rule or regulation or at equity. By way of illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrases,
“at the option of the General Partner,” “in its sole discretion” or some variation of those phrases, are used in
this Agreement, it indicates that the General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of
doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership Interests, or refrains from voting or
transferring its Partnership Interests, it shall be acting in its individual capacity.
(c) Whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or any Affiliates, on
the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, any other Person who acquires an
interest in a Partnership Interest or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement on the other hand, the
General Partner may in its discretion submit any resolution or course of action with respect to such conflict of
interest for (i) Special Approval or (ii) approval by the vote of a majority of the Common Units (excluding
Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates). If such course of action or resolution receives
Special Approval or approval of a majority of the Common Units (excluding Common Units owned by the
General Partner and its Affiliates), then such course of action or resolution shall be conclusively deemed
approved by the Partnership, all the Partners, each Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest
and each other Person who is bound by this Agreement, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement,
of any Group Member Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any fiduciary or
other duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise or obligation of any type whatsoever.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General Partner and its Affiliates or any
other Indemnitee shall have no duty or obligation, express or implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any
asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group Member
to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts
entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be in its sole discretion.
(e) The Partners, each Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or is otherwise bound by this
Agreement hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership as a partner or member of a
Group Member, to approve actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member
similar to those actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 7.9.
Section 7.10 Other Matters Concerning the General Partner and Indemnitees.
(a) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may rely upon, and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon, any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.
(b) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers,
management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act
taken or omitted in reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as
to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such Person’s professional or expert
competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance
with such advice or opinion.
(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act
through any of its duly authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly
authorized officers of any Group Member.
Section 7.11 Purchase or Sale of Partnership Interests. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to
purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership Interests. As long as Partnership Interests are held by any Group
Member, such Partnership Interests shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise
provided herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise
acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Interests for its own account, subject to the provisions of
Articles IV and X.

Section 7.12 Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates.
(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner (including for purposes of this Section 7.12,
any Person that is an Affiliate of the General Partner at the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later cease
to be an Affiliate of the General Partner) holds Partnership Interests that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule 144 of
the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is
not available to enable such holder of Partnership Interests (the “Holder”) to dispose of the number of
Partnership Interests it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities
Act, then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall file with the Commission as
promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective date or
such shorter period as shall terminate when all Partnership Interests covered by such registration statement
have been sold, a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the
number of Partnership Interests specified by the Holder; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be
required to effect more than three registrations pursuant to this Section 7.12(a); and provided further,
however, that if the General Partner determines that a postponement of the requested registration would be in
the best interests of the Partnership and its Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation or other
event, the filing of such registration statement or the effectiveness thereof may be deferred for up to six
months, but not thereafter. In connection with any registration pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Partnership shall (i) promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to
register or qualify the securities subject to such registration under the securities laws of such states as the
Holder shall reasonably request; provided, however, that no such qualification shall be required in any
jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject to general service of process or
to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such
jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration, and (B) such documents as may be necessary to apply for
listing or to list the Partnership Interests subject to such registration on such National Securities Exchange as
the Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii) do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of such Partnership Interests in such states.
Except as set forth in Section 7.12(c), all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than
the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.
(b) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act for an
offering of Partnership Interests for cash (other than an offering relating solely to a benefit plan), the
Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to include such number or amount of Partnership
Interests held by any Holder in such registration statement as the Holder shall request; provided, that the
Partnership is not required to make any effort or take any action to so include the Partnership Interests of the
Holder once the registration

statement becomes or is declared effective by the Commission, including any registration statement
providing for the offering from time to time of Partnership Interests pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act.
If the proposed offering pursuant to this Section 7.12(b) shall be an underwritten offering, then, in the event
that the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering advise the Partnership and the
Holder that in their opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holder’s Partnership Interests would adversely
and materially affect the timing or success of the offering, the Partnership shall include in such offering only
that number or amount, if any, of Partnership Interests held by the Holder that, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter or managing underwriters, will not so adversely and materially affect the offering. Except as set
forth in Section 7.12(c), all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the
underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.
(c) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred to in this Section 7.12, the
Partnership shall provide indemnification, representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the
underwriters in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further, in addition to and
not in limitation of the Partnership’s obligation under Section 7.7, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each Person who
controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and any agent thereof (collectively, “Indemnified
Persons”) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this
Section 7.12(c) as a “claim” and in the plural as “claims”) based upon, arising out of or resulting from any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration statement
under which any Partnership Interests were registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or Blue
Sky laws, in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of such registration statement), or
in any summary or final prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
thereto (if used during the period the Partnership is required to keep the registration statement current), or
arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading; provided,
however, that the Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim
arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such registration statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or free
writing prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person specifically for use in the
preparation thereof.
(d) The provisions of Section 7.12(a) and Section 7.12(b) shall continue to be applicable with respect to the
General Partner (and any of the General Partner’s Affiliates) after

it ceases to be a general partner of the Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective
date of such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the Holder to sell all of the Partnership
Interests with respect to which it has requested during such two-year period inclusion in a registration
statement otherwise filed or that a registration statement be filed; provided, however, that the Partnership
shall not be required to file successive registration statements covering the same Partnership Interests for
which registration was demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of Section 7.12(c) shall
continue in effect thereafter.
(e) The rights to cause the Partnership to register Partnership Interests pursuant to this Section 7.12 may be
assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such Partnership
Interests, provided (i) the Partnership is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written
notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the Partnership Interests with respect to
which such registration rights are being assigned; and (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be
bound by and subject to the terms set forth in this Section 7.12.
(f) Any request to register Partnership Interests pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall (i) specify the Partnership
Interests intended to be offered and sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such Person’s present
intent to offer such Partnership Interests for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or method of the proposed
offer and sale of Partnership Interests, and (iv) contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such
information and materials and take all action as may be required in order to permit the Partnership to comply
with all applicable requirements in connection with the registration of such Partnership Interests.

Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner and any officer of the
General Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has
full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the
Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be
entitled to deal with the General Partner or any such officer as if it were the Partnership’s sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or
disaffirm any action of the General Partner or any such officer in connection with any such dealing. In no
event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives be obligated
to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or
expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives. Each and
every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner
or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every

be taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed); (ii) at

own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General
Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the
withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner or managing member, if any, to the extent applicable, of
the other Group Members. If the General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), a
Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The
Person so elected as successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general partner or
managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner is a
general partner or a managing member. If, prior to the effective date of the General Partner’s withdrawal
pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), a successor is not selected by the Unitholders as provided herein or the
Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall be dissolved in
accordance with Section 12.1 unless the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2.
Any successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 10.2.
Section 11.2 Removal of the General Partner. The General Partner may be removed if such removal is
approved by the Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units held by the
General Partner and its Affiliates) voting as a single class. Any such action by such holders for removal of the
General Partner must also provide for the election of a successor General Partner by the Unitholders holding
a majority of the Outstanding Common Units, voting as a class, and a majority of the Outstanding
Subordinated Units, voting as a class (including, in each case, Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates). Such removal shall be effective immediately following the admission of a successor General
Partner pursuant to Section 10.2. The removal of the General Partner shall also automatically constitute the
removal of the General Partner as general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other
Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing member. If a Person is
elected as a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2, such Person shall,
upon admission pursuant to Section 10.2, automatically become a successor general partner or managing
member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner is a general
partner or a managing member. The right of the holders of Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner
shall not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the matters
covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor General Partner elected in accordance with the
terms of this Section 11.2 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.
Section 11.3 Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General Partner.
(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances where such withdrawal does not
violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under
circumstances where Cause does not exist, if the successor
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
79
General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, the Departing General
Partner shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or removal of such
Departing General Partner, to require its successor to purchase its General Partner Interest and its or its
Affiliates’ general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if any, in the other Group Members and all of its or
its Affiliates’ Incentive Distribution Rights (collectively, the “Combined Interest”) in exchange for an amount
in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such amount to be determined and payable
as of the effective date of its withdrawal or removal. If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders
under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under circumstances where such
withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the
terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to
Section 12.2 and the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner), such successor shall have
the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing General
Partner (or, in the event the business of the Partnership is continued, prior to the date the business of the
Partnership is continued), to purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined
Interest. In either event, the Departing General Partner shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due
such Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 7.5, including any employee-related liabilities (including
severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination of any employees employed by the
Departing General Partner or its Affiliates (other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or
the other Group Members.
For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of the Combined Interest shall be determined by
agreement between the Departing General Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after
the effective date of such Departing General Partner’s withdrawal or removal, by an independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing General Partner and its successor, which,
in turn, may rely on other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If
such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other independent expert within
45 days after the effective date of such withdrawal or removal, then the Departing General Partner shall
designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing General
Partner’s successor shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, and
such firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or independent
expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert shall determine the fair
market value of the Combined Interest. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert may consider the value of the Units, including the then current
trading price of Units on any National Securities Exchange on which Units are then listed or admitted to
trading, the value of the Partnership’s assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing General Partner, the
value of the Incentive Distribution Rights and the General Partner Interest and other factors it may deem
relevant.
(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in Section 11.3(a), the Departing General
Partner (and its Affiliates, if applicable) shall become a Limited
HI-CRUSH PARTNERS LP
FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
80
Partner and the Combined Interest shall be converted into Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an
investment banking firm or other independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without reduction
in such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of the admission of its
successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify the Departing General Partner as to all debts and
liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which the Departing General Partner becomes a
Limited Partner. For purposes of this Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest to Common Units will
be characterized as if the Departing General Partner (and its Affiliates, if applicable) contributed the Combined
Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Common Units.
(c) If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if
the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the successor General Partner is
not the former General Partner) and the option described in Section 11.3(a) is not exercised by the party
entitled to do so, the successor General Partner shall, at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership,
contribute to the Partnership cash in the amount equal to the product of (x) the quotient obtained by dividing
(A) the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of the Departing General Partner by (B) a percentage
equal to 100% less the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of the Departing General Partner and
(y) the Net Agreed Value of the Partnership’s assets on such date. In such event, such successor General
Partner shall, subject to the following sentence, be entitled to its Percentage Interest of all Partnership
allocations and distributions to which the Departing General Partner was entitled. In addition, the successor
General Partner shall cause this Agreement to be amended to reflect that, from and after the date of such
successor General Partner’s admission, the successor General Partner’s interest in all Partnership
distributions and allocations shall be its Percentage Interest.
Section 11.4 Termination of Subordination Period, Conversion of Subordinated Units and Extinguishment of
Cumulative Common Unit Arrearages. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, if the General Partner
is removed as general partner of the Partnership under circumstances where Cause does not exist:
(a) the Subordinated Units held by any Person will immediately and automatically convert into Common Units
on a one-for-one basis, provided (i) neither such Person nor any of its Affiliates voted any of its Units in favor
of the removal and (ii) such Person is not an Affiliate of the successor General Partner; and
(b) if all of the Subordinated Units convert into Common Units pursuant to Section 11.4(a), all Cumulative
Common Unit Arrearages on the Common Units will be extinguished and the Subordination Period will end;
provided, however, that such converted Subordinated Units shall remain subject to the provisions of
Section 5.5(c)(ii), Section 6.1(d)(x), Section 6.7(b) and Section 6.7(c).

Section 11.5 Withdrawal of Limited Partners. No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the
Partnership; provided, however, that when a transferee of a Limited Partner’s Limited Partner Interest
becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring Limited Partner
shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.
ARTICLE XII
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION
Section 12.1 Dissolution. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of additional Limited
Partners or by the admission of a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Upon the removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner is elected pursuant to
Section 11.1, Section 11.2 or Section 12.2, the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such successor General
Partner is hereby authorized to, and shall, continue the business of the Partnership. Subject to Section 12.2,
the Partnership shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon:
(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in Section 11.1(a) (other than Section 11.1(a)(ii)),
unless a successor is elected and such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement;
(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is approved by a Unit Majority;
(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware
Act; or
(d) at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the Partnership is continued without dissolution in
accordance with the Delaware Act.
Section 12.2 Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After Dissolution. Upon (a) an Event of
Withdrawal caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as provided in Section 11.1(a)(i) or
(iii) and the failure of the Partners to select a successor to such Departing General Partner pursuant to
Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, then within 90 days thereafter, or (b) an event constituting an Event of
Withdrawal as defined in Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi), then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within
180 days thereafter, a Unit Majority may elect to continue the business of the Partnership on the same terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement by appointing as a successor General Partner a Person approved
by a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time period as set forth above, the
Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made, then:
(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier dissolved in accordance with this Article
XII;

FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
82
(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then the interest of the former General
Partner shall be treated in the manner provided in Section 11.3; and
(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as General Partner, effective as of the
Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in writing to be bound by this Agreement; provided, that the right of a Unit
Majority to approve a successor General Partner and to continue the business of the Partnership shall not
exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the
exercise of the right would not result in the loss of limited liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited
Partner and (y) neither the Partnership nor any Group Member would be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of
such right to continue (to the extent not already so treated or taxed).
Section 12.3 Liquidator. Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to Section 12.2, the General Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator.
The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its
services as may be approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units and
Subordinated Units, voting as a single class. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not
to resign at any time without 15 days’ prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by
notice of removal approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units and
Subordinated Units, voting as a single class. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a
successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the
original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units and Subordinated Units, voting as a single class. The right to approve a
successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such
successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in
this Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without
further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the General
Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and
otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in Section 7.4)
necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the
period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein.

Section 12.4 Liquidation. The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership, discharge
its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the
Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:
(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners
on such terms as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind,
the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received cash equal
to its fair market value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the
other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership’s assets for a
reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnership’s
assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the
Partnership’s assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would
cause undue loss to the Partners.
(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such
capacity (subject to the terms of Section 12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their
distribution rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured
or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it
thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its payment. When paid, any
unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as additional liquidation proceeds.
(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b)
shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in their
respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other
than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable period of the
Partnership during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made
by the end of such taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence).
Section 12.5 Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership. Upon the completion of the distribution of
Partnership cash and property as provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited
partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may
be necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.
Section 12.6 Return of Contributions. The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return
of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

Section 12.7 Waiver of Partition. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any
right to partition of the Partnership property.
Section 12.8 Capital Account Restoration. No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative
balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to
restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its interest in the Partnership by the
end of the taxable period of the Partnership during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days
after the date of such liquidation.

(d) a change that the General Partner determines (i) does not adversely affect the Limited Partners (including
any particular class of Partnership Interests as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests) in any

asset” regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
regardless of whether such are substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed
by the United States Department of Labor;
(g) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the
creation, authorization or issuance of any class or series of Partnership Interests and Derivative Instruments

Section 13.2 Amendment Procedures. Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by the General
Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose
or approve any amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so in its sole discretion, and, in
declining to propose or approve an amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by law shall not be required to
act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation or at equity. An amendment shall be effective upon its approval by the General Partner and, except
as otherwise provided by Section 13.1 or 13.3, a Unit Majority, unless a greater or different percentage is
required under this Agreement or by Delaware law. Each proposed amendment that requires the approval of
the holders of a specified percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains the text
of the proposed amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek the written
approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or call a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and
vote on such proposed amendment. The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption
of any amendments. The General Partner shall be deemed to have notified all Record Holders as required by
this Section 13.2 if it has either (i) filed such amendment with the Commission via its Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system and such amendment is publicly available on such system or
(ii) made such amendment available on any publicly available website maintained by the Partnership
Section 13.3 Amendment Requirements.
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no provision of this Agreement (other
than Section 11.2 or Section 13.4) that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units (including Units deemed
owned by the General Partner) or requires a vote or approval of Partners (or a subset of Partners) holding a
specified Percentage Interest required to take any action shall be amended, altered, changed, repealed or
rescinded in any respect that would have the effect of reducing or increasing such percentage, unless such
amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of holders of Outstanding Units whose
aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced or
increased, as applicable, or the affirmative vote of Partners whose aggregate Percentage Interests constitute
not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced or increased, as applicable.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no amendment to this Agreement may
(i) enlarge the obligations of (including requiring any holder of a class of Partnership Interests to make
additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership) any Limited Partner without its consent, unless such shall
be deemed to have occurred as a result of an amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c), or (ii) enlarge
the obligations of, restrict, change or modify in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the
amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to, the General Partner or any of its Affiliates
without its consent, which consent may be given or withheld at its option.

(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3 or Section 13.1, any amendment that would have a material adverse
effect on the rights or preferences of any class of Partnership Interests in relation to other classes of
Partnership Interests must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Partnership Interests of the class affected. If the General Partner determines an amendment does not satisfy
the requirements of Section 13.1(d)(i) because it adversely affects one or more classes of Partnership
Interests, as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests, in any material respect, such amendment
shall only be required to be approved by the adversely affected class or classes.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for amendments pursuant to Section 13.1
and except as otherwise provided by Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the
approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Percentage Interests of all Limited Partners voting as a single
class unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment will not affect
the limited liability of any Limited Partner under applicable partnership law of the state under whose laws the
Partnership is organized.
(e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be amended with the approval of Partners
(including the General Partner and its Affiliates) holding at least 90% of the Percentage Interests of all Limited
Partners.
Section 13.4 Special Meetings. All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be
taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. Special meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by
the General Partner or by Limited Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Units of the class or
classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the
General Partner one or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to call a
special meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for which the special meeting is to be called.
Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be
reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements
or similar requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at such a
meeting, the General Partner shall send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or
indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be held at a time and place determined by the General
Partner on a date not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the time notice of the meeting is given as
provided in Section 16.1. Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the Limited Partners to
be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so
as to jeopardize the Limited Partners’ limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in
which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

Section 13.5 Notice of a Meeting. Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall be given to the
Record Holders of the class or classes of Units for which a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other
means of written communication in accordance with Section 16.1. The notice shall be deemed to have been
given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication.
Section 13.6 Record Date. For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the
General Partner may set a Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a) the
date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of
any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading or U.S. federal
securities laws, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities
Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a
meeting, the date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General Partner to give such
approvals. If the General Partner does not set a Record Date, then (a) the Record Date for determining the
Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners shall be the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, and (b) the Record Date for determining
the Limited Partners entitled to give approvals without a meeting shall be the date the first written approval is
deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner in accordance with Section 13.11.
Section 13.7 Adjournment. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of
the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At
the adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII.
Section 13.8 Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes. The transaction of business at any
meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had
occurred at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by
proxy. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except
when the Limited Partner attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and
except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of matters
required to be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made
at the meeting.

Section 13.9 Quorum and Voting. The holders of a majority, by Percentage Interest, of Partnership Interests of
the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Partnership Interests deemed owned by
the General Partner) represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Partners of
such class or classes unless any such action by the Partners requires approval by holders of a greater
Percentage Interest, in which case the quorum shall be such greater Percentage Interest. At any meeting of
the Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of
Partners holding Partnership Interests that, in the aggregate, represent a majority of the Percentage Interest of
those present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all Partners,
unless a greater or different percentage is required with respect to such action under the provisions of this
Agreement, in which case the act of the Partners holding Partnership Interests that in the aggregate represent
at least such greater or different percentage shall be required; provided, however, that if, as a matter of law or
amendment to this Agreement, approval by plurality vote of Partners (or any class thereof) is required to
approve any action, no minimum quorum shall be required. The Partners present at a duly called or held
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by Partners holding the required Percentage Interest specified in this Agreement. In the absence of
a quorum any meeting of Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of Partners with
at least a majority, by Percentage Interest, of the Partnership Interests entitled to vote at such meeting
(including Partnership Interests deemed owned by the General Partner) represented either in person or by
proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.
Section 13.10 Conduct of a Meeting. The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the
manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including
the determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements
of Section 13.4, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and the determination of any
controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the meeting or voting. The General
Partner shall designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a Person to
take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by
the General Partner. The General Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and
this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or
solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the
appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and
other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in writing.

Section 13.11 Action Without a Meeting. If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting, without a vote and without prior notice, if an
approval in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the
minimum percentage, by Percentage Interest, of the Partnership Interests of the class or classes for which a
meeting has been called (including Partnership Interests deemed owned by the General Partner), as the case
may be, that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all the Limited
Partners entitled to vote at such meeting were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or
admitted to trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities
Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited
Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot submitted
to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership
within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a ballot
returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Units held by the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall
be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any
action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the
written approvals shall have no force and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in
care of the General Partner and (b) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the effect that
the exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not
cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and
affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners’ limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise
permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the
Partners. Nothing contained in this Section 13.11 shall be deemed to require the General Partner to solicit all
Limited Partners in connection with a matter approved by the holders of the requisite percentage of Units
acting by written consent without a meeting.
(a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set pursuant to Section 13.6 shall
be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to
which the holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to act. All references in this Agreement to
votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the
votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.
(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Person’s account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer,
bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units
are registered, such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Units on any matter,
and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the
direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume it is so
acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this
Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

Section 13.12 Voting of Incentive Distribution Rights.
(a) For so long as a majority of the Incentive Distribution Rights are held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates, the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall not be entitled to vote such Incentive
Distribution Rights on any Partnership matter except as may otherwise be required by law and the holders of
the Incentive Distribution Rights, in their capacity as such, shall be deemed to have approved any matter
approved by the General Partner.
(b) If less than a majority of the Incentive Distribution Rights are held by the General Partner and its Affiliates,
the Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Unitholders,
other than amendments and other matters that the General Partner determines do not adversely affect the
holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights as a whole in any material respect. On any matter in which the
holders of Incentive Distribution Rights are entitled to vote, such holders will vote together with the
Subordinated Units, prior to the end of the Subordination Period, or together with the Common Units,
thereafter, in either case as a single class except as otherwise required by Section 13.3(c), and such Incentive
Distribution Rights shall be treated in all respects as Subordinated Units or Common Units, as applicable,
when sending notices of a meeting of Limited Partners to vote on any matter (unless otherwise required by
law), calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes under
this Agreement. The relative voting power of the Incentive Distribution Rights and the Subordinated Units or
Common Units, as applicable, will be set in the same proportion as cumulative cash distributions, if any, in
respect of the Incentive Distribution Rights for the four consecutive Quarters prior to the record date for the
vote bears to the cumulative cash distributions in respect of such class of Units for such four Quarters.
(c) In connection with any equity financing, or anticipated equity financing, by the Partnership of an
Expansion Capital Expenditure, the General Partner may, without the approval of the holders of the Incentive
Distribution Rights, temporarily or permanently reduce the amount of Incentive Distributions that would
otherwise be distributed to such holders, provided that in the judgment of the General Partner, such reduction
will be in the long-term best interest of such holders.

the Outstanding Units or of any class of Limited Partners, in which case such greater percentage vote or
consent shall be required for approval of the Merger Agreement.

assets to, another limited liability entity that shall be newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or
operations at the time of such merger or conveyance other than those it receives from the Partnership or other
Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the merger or conveyance,
as the case may be, would not result in the loss of the limited liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited
Partner or cause the Partnership or any Group Member to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not
already treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose of such merger, or conveyance is to effect a mere change in the

another entity if (A) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the merger or consolidation,
as the case may be, would not result in the loss of the limited liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited
Partner or cause the Partnership or any Group Member to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not

Merger Agreement, a certificate of merger shall be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of

ARTICLE XV
RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS
Section 15.1 Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time the General Partner and its Affiliates
hold more than 80% of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding, the General Partner
shall then have the right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in part to the Partnership or any
Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable in its sole discretion, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such
Limited Partner Interests of such class then Outstanding held by Persons other than the General Partner and
its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market Price as of the date three days prior to the date that the
notice described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such class purchased during the 90-day period preceding
the date that the notice described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed.
(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the Partnership elects to exercise the right to
purchase Limited Partner Interests granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the General Partner shall deliver to the
Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the “Notice of Election to Purchase”) and shall cause the
Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited Partner
Interests of such class (as of a Record Date selected by the General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60,
days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be published for a period of at
least three consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers of general circulation printed in the English
language and published in the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall
specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which Limited
Partner Interests will be purchased and state that the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the
case may be, elects to purchase such Limited Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing
such Limited Partner Interests in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, in exchange
for

FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
96
payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be
required by any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed or admitted
to trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at
his address as reflected in the records of the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been
given regardless of whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited Partner Interests to be purchased
in accordance with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly given as
aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the deposit
described in the preceding sentence has been made for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests
subject to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered for purchase, all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner
Interests shall thereupon cease, except the right to receive the purchase price (determined in accordance with
Section 15.1(a)) for Limited Partner Interests therefor, without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of
the Certificates representing such Limited Partner Interests in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced
by Certificates, and such Limited Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record books of the Transfer Agent and the
Partnership, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case
may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests from and after the Purchase
Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such Limited Partner Interests.
(c) In the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, at any time from and after the Purchase
Date, a holder of an Outstanding Limited Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1
may surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the Transfer Agent in exchange for
payment of the amount described in Section 15.1(a), therefor, without interest thereon.

demand, request, report or proxy materials shall be deemed given or made when delivered or made available
via such mode of delivery. An affidavit or certificate of making of any notice, payment or report in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 16.1 executed by the General Partner, the Transfer Agent or the mailing
organization shall be prima facie evidence of the giving or making of such notice, payment or report. If any
notice, payment or report given or made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 16.1 is returned
marked to indicate that such notice, payment or report was unable to be delivered, such notice, payment or
report and, in the case of notices, payments or reports returned by the United States Postal Service (or other
physical mail delivery mail service outside the United States of America), any subsequent notices, payments
and reports shall be deemed to have been duly given or made without further mailing (until such time as such
Record Holder or another Person notifies the Transfer Agent or the Partnership of a change in his address) or
other delivery if they are available for the Partner at the principal office of the Partnership for a period of one
year from the date of the giving or making of such notice, payment or report to the other Partners. Any notice
to the Partnership shall be deemed given if received by the General Partner at the principal office of the
Partnership designated pursuant to Section 2.3. The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in
relying on any notice or other document from a Partner or other Person if believed by it to be genuine.
(b) The terms “in writing”, “written communications,” “written notice” and words of similar import shall be
deemed satisfied under this Agreement by use of e-mail and other forms of electronic communication.

take or refrain from taking action as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this
Agreement.

thereof shall constitute waiver of any such breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

rights and remedies hereunder as a third-party beneficiary hereto with respect to those provisions of this

constitute an agreement binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding that all such parties are not
signatories to the original or the same counterpart. Each party shall become bound by this Agreement

pursuant to Section 10.1(a) without execution hereof.

claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court located
