<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on 
their activities (see Appendix).   
2.  In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders decided 
that a joint communications report would be prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with 
this decision being reconfirmed by the seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 
2010 in order to avoid duplication, rationalize documentation, allow examination of cross 
cutting issues and ensure that the content of communications and any follow-up would feed 
into the universal periodic review mechanism more effectively. Mandate holders decided 
that the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information 
(A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27).  
3. The Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights 
Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain 
information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and 
encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper 
(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 29 and 60).  
4.  Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other entity 
are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are 
accessible electronically through hyperlinks. Communications are reproduced in the 
language in which they were sent.  Replies received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are 
included with translations into English, where available.  
</p>
<p>5. This report covers all urgent appeals, letters of allegations and other letters sent by 
special procedures mandate holders between 1 June and 30 November 2013 and replies 
received between 1 August 2013 and 31 January 2014. Communications sent before 1 June 
2013 are reported in A/HRC/24/21, A/HRC/23/51, A/HRC/22/67, A/HRC/22/67 corr.1 and 
corr.2, A/HRC/21/49, A/HRC/20/30, A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/18/51 respectively. 
</p>
<p>6. The report also includes replies received between 1 August 2013 and 31 January 
2014, relating to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 June 
2013. Some of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by the 
respective State.   
</p>
<p>7. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint 
urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates. It does not contain other types of 
communications issued by these mandates, which are processed according to their own 
distinctive procedures, and are reported in the annual reports of these two working groups. 
</p>
<p>8. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their 
privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of victims who would otherwise have 
their identities protected are mentioned only when the concerned individual has expressly 
consented or requested to have his or her name in the public report. In the original 
communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the Government 
concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been darkened in State 
replies to preserve the presumption of innocence. 
</p>
<p>9. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have 
been used, reflecting all communications sent between 1 June and 30 November 2013, and 
responses received in relation to these communications up to 31 January 2014. </p>

<p>Alleged incidents of excessive violence against indigenous peoples in the states of 
Mato Grosso do Sul and Par&#225;, including the alleged killing of an indigenous person by 
police authorities. According to the information received, on 30 May 2013, police in 
Mato Grosso do Sul engaged in a forcible eviction of approximately 1000 indigenous 
Terena people who for two weeks had occupied a piece of land in the locality of 
Buriti, officially titled to a private landowner. The land in question is located in an 
area that the Ministry of Justice had reportedly determined to be indigenous territory. 
One Terena indigenous man, Mr Oziel Gabriel, was allegedly killed by police gunfire, 
several others were wounded and ten indigenous people were arrested. Allegations 
have also been received about the imminent eviction of approximately 150-170 
indigenous Kayapo, Arara, Munduruku and Xipaia persons who, since 27 May 2013, 
had occupied one of the construction sites of the Belo Monte dam in the state of Par&#225;.

<p>Allegations of harassment and arrest of activists and political leaders participating in 
demonstrations following the conclusion of the last national elections on 5 May 2013. 
According to the information received, on 17 May 2013, a leader of the opposition 
People&#8217;s Justice Party and deputy to the Selangor State Assembly Mr Nik Nazmi was 
charged under the Peaceful Assembly Act. On 18 May 2013, student activist Mr 
Adam Adli was arrested in Kuala Lumpur. On 23 May 2013, he was charged under 
the Sedition Act 1948, for allegedly uttering a seditious statement during a public 
forum on 13 May. He was released on bail on the same day, pending a court hearing 
set for 2 July. A candlelight vigil that was held on 22 May 2013 to call for the release 
of Mr Adam Adli resulted in the arrest of 18 participants, who were also questioned 
by the police. On 29 May, authorities allegedly re-arrested opposition Member of the 
Parliament Mr Tian Chua, opposition PAS Islamic Party member, Mr Tamrin Bin 
Abdul Ghafar and civil society activist, Mr Haris Ibrahim along with student activist 
Mr Safwan Anang, under the same Sedition Act in Kuala Lumpur.

<p>Alleged torture and ill-treatment of Mr Shawki Ahmad Sharif Omar by US officials in 
Iraq. According to the information received, in October 2004, Mr Omar was arrested 
along with his then pregnant wife by US soldiers in Baghdad in Al Zayouna district. 
Upon arrest, he was allegedly held incommunicado for two weeks. During 
interrogation sessions he was allegedly repeatedly subjected to electric shocks and 
simulations of drowning. He was then reportedly transferred to Camp Cropper (today 
known as Karkh Prison) and further to Abu Ghraib Prison (reopened as Baghdad 
Central Prison) with a period of several months of detention in the US army base 
Camp Bucca close to Umm Qasr in the south of Iraq. It is reported that, while still 
being held in US-controlled facilities, he was sentenced to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment for 
illegal entry into Iraq following an allegedly grossly unfair trial before the Central 
Criminal Court in Iraq on 24 June 2010. In July2011 Mr Omar was reportedly handed 
over to the Iraqi authorities and taken to Karkh Prison.

treatment. At the time of writing, all aforementioned individuals remained at risk of 
imminent execution.

<p>Alleged severe torture and ill-treatment upon arrest and during interrogation. 
According to the information received, Mr X, a 16 year-old minor and resident of 
Hares, Salfit, in the State of Palestine was arrested on 17 March 2013 by members of 
the Israeli Security Forces (ISF). It is alleged that during transport Mr X was 
repeatedly pushed, kicked, and hit on the head by ISF, and that in one instance a 
soldier tried to sit on his head. It is further reported that the soldiers smashed Mr X&#8217;s 
head against an iron box, causing bleeding, and stuffed a piece of cotton and a 
bandage into his mouth. Furthermore, it is reported that during interrogation an officer 
attempted to coerce a confession from Mr X by repeatedly threatening to cut off his 
head, bring in his mother for interrogation, cause difficulties for Mr X&#8217;s family at 
checkpoints, and hold him responsible for other accusations. It is additionally reported 
that Mr X was held in solitary confinement. Until 21 March 2013, neither his lawyer 
nor his family were informed about the fate and whereabouts of Mr X, and the first 
family visit only was scheduled for 11 June 2013.

<p>Allegations concerning the increasing number of state-level regulations that restrict 
the religious freedoms of Native American prisoners. According to the information 
received, indigenous peoples in the United States face high rates of imprisonment with 
an approximate 29,700 Native Americans incarcerated in prisons across the country as 
of 2011. Reportedly, while in prison, a significant number of Native Americans rely 
upon their freedom to carry out traditional religious practices for rehabilitation 
purposes and as a means to maintain their identity as members of indigenous peoples. 
However, numerous recent regulations in state correctional facilities have allegedly 
restricted Native American prisoners from engaging in traditional religious practices 
and possessing religious items. It is further alleged that the majority of these 
regulations are modified or created without meaningful consultation with Native 
Americans beyond processes for general public comment.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution of two prisoners on death row before available 
appeal procedures have been completed. According to the information received, the 
execution may take place on 7 June 2013. On that date the Federal High Court in 
Benin City, Nigeria, was expected to deliver its judgment in relation to a lawsuit filed 
on 19 October 2012 by Nigerian NGOs Human Rights, Social Development and 
Environmental Foundation (HURSDEF) and Legal Defence and Assistance Project 
(LEDAP) seeking to halt the execution. Reportedly, arrangements were made by the 
prison authorities for the executions by hanging to take place as soon as the judgment 
is delivered. Also it is alleged that since both individuals were convicted of murder, 
their capital punishments were mandatory. The two prisoners were the subject of an 
urgent appeal, dated 6 November 2012 (A/HRC/22/67).

<p>Alleged deportation by the Italian authorities in violation of the principle of non-
refoulement and due process guarantees. According to the information received, while 
searching for Mr Mukhtar Ablyazov, a national from Kazakhstan who was granted 
asylum in the United Kingdom, the Italian police arrested his wife, Ms Alma 
Shalabayeva, for possession of a forged diplomatic passport. Two days after her arrest 
Ms Alma Shalabayeva was reportedly deported from Italy to Kazakhstan together 
with her 6-year-old daughter. Allegedly, while moving quickly to deport Ms 
Shalabayeva and her daughter, the Italian authorities violated Italian legislation on 
immigration and her due process rights. In particular, while in detention Ms 
Shalabayeva&#8217;s lawyers did not have access to her, and she was not provided with an 
interpreter.

<p>Allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Congolese nationals after their forcible

(DRC). According to the information received, Congolese nationals face continuous 
and pervasive intimidation, harassment, torture and re-arrest upon return to the DRC 
after failed asylum attempts in the UK. The conditions they face are allegedly contrary 
to the Country of Origin Information Report (March 2012), the Country Policy 
Bulleting (November 2012) and the Operational Guidance Note (May 2012) 
developed by the UK Boarder Agency (UKBA) in order to assess the appropriateness 
of returning failed asylum seekers to their home countries.  According to the 
allegations, these documents, which are used in decision making processes, 
inaccurately designate the DRC as a safe place to return refused asylum seekers, and 
on the basis of this designation, many Congolese are returned to unsafe conditions.

<p>Alleged incommunicado detention of one human rights defender and alleged arbitrary 
arrests and excessive use of force by the police against eight other human rights 
defenders. According to the information received, on 27 May 2013, the police arrested 
nine members of the Movimiento Revolucionarion (Revolutionary Movement): 
Messrs. Emiliano Catumbela &#8220;Ticreme&#8221;, Manuel Nito Alves, Albano Bingo, Nicola, 
Domingos Cipriano &#8220;Aristocrata&#8221;, Adolfo Miguel Campos Andr&#233;, Graciano, Ferbern 
and Raul Lindo &#8220;Mandela&#8221;. At the time of their arrest, the above-mentioned members 
were participating in a vigil in the centre of Luanda to commemorate the one-year 
anniversary since the disappearance of two human rights defenders.  The police 
reportedly released 8 of them after several hours. After his release, Mr Lindo, was 
allegedly found unconscious by the side of a road. To date, Mr Catumbela is 
reportedly detained, injured, and denied access to his legal representative and family. 
Mr Catumbela&#8217;s charges allegedly include the attempted murder of a police officer 
and throwing stones at the police. A number of the above mentioned individuals were 
mentioned in a previous communication dated 26 April 2013 (A/HRC/24/21).

India granted concessions to the multi-national steel corporation, Pohang Iron and 
Steel Corporation (POSC), based in the Republic of Korea, for the construction of an 
integrated steel plant and a captive port, which could force up to 20,000 people to

would result in serious violations of human rights, including the right to adequate 
standard of living, food, adequate housing, water and sanitation, health and education.

superintendent of Iran&#8217;s AOG churches. On the same day, authorities allegedly raided 
Pastor Asserian&#8217;s house and confiscated some of his belongings, including computer 
equipment and books. They reportedly arrested him while he was leading a prayer 
meeting at the church. Prior to his arrest, on 23 December 2011, the police had 
arrested four other leaders of AOG Church in Ahwaz, including Pastor Farhad 
Sabokrouh, his wife Shahnaz Jeizan, Minister Naser Zamen Dezfuli, and Minister

<p>Alleged risk of eviction and forced displacement of a large number of Arab Bedouins 
in the Naqab (Negev) desert in the south of Israel. According to the information 
received, the &#8220;Law for the Regulation of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev- 2013&#8221;, a 
bill also known as the Prawer-Begin Bill, to be enacted into law in the coming days 
would lead to the eviction and forced displacement of more than 70,000 Arab 
Bedouins in the Naqab (Negev) desert in the south of Israel. Allegedly this would 
mean the destruction of most of the remaining unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages in 
this region. Concerns also include severance of the historical ties to land by the 
Bedouin community, strict limits and conditions to access and receive adequate 
compensation whether in money or land, and the use of force in the form of the 
deployment of additional police officers in charge of the implementation of this Plan.

Rohingya women. According to information received, a crowd of approximately 40 to 
50 mostly Rohingya women gathered in their village of Pa Rein in Rakhine State to 
protest against the construction of new temporary housing. Following the reported 
refusal of the protestors to leave the construction site, security forces allegedly fired 
shots into the air and directly into the crowd. In addition to the three women 
reportedly killed by the shots, three men and two women were injured by the gunfire.

<p>Alleged imposition of the death penalty after proceedings which did not comply with 
international human rights law standards of fair trial and due process guarantees. 
According to the information received, Mr William Van Poyck, aged 58, was 
convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1988. In 1990, the Florida Supreme 
Court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to find Mr Van Poyck guilty of first-
degree premeditated murder. However, reportedly, the Court said that Mr Van 
Poyck&#8217;s role in a crime, in which he should have known lethal force could be used, 
made the death sentence proportional. Reportedly, the appeal courts rejected the claim 
that Mr Van Poyck&#8217;s legal representation at trial was constitutionally inadequate. 
Allegedly, Mr Van Poyck has spent more than 25 years on death row. He was 
scheduled to be executed on 12 June 2013. On 3 June 2013, Mr Van Poyck&#8217;s lawyers 
petitioned the Florida Supreme Court in an attempt to win a stay of execution. 
Reportedly at the time of transmitting this communication the Court had not yet ruled 
on the petition.

<p>Alleged lack of effective protection provided to demonstrators during the International 
Day against Homophobia and subsequent threats made against members of an LGBT 
organization. According to the information received, on 17 May 2013, LGBT human 
rights defenders, including members of the organization Identoba, planned a 
demonstration, on the occasion of the International Day against Homophobia. The 
rally was supposed to start outside the former Parliament building. However, counter-
protestors bearing banners with homophobic slogans reportedly occupied the space an 
hour earlier, and forced LGBT defenders to move to a nearby square. Following the 
start of the demonstration, counter-demonstrators, who included Orthodox priests, 
broke the police line and entered the square. The police escorted the LGBT activists 
into municipal buses and drove away. In their attempt to reach the buses, twenty-eight 
people were reportedly injured. Before and after the rally members of Identoba 
received threats and one of them was reportedly held at gunpoint on 25 May 2013.

<p>Allegations of violent dispersal by law enforcement authorities of peaceful 
demonstrations organized by Kamlari activists in Nepal. According to the information 
received, from 31 May to 4 June, the police violently dispersed a series of peaceful 
protests held in Kathmandu, Dang, Kailai and Kanchanpur. The mentioned protests 
were organized by freed Kamlari activists to ensure accountability for the killing of a 
12-year old Kamlari girl in Dang in March 2013. Moreover, Kamlari activists were 
protesting more generally against the Kamaiya traditional system of bonded labour in 
place in several parts of Nepal. In the course of the police operations, police officers 
injured many and sexually assaulted some protestors. The police also detained groups 
of protestors for several hours.

<p>Alleged restrictions on the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly of 
groups defending the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT). 
According to the information received, Nigeria&#8217;s House of Representatives 
unanimously approved the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Bill on 30 May 2013. If 
signed into law by the President, the Bill would put a wide range of people at risk of 
criminal sanctions. The Bill allows for sentencing to up to ten years of imprisonment 
anyone who &#8220;registers, operates or participates in gay clubs, societies or 
organizations&#8221; or &#8220;witnesses&#8221;, &#8220;aids&#8221; or &#8220;abets&#8221; same-sex relationships. If passed, this 
Bill could be used to prevent LGBT individuals, those perceived as belonging to any 
of these groups, and those that support them, from freely associating or assembling. If 
signed into law, the Bill could also penalize human rights defenders and activists who 
seek to stand up for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people in 
Nigeria.

<p>Alleged implementation of a law leading to arbitrary and undue restrictions on the

received, the implementation of the Law on Introducing Amendments to Legislative 
Acts of the Russian Federation in Part Regulating Activities of Non-commercial 
Organizations which Carry Functions of Foreign Agents, which was adopted on 21 
November 2012, leads to arbitrary and undue restrictions on the enjoyment of the 
right to freedom of association, particularly of NGOs working on human rights issues, 
including reported cases of reprisals for cooperating or having cooperated with the 
United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights.

<p>Allegations of excessive use of force during peaceful protests. According to the 
information received, on 28 May 2013, a few hundred protesters gathered at Gezi Park 
in Taksim, Istanbul, to peacefully demonstrate against the municipal urban re-
development plan for the area. It is reported that police violently dispersed protesters 
through widespread and indiscriminate use of tear gas. Following the violent reaction 
of the police in Istanbul, since 31 May 2013, hundreds of thousands of people have 
started gathering across the country in support of the protesters. These demonstrations 
have met with excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, resulting in 
thousands of people being injured and arrested. In the context of these protests at least 
four persons reportedly died, including Mr Mehmet Ayvalitas, Mr Irfan Tuna, Mr 
Abdullah C&#246;mert and Mr Mustafa Sari. On 11 June 2013, members of Turkey&#8217;s 
Special Forces arrested at least 50 lawyers who had gathered in front of the &#199;aglayan 
Justice Palace in Istanbul to make a statement about the situation in Gezi Park.

<p>Alleged resettlement of agro-pastoralist indigenous groups in the lower Omo valley. 
In this follow-up letter, the Special Rapporteur provides a series of observations and 
recommendations in accordance with international human rights standards regarding 
indigenous peoples. In particular, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
ensure consistency with international standards and with the Ethiopian Constitution of 
any resettlement efforts in the lower Omo valley. He notes that unless and until 
resettlement can take place in accordance with these standards and adequate 
safeguards are put in place to mitigate any unavoidable impacts on human rights, 
Ethiopia should cease the resettlement of agro-pastoralist individuals groups in lower 
Omo valley. This communication is a follow-up to an earlier letter sent on 22 October

According to information received, as part of the austerity measures the privatization 
of water and sanitation services in Portugal continues. While the human rights to 
water and sanitation do not prescribe a particular form of service delivery, there are 
allegations that concerned populations have not participated in the decision-making 
process and that the privatization has made water and sanitation services unaffordable 
for some people. This trend has reportedly also had a negative impact on access and 
affordability of adequate housing, disproportionally affecting vulnerable sectors of the 
population.

the executive and legislative have escalated in the past months in Egypt. Such attacks 
and interference allegedly include: physical assaults against judges and members of 
the prosecution; encircling of court premises by mobs chanting threats against judges&#8217; 
lives; transfer of judges as punishment for their decisions; refusal by the authorities to 
implement court rulings and decisions; and defamation campaigns and public threats 
against the judiciary. Serious concern is also expressed regarding three new bills

of these draft bills are alleged to seriously undermine the independence of the

<p>Alleged legislative discrimination against women in relation to succession rights. 
According to information received, a recent decision by the Lesotho High Court 
upheld a provision of the Chieftainship Act No 10 of 1968, which discriminates 
against women. Section 10 of this Act is a restatement and codification of Lesotho 
customary law regarding succession to the office of a Chief. Sections 10(2) &amp; (3) of 
the Act only allow a son of a Chief to succeed to that office, denying the same right to 
a daughter. If no son is available Section 10(4) of the Act allows a Chief&#8217;s wife to 
succeed; however, once that wife&#8217;s tenure ends, only the brother or uncle of the 
previous male Chief may succeed. Despite the Lesotho Constitution protecting 
freedom from discrimination in section 18, sections 18(4)(b) &amp; (c) create an exception 
for laws such as &#8220;application[s] of the customary law of Lesotho&#8221;.

<p>Alleged acts of reprisal, incommunicado detention and torture and ill-treatment of 
human rights defenders for their cooperation with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. According to the 
information received, several individuals, including Messrs. Mazen Darwish, Hussayn 
Gharir, Hani Zitani, Abdelrahman Alhamade and Mansour Al-Omari, who were 
arrested in the context of the raid on the offices of the Syrian Centre for Media and 
Freedom of Expression (SCM) on 16 February 2012, spent nine months in 
incommunicado detention while being refused access to medication. They have 
reportedly suffered torture and ill-treatment while in detention. Messrs. Alhamade and 
Al-Omari were reportedly released pending trial. Charges of promoting terrorist acts 
have been brought against all of them. It is believed that they relate to, and were 
motivated by, the SCM&#8217;s activities in defence of human rights, and that the SCM has 
been criticized as inciting international mechanisms to condemn Syria in response to 
its cooperation with various UN human rights mechanisms. Mr Khalil Matouk, a 
prominent human rights lawyer and Director of the Syrian Centre for Legal Studies 
and Research, at the time of writing reportedly remained in incommunicado detention 
with Mr Mohammed Thatha, a colleague. Mr Matouk has represented a number of 
human rights defenders legally and has submitted information to United Nations 
special procedures on these and other cases both before and after the start of the 
Syrian conflict. They were arrested on 2 October 2012 and Mr Matouk&#8217;s health has

four persons, Mr Abdullah Moudhi Saad Al Atwai, Mr Mohammad Ayed Thawab Al 
Otaibi, Mr Abdullah Faisal Al Harbi and Mr Mohammad Abdullah Al Otaibi, formed 
a new association called &#8220;Union for Human Rights&#8221;. During the following days, the

several provisions of the Fourth Amendment to the Fundamental Law of Hungary, 
which was adopted on 11 March 2013 and entered into force on 1 April 2013, 
constitute serious interferences with the independence of the judiciary, in particular 
that of the Constitutional Court, the rule of law and the principle of separation of

<p>Alleged defamation lawsuit filed by the National Intelligence Service (NIS) against 
three human rights lawyers for action taken in their professional capacity. According 
to the information received, the lawyers Messrs Kyung-uk Jang, Yong-min Kim and 
Seung-bong Yang gave a press conference on 27 April 2013, stating that the criminal 
charges against their client, who had been accused of espionage by the NIS, were 
based solely on evidence procured under duress. In response, three employees of the 
NIS reportedly filed a civil lawsuit against the three lawyers claiming 200,000,000 
KRW (about USD 175,000) from each in damages for defamation against the agency. 
It is reported that the NIS or its agents have previously filed similar lawsuits against 
those who voiced criticism of the agency. Messrs. Jang, Kim and Yang are all 
members of the organization MINBYUN - Lawyers for a Democratic Society.

<p>Alleged recent removal of indigenous consent requirements in the context of 
infrastructure development projects affecting indigenous forest lands and resources. 
According to the information received, in February 2013, the Ministry of Environment 
and Forests allegedly revised previous policy orders that made consent by Gram 
Sabhas (local village councils) mandatory for projects that involve using forest lands 
for non-forest purposes such as commercial and development projects and activities. 
The Ministry of Environment and Forests reportedly created an exemption for consent 
requirements in the case of modifications to the use of forest lands for the 
development of what are termed &#8220;linear projects&#8221;. It is alleged that this consent 
exemption provision will negatively affect the rights of many indigenous peoples in 
India who are not &#8220;pre-agricultural communities&#8221; or &#8220;primitive tribal groups&#8221; but 
rather fall under the category of &#8220;Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes&#8221; or &#8220;other 
traditional forest dwellers&#8221;. It is feared that the removal of the consent requirement 
will facilitate the development of potentially damaging projects in traditional 
forestlands without prior consultation or consent of indigenous peoples.

April 2013, a unit of the Philippine Army landed by helicopter at Sitio Tah Canten, 
Malawanit, Magsaysay, Davao del Sur, Philippines. Armed confrontations between 
the New People&#8217;s Army (NPA), a Maoist guerrilla organization, and the army 
battalion ensued. It is alleged that the conflict resulted in the temporary displacement 
of B&#8217;laan indigenous villagers from their houses. In addition, members of the military 
allegedly harassed and conducted interrogations of B&#8217;laan indigenous villagers based 
on the unsubstantiated suspicion that they were either supporters or members of the

<p>Alleged mistreatment of foreign nationals, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, present in 
Libya. According to the information received, Government officials, militias and, in 
some cases, ordinary citizens motivated by xenophobia and misguided fears about 
diseases, detained foreign nationals on an almost daily basis, in holding centers. The 
conditions in most of these holding centres fell short of international standards, and at 
times amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. It is further reported that 
migrants were being forcibly tested for diseases and then deported, and were 
otherwise particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.

<p>Alleged attack against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) rights

to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences regarding the 
&#8220;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&#8221;, which entered into force on 30 June

<p>Alleged denial of appropriate health care and discrimination against a drug user living 
with HIV and Hepatitis C. According to the information received, Ms X was allegedly 
pressured into having an abortion on 10 June 2011 by her gynaecologist. On 4 July 
2011, Ms X decided not to undergo the abortion. On 2 August 2011, she was admitted 
to a drug treatment centre after overdosing on 11 July.  Ms X was allegedly forced to 
leave the clinic on 11 August 2011 since the doctor considered her to be healthy. 
Following severe abdominal pain, she gave birth through caesarean to a healthy infant 
on 28 August 2011. On 20 August 2012, Ms X filed an official complaint with the 
Ministry of Health. She received a reply on 10 December stating that the medical care 
provided to her was in full compliance with Russian legislation. Ms X filed a 
complaint with the district court, on 29 December, alleging that her right to health, to 
be free from discrimination and ill-treatment had been violated. The court rejected her 
complaint and, on 11 March 2013, Ms X appealed to the regional court, which 
eventually upheld the decisions of the previous court.

<p>Alleged arrest and detention of peaceful protesters requesting to participate in the

issue. According to the information received, a series of requests have been made by 
individuals and associations to participate in the consultation and drafting process 
around China&#8217;s upcoming UPR in October 2013. On 1 July 2013, a large number of 
the protesters requesting to participate were arrested outside the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs in Beijing and divided into two groups. One of the groups was released after 
twelve hours of interrogation. The fate and whereabouts of the second group remained 
unknown. Some activists, including Mr Cao Shunli, Zhang Ming, Hu Guang and Ms 
Peng Lanlan, were reportedly subjected to arbitrary arrests and detention in response 
to requests for information regarding the UPR process. Ms Peng Lanlan is currently 
on trial and may have been subjected to torture while in pre-trial detention. It is 
reported that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in response to requests for information 
regarding the UPR process, stated officially that such information amounted to &#8216;state 
secrets&#8217;.

promotion of public health is under threat due to the alleged strong influence of 
fundamentalist and religious groups on the Ministry of Health. The Government is 
allegedly retreating from its policies on HIV prevention, previously shaped in 
partnership with civil society, and on 4 June 2013, the Ministry of Health suspended 
and later drastically altered an outreach campaign aimed at raising awareness among 
sex workers. It is also alleged that the Ministry of Health has increasingly undermined 
the rights-based approach, which used to underline the actions of the National AIDS 
Programme, and took other actions that have had a negative impact on HIV 
prevention policies, especially for vulnerable groups.

psychosocial disabilities in violation of due process safeguards. According to the 
information received, Mr X was sentenced to death for murder in the state of Georgia. 
The execution was, however, temporarily halted on 23 July 2012. It is reported that, in 
April 2013, the stay of execution of Mr X was lifted and the state rescheduled the 
execution for 15 July 2013. Reportedly three hours before his execution, a judge in 
Fulton County, Georgia, issued a new stay of execution and decided to delay it in 
order to hold a new hearing on 18 July 2013, to discuss whether the process 
surrounding Mr X&#8217;s execution violates the state&#8217;s Lethal Injection Secrecy Act. It is 
alleged that on 20 July 2013, the current execution warrant of Mr X would expire and 
if the stay is lifted before then, Mr X would be at high risk of being executed. Mr X 
was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 13 July 2012 (A/HRC/22/67).

n&#176;117 completing the Contravention Code could potentially limit the rights to freedom 
of expression, association and peaceful assembly of lesbian, gay, bisexual and

<p>Alleged prolonged solitary confinement that may amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or even torture and inadequate medical care. According to the 
information received, Mr Herman Wallace and Mr Albert Woodfox were placed in 
solitary confinement over forty years ago and Mr Robert King Wilkerson was placed 
in solitary confinement for a total of twenty-nine years at the Louisiana State 
Penitentiary. Mr Woodfox, after his reported transfer to the David Wade Correctional 
Centre, allegedly continued to be subjected to solitary confinement. Additionally, it is 
alleged that the prison review boards have not made good faith efforts to have fair and 
meaningful hearings to assess the necessity of solitary confinement, setting aside the 
prisoner&#8217;s behaviour in the assessment. It is also alleged, that Mr Wallace was 
diagnosed with liver cancer and that he received insufficient medical care.

<p>Alleged irregularities in the trials of human rights defenders, including possible acts of 
reprisals for co-operation with the United Nations against one of them, and alleged 
torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of another while in 
detention. According to the information received, on 25 June 2013, Ms Zainab 
Alkhawaja was sentenced to two further months of imprisonment on the basis of 
charges of having assaulted two police officers while in detention. It is also reported 
that on 1 July 2013, the Court of Cassation rejected the application of Mr Mahdi Abu 
Deeb to suspend previous convictions against him until the completion of 
investigations of allegations of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment against him. It is further reported that Mr Mahdi Abu Deeb does not receive 
adequate medical attention in detention, and has possibly been subjected to torture. 
Moreover, Mr Mohamed Al-Maskati reportedly faces trial on charges of &#8220;participation 
in illegal protests&#8221;, after his co-operation with the United Nations during the Universal 
Periodic Review of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

<p>Alleged killings of human rights defenders. According to the information received, on 
7 July 2013, two unknown assailants shot dead in Gassor neighbourhood, in northern 
Galkayo, Mr Libaan Abdullahi Farah, a journalist who worked for several media 
houses. On 13 July 2013, two unidentified men shot dead in Israac village, in 
Galkayo, Mr Abdi Farah Dheere, deputy chair of the non-governmental organisation 
Peace and human Rights Network (PHRN/INXA). It is feared that these two murders 
are related to the human rights activities carried out by the two human rights 
defenders. Since the beginning of the year, at least three other journalists have 
reportedly been killed in Somalia.

<p>Allegations concerning conditions of detention that may amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or even torture and possible refoulement of more than 1800 
ethnic Rohingya migrants and refugees in immigration detention centers in Thailand. 
According to the information received, escalating violence in Rakhine, Myanmar, has 
displaced thousands of Rohingya people, many of whom fled by boat to neighbouring 
Thailand. Thailand treats these migrants and refugees as irregular immigrants and has 
detained them in immigration detention centers for over five months in conditions that 
may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even torture. Between 19 
March and 22 July 2013, seven men and one boy allegedly died as a result of poor 
conditions and lack of medical care in the centers. In the Phang Nga detention center 
near Phuket, there are 276 Rohingya men detained in cells meant only for 5-15 
persons. Their lack of exercise is emaciating their leg muscles. Furthermore, there is 
serious concern of refoulement and possible repatriation to Myanmar, since Thai 
authorities have restricted the Rohingyas&#8217; stay to six months.

<p>Alleged imminent risk of executions after proceedings that did not comply with 
international standards on fair trial and due process guarantees, as well as torture 
while in detention. According to the information received, Messrs Ghazi Abbasi, 
Abdul-Reza Amir-Khanafereh, Abdul-Amir Mojaddami, and Jasim Moghaddam 
Payam, members of the Ahwazi Arab minority, are at risk of imminent execution. On 
15 August 2012, the Revolutionary Court of Ahwaz reportedly sentenced them to 
death on charges of moharebeh and ifsad fil-arz. In addition, Messrs Shahab Abbasi, 
Sami Jadmavinejad, and Hadi Albokhanfarnejad, also Ahwazi Arabs, were sentenced 
to three years in prison. All the accused were reportedly held in incommunicado pre-
trial detention for months, subjected to torture and ill-treatment for the purpose of 
extracting confessions, and denied full access to a defence lawyer. Their trial took 
place behind closed doors, and some members of their families were allegedly 
harassed and detained.

(WGEID). According to the information received, since 2 July 2013, police officers in 
the Mount Elgon District have allegedly visited homes of family members of victims 
of enforced disappearances, reportedly asking them to come to the police station. The 
police officers allegedly questioned the families about cases of disappearances 
submitted to the WGEID and compelled family members to sign statements without 
disclosing their content. Reportedly, following the police visits, some of the families 
left their houses out of fear of reprisals. Furthermore, on 5 July 2013, a local NGO 
issued a press statement addressing the alleged incidents and asking for investigations. 
It is reported that the police have harassed and threatened eight members of the

<p>Alleged imposition of the death penalty on an individual with psychosocial 
disabilities. According to the information received, Mr John Ferguson, a 65 year old 
man, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1978. Since he has been on 
death row, prison doctors have reportedly continually assessed him as &#8220;suffering from 
chronic schizophrenia, paranoid type&#8221;. In 2012, the execution of Mr Ferguson was 
stayed while litigation ensued on the question of his competence. On 21 May 2013, a 
panel of three judges at the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the 
finding of the Florida courts that Mr Ferguson &#8220;is aware that the State is intending to 
execute him and that he will physically die as a result of the execution&#8221;. However, 
according to Mr Ferguson&#8217;s lawyers, he lacks a rational understanding of the reason 
for and reality of the punishment. At the time of transmission of this communication, 
Mr Ferguson was scheduled to be executed on 5 August 2013. On 25 July 2013, his 
lawyers filed a petition before the US Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution.

<p>Alleged sentencing of 69 out of the 94 individuals arrested, including human rights

and allegations of torture whilst in detention. According to the information received, 
94 individuals, including human rights lawyers, judges, academics and student leaders 
(referred to as the UAE 94) were arrested during the spring and summer of 2012 and 
charged with plotting to overthrow the Government on 27 January 2013. The first 
hearings reportedly took place on 4 and 11 March 2013, amidst allegations of unfair 
trials, as well as torture from international organizations and the defence team. No 
independent investigation into the torture claims has been launched. It is further 
reported that Mr Obaid Yousif al-Zaabi was arrested after allegedly having criticized 
the UAE authorities and claimed that his brother had been tortured. On 2 July 2013, 
69 of the 94 individuals were sentenced, and on 3 July 2013, 2 of the 25 acquitted 
were re-arrested. Three previous communications have been sent on the same case 
(A/HRC/24/21, A/HRC/22/67 and A/HRC/21/49).

qu&#8217;en d&#233;pit des graves crimes survenus au cours des derniers mois en Tunisie, les 
autorit&#233;s n&#8217;auraient pas pris des mesures suffisantes pour prot&#233;ger les militants 
politiques et tous ceux qui professent des id&#233;es et opinions minoritaires ou dissidentes 
dans le pays. De plus, suite aux obs&#232;ques de M. Brahmi, de nombreuses 
manifestations auraient eu lieu en Tunisie et certaines auraient fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un usage 
disproportionn&#233; de la force de la police.

<p>Allegations concerning the rescue of 102 migrants in the Mediterranean sea and the 
refusal of Malta to allow the tanker which rescued the migrants to enter into Maltese 
territorial waters and disembark the migrants. According to the information received, 
on 4 August 2013 a dinghy style boat with 102 migrants aboard was spotted in the 
Mediterranean sea.  A nearby tanker, the MT Salamis, rescued the 102 migrants, 
disembarking them from their dinghy onto the tanker. Among the rescued migrants 
were allegedly four pregnant women, one injured woman as well as a five months-old 
baby. At 24 nautical miles off the Maltese coast, the Armed Forces of Malta 
intercepted the vessel and refused it entry into Maltese Territorial Waters, requesting 
it instead to return to Libya and refusing to allow the tanker to disembark the 
migrants. Between 4 to 7 August, the tanker remained stranded off the coast of Malta. 
On 7 August Italy accepted to take in the migrants and the vessel disembarked the 
migrants at the Italian port of Syracuse.

<p>Alleged attacks against the independence of the legal profession, in particular the 
alleged arrest, detention and launching of criminal proceedings against lawyers in the 
context of antiterrorism operations. According to information received, in November 
2011, 47 lawyers, three law office employees and one journalist were allegedly 
arrested in Turkey in the scope of an operation aimed at dismantling a supposed 
terrorist network. The lawyers were reportedly taken into custody in Istanbul for 
allegedly being &#8220;members&#8221; or &#8220;executives&#8221; of the &#8220;illegal organization&#8221; Kurdish 
Communities Union (KCK) and for acting as &#8220;messengers&#8221; for the elaboration of the 
organization&#8217;s strategies. Concerns are expressed that the arrests, charges and criminal 
proceedings brought against the lawyers are mainly linked to the contacts they had 
with their clients within the scope of their professional duties and the legitimate 
exercise of their profession. Similar concerns were expressed in two previous urgent 
appeals in 2011 and 2012 (A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/20/30).

to the information received, on 27 July 2013, Mr Mohammad Hasan, a 28 year-old 
Afghan migrant who had been detained for almost 11 months, died in a hospital in 
Athens. Allegedly, the police authorities at Korinthos detention centre had repeatedly 
rejected his requests to see a doctor. Furthermore, in two recent incidents, in police 
facilities in Grevena and Kozani, two migrants allegedly committed suicide while in 
detention. It is further reported that a 33 year-old Congolese man was awaiting 
amputation of both legs following seven months of detention in Komotini without 
appropriate access to medical care, and a 28-year-old Afghan national, suffering from 
a serious disease, was hospitalized. Additionally, a group of Bangladeshi strawberry 
pickers who were shot at on 17 April of this year in Nea Manolada have allegedly 
received no support from the Greek government.

<p>Alleged negative consequences of amendments to the Legislation on the Armed 
Forces of 2007 on the right to fair trial and due process, freedom of expression, the 
rights to liberty and security, the right to be free from torture and ill-treatment, and the 
right to life. According to the information received, an amendment to Sudan&#8217;s Armed 
Forces Law of 2007 was adopted on 2 July 2013 by the Parliament. The amendment 
reportedly stipulates that every person &#8211; irrespective of their military status or 
connection with Sudan&#8217;s armed forces &#8211; who commits or is suspected of committing 
any act undermining the security of the State is subject to the jurisdiction of Sudan&#8217;s 
military courts, thereby subjecting civilians to the jurisdiction of military courts in 
relation to a large number of vaguely worded offences. The amendment is said to have 
been enacted in a context of concerns over serious human rights violations in the 
country, including the prosecution of journalists, political opponents, human rights 
defenders and others for their peaceful activities.

one hundred persons with disabilities, including mental disabilities, at the Gheorghe 
Servan Centre for Neuropsychiatric Recuperation and Rehabilitation in Bucharest

or beaten, physically restrained by ligatures to prevent them from moving in or out of 
their beds and are fed while lying on their back. Thirty persons are allegedly kept tied 
to their beds and appear to be seriously and systemically underweight, which allegedly 
indicates signs of malnourishment, serious medical or psychiatric related stress, or a 
difficulty with swallowing, associated with dietary practices or environmental stress 
factors. It is also alleged that the persons institutionalized at the Centre are denied life-
saving external medical treatment, which resulted in the deaths of two young women 
from pneumonia in 2012.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution and executions carried out in violation of 
international human rights standards in the Gaza Strip. According to the information 
received, the de facto authorities in Gaza announced that executions would be carried 
out in the coming weeks. In particular, Mr Hani Mohammed Abu Aliyan appears to be 
at risk of execution, although he was reportedly subjected to torture and sentenced to 
death for an offence allegedly committed when he was a minor. Furthermore, Mr 
Faraj Abed Rabu was sentenced to death in 2013, while Messrs Emad Mahmoud Abu 
Ghalyoun and Husein Youssef Mohammad El Khatib were executed in June 2013. 
The proceedings against the defendants were allegedly conducted in serious violation 
of international standards. At least 35 individuals are reportedly on death row in the 
Gaza Strip. The unlawful imposition of the death penalty in the Gaza Strip was the 
subject of a previous communication dated 17 August 2012 (A/HRC/22/67).

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution and alleged executions carried out in violation of 
international human rights standards in the Gaza Strip. According to the information 
received, the de facto authorities in Gaza announced that executions would be carried 
out in the coming weeks. In particular, Mr Hani Mohammed Abu Aliyan appears to be 
at risk of execution, although he was reportedly subjected to torture and sentenced to 
death for an offence allegedly committed when he was a minor. Furthermore, Mr 
Faraj Abed Rabu was sentenced to death in 2013, while Messrs&#8217; Emad Mahmoud Abu 
Ghalyoun and Husein Youssef Mohammad El Khatib were executed in June 2013. 
The proceedings against the defendants were allegedly conducted in serious violation 
of international standards. At least 35 individuals are reportedly on death row in the 
Gaza Strip. The unlawful imposition of the death penalty in the Gaza Strip was the 
subject of a previous communication dated 17 August 2012 (A/HRC/22/67).

<p>Alleged excessive use and practices of prolonged solitary confinement, poor 
conditions of detention and retaliatory measures. According to the information 
received, from 8 July 2013, hundreds of prisoners in the California Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation have been conducting a hunger strike in protest of 
being placed in solitary confinement and denied certain basic necessities. Allegedly, 
the protest is in response to inaction by prison officials after a negotiated agreement 
after a 20-day hunger strike in July 2011. The prisoners are protesting against being 
subjected to solitary confinement for over 22 hours a day, some prisoners have been 
enduring isolation for decades, with inadequate food rations and quality, and overly 
restrictive policies regarding hobby materials and family visits. Reportedly, there are 
concerns regarding retaliation against the strikers, by further restricting family visits 
and denying any opportunity to contact family over the phone. Reportedly, there are 
also threats being made by the Corrections Secretary to obtain a court order to begin 
force feeding the prisoners.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution after proceedings that did not comply with 
international human rights law standards. According to the information received, on 
14 August 2013, the Supreme Court of India dismissed a review petition on the case 
of Mr Devender Pal Singh Bhullar, who was sentenced to death in 2001. 
Consequently, Mr Singh Bhullar is reported to be at risk of imminent execution. Mr 
Devender Pal Singh Bhullar&#8217;s death was the subject of two previous communications, 
dated 5 June 2013 and 21 August 2013 (A/HRC/25/74), where serious concerns were 
expressed regarding the level of respect of fair trial and due process safeguards in the 
legal proceedings against him, his psycho-social disabilities and alleged use of torture 
against the defendant.

<p>Alleged arrests and administrative detention of four human rights defenders. 
According to the information received, in July and August 2013, Messrs Yang Lin, 
Yang Maodong, Li Huaping, and Liu Jiacai were arrested and detained on charges of 
&#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221; and &#8220;gathering a crowd to disrupt order in a 
public space&#8221; in Guangdong, Guangzhou, Anhui and Hubei provinces respectively. 
Their work included criticism of the one-party system and state censorship, in addition 
to calling for rule-of-law reforms. Mr Yang Maodong was the subject of previous 
communications sent by several mandate holders, including dated 6 March 2006 
(A/HRC/4/37/Add.1, para 146), 1 December 2006 (A/HRC/4/37/Add.1, para 158) and 
30 November 2007 (A/HRC/7/28/Add.1, para 413-417). Concerns are expressed that 
the series of arrests shows a worrisome sign of an escalating crackdown on the rights 
to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly.

<p>Alleged violation of the rights of persons belonging to a Roma community, including 
their right to adequate housing. According to the information received, on 14 August, 
at 12 p.m., Roma people living at Granite street, Uzhgorod, Transcarpathia region, 
informed local Roma NGOs about a visit to their community by representatives of 
prosecutors, police and journalists headed by the Mayor of the city. The Roma 
community stated that they were being given notice that they must move out of their 
homes. They were reportedly informed that the reason for their eviction was the 
illegal construction of the Roma homes on the land. It is reported that 22 houses, 
inhabited by 147 people (19 families), including 80 children, are under immediate 
threat of demolition. The police allegedly went into individual Roma houses and 
asked for registrations, acting in a &#8220;rough&#8221; manner towards the Roma. According to 
the Head of one Roma NGO in Thalmann, the Mayor of the city gave Roma residents 
only 24 hours to &#8220;evacuate&#8221; their homes.

received, Messrs Hadi Rashedi and Hashem Sha&#8217;bani Amouri, members of the 
Ahwazi Arab minority, were recently transferred from Karoon Prison to an unknown 
location where they face a very high risk of imminent execution. In January 2013,

<p>Allegations of possible eviction of human rights non-governmental organizations from 
their premises. According to the information received, on 17 and 22 May 2013, the 
municipal authorities of Voronezh informed the International Youth Human Rights 
Movement (IYHRM) and the Confederation of Free Labour (CFL), member 
organizations of the Human Rights House Voronezh (HRHV) community centre that 
their rental contracts had been ceased and that they had to leave the premises. 
IYHRM, CFL and HRHR appealed the decision before the Voronezh City 
Administration. In early August 2013, the municipal authorities of Voronezh 
confirmed their decision not to extend the rental agreement, allegedly because the 
building was to be used to host a to-be established municipal youth centre. The 
authorities did not propose to relocate the HRHV elsewhere.

<p>Alleged negative impact on lowest incomes of rising water costs leading to water 
poverty. According to a report by the House of Commons Library, in England and 
Wales water bills might not be affordable for a large number of people. Nearly one-
third of those on the lowest incomes already have to pay more than 3 per cent of their 
income for their water and sewerage bills. If people pay more than 3 per cent of their 
income for water and sewerage, Government regards them as being affected by &#8216;water 
poverty&#8217;. According to a survey, 23.6 per cent of households in England and Wales 
paid more than 3 per cent of their net income after housing cost on water and 
sewerage in 2009-2010. Nearly half of those paid more than 5 per cent of household 
disposable income. This is a sharp increase compared to 9 per cent of households who 
were affected by &#8216;water poverty&#8217; in 2002-2003. National Debtline received a record 
19,667 calls for help with water debts in 2012 (up from 12,225 in 2011). The figure 
represents an increase of 251% since 2007.

<p>Allegations regarding the escalating violence and intimidation against journalists and

other TV channels were reportedly shut down by Egyptian authorities in the early 
hours of the military coup on 3 July 2013. It is alleged that the channels include at

Brotherhood. On the same day Al-Jazeera&#8217;s office, specifically Al Jazeera&#8217;s Mubasher 
Misr channel, was reportedly raided by the security forces, and a number of staff 
members were detained. Concerns are raised regarding these attacks against Al

<p>Alleged 2011 legislative ban on the coverage of contraceptives under public health 
insurance which discriminates against women and adolescent girls. According to the 
information received, Act No. 363/2011 Coll. of Laws prohibits public health 
insurance coverage of any form of modern contraception if intended, under Art I. 
sections 16(4)(e)(1) and 37(5)&#169;(6), &#8220;for the regulation of conception&#8221;. It is alleged 
that, in comparison with men, this ban disproportionally affects women&#8217;s enjoyment 
of many economic and social rights including the right to health, the right to work and 
participation in public life. It has also been reported that there is currently inadequate 
instruction on sex education in schools and that health workers are unable to

<p>Allegations concerning the situation of &#8220;Veronica&#8221;, an indigenous child who is the 
subject of a custody dispute. According to the information received, Veronica, an 
almost four year old Cherokee child who is the daughter of Dusten Brown, a citizen of 
the Cherokee Nation, faced judicially ordered removal from her indigenous family 
and community to the custody of Matt and Melanie Capobianco, a non-indigenous 
couple. Reportedly, a court in the state of South Carolina awarded custody to the 
Capobiancos without allowing for a hearing or full determination about the best 
interests of Veronica, as ordinarily is done when custody or adoption is contested by a 
biological parent.

<p>Allegations of threats against a human rights defender and his family. According to 
the information received, on 20 September 2013, upon receiving intelligence that a 
militia group intended to burn down the house of Mr Maina Kiai, human rights 
defender and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association, and his family homestead in Nyeri, armed police with 
dogs were deployed at these locations to ensure protection. The threats were 
reportedly the result of a post from a blogger who had been criticizing in harsh terms 
the human rights work of Mr Kiai related to on-going proceedings before the 
International Criminal Court in relation to the 2007 and 2008 post-election violence in 
Kenya. These threats reportedly took place in a climate of increased intimidation and 
harassment of witnesses and human rights defenders in Kenya.

<p>Allegations of gang-rape of a pregnant woman by seven men; and of threats and acts 
of violence, harassment and intimidation by the alleged perpetrators. According to the 
information received, on 17 August 2013, while returning home, Ms X was 
approached by a young individual who offered to accompany her to the village of Y, 
her hometown. Soon after she accepted, Ms X was forced to get in a mini-bus and was 
taken to a field outside the village of Y. Ms X was brutally gang-raped by 7 men 
during the whole night. On 22 August 2013, five persons allegedly broke into Ms X&#8217;s 
house and threatened to kill her. It is reported that the alleged perpetrators were only 
apprehended by the police after a relative of Ms X had filed a formal complaint, and 
that they were released within 72 hours. It is further reported that the parents of the 
alleged perpetrators and a police officer visited Ms X and her relative at their home 
and forced her to sign a written declaration affirming that she had no complaint of 
rape against the alleged perpetrators. It is further alleged that the police failed to 
respond quickly and effectively after the above incidents were reported and that those 
officers investigating this case colluded with the alleged perpetrators.

<p>Alleged imminent execution of four Kurdish men after trials that did not comply with 
international standards. According to the information received,  Messrs Kamal Malaie, 
Jahangir Dehghani, Jamshed Dehghani and Hamed Ahmadi, were accused of 
involvement in the assassination of a senior Sunni cleric, and sentenced to death on 
charges of Moharebeh (enmity against God) and Ifsad filarz (corruption on earth). The 
four men belonging to the Kurdish minority of Sunni Muslim faith were arrested in 
2009 and reportedly subjected to torture and other ill-treatment while in detention. 
They were forced to confess and sign papers without being allowed to read them. 
They were also reportedly denied access to a lawyer before and during their trials. 
Officials from the Ghezal Hesar Prison, where they were reportedly being held at the 
time of writing, informed the four men that their execution was imminent and would 
be carried out soon.

<p>Alleged disruption of two peaceful protests against alleged election irregularities, one 
brutally, by law enforcement officials. According to the information received, on 20 
September 2013, a peaceful assembly took place at Wat Phnom, in Phnom Penh, to 
protest against alleged election irregularities. However, hundreds of military police 
officers put an end to the gathering. In the afternoon of 22 September, a group of 25 
individuals from the Boeung Kak Lake community, including women and children, 
reportedly gathered peacefully under a kiosk at Wat Phnom to protest against the same 
alleged irregularities, and to ask the National Assembly not to convene the following 
day. In the evening, the peaceful demonstrators lit up candles forming the word 
&#8220;justice&#8221; on the ground. Around 9.30pm that evening, a large group composed of 
Daun Penh district police, national gendarme, Daun Penh district authorities and 
young people dressed in civilian clothes, arrived at Wat Phnom. Armed with 
slingshots, teasers and electric prods, they beat and fired marbles at the peaceful 
demonstrators, leaving many injured. At 10 p.m., human rights monitors and 
journalists reached the scene, and were similarly assaulted.

<p>Allegations concerning the treatment of drug users living with HIV and tuberculosis. 
According to the information received, Tuberculosis Clinic No. 2, at 37 Kamskaya St., 
Yekaterinburg made no arrangements to ensure effective tuberculosis treatment for 
drug using patients living with HIV. The treatment programmes offered by the clinic 
failed to incorporate procedures and practices that address the special needs of drug 
using patients. It is reported that the administration of the clinic retaliated against 
patients, who complained about the clinic, by dismissing them before the completion 
of their treatment. It is further reported that harm-reduction measures, such as opioid 
substitution therapy, continued to be unavailable at the clinic and that the clinic failed 
to provide effective HIV/tuberculosis co-infection treatment. Tuberculosis Clinic No. 
2 was the subject of a previous communication sent on 25 June 2010 
(A/HRC/17/25/Add.1, para 272-283).

<p>Alleged proposed legal amendments, which would significantly impinge on the right 
to freedom of association and the right to defend human rights. According to the 
information received, a draft law on &#8220;non-commercial organisations fulfilling the role 
of foreign agents&#8221; that classifies as foreign agents as organisations that receive 
external funding and participate in &#8220;political activities&#8221;, had been tabled for public 
discussion at the Kyrgyz Parliament.  It is alleged that, should the provisions become 
law, they would restrict the right to freedom of association and the work of human 
rights defenders and civil society.

Yuzepchuk and Alyaksandr Haryunou were sentenced to death in 2013, on charges of 
murder. The Supreme Court reportedly upheld the death sentences against Messrs 
Selyun and Yuzepchuk, putting them allegedly at risk of imminent execution. It is 
reported that the proceedings in all three cases did not meet international human rights 
norms of fair trial and due process. The trials were allegedly not fully transparent, 
with the proceedings against Messrs Selyun and Yuzepchuk being held in secret. 
Moreover, the lawyers did not have full access to the documents of the prosecution. 
Mr Haryunou was also allegedly diagnosed with a psycho-social disability.

<p>Allegations of indiscriminate and excessive use of force against individuals in the 
margins of peaceful protests, leading to the death of one person and injuries, as well as 
arrests of at least six individuals. According to the information received, on 15 
September 2013, tens of thousands of Cambodian National Rescue Party supporters 
attended peaceful protests in Phnom Penh. However, roadblocks placed in many 
streets frustrated some demonstrators as well as residents, business-owners and other 
individuals who gathered spontaneously around these roadblocks leading to further 
protests. In the evening, police forces used live ammunition to quell a violent protest 
at the Kbal Thnal sky bridge. Mr Mao Sok Chan, a by-stander, was shot in the head 
and died on the scene. Nine persons were injured, eight of whom sustained bullet 
wounds, and were taken to hospitals. Security forces severely beat several individuals, 
including teenagers with truncheons. One of them suffered head lacerations from 
these beatings. At least six persons were arrested and at the time of writing remained 
detained.

<p>Alleged policies and practices of the State of Israel negatively impacting the 
enjoyment of several economic, social, civil and political rights of persons living in 
the Gaza strip. According to the information received, naval attacks within three 
nautical miles off the Gaza coast have allegedly resulted in the destruction of fishing 
boats, nets and other fishing equipment. The alleged restriction of movement of 
farmers in the &#8220;buffer zone&#8221; has reportedly resulted in property and crops destruction 
and damage. Reports further suggest that the limited access to export markets created 
significant challenges for businesses based in the Gaza strip with 95% of the 3,900 
industrial establishments having closed or been forced to suspend their work. 
According to the reports received, four residents of the Gaza strip have been subjected 
to these policies and practices and have allegedly sustained important losses, which 
have plunged them and their families in conditions of extreme poverty, deprivation, 
inadequate standards of living and food insecurity. Reports further suggest that due to 
legal and procedural obstacles, the alleged victims are reportedly unable to seek 
remedy or accountability from Israel.

<p>Alleged legislative amendments, which would lead to severe restrictions on the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression online. According to the information received, 
the Decree on the Management, Provision, Use of Internet Services and Information 
Content Online, known as &#8220;Decree 72&#8221; was adopted on 15 July 2013 and came into 
effect on 2 September 2013. It allegedly forbids the use of private websites, including 
social networking websites (for example, Facebook and Twitter) for disseminating 
any information about politics, economics and cultural affairs that is regarded 
&#8220;general or public&#8221;. Decree 72 also prohibits any online acts that are considered 
&#8220;opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; threatening the national security, social 
order and safety; sabotaging the national fraternity; propagating wars and terrorism; 
arousing animosity among races and religions&#8221;. This broad formulation could severely 
hamper the legitimate right to free speech online, including for bloggers and activists. 
Decree 72, in draft form, has already been the subject of a previous communication 
sent by Special Procedures mandate holders on 2 August 2012 (A/HRC/22/67).

<p>Alleged risk of execution following proceedings that did not comply with fair trial

aged 43, was charged with murder in 2000, sentenced to four years and six months of 
imprisonment and 3500 lashes. The sentence was reportedly carried out, after which 
the defendant was released. However, at the request of the victim&#8217;s family, Mr Al 
Sai&#8217;ari was again arrested and placed in detention, for the same offence. In 2012, after

<p>Allegations of forced labour in prison which do not comply with international 
standards, threats as a consequence of complaint, hunger strike and hospitalization. 
According to the information received, Ms Nadezhda A. Tolokonnikova, a woman 
held in correctional colony no. 14 (Mordoviya Republic), and other prisoners in the 
same facility, were forced to work for up to 16 hours per day. They were only able to 
sleep 4 hours per night, and were not provided the rest days they were entitled to. The 
sewing equipment they used to make police uniforms was reportedly outdated, leading 
to injuries and the remuneration received for the work did not comply with 
international standards. It is alleged that complaints by Ms Tolokonnikova led to 
retaliation and threats against her by the deputy governor of the colony. In protest 
against the conditions of work, Ms Tolokonnikova subsequently went on a hunger 
strike. Her health reportedly deteriorated and on 29 September 2013, she was 
transferred from solitary confinement to a hospital, where for some time, she was 
reportedly denied access to visitors, including her husband.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution of an Ahwazi Arab after torture and proceedings 
that did not comply with international standards regarding fair trial. According to the 
information received, in September 20103 Mr Ghazi Abbasi, member of the Ahwazi 
Arab minority, was transferred from his cell to solitary confinement in Karoun prison 
in Khuzestan. Allegedly, at the time of writing Mr Ghazi Abbasi&#8217;s execution might be 
imminent given the reported practice in the Islamic Republic of Iran to transfer 
defendants to solitary confinement before the implementation of their death sentences. 
Mr Ghazi Abbasi was the subject of a previous communication sent to the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 31 July 2013 (A/HRC/25/74), in 
which serious concerns were expressed regarding his alleged torture and violations of 
fair trial and due process standards in the proceedings against him.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution after torture and proceedings that did not comply 
with international standards of fair trial. According to the information received, Mr 
Ahmad Nuri Badawi &#8216;Abbas was detained in 2009 and convicted under the Iraqi Anti-
Terrorism Law for killing security officers in Baghdad. Reportedly, he was sentenced 
to death in 2010. The Court of Cassation upheld this verdict in 2011. It is reported that 
at the time of writing Mr Ahmad Nuri Badawi &#8216;Abbas was being held on death row in 
Baghdad. The proceedings against Mr Ahmad Nuri Badawi &#8216;Abbas were allegedly 
conducted in violation of international human rights law standards regarding fair trial 
and due process. Mr Ahmad Nuri Badawi &#8216;Abbas is further alleged to have been held 
in incommunicado detention, subjected to torture and forced to confess. Apparently, at 
least 42 individuals, including one woman, were executed in Iraq on 9 and 10 October 
2013 on terrorism-related charges.

<p>Alleged interferences with, and pressure on, the independence of lower courts and 
tribunals in the Maldives. According to the information received, the Human Rights 
Commission of the Maldives has developed a court/trial monitoring programme for 
judges and magistrates. The aim of the two-day training programme is to assess the 
extent to which the court system in the Maldives complies with international standards 
relating to the administration of justice. On 12 September, the Supreme Court&#8217;s 
Judges Council allegedly barred the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives from 
conducting the training programme, since monitoring the administration of justice by 
national courts and tribunals would go beyond the mandate of the Commission. A 
number of judges and magistrates of lower courts and tribunals, who had confirmed 
their attendance, informed the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives that they 
were asked by the Supreme Court not to attend the training programme.

<p>Alleged serious violation of international human rights standards. According to the 
information received, since 22 September 2013, National Intelligence Services (NISS) 
and the Sudanese police have arrested at least 800 individuals, including political 
activists, opposition party members, human rights defenders and journalists. It is 
reported that an estimated 200 demonstrators were killed by gunshot wounds caused 
by Governmental security forces. It is alleged that the NISS and the Sudanese Police 
used excessive and disproportionate force including live ammunition and tear gas to 
disperse assemblies, and blocked access to hospitals. It is further reported that the 
previous detained have in most cases been held incommunicado and denied access to 
medical care, and that it is common in NISS facilities to extend periods in custody to 
up to four and a half months without charges. Journalists have allegedly been harassed 
and heavily censured and political parties are no longer allowed to hold meetings.

Association of Maldives and Transparency Maldives were under investigation for 
challenging the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the staff of Transparency Maldives

ratified the &#8220;Non-Governmental Organizations Bill&#8221; (NGO Bill), regulating operations

required to re-register by 11 November 2013. Concerns were raised that the NGO Bill 
represents an undue interference with the substantive work and organizational

<p>Allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention, and enforced disappearances. According 
to the information received, 20 individuals were arrested and detained, and in some 
instances forcibly disappeared, in connection with their participation in peaceful 
assemblies or human rights campaigns in different parts of the country. They had 
protested, inter alia, against alleged corruption among Government officials or called 
on the State to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Many of 
them were believed to belong to, or be inspired by, the New Citizen Movement, a 
network of peaceful activists who reportedly call for transparency about the financial 
assets of top Chinese leaders, and promote political and legal reforms.

cases.

<p>Alleged lack of compliance of the amended Information and Communication 
Technology Act with international human rights standards. According to the 
information received, the amended Information and Communication Act of 2013, 
passed by Parliament on 6 October 2013, imposed severe and disproportionate 
penalties on persons charged with writing or publishing fake or defaming information 
online. The new Act could impose up to 14-years&#8217; imprisonment and give law 
enforcement officials the power to arrest suspected offenders without obtaining a 
warrant and hold them in detention for an indefinite period without bail. This is 
allegedly seen as an attempt to silence dissenting voices.

<p>Allegations of violence and other human rights abuses against tribal/ indigenous 
peoples. According to the information received, members of indigenous peoples of the 
Chittagong Hill Tracts have experienced murders, harassment, intimidation, religious 
persecution and sexual violence against indigenous women and children. Allegedly, 
this violence is linked to land disputes that originate from Government policies that 
have promoted the migration of Bengali citizens to settle in the Chittagong Hill Tracts 
over the course of several decades in order to alter the demographic composition of 
the region. It is reported that the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord of 1997, providing for 
the recognition of the Chittagong Hills Tracts as a &#8220;tribal inhabited region&#8221;, the 
promotion of indigenous cultures, customary laws and rights to customary lands and 
natural resources, which brought an end to an armed insurgency that arose in the 
1970s had not been implemented.

<p>Alleged arrest and administrative detention of an independent journalist. According to 
the information received, Mr Sergei Naumov, who reported on a variety of human 
rights issues including labour conditions in the cotton fields, was allegedly arrested on 
21 September 2013, by local police officers at his home in the city of Urgench. He 
was held in detention for 12 days under Article 183 of the Administrative Code of 
Uzbekistan (&#8220;Disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace&#8221;) for harassment after an 
incident on the street with a woman. Contrary to the claim by the authorities that they 
had no record of him in detention, his lawyer reportedly learned on 24 September 
2013 that Mr Naumov was being held in the Urgench temporary detention facility. It 
is further reported that the administrative detention may be linked to his journalistic 
activities reporting on the use of forced labour in the cotton industry, including that of 
children, during the harvest season. He was released on 3 October 2013 following a 
summary trial during which he had no legal representation.

<p>Allegations concerning the burning of Maasai houses and property and the alleged 
failure of the Government to provide compensation. According to the information 
received, on 26 July 2013, a convoy of vehicles arrived in the community of Narasha, 
Naivsha, in the Great Rift Valley, which is located in the traditional lands of the 
Maasai people. Throughout that day, the group burned numerous Maasai homes 
destroying items within the houses. It is reported that, while State authorities have 
promised Narasha community members that they will be compensated for their loss, 
over two months since the incident no compensation has been provided to the victims. 
In the meantime, numerous Maasai families have had to endure bouts of rain without 
any adequate shelter following the destruction of their houses.

<p>Allegations of forced labour in prison amounting to slavery and acts of retaliation by 
prison authorities. This communication follows up to an earlier UA submitted on 8 
October 2013 (current report, RUS 8/2013), regarding the situation of Ms Nadezhda 
Tolokonnikova. The original UA related to allegations of forced labour in prison 
amounting to slavery, which reportedly resulted in retaliation by prison authorities, a 
hunger strike by Ms Tolokonnikova, and her hospitalization. No response to the 
previous UA was received by Government authorities at the time of writing. 
According to the updated information received, Ms Tolokonnikova was repeatedly 
denied access to members of her legal team. Since 8 October 2013, she has also been 
transferred to a number of different prisons, including transit prisons with authorities 
allegedly refusing to reveal her exact whereabouts, which remained at the time of 
writing still unknown. Interventions by Ombudsman, Parliamentary deputies and 
others at the national level have not succeeding in clarifying her location and 
wellbeing.

According to the information received, on 11 September 2013, an arrest warrant was 
issued against Mr Nasiruddin Elan, Director of Odhikar, for allegedly violating 
Section 57 of the Information and Communications Technology Act (2006). It is 
believed that the arrest warrant may be linked to the publication by Odhikar of an 
investigative report on individuals who were allegedly killed by security forces on 5 
May 2013 during a demonstration organized by Hefazat-e-islam. On 10 October 2013, 
the High Court Division of the Supreme Court granted Mr Elan a no-arrest order for 
four weeks. On 6 November 2013, Mr Elan spontaneously surrendered before the 
Cyber Crimes Tribunal of Dhaka. His lawyers sought bail on his behalf before the 
Tribunal, but it was not granted. Mr Elan was subsequently arrested and incarcerated. 
On 10 November 2013, Mr Elan&#8217;s lawyers submitted a bail application on his behalf, 
which at the time of writing was planned to be heard on 17 November 2013.

<p>Alleged violation of the freedom of religion or belief and the freedom of expression

in the publication permit of the &#8220;Herald &#8211; The Catholic Weekly&#8221;, which is published 
on behalf of the Bishops of Peninsular of Malaysia. Reportedly, the condition was the 
prohibition of the name &#8220;Allah&#8221; in the aforementioned publication by an 
administrative decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Government of 
Malaysia, dated 7 January 2009. Allegedly the decision may have far-reaching 
implications and may affect the rights of all non-Muslims in Malaysia. It is reported

<p>Alleged forcible eviction and other alleged human rights violations affecting 
indigenous Maasai pastoralists. According to the information received, Sukenya Farm 
is a locality encompassing approximately 12,617 acres in the Loliondo Division, 
Ngorongoro District, in the Arusha Region. Reportedly, Sukenya Farm is a large 
grazing area that constitutes part of the ancestral territories of Maasai pastoralists. 
Maasai groups have used this territory to carry out their traditional activities including 
grazing cattle and accessing important water sources. In 1984, the Government of 
Tanzania in conjunction with the Ngorongoro District Council allocated 10,000 acres 
within the then Soitsambu village to the parastatal company Tanzanian Breweries 
Limited (TBL). Subsequently, in 2006, TBL sold its remaining 96-year leasehold to a 
tourism company known as Tanzania Conservation Limited (TCL). It is reported that 
since the 2006 evictions, private security guards connected to TCL and local police 
have continually subjected Maasai pastoralists to acts of intimidation, harassment, and 
beatings when they have attempted to graze their cattle or access water points in the 
disputed land area.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution in violation of international human rights law.  
According to the information received, Messrs Zaniar Moradi (or Zanyar Moradee) 
and Loghman Moradi (or Loqman Moradee), both members of the Kurdish 
community, at the time of writing were at risk of imminent execution. Messrs Zaniar 
Moradi and Loghman Moradi were the subject of three previous communications 
dated 15 November 2011 (A/HRC/19/44), 29 February 2012 (A/HRC/20/30) and 9 
January 2013 (A/HRC/23/51), where it was alleged that the defendants had been 
subjected to torture and were forced to confess. The Government&#8217;s replies on their 
cases confirmed the sentences to death against Messrs Zaniar Moradi and Loghman 
Moradi, without providing details on how the imposition of the death penalty in these 
cases complied with international human rights law standards. The new information 
alleged in the current follow-up communication contains details of the allegations of 
torture against the defendants, as well as new allegations of violations of fair trial 
standards.

<p>Alleged legislative developments that could unduly restrict the rights to freedom of 
association and expression. According to the information received, the Kenyan 
Parliament is, at the time of writing, examining the Statute Law (Miscellaneous 
Amendments) Bill, 2013 (the &#8220;Bill&#8221;), presented to the Parliament on 30 October 2013. 
The Bill aims at amending two Acts, among others: the Public Benefits Organizations 
Act, 2013 (&#8220;PBO Act&#8221;), which regulates all associations carrying out &#8220;public benefit 
activities; and the National Youth Council Act, 2009 (the &#8220;Council Act&#8221;), which 
regulates activities undertaken by youth groups and other associations.

<p>Alleged concerns over the impact of the economic crisis and austerity measures, in 
particular on the right to adequate housing and the right to an adequate standard of 
living. According to the information received, a combination of legal reforms, budget 
enactments and policy interventions conducted between 2010 and 2013 aimed at 
reducing public expenditures by historic margins at the national, regional and 
municipal levels. One of the main effects of the Government&#8217;s austerity policies has 
been that the number of people at risk of poverty and exclusion has significantly 
increased by over two million since 2008. The absence of official data on the number 
of evictions affecting family homes and the absence of regulations to relocate the 
evicted families reportedly has made it difficult to assess the dimensions of this 
problem.

<p>Alleged sentencing to six years of imprisonment of a human rights lawyer. Mr 
Mohammad Seifzadeh, a human rights lawyer and co-founder of the Defenders of 
Human Rights Centre (DHRC) was allegedly sentenced to six years&#8217; imprisonment on 
charges of &#8220;collusion to take action against the national security&#8221; and &#8220;spreading 
propaganda against the system&#8221; on 20 February 2013. Branch 54 of the Appeals Court 
allegedly upheld this sentence in late September 2013. It is reported that the health of 
Mr Seifzadeh has deteriorated significantly while in detention. Mr Seifzadeh has been 
the subject of two urgent appeals dated 30 September 2010 and 12 November 2010 
(A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, paras. 1261-1264 /1267-1271).

<p>Allegations of arrest of, and possible charges against, 19 demonstrators during a 
peaceful protest against the demolition of Kampung Hakka Mantin historical village,

<p>Letter concerning recent developments regarding the nomination and declaration of 
World Heritage sites by the World Heritage Committee. In this letter, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that the World Heritage Committee will hold a discussion on 
potential reforms to site nomination criteria and the Advisory Bodies&#8217; evaluation 
process at its next annual session. According to the information received, reform 
efforts have arisen mainly due to the difficulties in the nomination process of the 
Pimachiowin Aki site in Canada, an indigenous-led nomination developed through a 
collaborative process between the Government of Canada and First Nations. The site 
was nominated as &#8220;mixed property&#8221; for both, its cultural and natural significance 
under the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage 
Convention. However, the World Heritage Committee reportedly deferred the 
Pimachiowin Aki nomination in large part because the Advisory Bodies were unable 
to concurrently consider natural and cultural values under the present criteria and 
evaluation processes.

<p>Allegations concerning the draft Special Secrets Bill which could seriously restrict the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression in Japan. According to the information 
received, the Lower House of the Japanese Parliament was at the time of writing 
deliberating a bill, approved by the Cabinet in October 2013. The draft Bill reportedly 
includes a number of provisions that may not be in line with international human 
rights standards on freedom of opinion and expression and with Japan&#8217;s Constitution, 
which recognizes the right to access information as part of the right to freedom of 
expression as a fundamental right. It is alleged that, if enacted, the Bill would provide 
very broad grounds for secrecy, limited oversight on decisions to classify matters as 
state secrets, and potential penalization of disclosure of confidential information 
including by whistleblowers and the press.

<p>Alleged concerns over the impact of austerity measures on people living in poverty in 
Spain, in particular the effects on the equal enjoyment of their human right to the 
highest attainable standard of health. According to the information received, a 
combination of budgetary, legislative and administrative measures structurally 
modified the Spanish healthcare system, from a model based on the right to health 
recognized universally for all persons to a multi-layered model, which bases delivery 
on the economic and employment condition of the beneficiary. Specific groups have 
been particularly affected by this situation, including older persons, people living with 
chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, migrants, women (especially those 
disproportionately exposed to gender-based violence and victims of trafficking in 
persons) and youth/children.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention, torture and denial of medical treatment. According to the 
information received, in August 2013, Mr Ahmed Hassan Al-Din was reportedly 
arrested by law enforcement and State security officers and taken to Tajamo Awawal 
Police Station in New Cairo District 2. While detained, Mr Al-Din was allegedly 
beaten and insulted by several police officers. On 20 August, he was transferred to the 
State Security Investigation building, where he was reportedly put in a small cell and 
left handcuffed in a stress position for eight hours. While blindfolded, he was 
reportedly punched several times in the face before being taken to an interrogation 
room. He was later transferred to Tora prison in Aqrab, where he remained detained at 
the time of writing. It is reported that Mr Al-Din suffers from back pain as a result of 
falling twice when forced to walk down the stairs blindfolded. In an attempt to protest 
his situation, on 24 October 2013, Mr Al-Din began a hunger strike and on 4 
November, he refused to take liquids.

<p>Allegations of torture and ill-treatment and imposition of the death penalty in view of 
the imminent extradition from Iraq to Saudi Arabia. According to the information 
received, in 2005, Mr Ayesh Al Harby, a political asylum seeker in Saudi Arabia, was 
reportedly arrested by United States Armed Forces in Baghdad and held in detention 
for three years without trial or charges brought against him. Mr Al Harby was 
reportedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment while in detention. Shortly after his 
release in September 2008, he was reportedly re-arrested by Iraqi Ministry of Interior 
forces and subjected to severe acts of torture. He was subsequently tried before Al 
Rusafa Court in Baghdad and sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of alleged 
&#8220;terrorism-related activities&#8221; and alleged membership in armed groups. In July 2013, 
Mr Al Harby was transferred to the section of Al Rusafa Prison in Baghdad, where he 
remained at the time of writing. It is feared that, if extradited to Saudi Arabia, Mr Al 
Harby would be subjected to torture and ill-treatment and imposition of the death 
penalty.

<p>Alleged targeting of an NGO in the aftermath of the recent presidential elections of 9 
October 2013. According to the information received, on 28 and 30 October 2013, the 
Office of the Prosecutor General called for questioning the Chairperson and Executive 
Director of the Azerbaijani Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies Centre 
(EMDSC). This is reportedly due to heightened scrutiny vis-&#224;-vis any organization 
receiving large amount of grants from foreign sources. On 31 October 2013, law 
enforcement officials reportedly searched the EMDSC&#8217;s premises and confiscated 
computers, print materials, and programme and financial documents. EMDSC is a 
non-governmental organization, which works on election monitoring and, more 
broadly, on the promotion and protection of the right to participate in the conduct of 
public affairs.

<p>Allegations of arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. According to the 
information received, on 26 April 2011, law enforcement officers arrested at their 
home Ms X and her sister, following Ms X&#8217;s participation in a peaceful demonstration 
at the University of Bahrain. They were charged with &#8220;participation in illegal 
assembly&#8221;, &#8220;illegal possession of weapons&#8221;, and &#8220;destruction of university property&#8221;. 
Ms X and her sister were taken to an unknown location where Ms X was separated 
from her sister. She was reportedly beaten during interrogations and threatened with 
rape for the purposes of extracting confessions. Ms X and her sister were subsequently 
released on the following morning. Ms X was later tried by the Criminal Court of 
Bahrain and was sentenced to 40 days in prison or a fine of 200 Bahraini Dinar. On at 
least two occasions, she was reportedly expelled from the University of Bahrain, 
arrested and released shortly afterwards. Serious concern is expressed for the physical 
and psychological integrity of Ms X and her sister. Grave concern is expressed at the 
fact that Ms X&#8217;s detention may be linked to her recent participation in a peaceful 
assembly.

<p>Alleged concerns over the impact of the Multi-Year Tariff Order II (MYTO II) and its 
potential detrimental impact on the realization of human rights of people living in 
extreme poverty in Nigeria. According to the information received, the fact that there 
is no functioning metering system limits the ability to accurately set prices for 
electricity and leaves electricity bills vulnerable to mismanagement and arbitrary 
decisions, disproportionately affecting people living in poverty. Certain groups 
already vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion, including women heads of 
households and persons living in informal settlements and in rural areas, may be 
especially affected by the rise in tariffs under MYTO II enacted by the Nigerian

violation of his rights to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful

information received, on 22 October 2013, Mr Aung Zaw Oo, a 33 year old Muslim 
from Taunggyi in Shan State, was asked by military Special Branch officers to sign a 
written statement committing him not to engage in political activities in exchange for 
the removal of his name from a political activists watch list. Following his refusal to 
do so, he was reportedly hit on three separate occasions by motorbikes driving at him.  
Police have reportedly failed to take up his case. There are concerns that the alleged 
attacks may be related to his civil society work in Rakhine State.

&#8220;in response&#8221; to the killing of 14 border guards the day before. It was publicly

Furthermore, Messrs Reza Esmaili and Habibollah Golparipour (or Gholpari-poor), as 
well as Mr Shirkoo (or Sherko) Moarefi, who were members of the Kurdish minority, 
were also reportedly executed on 26 October 2013 and 4 November 2013, 
respectively, after proceedings that did not comply with fair trial and due process

sentenced to death in 2011 under the Anti-Terror Law of 2005, at the time of writing 
remained  at risk of imminent execution in Iraq, following the rejection of his 
application for retrial by the Court of Cassation on 12 November 2013.During the re-
trial, the defendant allegedly was limited to presenting written submissions, and the 
allegations of the defendant&#8217;s torture, confessions obtained under torture, and use of 
his confession as evidence against him were not addressed. Mr Ahmad &#8216;Amr &#8216;Abd al-
Qadir Muhammad was the subject of a previous communication dated 11 October

Wuhaibi, Mr. Muhammad bin Hussain al-Qahtani and Mr. Muhammad bin Nasser al-

submitted a request for recognition of what would be Saudi Arabia&#8216;s first political party, 
the Islamic Omma Party. All of them were asked to sign an undertaking that they would 
renounce their activities with the party. Mr. bin Sa&#8216;d al-Ghamdi, Mr Aziz al-Wuhaibi, 
Mr bin Hussain al-Qahtani and Mr bin Nasser al-Ghamdi reportedly refused to do so, 
and as a result they were placed in detention.

<p>Alleged killings of human rights defenders. According to the information received, on 24 
May 2011, Mr Jos&#233; Cl&#225;udio Ribeiros da Silva and Ms Maria do Esp&#237;rito Santo da Silva, 
leaders of Projeto Agroextrativista Praialta-Piranheira and members of the Conselho 
Nacional das Popula&#231;oes Extrativistas, were ambushed and shot by unknown individuals. 
They had reportedly received death threats in the past, reportedly from loggers and cattle 
ranchers. On 27 May 2011, Mr Adelino Dinho Ramos, coordinator of the Movimiento 
Campones Corumbiara, was reportedly shot dead in Porto Vehlo, Rodondia. The killing 
of Erenilto Pereira dos Santos, which reportedly took place on 28 May 2011, may 
allegedly be linked to the killing of Mr Ribeiros da Silva and Ms Esp&#237;rito Santo da Silva, 
as it is believed that he may have witnessed the incident. The aforementioned killings 
reportedly took place in the context of a Congressional debate regarding amendments to 
Brazil&#8217;s Forest Code.

allegedly transferred to a psychiatric facility for a term of 60 days following a decision 
of the Central District Court of Chisinau dated 13 July 2011. Allegedly, the term 
expired, and there was no judicial review and decision to extend it, and thus there was a 
lack of legal basis for Mr X&#8217;s detention beyond 13 September 2011.

<p>Alleged killing of human rights defender. According to the information received, land 
rights activist Mr S. Bhuvaneswaran was killed in Kolathur in the district of Chennai on 
10 January 2012. It is reported that Mr Bhuvaneswaran was attacked by a man armed 
with a sickle as another assailant kept hold of his daughter. Reports indicate that the 
killing may have been connected with Mr Bhuvaneswaran&#8217;s campaigning against land 
grabs allegedly carried out by a land mafia group with reported links to the Dravidian 
Progress Federation political party. It is alleged that death threats were made against Mr 
Bhuvaneswaran in July 2011, but police reportedly failed to take protective measures 
after learning of the threats. Reports indicate that two cases have been registered by the 
police in relation to the alleged killing.

<p>Alleged threats to the enjoyment of the rights to food, housing, water and sanitation, and 
health care for several communities in Banke, Nepal as a result of annual flooding 
caused by the Lakshmanpur Dam and the Kalkwala Afflux Bund. According to 
information received, annual floods threaten more than 3,000 families of Holiya, 
Bethani, Mattaiya, Fattepur, Bankatti and Gangapur in the Banke district of Nepal. 
While some flooding in the area is a natural phenomenon, the annual flooding has been 
aggravated since the construction of the Lakshmanpur Dam in 1985 and, in particular the 
Kalkwala Afflux Bund built between 1999 and 2000 by the Government of India along 
the Indo-Nepali border. Reportedly, the affected communities were not consulted prior to 
the construction of the dam and afflux bund in question. It is alleged that no proper 
resettlement plan has been put in place despite the challenges the affected communities 
face yearly.

<p>Allegations of violations against human rights defenders, including attempted abduction, 
surveillance and intimidation. According to the information received, Dr Nirmal 
Dewasiri, President of the Federation of University Teachers Unions and Secretary of the 
Arts Faculty Teachers' Association of the University of Colombo, has been subjected to 
repeated acts of surveillance and intimidation. Most recently, on 22 June 2012, Dr. 
Dewasiri received a phone call from a person who identified himself as one of two men 
from the Ministry of Defence who were witnessed on 19 June enquiring about him to 
neighbours. During the call, the man reportedly threatened to harm Dr. Dewasiri's family 
if he did not cease his trade union activities. On 5 July 2012, prominent Sri Lanka X 
News journalist and human rights defender Mr Shantha P. Wijesooriya was in the 
Colombo suburb of Nugegoda, when he noticed that he was being followed by a white 
van. He changed his route in order to avoid the van, and while doing so, two unidentified 
persons attempted to grab him and drag him towards the van, the journalist managed to 
escape. Sources indicate that Mr Wijesooriya and other Sri Lanka X News journalists 
have been repeatedly subjected to threats and intimidation since 2008. On 25 April 2011, 
Mr Wijesooriya was arrested and detained for seventeen days on charges of contempt for 
an article published by Sri Lanka X News. Since September 2011, Mr Wijesooriya and 
members of his family have reportedly received visits from military intelligence and CID 
officials, while unidentified individuals have asked about the journalist near his home.

<p>Alleged arbitrary and indefinite detention, inhuman treatment, infringement of due 
process and fair trial guarantees, and denial of access to an independent doctor. According 
to the information received, Mr Shaker Aamer was captured by Northern Alliance forces 
in Kabul in December 2001 and held there in an underground prison. Around 25 
December 2001, he was reportedly transferred from the Kabul prison to the Bagram 
Airforce Base by US forces. In January 2002, he was reportedly transferred with a US 
aircraft to Kandahar Airforce Base in Afghanistan under US control. On 13 February

from Guantanamo Bay since 2007, he still remained detained at Guantanamo. He has 
allegedly been denied an independent medical assessment by a civil doctor of his choice.

<p>Alleged imminent execution of members of the Kurdish community. According to the 
information received, Mr Zaneyar Moradee and Mr Loghmun Moradee were sentenced to 
death on charges of &#8220;enmity against God&#8221; (moharebeh) and &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; (Fisad-
fil-Arz) for allegedly murdering the son of a senior cleric in Marivan, Kordestan province 
in July 2009. In addition they were also convicted of participating in armed activities of 
Komala, a Kurdish opposition group. Their death penalty was upheld by both the 
Supreme Court and the court of appeal in 2011. Concerns remain about the alleged due 
process procedures, forced confession, torture and other physical violence including 
lashing for the purpose of soliciting confession. The authorities have reportedly notified 
Marivan Friday Imam of the planned execution and the Prosecutor for Kurdistan 
reportedly left on 7 January 2012 for Karaj prison to carry out the execution.

<p>Supuesto impacto del C&#243;digo Penal de Bolivia en la salud sexual y reproductiva de las 
mujeres. Seg&#250;n la informacion recibida, el actual C&#243;digo Penal de Bolivia contiene una 
serie de leyes que contravienen las garant&#237;as de los derechos sexuales y reproductivos 
incluidos en la Constituci&#243;n del 2009. El C&#243;digo Penal impone sanciones para cualquier 
persona que practique o se someta a un aborto, incluso en condiciones seguras y dentro 
de las primeras 12 semanas de embarazo (art&#237;culos 263 y 269). As&#237; mismo, se alega que 
el art&#237;culo 266 del C&#243;digo Penal establece que en casos de violaci&#243;n o incesto, una mujer 
puede tener acceso a abortos legales s&#243;lo si inicia un procedimiento de demanda. 
Tambi&#233;n se alega que el art&#237;culo 254 establece una figura de &quot;homicidio por emoci&#243;n 
violenta&quot; que, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, ha sido empleada como base para la 
impunidad en casos de violencia contra las mujeres.

<p>Allegation that the Dutch celebration of Black Pete, also known as &#8220;Zwarte Piet&#8221;, which, 
each year, is part of the Saint Nicholas Event (5 December), and precedes and 
accompanies the celebration of Santa Claus, perpetuates a stereotyped image of African 
people and people of African descent. According to the information received, proposals 
have been made to declare the Dutch Cultural Historical Tradition &#8220;Santa Claus and 
Black Pete&#8221; as Immaterial Cultural Heritage, and the Dutch authorities have selected the 
annual Saint Nicolas Event (December 5) as one of the intangible heritages to be 
submitted for inclusion in the UNESCO list.

<p>Allegations concerning the physical and psychological integrity of a human rights 
defender in pre-trial detention.  According to the information received, since 22 June 
2012, Mr Hilal Mammadov had been in pre-trial detention under charges of, inter alia, 
treason and incitement to national, racial or religious hostility. It is reported that in 
November 2012, Mr Mammadov was beaten and injured by his cell mate who allegedly 
suffered from a serious mental disease.  It is also reported that, in November 2012, the 
courts rejected a complaint filed by Mr Mammadov denouncing acts of torture and ill-
treatment he allegedly suffered during his arrest, acts which were reportedly supported 
by a forensic examination.  Mr Mammadov has been a leader of Azerbaijan&#8217;s ethnic 
Talysh minority and had shortly before his arrest become editor of the newspaper Tolishi 
Sado (Talysh Voice), the only newspaper published in the Talysh minority language of 
southern Azerbaijan.

<p>Alleged execution after proceedings that did not comply fully with fair trial and due 
process guarantees. According to the information received, Mr Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani 
national aged 25, was executed in India on 21 November 2012. He was sentenced to 
death by a special court in 2010, for his alleged involvement in the Mumbai attacks that 
took place on 26 November 2008, and reportedly resulted in 150 persons killed and 
approximately 250 individuals injured. It was reported that Mr Kasab was found guilty 
of more than 80 charges, including murder, committing acts of terrorism and criminal 
conspiracy to commit murder. The legal proceedings against him allegedly did not 
comply sufficiently with international human rights law standards regarding fair trial and 
due process guarantees. His execution was reportedly carried out in secret, and 
announced to the public only afterwards.

<p>Allegations concerning the situation of the Basarwa and Bakgalagadi indigenous peoples 
in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. According to the information received, there are 
approximately 500 to 600 Basarwa and Bakgalagadi indigenous residents living in five 
communities within the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Approximately 2,200 to 2,400 
Basarwa and Bankgaladi people who were former residents of the Reserve, but who have 
been evicted from their traditional lands, now live in the resettlement sites of Xere, New 
Xade and Kaudwane. In the Roy Sesana and Others v. The Attorney General decision of 
2006, the High Court of Botswana held that the Government&#8217;s refusal to allow the 
applicants in the case to enter the Reserve unless they were issued with permits was 
unlawful and unconstitutional. However, the Government has allegedly maintained a 
position that only the 243 applicants who were named in the Sesana case can return to 
the Reserve without obtaining a temporary entry permit. Further, indigenous residents in 
the Reserve have allegedly been criminally prosecuted, arrested, harassed, beaten and 
intimidated by police and park officials for engaging in their traditional subsistence 
hunting and gathering activities.

December 2001 at the Indian Parliament in New Delhi, during which nine people were 
killed. Reportedly, Mr Guru only received legal representation after he confessed. His 
confession, which he subsequently retracted, was allegedly obtained through torture. It is 
also reported that the Government-appointed legal representative failed to conduct a 
thorough cross-examination of evidence and witnesses. Mr Guru`s appeal for clemency 
was rejected on 3 February 2013. He was allegedly denied judicial review of the decision 
rejecting his mercy petition. The execution reportedly took place in secrecy and his wife 
was refused return of the body.

According to information received, on 3 April 2012, the Third Committee of Film and 
Video Censorship Board issued a banning order prohibiting the distribution of the 
movie, which is as adaptation in Thai-language of William Shakespeare&#8217;s Macbeth. It is 
alleged that the Censorship Board deemed that the movie &#8220;has content that causes 
disunity among the people of the nation&#8221;, and that the filmmakers did not agree to re-
shoot the scenes that were the subject of the Third Committee&#8217;s various objections. It is 
alleged that the banning of the film is politically motivated.

<p>Alleged arrest, detention and conviction of human rights defenders. According to the 
information received, human rights lawyers from two prominent human rights 
organisations, Insan Haklari Dernegi (IHD) and &#199;agdas Hukuk&#231;ular Dernegi (&#199;HD) 
have been arrested and/or convicted under counter-terrorism legislation. It is alleged that 
on 11 December 2012, IHD members Mr Tugay Bek and Ms Sevil Araci Bek were 
convicted following their participation in election activities. Four further human rights 
lawyers, Ms.Filiz Kalayci, Mr Hasan Anlar, Mr Murat Varg&#252;n and Mr Halil Ibrahgim 
Varg&#252;n, members of IHD, were reportedly convicted to prison sentences on 24 January 
2013 for membership of an illegal organisation, reportedly for their contact with 
detainees as the organisation was documenting human rights violations. It is further 
alleged that during a raid carried out on homes and &#199;HD offices during the morning of 
18 January 2013, confidential documents were seized amid procedural violations on the 
part of the police Anti-Terror Unit, eventually resulting in the detention of fifteen human 
rights lawyers, six of whom, Mr Efkan Bola&#231;, Mr G&#252;ray Dag, Ms Oya Aslan, Ms Gulvin 
Aydin, Mr Serhan Arikanoglu and Mr Zeki R&#252;zgar, were later released. Nine lawyers , 
namely Mr Sel&#231;uk Kozaga&#231;li, Mr Taylan Tanay, Mr G&#252;&#231;l&#252; Sevimli, Mr Naciye Demir, 
Ms Nazan Bet&#252;l Vang&#246;l&#252; Kozaga&#231;li, Mr G&#252;nay Dag, Ms Ebru Timtik, Ms Barkin Timtik 
and Ms S&#252;kriye Erden were accused with membership of an illegal organisation while 
counter-terrorism provisions are hampering the ability of their defence lawyers to 
adequately access the investigation and evidence against them.

<p>Alleged practices throughout New York state prisons that subject thousands of 
incarcerated persons to prolonged solitary confinement, other extreme isolation 
practices, and inhuman or degrading conditions in detention. According to the 
information received, in 39 prisons across New York state, nearly 4,500 prisoners are 
held in isolation cells, or Special Housing Units (SHUs), each day. It is further reported 
that more than 68,000 sentences placing inmates in SHUs have been imposed as 
punishment or disciplinary sanctions for prisoners&#8217; violations of prison rules between 
2007 and 2011. It is alleged that while the average length of the sentences is five months, 
many prisoners are held in extreme isolation for multiple years. It is alleged that the New 
York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS)  places no 
limits on the number of consecutive SHU sentences a prisoner may be forced to serve. 
Mr William Blake, 49 years old, has allegedly been held in a barren concrete cell with no 
furnishings other than a steel bed frame for 25 consecutive years. Mr Stephan Poole 
received a sentence of 36 months in the SHU for allegedly planning an escape and has 
reportedly accumulated additional lengthy SHU sentences for non-violent prison 
infractions. Mr Kenneth Wright has been repeatedly confined to SHU as punishment for 
the infraction of using marijuana, despite proactively seeking treatment from the 
DOCCS.

protection of human rights.  According to the information received, on 15 February 
2013, the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan adopted new amendments to the 
mentioned legal texts which will imply increased penalties for violation of the 
requirement to register grants with the Ministry of Justice; will introduce liability (fines 
and confiscation) for carrying out activities under a grant in the absence of a grant 
agreement; and will only allow donations in cash to the amount of up to 200 AZN if the 
recipient is an NGO that has charitable activities indicated as a primary statutory 
purpose.  It is reported that the legislative changes were submitted hastily to the 
Parliament without due consultation with civil society organizations.

<p>Allegations received regarding the impact of the activities of IAMGOLD on the 
Saramaka tribal people, in relation to the new mining rights and the expansion of a 
hydroelectric project. According to the information received, IAMGOLD and its 
subsidiary Rosebel Gold Mines N.V. have requested and been granted an extension of 
mining rights in Saramaka territories under an agreement to modify the Mineral 
Agreement of 7 April 1994 and expand the Afobaka hydroelectric dam and reservoir, 
also in Saramaka territories, as part of the TapaJai project. The mining concessions and 
the expansion of the Afobaka dam are alleged to impact adversely on the rights of the 
Saramaka and contravene the judgment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 
the case of Saramaka People v. Suriname, which affirmed the collective land and 
resource rights of the Saramaka, a maroon tribal group in northeast Suriname, and 
ordered the Government of Suriname to legally recognize and protect the land and 
natural resource rights of indigenous and tribal peoples in the country.

Cau was prohibited from joining demonstrations during the massive crackdown on anti-
China protesters around the country. Following an intensive 7-hour interrogation with 
regard to the articles he wrote online about the Communist Party&#8217;s policies on Buddhism 
and China, he was reportedly not allowed to leave his house which was surrounded by 
police. In March 2013, he was again summoned for another interrogation, which lasted 
for two and a half days. Security Police accused him of slandering the regime and 
spreading propaganda and, before releasing him, forced him to write a statement 
admitting that he had written articles criticizing the Communist Party.

pre-trial detention and that a confession which constitutes a central piece of evidence 
was obtained under torture. Allegations have also been received of numerous violations 
of international minimum fair trial standards, including breaches of lawyer-client

submit and receive documentation. Numerous international observers have reportedly 
been prevented from attending the hearings. Mr Abdullah Al-Hadidi was allegedly 
sentenced to ten months imprisonment for publishing an account of the trial on Twitter.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention of two NGO workers and harassment of evictees. According 
to the information received, Mr Okorie David Okafor and Mr Odukoya Oluwaseun have 
been detained since 26 March 2013 for an alleged traffic violation in Lagos. During the 
arrest, several police officers forcibly pulled the passengers out of two cars, and 
reportedly proceeded to beat the drivers, resulting in severe injuries to one of them. 
Everyone in the two cars was reported to be affiliated to the Social and Economic Rights 
Action Centre (SERAC). SERAC has in recent months conducted advocacy work to 
bring attention to forced evictions of a community in Badia East in Lagos, including a 
petition filed to the World Bank, which funds the $200 million Lagos Metropolitan 
Development and Governance Project (LMDGP). Increased harassment of Badia East 
evictees has also been reported after the petition was filed.

<p>Alleged criminal charges brought against a human rights defender. According to the 
information received, criminal charges of broadcasting false statements have been 
brought against Mr Andy Hall, a British citizen, based on a complaint by a fruit 
processing company. Mr Hall was the leading researcher for a report published in 
January 2013 by the NGO Finnwatch, which detailed serious human rights violations by 
the fruit processing company in question with regard to work conditions and labour 
rights of migrant workers employed by the company. Mr Hall personally conducted 
many of the interviews for the report and faces, in addition to the criminal charges, a 
private lawsuit by the company demanding 300 million Baht (or approx. 7.7 million 
EUR) in damages for defamation and damage to the company. Mr Hall has worked as a 
researcher on labour and migrant rights in Thailand for over ten years, exposing 
numerous violations. He was attached, until recently, to Mahidol University in Bangkok 
as an associate researcher and foreign expert.

<p>Alleged imminent deportation of a journalist asylum-seeker, who would be at risk of 
being tortured and killed by the Taliban, if forcibly returned to Afghanistan. According 
to the information received, Mr Saif Ur Rahman Shirzad was forced to flee to Pakistan in 
2008 after receiving death threats from the Taliban due to his journalistic activities. He 
applied for asylum in Sweden on 18 April 2011, but the application was rejected on 14 
December 2011. The appeal was rejected on 15 November 2012. Mr Shirzad, along with 
his brother Mr Noor Rahman Shirzad, had reported on the Afghan-Pakistan border 
region, which put himself and his family at risk and under death threats by the Taliban. It 
is reported that his family received protection and were relocated to the United States of 
America by the UNHCR in 2009, and his brother has been granted asylum in Sweden. 
At the moment of preparing this communication, Mr Shirzad had not yet been deported. 
However, he could be deported at any moment.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention and torture of a human rights defender as well as denial to 
seek legal representation. According to the information received, Mr Naji Fateel was 
arrested on 2 May 2013 at his home in Bani Jamra. It is reported that he was 
subsequently taken to the Criminal Investigation building where he was tortured. The 
resulting injuries were allegedly of such severity that he had to be taken to hospital twice 
after losing consciousness. Allegedly, he was taken to the Public Prosecutor's Office but 
refused to be interrogated there without a lawyer present. It is further alleged he was then 
taken back to the Criminal Investigation building and beaten more severely for having 
requested a lawyer. He was first allowed to make a call on the evening of 4 May, and 
was transferred to Dry Dock prison in the morning of 5 May, where he is suffering from 
severe injuries and fatigue. Mr Naji Fateel is a board member of the Bahrain Youth 
Society for Human Rights, and has been an active blogger on human rights issues.

<p>Alegaciones sobre la situaci&#243;n en la reserva Bosaw&#225;s en la Costa Atl&#225;ntica de Nicaragua. 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la reserva Bosaw&#225;s est&#225; habitada por varias comunidades 
ind&#237;genas mayagna y miskito, quienes recibieron el reconocimiento legal sobre sus 
tierras tradicionales dentro de la reserva en 2007. Desde este entonces, el asentamiento 
ilegal de personas no-ind&#237;genas, o colonos, dentro de la reserva ha aumentado 
dram&#225;ticamente. Por varios a&#241;os, las comunidades ind&#237;genas que habitan la reserva 
Bosaw&#225;s vienen exigiendo al Gobierno a que se realice la etapa de &#8220;saneamiento&#8221; de sus 
tierras. Sin embargo, hasta semanas recientes, el Gobierno no ha avanzado en este 
proceso. Las comunidades ind&#237;genas han amenazado desalojar a los colonos por cuenta 
propia a la luz de la inacci&#243;n por parte del Estado. En semanas recientes, tensiones entre 
los colonos y los ind&#237;genas que habitan la reserva han intensificado, resultando en la 
muerte de un individuo ind&#237;gena.

<p>Alleged criminal charges against human rights defenders and alleged Government 
campaign against defenders working on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and 
Intersex rights. According to the information received, Mr Paul Kasonkomona was 
arrested on 7 April 2013, following his appearance on a television show where he 
emphasized the need for improved access to health care for sex workers, prisoners and 
sexual minorities. After five days in detention, he was charged with inciting activities for 
immoral purposes and subsequently released. It is reported that a campaign has been 
initiated by the Government against defenders working to defend the rights of LGBTI 
individuals, in response to the failed attempt of four same-sex couples to register their 
marriages between 29 and 30 March 2013 and the fact that consensual same-sex 
relationships are criminalized under the Zambian Penal Code.

<p>Allegation of violation of the right to freedom of religion or belief and freedom of 
opinion and expression of a monk teaching the doctrine of an alternative Buddhist order.  
According to information received, U Ottama is imprisoned in Taunggyi Prison, Shan 
State, Myanmar for reportedly teaching a doctrine known as Moepyar. On 3 October 
2012, the Kalaw Township Court in Shan State charged him with violating Section 295A 
of the Penal Code for insulting religion, and sentenced him to two years in prison.  The 
Taunggyi District Court and Shan State High Court on 19 February 2013 reportedly 
dismissed the appeal without a hearing, and the matter is now pending before the 
Supreme Court.
