Explanatory Note
This report on Form 10-Q is a combined report being filed separately by Western Refining, Inc.
(“Western”) and Northern Tier Energy LP (“NTI”). Western owns all of the common units of NTI
and NTI meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q and is
therefore filing its information within this Form 10-Q with the reduced disclosure format. NTI's
debt is in the form of senior secured notes due in 2020 and the indenture governing NTIs senior
secured notes requires that it publicly disclose its quarterly financial position, results of
operations and cash flows through the maturity date or retirement of its senior secured notes.
Western and NTI have elected to include NTI's statements of financial position, results of
operations, statements of cash flows and corresponding notes to its consolidated financial
statements for all periods required within a separate section of Western's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. Each of Western and NTI is filing on its own behalf the information contained in this
report that relates to itself, and neither entity makes any representation as to information relating
to the other entity. Where information or an explanation is provided that is substantially the same
for each entity, such information or explanation has been combined in this report. Where
information or an explanation is not substantially the same for each entity, separate information
and explanation has been provided.
Forward-Looking Statements
As provided by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
certain statements included throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in particular
under the section entitled Part I — Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations relating to matters that are not historical fact should be
deemed forward-looking statements that represent management’s beliefs and assumptions
based upon currently available information. These forward-looking statements relate to matters
such as our industry, including the regulation of our industry, business strategy, our acquisition of
all of the publicly held common units of NTI, future operations, our expectations for margins and
crack spreads, seasonality, the discount between West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil and
Dated Brent crude oil as well as the discount between WTI Cushing and WTI Midland crude oils,
volatility of crude oil prices, additions to pipeline capacity in the Permian Basin and at Cushing,
Oklahoma, pipeline access to advantaged crude oil, expected share repurchases and dividends,
volatility in pricing of Renewable Identification Numbers ("RIN"), taxes, capital expenditures,
liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information. Forward-looking
statements also include those regarding the timing of completion of certain operational and
maintenance improvements we are making at our refineries, future operational and refinery
efficiencies and cost savings, timing of future maintenance turnarounds, the amount or sufficiency
of future cash flows and earnings growth, future expenditures, future contributions related to
pension and postretirement obligations, our ability to manage our inventory price exposure
through commodity hedging instruments, the impact upon our business of existing and future
state and federal regulatory requirements, environmental loss contingency accruals, projected
remediation costs or requirements and the expected outcomes of legal proceedings in which we
are involved. We have used the words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,”
“could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “predict,”
“project,” “strategy,” “will,” “future” and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking
statements in this report.
Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events, results or
outcomes. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be
based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect or that are affected by unknown
risks or uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statements can be guaranteed. In
addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many that are
beyond our control, that could result in our expectations not being realized or otherwise
materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors
and other cautionary statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Actual events, results and
outcomes may differ materially from our expectations due to a variety of factors. Although it is not
possible to predict or identify all of these factors, they include, among others, the following:
•our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with NTI;
•availability, costs and price volatility of crude oil, other refinery feedstocks and refined products;
the successful integration and future performance of acquired assets, businesses or third-party
product supply, and the possibility that expected synergies may not be achieved;
the impact on us of increased levels and cost of indebtedness used to fund our merger with NTI
or the cash portion of the merger consideration and increased cost of existing indebtedness due
to the actions taken to consummate the merger with NTI;
our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms to fund additional acquisitions,
expansion projects, working capital requirements and the repayment or refinancing of
indebtedness;
•changes in crack spreads;

NTI's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("2015 10‑K") that
are incorporated herein by this reference.
Any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows and could influence whether any forward-looking
statements ultimately prove to be accurate. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in
evaluating any forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon
these forward-looking statements.
Although we believe the forward-looking statements we make in this report related to our plans,
intentions and expectations are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that such plans,
intentions or expectations will be achieved. These statements are based upon assumptions
made by us based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions,
expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in the
circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of
which are beyond our control. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as
of the date of this report and we are not required to (and will not) update any information to reflect
events or circumstances that may occur after the date of this report, except as required by
applicable law.

WESTERN REFINING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Organization
"Western," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Western Refining, Inc. and, unless the
context otherwise requires, our subsidiaries. Western Refining, Inc. was formed on September
16, 2005, as a holding company prior to our initial public offering and is incorporated in
Delaware.
We produce refined products at three refineries: one in El Paso, Texas, one near Gallup, New
Mexico and one in St. Paul Park, Minnesota. We sell refined products in Arizona, Colorado,
Minnesota, New Mexico, Wisconsin, West Texas, the Mid-Atlantic region and Mexico. Our
product sales occur through bulk distribution terminals, wholesale marketing networks and two
retail networks with a total of 543 company-owned and franchised retail sites in the United
States.
As of June 30, 2016, we own 100% of the limited partner interest in Northern Tier Energy LP
("NTI") and 100% of its general partner. We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of December 21, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”) with Western Acquisition Co, LLC
(“MergerCo”) which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP
LLC, to acquire all of NTI’s outstanding common units not already held by us (the “Merger”). On
June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger Agreement by NTI common unitholders, all
closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was successfully completed. We
incurred $500 million of additional secured indebtedness under our amended term loan credit
agreement to partially fund the Merger consideration. See See Note 21, Acquisitions, and Note 9,
Long-Term Debt, for further discussion.
At June 30, 2016, we owned a 60.8% limited partner interest in Western Refining Logistics, LP
("WNRL") and the public held a 39.2% limited partner interest. We control WNRL through our
100% ownership of its general partner and we own the majority of WNRL's limited partnership
interests. WNRL owns and operates logistics assets consisting of pipeline and gathering,
terminalling, storage and transportation assets as well a wholesale business that operates
primarily in the Southwest. WNRL operates its logistics assets primarily for the benefit of the
Company.
On May 16, 2016, WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and
sale by WNRL of 3,750,000 common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The
closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to
purchase up to 562,500 additional WNRL common units on the same terms. The underwriter fully
exercised the option on June 1, 2016.
On October 30, 2015, we sold a 375 mile segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline system to WNRL.
This segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeliine extends from WNRL's crude oil station in Star Lake,
New Mexico, in the Four Corners region to its T station in Eddy County, New Mexico (the
"TexNew Mex Pipeline System"). We also sold an 80,000 barrel crude oil storage tank located at
WNRL's crude oil pumping station in Star Lake, New Mexico and certain other related assets.
WNRL acquired these assets from us in exchange for $170 million in cash, 421,031 common
units representing limited partner interests in WNRL and 80,000 units of a newly created class of
limited partner interests in WNRL, referred to as the "TexNew Mex Units." We refer to this
transaction as the "TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction."
The WNRL financial and operational data presented includes the historical results of all assets
acquired from Western in the TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction. The acquisition from Western
was a transfer of assets between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial
information contained herein for WNRL has been retrospectively adjusted, to include the
historical results of the TexNew Mex Pipeline System assets acquired, for periods prior to the
effective date of the TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction.
Our operations include four business segments: refining, NTI, WNRL and retail. See Note 3,
Segment Information, for further discussion of our business segments.
2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim
consolidated financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial
statements. In management's opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, or for any other period.
The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the
audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The
5
Table of Contents
WESTERN REFINING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Western and our subsidiaries. We own 100% of NTI's general partner and, subsequent to the
Merger, we own 100% of the limited partner interest in NTI. We own a 60.8% limited partner
interest in WNRL and 100% of WNRL's general partner. As the general partner of WNRL, we
have the ability to direct the activities of WNRL that most significantly impact their respective
economic performance. We have reported a non-controlling interest for WNRL as of June 30,
2016 of $418.8 million and non-controlling interests for NTI and WNRL of $1,646.6 million as of
December 31, 2015 in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated for all periods presented. Investments in significant non-
controlled entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted
for using the equity method.
Variable Interest Entity
WNRL is a variable interest entity ("VIE") as defined under GAAP. A VIE is a legal entity whose
equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the equity holders lack the power,
through voting rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's financial
performance, the obligation to absorb the entity's expected losses or rights to expected residual
returns. As the general partner of WNRL, we have the sole ability to direct the activities of WNRL
that most significantly impact WNRL's financial performance, and therefore we consolidate
WNRL. See Note 22, WNRL, for further discussion.
Goodwill and Other Unamortizable Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price (cost) over the fair value of the net assets
acquired and is carried at cost. We do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes. We
test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate
and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the
business is managed. Our policy is to test goodwill and other unamortizable intangible assets for
impairment annually at June 30, or more frequently if indications of impairment exist.
The risk of goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses may increase to the extent that NTI’s
results of operations or cash flows decline. Impairment losses may result in a material, non-cash
write-down of goodwill or intangible assets. Furthermore, impairment losses could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and shareholders’ equity.
Use of Estimates and Seasonality
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter
months. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally
lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. During 2014, 2015 and
continuing into 2016, the volatility in crude oil prices and refining margins contributed to the
variability of our results of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the revised accounting and reporting requirements
included in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") for consolidation of limited
partnerships or similar entities. We have applied the new standards retrospectively. The adoption
of these revised standards did not result in any change to our consolidation conclusions or
impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have added disclosures for
WNRL as required for entities not previously included in the reporting entity as a variable interest
entity.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by various standard setting
bodies that may have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We are currently evaluating the
effect that certain of these new accounting requirements may have on our accounting and related
reporting and disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recognition and reporting of revenues - the requirements were amended to remove
inconsistencies in revenue requirements and to provide a more complete framework for
addressing revenue issues across a broad range of industries and transaction types. The
revised standard’s core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to
•

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
•
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The revised standard also addresses principal versus agent considerations and indicators
related to transfer of control over specified goods. These provisions are effective January 1,
2018, and are to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter.
Lease accounting - the requirements were amended with regard to recognizing lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing information about leasing
arrangements. The core principle is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from leases. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
Employee share-based payment accounting - the requirements involve several aspects of
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the statement of cash
flows. These provisions are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim
or annual period.
Recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products - the requirements align
recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid stored-value products with the revenue
recognition standard discussed above for non-financial liabilities. Certain of these liabilities may
be extinguished proportionally in earnings as redemptions occur, or when redemption is remote
if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed stored value. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early
adoption permitted subject to certain requirements.
Contingent put and call options in debt instruments - the requirements will reduce diversity of
practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments and clarify the nature of an
exercise contingency is not subject to the “clearly and closely” criteria for purposes of assessing
whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for
separately as a derivative. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within

those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted subject to certain
requirements.
3. Segment Information
Our operations are organized into four operating segments based on manufacturing and
marketing criteria and the nature of our products and services, our production processes and our
types of customers. These segments are refining, NTI, WNRL and retail.
We treated the TexNew Mex Pipeline System assets that we sold to WNRL in the TexNew Mex
Pipeline Transaction as a transfer of assets between entities under common control. Accordingly,
we have retrospectively adjusted the financial information for the affected reporting segments to
include or exclude the historical results of the transferred assets for periods prior to the effective
date of the transaction. We moved the TexNew Mex Pipeline System from the refining segment to
the WNRL segment.
Business Segments and Principal Products
Refining. We report the operations of two of our refineries in our refining segment. One is in El
Paso, Texas (the "El Paso refinery") with a 131,000 barrel per day ("bpd") capacity and one is
near Gallup, New Mexico (the "Gallup refinery") with a 25,000 bpd capacity. The El Paso and
Gallup refineries produce various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel and other products from crude
oil, other feedstocks and blending components. We purchase crude oil, other feedstocks and
blending components from various third-party suppliers. We also acquire refined products
through exchange agreements and from various third-party suppliers to supplement supply to our
customers. We sell these products to WNRL, to our retail segment, to other independent
wholesalers and retailers, commercial accounts and sales and exchanges with major oil
companies.
We have an exclusive supply and marketing agreement with a third party covering activities
related to our refined product supply, sales and hedging in the Mid-Atlantic region. We recorded
$2.9 million and $1.8 million in assets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
related to this supply agreement in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The revenues
and costs recorded under the supply agreement included $0.3 million and $5.5 million in net
hedging losses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and gains of
$26.0 million and $16.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
This supply agreement is due to expire at the end of 2016.

NTI. The NTI segment includes a 98,000 bpd refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota and a network
of retail convenience stores that sell various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, convenience store
merchandise and beverage and food products to the general public primarily in Minnesota and
Wisconsin. Our St. Paul Park refinery supplies the majority of the gasoline and diesel fuel sold
through our Minnesota and Wisconsin retail convenience stores. As of June 30, 2016, the NTI
segment included the operations of 170 retail convenience stores and supported the operations
of 114 franchised retail convenience stores.
WNRL. WNRL owns and operates pipeline and gathering, terminalling, storage and
transportation assets that provide logistics services to our refining segment in the Southwest,
including 685 miles of pipelines and 8.4 million barrels of active storage capacity. The majority of
WNRL's logistics assets are integral to the operations of the El Paso and Gallup refineries.
WNRL also owns a wholesale business that operates primarily in the Southwest. WNRL's
wholesale business includes the operations of several lubricant and bulk petroleum distribution
plants and a fleet of crude oil, refined product and lubricant delivery trucks. WNRL distributes
commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico and Texas. WNRL purchases petroleum fuels and lubricants from our refining
segment and from third-party suppliers.
Retail. Our retail segment sells various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, convenience store
merchandise and beverage and food products to the general public through retail convenience
stores and various grades of gasoline and diesel fuel to commercial vehicle fleets through
unmanned fleet fueling sites ("cardlocks"). WNRL supplies the majority of gasoline and diesel
fuel that our retail segment sells. We purchase general merchandise and beverage and food
products from various third-party suppliers. At June 30, 2016, the retail segment operated 259
service stations and convenience stores or kiosks located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and
Texas compared to 262 service stations and convenience stores or kiosks at June 30, 2015. At
June 30, 2016 and 2015, the retail segment operated 52 cardlocks located in Arizona, California,
Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.
Segment Accounting Principles. Operating income for each segment consists of net revenues
less cost of products sold; direct operating expenses; selling, general and administrative
expenses; net impact of the disposal of assets and depreciation and amortization. The refining
and NTI segments also include costs related to periodic maintenance turnaround activities. Cost
of products sold includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to our commodity
hedging activities and reflects current costs adjusted, where appropriate, for "last-in, first-out"
("LIFO") and lower of cost or market ("LCM") inventory adjustments. Intersegment revenues are
reported at prices that approximate market.
Activities of our business that are not included in the four segments mentioned above are
included in the Other category. These activities consist primarily of corporate staff operations and
other items that are not specific to the normal business of any one of our four operating segments.
We do not allocate certain items of other income and expense, including income taxes, to the
individual segments. Through June 30, 2016, both NTI and WNRL function primarily as pass-
through entities with respect to income taxes. As a result of the Merger, all of the NTI segment's
taxable income will be subject to income taxes at the Western consolidated level.
The total assets of each segment consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents; inventories; net
accounts receivable; net property, plant and equipment and other assets directly associated with
the individual segment’s operations. Included in the total assets of the corporate operations are
cash and cash equivalents; various net accounts receivable; prepaid expenses; other current
assets; net property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.

The effect of our economic hedging activity is included within the operating income of our
refining and NTI segments as a component of cost of products sold. The cost of products sold
within our refining segment included $11.8 million and $5.8 million in net realized and
unrealized economic hedging losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, and $12.1 million and $15.8 million in net realized and unrealized economic
hedging losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. NTI cost of
products sold included $2.2 million and $2.9 million in net realized and unrealized economic
hedging losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and
$2.4 million and $1.1 million in net realized and unrealized economic hedging losses for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Also included within cost of products
sold is the net effect of non-cash LCM recoveries of $40.7 million and $4.9 million for our
refining segment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $35.6
million, $46.7 million, $38.2 million and $49.0 million for NTI for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
WNRL's financial data includes its historical financial results and an allocated portion of
corporate general and administrative expenses, previously reported as Other, for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015. WNRL operating results include activity of the TexNew Mex
Pipeline System that was previously recorded within our refining segment. The information
contained herein for WNRL has been retrospectively adjusted, to include the historical results
of the TexNew Mex Pipeline System.

4. Fair Value Measurement
We utilize the market approach when measuring fair value of our financial assets and liabilities.
The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
Level 1Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level
2
Level
3
Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than
quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs that are derived
principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
Inputs are derived from valuation techniques that one or more significant inputs or value
drivers are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific
inputs.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, which we consider Level 1 assets and
liabilities, approximated their fair values at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, due to their
short-term maturities. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations,
including the short-term duration of the instruments and an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.
Cash equivalents totaling $0.02 million and $70.1 million consisting of short-term money market
deposits and commercial paper were included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets
as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
We maintain cash deposits with various counterparties in support of our hedging and trading
activities. These deposits are required by counterparties as collateral and cannot be offset
against the fair value of open contracts except in the event of default. Certain of our commodity
derivative contracts under master netting arrangements include both asset and liability positions.
We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative
instruments executed with the same counterparty under the column "Netting Adjustments" below;
however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented on a gross basis in the tables
below. See Note 13, Crude Oil and Refined Product Risk Management, for further discussion of
master netting arrangements.

Commodity hedging contracts designated as Level 3 financial assets consisted of jet fuel crack
spread swaps. Ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD") pricing has had a strong historical correlation to
jet fuel crack spread swaps. We estimate the fair value of our Level 3 instruments based on the
differential between quoted market settlement prices on ULSD futures and quoted market
settlement prices on jet fuel futures for settlement dates corresponding to each of our outstanding
Level 3 jet fuel crack spread swaps. As quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active
market are available, we reclassify the underlying financial asset or liability and designate them
as Level 2 prior to final settlement.
Carrying amounts of commodity hedging contracts reflected as financial assets are included in
both current and non-current other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Carrying amounts of commodity hedging contracts reflected as financial liabilities are included in
both accrued and other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair
value adjustments referred to as credit valuation adjustments ("CVA") are included in the carrying
amounts of commodity hedging contracts. CVAs are intended to adjust the fair value of
counterparty contracts as a function of a counterparty's credit rating and reflect the credit quality
of each counterparty to arrive at contract fair values.

inventories are valued under the LIFO valuation method. WNRL's wholesale refined product,
lubricants and related inventories are valued using the FIFO inventory valuation method. Our
retail segment refined product inventory is valued using the FIFO inventory valuation method.
Retail merchandise inventory is valued using the retail inventory method.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, refined products valued under the LIFO method
and crude oil and other raw materials totaled 10.6 million barrels and 10.0 million barrels,
respectively. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the excess of the LIFO cost over the
current cost of these crude oil, refined product and other feedstock and blendstock inventories
was $113.8 million and $198.4 million, respectively.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, cost of products sold included net non-
cash charges of $107.6 million and $89.6 million, respectively, from changes in our LIFO
reserves. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, cost of products sold included
net non-cash charges of $84.6 million and net non-cash recoveries of $24.0 million, respectively,
from changes in our LIFO reserves. In order to state our inventories at market values that were
lower than our LIFO costs, we reduced the carrying values of our inventory through non-cash
LCM inventory adjustments of $87.7 million and $175.1 million at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. These non-cash LCM recoveries decreased cost of products
sold by $35.6 million, $87.4 million, $38.2 million and $53.9 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Average LIFO cost per barrel of our refined products and crude oil and other raw materials

6. Equity Method Investment
We own a 17% common equity interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC ("MPL"). The
carrying value of this equity method investment was $103.1 million and $97.5 million at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the equity method
investment was $21.2 million and $21.3 million, respectively, higher than the underlying net
assets of the investee. We are amortizing this difference over the remaining life of MPL’s primary
asset (the fixed asset life of the pipeline). There is no market for the common units of MPL and,
accordingly, no quoted market price is available.
We recognized distributions from MPL during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, of
$4.3 million. Distributions from MPL during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were
$2.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Equity income from MPL for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was $4.5 million, $10.0 million, $4.2 million and $7.8 million,
respectively. Equity income has been included in other, net in the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Western Obligations
Revolving Credit Facility
On May 27, 2016, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving
Credit Amendment amended the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility by, among other things,
(i) permitting us to incur up to $500.0 million of additional secured indebtedness secured on a
pari passu basis with the loans under the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility (in the form of
incremental term loans or bonds secured on a pari passu basis with the term loans) beyond what
was permitted under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) modifying several
triggers and thresholds based on borrowing availability under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit
Facility.
On October 2, 2014, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit
Agreement. Lenders committed $900.0 million, all of which will mature on October 2, 2019. The
commitments under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in the future to
$1.4 billion, subject to certain conditions (including the agreement of financial institutions, in their
sole discretion, to provide such additional commitments). The amended terms of the agreement
include revised borrowing rates. Borrowings can be either base rate loans plus a margin ranging
from 0.50% to 1.00% or LIBOR loans plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00%, subject to
adjustment based upon the average excess availability. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit
Facility also provides for a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum,
subject to adjustment based upon the average utilization ratio, and letter of credit fees ranging
from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum payable quarterly, subject to adjustment based upon the
average excess availability. Borrowing availability under the Western 2019 Revolving Credit
Facility is tied to the amount of our and our restricted subsidiaries' eligible accounts receivable
and inventory. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed, on a joint and several
basis, by certain of our subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by certain newly acquired or formed
subsidiaries, subject to certain limited exceptions. The Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is
secured by our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventory. The Western
2019 Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations
on debt, investments and dividends and the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio in certain circumstances.
As of and during the six month period ended June 30, 2016, we had no direct borrowings under
the Western 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, with availability of $353.1 million at June 30, 2016.
This availability is net of $64.2 million in outstanding letters of credit.
Term Loan Credit Agreement - 5.25%
On November 12, 2013, we entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "Western 2020 Term
Loan Credit Facility"). The Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility provides for loans of $550.0
million, matures on November 12, 2020, and provides for quarterly principal payments of $1.4
million until September 30, 2020, with the remaining balance then outstanding due on the
maturity date. On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment of the Western
2020 Term Loan Credit Facility. The revised terms under the amendment provide for additional
capacity to make restricted payments including dividends and repurchase of the Company’s
outstanding common stock, inclusion of equity interests of master limited partnership subsidiaries
as “replacement assets” for purposes of asset sale mandatory prepayment and changes to the
use of proceeds of the incremental term loan available under the Term Loan. The third
amendment also increased the incremental availability under the Western 2020 Term Loan
Credit Facility from $200.0 million, prior to the amendment, to $700.0 million.
Following the third amendment, the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility bears interest at a
rate based either on the base rate (as defined in the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility)
plus 2.25% or the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility) plus
4.25% (subject to a LIBOR Rate floor of 1.00%). The current interest rate based on these criteria
is 5.25%. Our effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan
fees, for the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility was 5.80% as of June 30, 2016.
The Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility is secured by the El Paso and Gallup refineries and
the equity of NT InterHoldCo LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, and is fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of Western's material
wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility contains customary
restrictive covenants including limitations on debt, investments and dividends and does not
contain any financial maintenance covenants.
6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes
On March 25, 2013, we entered into an indenture (the "Western 2021 Indenture") for the issuance
of $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 (the
"Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes"). The
16
Table of Contents
WESTERN REFINING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of
our wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries. We pay interest on the Western 2021 Senior
Unsecured Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Western
2021 Senior Unsecured Notes mature on April 1, 2021. The effective rate of interest, including
contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes
was 6.52% as of June 30, 2016.
Term Loan Credit Agreement - 5.50%
On June 23, 2016, as an incremental supplement to the Western 2020 Term Loan Credit Facility,
we incurred $500.0 million in new term debt that matures on June 23, 2023 (the "Western 2023
Term Loan Credit Facility"). The proceeds from the Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility were
net of original issue discount and other fees totaling $17.0 million. We used these proceeds to
partially fund the cash portion of the Merger consideration. The Western 2023 Term Loan Credit
Facility provides for quarterly principal payments of $1.3 million payable on the last business day
of each March, June, September and December, with the remaining principal amount due on
June 23, 2023. The Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility is secured by both the El Paso and
Gallup refineries and by the equity of NT InterHoldCo LLC and is fully and unconditionally
guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of Western's material wholly-owned
subsidiaries. The Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility bears interest at a rate based either on
the base rate plus 3.50% or the LIBOR Rate plus 4.50% (subject to a LIBOR Rate floor of 1.00%).
The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of original issue
discount and other loan fees, for the Western 2023 Term Loan Credit Facility was 5.99% as of
June 30, 2016.
NTI Obligations
Revolving Credit Facility
On September 29, 2014, certain subsidiaries of NTI entered into the Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement (the "NTI Revolving Credit Facility"), increasing the aggregate
principal amount available prior to the amendment and restatement from $300.0 million to
$500.0 million. The NTI Revolving Credit Facility, which matures on September 29, 2019,
incorporates a borrowing base tied to eligible accounts receivable and inventory and provides for
up to $500.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $45.0 million for swing line
loans. The NTI Revolving Credit Facility may be increased up to a maximum aggregate principal
amount of $750.0 million, subject to certain conditions (including the agreement of financial
institutions, in their sole discretion, to provide such additional commitments). Obligations under
the NTI Revolving Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of NTI’s assets. Indebtedness
under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility is recourse to Northern Tier Energy GP LLC ("NTI LLC")
and certain of its subsidiaries that are borrowers thereunder, its general partner, and is
guaranteed by NTI and certain of its subsidiaries. Borrowings under the NTI Revolving Credit
Facility bear interest at either (a) a base rate plus an applicable margin (ranging between 0.50%
and 1.00%) or (b) a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (ranging between 1.50% and 2.00%),
in each case subject to adjustment based upon the average historical excess availability. In
addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings, NTI is also required to pay a quarterly
commitment fee ranging from 0.250% to 0.375% subject to adjustment based upon the average
utilization ratio and letter of credit fees ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% subject to adjustment based
upon the average historical excess availability. The NTI Revolving Credit Facility contains
certain covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on debt, investments and dividends and
the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances.
At June 30, 2016, the availability under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility was $229.2 million.
This availability is net of $7.5 million in direct borrowings and $54.2 million in outstanding letters
of credit. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of loan fees,
for the NTI Revolving Credit Facility was 5.41% as of June 30, 2016.
7.125% Secured Notes
On November 8, 2012, NTI LLC and Northern Tier Finance Corporation (together with NTI LLC,
the "NTI 2020 Notes Issuers"), issued $275.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.125%
senior secured notes due 2020 (the "NTI 2020 Secured Notes").
NTI increased the principal amount of the NTI 2020 Secured Notes in September 2014 by an
additional $75.0 million in principal value at a premium of $4.2 million. This additional offering
was issued under the same indenture as the existing NTI 2020 Secured Notes and the new
notes issued have the same terms as the existing notes. The offering generated cash proceeds of
$79.2 million including an issuance premium of $4.2 million. The issuance premium will be
amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. The effective rate of interest,
including contractual interest and amortization of debt premium and of loan fees, for the NTI 2020
Secured Notes was 6.91% as of June 30, 2016.
The obligations under the NTI 2020 Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed,
jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by Northern Tier Energy LP and on a senior
secured basis by (i) all of NTI LLC’s restricted subsidiaries

that borrow, or guarantee obligations, under the NTI Revolving Credit Facility or any other
indebtedness of NTI LLC or another subsidiary of NTI LLC that guarantees the NTI 2020
Secured Notes and (ii) all other material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of NTI LLC. The
indenture governing the NTI 2020 Secured Notes contains covenants that limit or restrict
dividends or other payments from restricted subsidiaries. Indebtedness under the NTI 2020
Secured Notes is guaranteed by NTI and certain of its subsidiaries.
WNRL Obligations
Revolving Credit Facility
On October 16, 2013, WNRL entered into a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility
(the "WNRL Revolving Credit Facility"). WNRL has the ability to increase the total commitment of
the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility by up to $200.0 million for a total facility size of up to $500.0
million, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders and to the satisfaction of certain
conditions. The WNRL Revolving Credit Facility includes a $25.0 million sub-limit for standby
letters of credit and a $10.0 million sub-limit for swing line loans. Obligations under the WNRL
Revolving Credit Facility and certain cash management and hedging obligations are guaranteed
by all of WNRL's subsidiaries and, with certain exceptions, will be guaranteed by any formed or
acquired subsidiaries. Obligations under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a
first priority lien on substantially all of WNRL's and its subsidiaries' significant assets. The WNRL
Revolving Credit Facility will mature on October 16, 2018. Borrowings under the WNRL
Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging
from 0.75% to 1.75%, or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%. The
applicable margin will vary based upon WNRL's Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as defined
in the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility.
On October 15, 2014, to partially fund the purchase of certain assets from Western, WNRL
borrowed $269.0 million under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility. On February 11, 2015,
WNRL repaid its outstanding direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility with a
portion of the proceeds from the issuance of its 7.5% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "7.5% Senior
Notes"), discussed below. On October 30, 2015, WNRL borrowed $145.0 million under the
WNRL Revolving Credit Facility to partially fund the purchase of the TexNew Mex Pipeline
System from Western. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, WNRL repaid $125.0 million
of its outstanding direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility using the
proceeds generated through our equity issuance during the period.
The WNRL Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that limit or restrict WNRL's ability to
make cash distributions. WNRL is required to maintain certain financial ratios that are tested on a
quarterly basis for the immediately preceding four quarter period. At June 30, 2016, the
availability under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility was $279.3 million, net of $20.0 million in
direct borrowings and $0.7 million in outstanding letters of credit. WNRL had no swing line
borrowings outstanding under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016. The
interest rate for the borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility was 2.71% as of
June 30, 2016. The effective rate of interest, including contractual interest and amortization of
loan fees, for the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility was 2.97% as of June 30, 2016.
7.5% Senior Notes
On February 11, 2015, WNRL entered into an indenture (the “WNRL Indenture”) among WNRL,
WNRL Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership
(“Finance Corp.” and together with the Partnership, the “Issuers”), the Guarantors named therein
and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) under which the Issuers issued
$300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2023. The Partnership
will pay interest on the 7.5% Senior Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 15 and
August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2015. The 7.5% Senior Notes will mature on
February 15, 2023. WNRL used the proceeds from the notes to repay the full balance due under
the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility on February 11, 2015. The effective rate of interest, including
contractual interest and amortization of loan fees, for the 7.5% Senior Notes was 7.78% as of
June 30, 2016.
The WNRL Indenture contains covenants that limit WNRL’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability
to, among other things, (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred
units, (ii) create liens to secure indebtedness, (iii) pay distributions on equity securities,
repurchase equity securities or redeem subordinated indebtedness, (iv) make investments, (v)
restrict distributions, loans or other asset transfers from the Partnership’s restricted subsidiaries,
(vi) consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of the Partnership’s properties
to, another person, (vii) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in
subsidiaries and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a
number of important limitations and exceptions. The WNRL Indenture also provides for events of
default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and
interest on all the then outstanding 7.5% Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately.

11. Income Taxes
Compared to the federal statutory rate of 35%, our effective tax rates for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, were 27.1%, 28.5%, 26.8% and 26.2%, respectively. The
effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, were lower than
the statutory rate primarily due to the reduction of taxable income associated with the non-
controlling interests in NTI and WNRL. As of June 23, 2016, all of our NTI segment's taxable
income will be subject to income taxes at the Western consolidated level.

We are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years ending December
31, 2012, or after and by various state and local taxing jurisdictions for tax years ending
December 31, 2011, or after.
We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss
("NOL") carryforwards related to the Yorktown refinery will not be realized. Accordingly, a
valuation allowance of $20.8 million was previously provided against the deferred tax assets
relating to these NOL carryforwards at June 30, 2016. There was no change in the valuation
allowance for the Yorktown NOL carryforwards from December 31, 2015.
As of June 30, 2016, we have recorded a liability of $41.2 million for unrecognized tax benefits, of
which $21.9 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. There was an increase of
$1.0 million in our unrecognized tax benefits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
We also recognized $0.3 million and $0.5 million in interest and penalties for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.1 million and $0.2 million in interest and
penalties for three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.

three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was $0.03 million, $0.06 million,
$0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
Our benefit obligation at December 31, 2015, for our postretirement medical benefit plans was

13. Crude Oil and Refined Product Risk Management
We enter into crude oil forward contracts primarily to facilitate the supply of crude oil to our

contracts to physically receive and deliver crude oil that qualify as normal purchases and normal
sales and are exempt from derivative reporting requirements.
We use crude oil, refined products and natural gas futures, swap contracts or options to mitigate
the change in value for a portion of our LIFO inventory and refinery fuel gas volumes subject to
market price fluctuations. We enter into swap contracts

our future gasoline and distillate production. The physical volumes are not exchanged; these
contracts are net settled with cash. These hedging activities do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment.
The fair value of these contracts is reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and
the related net gain or loss is recorded within cost of products sold in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets (Level 2) are considered to determine the fair values of the majority of the contracts for
the purpose of marking the hedging instruments to market at each period end.

Western's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements to manage

value amounts recorded for derivative instruments under these agreements in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have posted or received margin collateral with various
counterparties in support of our hedging and trading activities. The margin collateral posted or
received is required by counterparties as collateral deposits and cannot be offset against the fair
value of open contracts except in the event of default.

Western Incentive Plans
The Western Refining 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2006 LTIP") and the Amended and
Restated 2010 Incentive Plan of Western Refining (the "2010 Incentive Plan") allow for restricted
share unit awards ("RSUs") among other forms of awards. As of June 30, 2016, there were
19,856 and 2,391,711 shares of common stock reserved for future grants under the 2006 LTIP
and the 2010 Incentive Plan, respectively. Awards granted under both plans vest over a
scheduled vesting period of either one, three or five years and their market value at the date of
the grant is amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Effective March 25, 2015,
our board of directors approved administrative amendments to the 2010 Incentive Plan.
As of June 30, 2016, there were 658,506 unvested RSUs outstanding. We recorded stock
compensation of $1.7 million, $2.7 million, $1.1 million and $2.1 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.
As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate grant date fair value of outstanding RSUs was $21.2 million.
The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding RSUs was $13.6 million. The unrecognized
compensation cost of unvested RSUs was $18.4 million. Unrecognized compensation costs for
RSUs will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.86 years.
The tax deficiency related to the RSUs that vested during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 was $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, using a statutory blended rate of
38.1%. The aggregate grant date fair value of the RSUs that vested during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, was $0.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively. The related
aggregate intrinsic value of these RSUs was $0.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, at the
vesting date.
The excess tax benefit related to the RSUs that vested during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, was $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, using a statutory blended rate of
38.1%. The aggregate grant date fair value of the RSUs that vested during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015, was $1.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The related
aggregate intrinsic value of these RSUs was $3.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively, at the
vesting date.

Amended and Restated Northern Tier Energy LP 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Effective upon the closing of the Merger, Western adopted and assumed NTI's equity
compensation plan and amended and renamed the plan as the Amended and Restated Northern
Tier Energy LP 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("NTI LTIP"). Modifications to the NTI LTIP
include, among other things, a change to the unit of equity from an NTI common unit to a share of
Western common stock. The amendment changes the administrator of the NTI LTIP from the
board of directors of NTI's general partner to Western's board of directors or its applicable
committee. Consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement, all unvested equity awards at the
time of the Merger were exchanged for Western phantom stock awards and performance cash
awards under the NTI LTIP.
We incurred equity-based compensation expense of $3.4 million, $8.0 million, $2.9 million and
$5.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The NTI LTIP provides, among other awards, for grants of stock options, restricted stock,
phantom stock, dividend equivalent rights, stock appreciation rights and other awards that derive
their value from the market price of Western's common stock. As of June 30, 2016, there was
238,959 common share equivalents reserved for future grants under the NTI LTIP.
We determined the fair value of the phantom stock based on the closing price of Western
common stock on the grant date. We amortize the estimated fair value of the phantom stock on a
straight-line basis over the scheduled vesting periods of individual awards.

Western Refining Logistics, LP 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Western Refining Logistics, LP 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "WNRL LTIP") provides,
among other awards, for grants of phantom units and distribution equivalent rights. As of June 30,
2016, there were 4,114,223 phantom units reserved for future grants under the WNRL LTIP.
The fair value of the phantom units is determined based on the closing price of WNRL common
units on the grant date. The estimated fair value of the phantom units is amortized on a straight-
line basis over the scheduled vesting periods of individual awards. WNRL incurred unit-based
compensation expense of $0.8 million, $1.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.9 million for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The aggregate grant date fair value of non-vested phantom units outstanding as of June 30,
2016, was $7.5 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of such phantom units was $7.5 million.
Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested phantom units totaled $6.5 million as
of June 30, 2016, that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.90
years.

15. Earnings per Share
We follow the provisions related to the accounting treatment of certain participating securities for
the purpose of determining earnings per share. These provisions address share-based payment
awards that have not vested and that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and
state that they are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings
per share pursuant to the two-class method.
Diluted earnings per common share includes the effects of potentially dilutive shares that consist
of unvested RSUs and phantom stock. These awards are non-participating securities due to the
forfeitable nature of their associated dividend equivalent rights, prior to vesting and we do not
consider the RSUs or phantom stock in the two-class method when calculating earnings per
share.

A shareholder's interest in our common stock could become diluted as a result of vestings of
RSUs and phantom stock. In calculating our fully diluted earnings per common share, we
consider the impact of RSUs and phantom stock that have not vested. We include unvested
awards in our diluted earnings calculation when the trading price of our common stock equals or
exceeds the per share or per share unit grant price.
16. Cash Flows
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash reported in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, relates to net proceeds from the sale of Western's TexNew Mex Pipeline
System to WNRL. This cash is restricted through October 30, 2016, and must be used to reinvest
in assets used in our business or as an offer of prepayment to lenders under the Western 2020
Term Loan Credit Facility.

17. Leases and Other Commitments
We have commitments under various operating leases with initial terms greater than one year for
retail convenience stores, office space, warehouses, cardlocks, railcars and other facilities, some
of which have renewal options and rent escalation clauses. These leases have terms that will
expire on various dates through 2040. We expect that in the normal course of business, these
leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Certain of our lease agreements provide for
the fair value purchase of the leased asset at the end of the lease. Rent expense for operating
leases that provide for periodic rent escalations or rent holidays over the term of the lease and for
renewal periods that are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
In the normal course of business, we also have long-term commitments to purchase products and
services, such as natural gas, electricity, water and transportation services for use by our
refineries and logistic assets at market-based rates. We are also party to various refined product
and crude oil supply and exchange agreements.
Under a sulfuric acid regeneration and sulfur gas processing agreement with The Chemours
Company FC, LLC (“Chemours”), Chemours constructed and operates two sulfuric acid
regeneration units on property we leased to Chemours within our El Paso refinery. Our annual
estimated cost for processing sulfuric acid and sulfur gas under this agreement is $15.7 million
through March of 2028.
In November 2007, we entered into a ten-year lease agreement for office space in downtown
El Paso, Texas. The building serves as our headquarters. In December 2007, we entered into an
eleven-year lease agreement for an office building in Tempe, Arizona. The building centralized
our operational and administrative offices in the Phoenix area.
We are party to 39 capital leases, with initial terms of 20 years, expiring in 2017 through 2036.
The current portion of our capital lease obligation of $1.3 million and $1.0 million is included in
accrued liabilities and the non-current portion of $56.8 million and $53.2 million is included in
lease financing obligations in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The capital lease obligations include a
deferred gain of $2.2 million. These capital leases were discounted using annual rates of 3.24%
and 10.51%. Total remaining interest related to these leases was $44.1 million and $44.1 million
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Average annual payments, including
interest, for the next five years are $5.8 million with the remaining $74.2 million due through
2036.

and subleases were not significant in any period.
18. Contingencies
Environmental Matters
Similar to other petroleum refiners, our operations are subject to extensive and periodically
changing federal and state environmental regulations governing air emissions, wastewater
discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these regulations are
becoming increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over
time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. Such estimates may be subject to revision in the future as regulations and other
conditions change.
Periodically, we receive communications from various federal, state and local governmental
authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or regulations. These governmental
entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective action for these asserted
violations. We intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take
appropriate corrective action. We do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will
have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had consolidated environmental accruals of
$19.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively.
El Paso Refinery
Prior spills, releases and discharges of petroleum or hazardous substances have impacted the
groundwater and soils in certain areas at and adjacent to our El Paso refinery. We are currently
remediating, in conjunction with Chevron U.S.A., Inc. ("Chevron"), these areas in accordance
with certain agreed administrative orders with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(the "TCEQ"). Pursuant to our purchase of the north side of the El Paso refinery from Chevron,
Chevron retained responsibility to remediate its solid waste management units in accordance
with its Resource Conservation Recovery Act ("RCRA") permit that Chevron has fulfilled.
Chevron also retained control of and liability for certain groundwater remediation responsibilities
that are ongoing.
In May 2000, we entered into an Agreed Order with the TCEQ for remediation of the south side of
our El Paso refinery property. We purchased a non-cancelable Pollution and Legal Liability and
Clean-Up Cost Cap Insurance policy that covers environmental clean-up costs related to
contamination that occurred prior to December 31, 1999, including the costs of the Agreed Order
activities. The insurance provider assumed responsibility for all environmental clean-up costs
related to the Agreed Order up to $20.0 million, of which $6.5 million remained as of June 30,
2016. In addition, a subsidiary of Chevron is obligated under a settlement agreement to pay 60%
of any Agreed Order environmental clean-up costs that exceed the $20.0 million policy coverage.

Four Corners Refineries
Four Corners 2005 Consent Agreements. In July 2005, as part of the EPA Initiative, Giant
Industries, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, reached an administrative settlement with the New
Mexico Environment Department (the "NMED") and the EPA in the form of consent agreements
that resolved certain alleged violations of air quality regulations at the Gallup and Bloomfield
refineries in the Four Corners area of New Mexico. In January 2009 and June 2012, we and the
NMED agreed to amendments of the 2005 administrative settlement (the "2005 NMED Amended
Agreement") that altered certain deadlines and allowed for alternative air pollution controls.
We incurred $50.8 million in total capital expenditures between 2009 and 2013 to address the
requirements of the 2005 NMED Amended Agreement. These capital expenditures were
primarily for installation of emission controls on the heaters, boilers and Fluid Catalytic Cracking
Unit ("FCCU") and for reducing sulfur in fuel gas to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, NOx and
particulate matter from our Gallup refinery. As of March 31, 2016, we have completed the capital
expenditures required by the 2005 NMED Amended Agreement to implement one or more FCCU
emission offset projects prior to the end of 2017. We incurred $0.1 million and $1.9 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and $0.1 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, to implement an FCC emission offset project. We paid penalties
between 2009 and 2012 totaling $2.7 million.
Bloomfield 2007 NMED Remediation Order. In July 2007, we received a final administrative
compliance order from the NMED alleging that releases of contaminants and hazardous
substances that have occurred at the Bloomfield refinery over the course of its operation prior to
June 1, 2007, have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination. Among other things, the
order requires that we investigate the extent of such releases, perform interim remediation
measures and implement corrective measures. Prior to July 2007, with the approval of the NMED
and the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, we placed into operation certain remediation
measures that remain operational.
Gallup 2014 Environment Protection Division of NMED Settlement. In March 2014, we received a
revised notice of violation and offer of settlement from the NMED Air Quality Bureau for alleged
violations of the Clean Air Act. We agreed to settle and paid a penalty of $0.1 million in May
2014. No capital expenditures are required under the settlement.
St. Paul Park Refinery
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, liabilities for remediation and closure obligations
related to NTI operations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million, respectively, of which $2.5 million
and $2.6 million, respectively, are recorded on a discounted basis. These discounted liabilities
are expected to be settled over at least the next 22 years. At June 30, 2016, the estimated future
cash flows to settle these discounted liabilities totaled $2.9 million and are discounted at a rate of
1.95%. Receivables for recoverable costs from the state, under programs to assist companies in
clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks at retail marketing outlets, and others were
$0.1 million and $0.2 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
On June 3, 2014, the St. Paul Park refinery was issued a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination Permit/State Disposal System Permit by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
("MPCA") relating to its upgraded wastewater treatment plant at its St. Paul Park refinery. This
permit required the refinery to conduct additional testing of its remaining lagoon. The testing was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, following the review of the test results and additional
discussions with MPCA, we plan to close the remaining lagoon. At June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, we estimated the remediation and closure costs to be $5.9 million and
$6.0 million, respectively, subject to receipt of final bids from contractors. In connection with NTI's
December 2010 acquisition of the St. Paul Park refinery, among other assets, from the Marathon
Petroleum Company LP ("Marathon"), we entered into an agreement with Marathon that required
Marathon to share in the future remediation costs of this lagoon, should they be required. During
the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a settlement and release agreement with Marathon and
received $3.5 million pursuant to this settlement that we recorded as a reduction of direct
operating expenses.
Other Matters
The EPA has issued Renewable Fuels Standards ("RFS"), that require refiners to blend
renewable fuels into the refined products produced at their refineries. Annually, the EPA is
required to establish a volume of renewable fuels that refineries must blend into their refined
petroleum fuels. To the extent we are unable to blend at the rate necessary to satisfy the EPA
mandated volume, we purchase Renewable Identification Numbers ("RIN"). The purchase price
for RINs is volatile and may vary significantly from period to period. The net cost of meeting our
estimated renewable volume obligations, including sales and purchases of RINs, was
$16.9 million, $36.0 million, $6.5 million and $12.7 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The supply and demand environment for RINs is
uncertain and we cannot predict the impact of RIN purchases on our results of operations in any
given period.
29
Table of Contents
WESTERN REFINING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
In addition, the EPA has investigated and brought enforcement actions against companies it
believes produced invalid RINs. We have purchased RINs that the EPA determined were invalid.
Previously, we have entered into settlements and entered into another settlement in May 2015,
with the EPA regarding RINs we purchased that the EPA ultimately determined were invalid.
While we do not know if the EPA will determine that other RINs we have purchased are invalid,
at this time we do not expect any settlements we would enter into with the EPA would have a
material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We are party to various other claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business.
We believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.
19. Related Party Transactions
We lease office space in a building located in El Paso, Texas that is owned by an entity
controlled by one of our officers. The lease agreement expires in May 2017. Under the terms of
the lease, we make annual payments of $0.2 million. For the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, we made rental payments under this lease to the related party of
$0.06 million, $0.12 million, $0.06 million and $0.12 million. We have no amounts due as of
June 30, 2016, related to this lease agreement.
Beginning on September 30, 2014, we began paying MPL for transportation services at
published tariff rates. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid
$14.8 million, $28.8 million, $14.7 million and $27.4 million, respectively, in crude transportation
costs with MPL. Prior to September 30, 2014, we had a crude oil supply and logistics agreement
with a third-party and had no direct supply transactions with MPL prior to this date. NTI's Chief
Executive Officer is a member of MPL's board of managers.
20. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
Separate condensed consolidating financial information of Western Refining, Inc. (the "Parent"),
subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors is presented below. At June 30, 2016, the Parent and
certain subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally guaranteed our Western 2021
Senior Unsecured Notes on a joint and several basis. NTI and WNRL are subsidiaries that have
not guaranteed the Western 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes. As a result of the Parent and certain
subsidiaries' guarantee arrangements, we are required to present the following condensed
consolidating financial information that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Due to the retrospective adjustments of financial position, results of operations and cash flows
from the guarantor to the non-guarantor entities resulting from the TexNew Mex Pipeline
Transaction, we have revised the condensed consolidating financial information for all periods
presented. See Note 1, Organization, for additional information on this transaction.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned a 100% limited partnership interest in NTI and a 60.8% limited
partnership interest in WNRL, and the non-financial general partner interests of both entities. We
are the primary beneficiary of WNRL's earnings and cash flows. We exercise control of WNRL
through our 100% ownership of its general partner. Accordingly, NTI and WNRL are consolidated
with the other accounts of Western.
Our transactions with WNRL, including fees paid under our pipeline, terminalling and services
agreements, are eliminated and have no impact on our condensed consolidated financial
statements. All intercompany accounts and transactions with NTI and WNRL are eliminated in
our condensed consolidated financial statements.
NTI's long-term debt is comprised of the NTI 2020 Secured Notes and the NTI Revolving Credit
Facility. NTI creditors under the NTI 2020 Secured Notes and the NTI Revolving Credit Facility
have no recourse to the Parent's assets except to the extent of the assets of Northern Tier Energy
GP LLC, the general partner of NTI that we wholly own. Any recourse to NTI’s general partner
would be limited to the extent of the general partner’s assets that other than its investment in NTI
are not significant. Furthermore, the Parent's creditors have no recourse to the assets of NTI's
general partner, NTI and its consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt, for a
description of NTI’s debt obligations.
WNRL generates revenues by charging fees and tariffs for transporting crude oil through its
pipelines and truck fleet, for transporting refined and other products through its terminals and
pipelines, for providing storage in its storage tanks and at its terminals and selling refined
products through its wholesale distribution network. We do not provide financial or equity support
through any liquidity arrangements and/or debt guarantees to WNRL.
WNRL's long-term debt is comprised of the WNRL 2023 Senior Notes and the WNRL Revolving
Credit Facility. With the exception of the assets of Western Refining Logistic GP, LLC, the
general partner of WNRL, creditors have no recourse to our assets. Any recourse to WNRL’s
general partner would be limited to the extent of Western Refining Logistic GP, LLC’s assets
30

which, other than its investment and incentive distribution rights in WNRL, are not significant.
Furthermore, our creditors have no recourse to the assets of WNRL and its consolidated
subsidiaries. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt, for a description of WNRL’s debt obligations.
WNRL’s risks are directly associated with our operations. If we suffer significant decreases in our
throughput or fail to meet desired shipping or throughput levels for an extended period of time,
WNRL revenues would be reduced and WNRL could suffer substantial losses.
In the event that WNRL incurs a loss, our operating results will reflect WNRL’s loss, net of
intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interests in WNRL at that point in time.
The following condensed consolidating financial information is provided as an alternative to
providing separate financial statements for guarantor subsidiaries. Separate financial statements
of Western’s subsidiary guarantors are not included because the guarantees are full and
unconditional and these subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned and jointly and severally liable
for the Parent’s outstanding debt. The information is presented using the equity method of
accounting for investments in subsidiaries.

21. Acquisitions
On December 21, 2015, Western entered into the Merger Agreement, by and among Western,
MergerCo, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, the general partner of NTI and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Western (“NTI GP”). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger
by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger
was successfully completed. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, MergerCo merged with and into NTI, the separate limited liability company existence
of MergerCo ceased and NTI continued to exist, as a limited partnership under Delaware law and
as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, as the surviving entity in the Merger.
Prior to the Merger, NT InterHoldCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Western ("NT InterHoldCo"), owned 100% of the membership interests in NTI GP
and 38.3% of NTI’s outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in NTI (“NTI
Common Units”). NT InterHoldCo also owned 100% of the membership interests in Western
Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and holder of 100% of the
membership interests in MergerCo (“MergerCo HoldCo”). Following the Merger, NTI GP
remained the sole general partner of NTI, the NTI Common Units held by Western and its
subsidiaries were unchanged and remained issued and outstanding, and, by virtue of the Merger,
all of the membership interests in MergerCo automatically converted into the number of NTI
Common Units (excluding any NTI Common Units owned by Western and its subsidiaries)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

effective time of the Merger. Consequently, NT InterHoldCo and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
MergerCo HoldCo, became the sole limited partners of NTI.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we paid $859.9 million in cash and issued 17.1 million
shares of Western common stock adjusted slightly for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We
incurred transaction costs related to the Merger of $12.4 million.
The Merger involved a change in WNR’s ownership interest in its subsidiary, NTI, due to the
purchase of the remaining ownership interests not already owned by WNR and was accounted
for under Accounting Standards Codification 810-10-45-23, Consolidation, which indicates that
increases in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest
in its subsidiary shall be accounted for as an equity transaction. Therefore, no gain or loss was
realized as a result of the Merger. Any difference between the consideration paid and the amount
by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted was recognized in Western shareholders' equity.
Based upon the consideration elections made by NTI common unitholders, this cash and
Western common stock was allocated among NTI common unitholders as follows:
NTI common unitholders who made a valid “Mixed Election” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), or who made no election, received $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a share of
Western common stock for each such NTI common unit held.
NTI common unitholders who made a valid “Cash Election” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) received $15.357 in cash and 0.28896 of a share of Western common stock as
prorated in accordance with the Merger Agreement for each such NTI common unit held.
NTI common unitholders who made a valid “Stock Election” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) received 0.7036 of a share of Western common stock for each such NTI common
unit held.
The consolidated statements of operations include the results of the Merger beginning on June
23, 2016. The following unaudited pro forma information assumes that (i) the Merger occurred on
January 1, 2015; (ii) $500.0 million was borrowed to fund the Merger consideration on January 1,
2015, resulting in increased interest and debt expense of $8.2 million, $17.2 million, $9.0 million
and $18.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and
(iii) income tax expense increased as a result of the increased net income attributable to Western
Refining, Inc. offset by increased interest and debt expense of $8.7 million, $6.9 million,
$25.0 million and $45.8 million, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

22. WNRL
WNRL is a publicly held master limited partnership that owns and operates logistic assets that
consist of pipeline and gathering, terminalling, storage and transportation assets, providing
related services to our refining segment in the Southwest, including 685 miles of pipelines and
8.4 million barrels of active storage capacity. The majority of WNRL's logistics assets are integral
to the operations of the El Paso and Gallup refineries.
WNRL also owns a wholesale business that operates primarily in the Southwest. WNRL's
wholesale business includes the operations of several lubricant and bulk petroleum distribution
plants and a fleet of crude oil, refined product and lubricant delivery trucks. WNRL distributes
commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado,

WESTERN REFINING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. WNRL purchases petroleum fuels and lubricants from our
refining segment and from third-party suppliers.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned a 60.8% interest in WNRL and a 100% general partner interest.
As the general partner of WNRL, we have the sole ability to direct the activities that most
significantly impact WNRL's financial performance, and therefore we consolidate WNRL.
We are WNRL’s primary logistics customer and a significant wholesale customer through our
retail business. WNRL generates revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products
and crude oil though its pipelines, by charging fees for terminalling refined products and other
hydrocarbons, and storing and providing other services at its storage tanks and terminals.
Additionally, WNRL sells various finished petroleum products to us and other third party
customers. Under our long-term agreements with WNRL (discussed below), we accounted for
31.2%, 31.5%, 28.8% and 29.1% of WNRL’s total revenues for the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We do not provide financial or equity support
through any liquidity arrangements and/or debt guarantees to WNRL.
WNRL has outstanding debt under a senior secured revolving credit facility and its senior notes.
Excluding assets held by WNRL, WNRL’s creditors have no recourse to our assets. Any
recourse to WNRL’s general partner would be limited to the extent of Western Refining Logistics
GP LLC’s assets that other than its investment in WNRL, are not significant. Our creditors have
no recourse to the assets of WNRL and its consolidated subsidiaries.
WNRL provides us with various pipeline transportation, terminal distribution and storage services
under long-term, fee-based commercial agreements expiring in 2023. These agreements contain
minimum volume commitments. Each agreement has fees that are indexed for inflation and
provides us with options to renew for two additional five-year terms.
In addition to commercial agreements, we are also party to an omnibus agreement with WNRL
that among other things provides for reimbursement to us for various general and administrative
services provided to WNRL. We are also party to an operational services agreement with WNRL,
under which we are reimbursed for personnel services provided by Western in support of
WNRL's operations of its pipelines, terminals and storage facilities.
WNRL has risk associated with its operations. If a major customer of WNRL were to terminate its
contracts or fail to meet desired shipping or throughput levels for an extended period of time,
revenue would be reduced and WNRL could suffer substantial losses to the extent that a new
customer is not found. In the event that WNRL incurs a loss, our operating results will reflect
WNRL’s loss, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in WNRL
at that point in time.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the notes
thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and
operations. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all
related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results may
differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking
statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under Part I, Item 1A.
"Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 ("2015 Form 10-K") and elsewhere in this report. You should read "Risk Factors" and
"Forward-Looking Statements" in this report. In this Item 2, all references to "Western Refining,"
"the Company," "Western," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Western Refining, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries including Western Refining Logistics, LP ("WNRL"), unless the context
otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated.
Company Overview
We are an independent crude oil refiner and marketer of refined products incorporated in
September 2005 under Delaware law with principal offices located in El Paso, Texas. Our
common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol “WNR.” We
own certain operating assets directly; the controlling general partner interest and 100% limited
partner interest in Northern Tier Energy ("NTI") and the controlling general partner interest,
incentive distribution rights and a 60.8% limited partner interest in WNRL. WNRL common
partnership units trade on the NYSE under the symbol "WNRL".
We produce refined products at our refineries in El Paso, Texas (131,000 barrels per day, or
bpd), near Gallup, New Mexico (25,000 bpd) and St. Paul Park, Minnesota (98,000 bpd). We sell
refined products primarily in Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico, Wisconsin, West
Texas, the Mid-Atlantic region and Mexico through bulk distribution terminals and wholesale
marketing networks. We also sell refined products through two retail networks with a total of 543
company-operated and franchised retail sites in the United States.
Our 100% ownership of the general partner gives us effective control of WNRL. WNRL provides
logistical services to our refineries in the Southwest and operates several lubricant and bulk
petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of crude oil and refined product delivery trucks. WNRL
distributes wholesale petroleum products primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico and Texas.
We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21, 2015 (the “Merger
Agreement”) with Western Acquisition Co, LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western,
NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, to acquire all of NTI’s outstanding common units not
already held by us (the “Merger”). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger
Agreement by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and
the Merger was successfully completed. We incurred $500 million of additional secured
indebtedness under our amended term loan credit agreement to partially fund the Merger
consideration. See Note 21, Acquisitions and Note 9, Long-Term Debt, in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
On May 16, 2016, WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and
sale by WNRL of 3,750,000 common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The
closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to
purchase up to 562,500 additional WNRL common units on the same terms. The underwriter fully
exercised the option on June 1, 2016.
On October 30, 2015, we sold a 375 mile segment of the TexNew Mex Pipeline system to WNRL
that extends from WNRL's crude oil station in Star Lake, New Mexico, in the Four Corners region
to its T station in Eddy County, New Mexico (the "TexNew Mex Pipeline System"). We also sold
an 80,000 barrel crude oil storage tank located at WNRL's crude oil pumping station in Star Lake,
New Mexico and certain other related assets. WNRL acquired these assets from us in exchange
for $170 million in cash, 421,031 common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL
and 80,000 units of a newly created class of limited partner interests in WNRL, referred to as the
"TexNew Mex Units." We refer to this transaction as the "TexNew Mex Pipeline Transaction."
Our operations are reported under four business segments based on manufacturing and
marketing criteria and the nature of our products and services, our production processes and our
types of customers. These four segments are: refining, NTI, WNRL and retail. See Note 3,
Segment Information, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of our business segments.
Refining. Our refining segment owns and operates two refineries in the Southwest that process
crude oil and other feedstocks primarily into gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and asphalt. We
market refined products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail
chains. The refining segment also sells refined products in the Mid-Atlantic region and Mexico.
NTI. The NTI segment operates refining and transportation assets and operates and supports
retail convenience stores primarily in the Upper Great Plains region of the United States.

WNRL. WNRL owns and operates terminal, storage, transportation and wholesale assets
consisting of a fleet of crude oil and refined product truck transports and wholesale petroleum
product operations in the Southwest region. WNRL's primary customer is our refineries in the
Southwest. WNRL purchases its wholesale product supply from the refining segment and third-
party suppliers.
Retail. Our retail segment operates retail convenience stores and unmanned commercial fleet
fueling ("cardlock") locations located in the Southwest. The retail convenience stores sell
gasoline, diesel fuel and convenience store merchandise.

Overview of Segments
Petroleum based commodity values have significant influence, either directly or indirectly, on the
gross margins, results of operations and cash flows for each of our operating segments. The
•
•
•
•
following key factors affect petroleum based commodity values:
•supply and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products;
•changes in domestic and foreign economies;
•weather conditions;
•domestic and foreign political affairs;
•crude oil and refined petroleum product production levels;
•logistics constraints;
•availability of imports;
•marketing of competitive fuels;
•price differentials between heavy and sour crude oils and light sweet crude oils;
•government regulation; and
availability and cost of Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs") to meet our Renewable Fuel
Standards ("RFS") obligations.
Refining and NTI segments. The following items have a significant impact on our overall refinery
gross margin, results of operations and cash flows:
fluctuations in petroleum based commodity values such as refined product prices and the cost of
crude oil and other feedstocks;
product yield volumes that are less than total refinery throughput volume, resulting in yield loss
and lower refinery gross margin;
•the impact of our economic hedging activity;
adjustments to reflect the lower of cost or market value of crude oil, finished product and retail
LIFO inventory values;
•availability and cost of RINs to meet our RFS obligations;
•fluctuations in our direct operating expenses;
planned maintenance turnarounds, generally significant in both downtime and cost, are
expensed as incurred;
•seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products; and
unplanned downtime of our refineries generally leads to increased maintenance costs and a
temporary increase in working capital investment.
We engage in hedging activity primarily to fix the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and
distillate production and to protect the value of certain crude oil, refined product and blendstock
inventories. We record the results of our hedging activity within cost of products sold which
directly impacts our results of operations.
Excise and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not
included in revenues or cost of products sold. In addition to the crude oil that we purchase to
process at our refineries, we also purchase crude oil quantities that are transported to different
locations and sold to third parties. We record these sales on a gross basis with the sales price
recorded as revenues and the related costs within cost of products sold. Consolidated cost of
products sold for the six months ended June 30, 2016, includes $8.7 million of realized and
unrealized net losses from our economic hedging activities, including refining segment losses of
$5.8 million and NTI losses of $2.9 million. The non-cash unrealized net losses included in the
consolidated total were $27.1 million, including unrealized losses of $37.0 million related to
Western's refining segment and unrealized gains of $9.9 million related to NTI for the six months
ended June 30, 2016.
Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter
months. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally
lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. During 2015 and 2016,
the volatility in crude oil prices and refining margins contributed to the variability of our results of
•
•
operations.

Table of Contents
Safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our refineries’ operations are critical
components of our financial performance. Unplanned downtime of our refineries generally results
in lost refinery gross margin, increased maintenance costs and a temporary increase in our
working capital investment. We attempt to mitigate the financial impact of planned downtime,
such as a turnaround or a major maintenance project, through our planning process that
considers product availability, the margin environment and the availability of resources to perform
the required maintenance. We occasionally experience unplanned downtime due to
circumstances outside of our control. Certain of these outages may lead to losses that qualify for
reimbursement under our business interruption insurance and we record such reimbursements
as revenues when received.
Under an exclusive supply agreement with a third party, we receive monthly distribution amounts
from the supplier equal to one-half of the amount by which our refined product sales in the Mid-
Atlantic exceeds the supplier's costs of acquiring, transporting and hedging the refined product
related to such sales. To the extent our refined product sales do not exceed the refined product
costs during any month, we pay one-half of that amount to the supplier. Our payments to the
supplier are limited to an aggregate annual amount of $2.0 million. This supply agreement is due
to expire at the end of 2016.
WNRL. WNRL's terminal throughput volumes depend primarily on the volume of refined and
other products produced at Western’s southwestern refineries that, in turn, is ultimately
dependent on supply and demand for refined product, crude oil and other feedstocks and
Western’s response to changes in demand and supply.
Earnings and cash flows from WNRL's wholesale business are primarily affected by the sales
volumes and margins of gasoline, diesel fuel and lubricants sold and transportation revenues
from crude oil trucking and delivery. These margins are equal to the sales price, net of discounts,
less total cost of sales and are measured on a cents per gallon ("cpg") basis. Factors that
influence margins include local supply, demand and competition.
Retail. Earnings and cash flows from our retail business are primarily affected by the sales
volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel and by the sales and margins of merchandise
sold at our retail stores. Margins for gasoline and diesel fuel sales are equal to the sales price
less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes and are measured on a cpg basis. Fuel
margins are impacted by competition and local and regional supply and demand. Margins for
retail merchandise sold are equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the
merchandise, net of supplier discounts and inventory shrinkage and are measured as a
percentage of merchandise sales. Merchandise sales are impacted by convenience or location,
branding and competition. Our retail sales reflect seasonal trends such that operating results for
the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third
calendar quarters of each year primarily due to lower demand for retail fuel. Earnings and cash
flows from our cardlock business are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of
gasoline and diesel fuel sold. These margins are equal to the sales price, net of discounts less
the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes and are measured on a cpg basis. Factors that
influence margins include local supply, demand and competition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"). In order to apply these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions
and estimates based on the best available information at the time. Actual results may differ based
on the continuing development of the information utilized and subsequent events, some of which
we may have little or no control over. Our critical accounting policies could materially affect the
amounts recorded in our financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, estimates and
recent accounting pronouncements that potentially impact us are discussed in detail under
Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations in our 2015 Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may
have an impact on our accounting and reporting. We are currently evaluating the effect that
certain of these new accounting requirements may have on our accounting and related reporting
and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of the impact of
recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant
Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gross margin
Compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, our current quarter consolidated gross
margin decreased by 22.5%. This decrease was primarily due to lower refining margins and
economic hedging losses. We discuss refining margins and economic hedging activities under
our refining and NTI segments.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The increase in direct
operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $3.6 million, $2.7 million and $0.6 million
in our NTI, refining and retail segments, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million
in our WNRL segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses resulted from decreases of $2.4 million, $0.8 million, $0.5 million and
$0.1 million in our corporate overhead, NTI, WNRL and retail segments, respectively, partially
offset by an increase of $0.3 million in our refining segment. The decrease in corporate overhead
was primarily due to lower professional and legal expenses and incentive compensation in the
current period.
Depreciation and Amortization. The increase between periods was primarily due to additional
depreciation associated with logistics assets capitalized through the ongoing expansion of our
Delaware Basin logistics system.

Gross margin
Compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, our consolidated gross margin decreased by
25.7% for the current period. This decrease was primarily due to lower refining margins and net
economic hedging losses. We discuss refining margins and economic hedging activities under
our refining and NTI segments.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The increase in direct
operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $12.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.3 million
in our NTI, WNRL and retail segments, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million
in our refining segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses resulted from decreases of $4.5 million, $2.0 million, $1.4 million and
$0.5 million in corporate overhead, refining, WNRL and retail segments, respectively, partially
offset by an increase of $2.4 million in our NTI segment. The decrease in corporate overhead
was due to lower employee expenses based primarily on lower incentive compensation
expenses in the current period.
Depreciation and Amortization. The increase between periods was primarily due to additional
depreciation associated with our logistics assets related to the TexNew Mex Pipeline System
and the ongoing expansion of our Delaware Basin logistics system.
Interest and Debt Expense. The increase in interest expense from prior periods was attributable
to the full six month period of interest incurred in 2016 on the $300.0 million WNRL 2023 Senior
Notes that WNRL issued during the first quarter of 2015 and borrowings under the WNRL
Revolving Credit Facility that were outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2016 without a
corresponding balance in the prior year period.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest and debt expense, provision for income
taxes, depreciation, amortization, maintenance turnaround expense and certain other non-cash
income and expense items. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our management believes that the
presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities
analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In
addition, our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating
performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of
Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financings, income taxes, the accounting
effects of significant turnaround activities (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby
exclude from their measures of EBITDA) and certain non-cash charges that are items that may
vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation,
or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations
are:
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for significant
turnaround activities, capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest or principal payments on our debt;
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital
needs; and
Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate it, may differ from the Adjusted EBITDA calculations of other
companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for
these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only
supplementally.

Sales volume includes sales of refined products sourced primarily from our refinery production
as well as refined products purchased from third parties. We purchase additional refined
products from third parties to supplement supply to our customers. These products are similar
to the products that we currently manufacture and represented 8.4% and 10.7% of our total
consolidated sales volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The majority of the purchased refined products are distributed through our refined product
sales activities in the Mid-Atlantic region where we satisfy our refined product customer sales
requirements through a third-party supply agreement.
(4)Total refinery throughput includes crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks.
Refinery gross margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the difference
between net sales and cost of products sold by our refineries’ total throughput volumes for the
(5)
respective periods presented. Net realized and net non-cash unrealized economic hedging
gains and losses included in the combined refining segment gross margin are not allocated to
the individual refineries. Cost of products sold does not include any depreciation or
amortization. Refinery gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is
important to investors in evaluating our refinery performance as a general indication of the
amount above our cost of products that we are able to sell refined products. Each of the
components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of products sold) can be reconciled
directly to our statement of operations. Our calculation of refinery gross margin may differ from
similar calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a
comparative measure.
Our calculation of refinery gross margin excludes the sales and costs related to our Mid-Atlantic
business that we report within the refining segment. The following table reconciles the sales and
cost of sales used to calculate refinery gross margin with the total sales and cost of sales
reported in the refining statement of operations data above:

Gross Margin. Refinery gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as
net sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and
amortization):

Gross margin
Refining gross margins depend on both the price of crude oil or other feedstock and the price of
refined products. Factors affecting the prices of petroleum based commodities include supply and
demand in crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products
depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and
foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of
competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation.
Excluding the impact of hedging activities, refinery gross margin per throughput barrel decreased
in a manner generally consistent with the decrease in industry benchmarks. The Gulf Coast
benchmark 3:2:1 crack spread (the "GC 3:2:1") declined to $13.15 in the second quarter of 2016
from $22.76 in the second quarter of 2015. Our crude oil purchases are based on pricing

tied to WTI that, in recent quarters, has experienced price volatility relative to Brent crude oil
reflective of the decline in global and domestic crude oil prices. During the second quarter of
2016, this differential decreased to an average of $0.06 per barrel from an average of $4.00 per
barrel for the second quarter of 2015. Our El Paso refinery margins have historically benefited
from the WTI Midland/Cushing crude oil differential. However, this differential has been volatile,
has narrowed over the past year, and at times has shifted to a premium rather than a discount.
The differential averaged a WTI Midland discount of $0.17 per barrel during the second quarter of
2016 compared to $0.60 per barrel during the second quarter 2015.
Refinery gross margin was also affected by second quarter 2016 net realized and unrealized
economic hedging losses of $11.8 million compared to losses of $12.1 million during the second
quarter of 2015. We enter into hedge contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price risks
or to fix sales margins on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production. Unrealized
mark-to-market gains and losses related to our economic hedging instruments are the result of
differences between forward crack spreads and the fixed margins from our hedge contracts. We
incur unrealized commodity hedging losses when forward spreads are in excess of our fixed
contract margins. Hedging gains or losses are included within cost of product sold, directly
impacting our refining gross margin.
Other impacts to margin include the net cost of RINs, which was $12.1 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $6.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The increase in the net cost was primarily the result of an industry increase in the unit cost
of RINs. Total refinery throughput decreased by 0.2 million barrels quarter over quarter. Our
refined product sales volume decreased to 19.9 million barrels during the second quarter of 2016
from 21.3 million barrels during the second quarter of 2015.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Direct operating
expenses increased quarter over quarter primarily due to an increase in employee expenses,
new short-term railcar leases and maintenance expenses of $2.3 million, $1.3 million and
$1.2 million, respectively. Partially offsetting the total increase was a decrease in chemical and
energy expenses of $1.9 million resulting from lower commodity prices and a decrease in
professional and legal expenses of $0.4 million.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee expenses of $0.5 million,
partially offset by a decrease in professional and legal expenses $0.1 million and information
technology costs of $0.1 million.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased due to additional
depreciation associated with recently capitalized assets.

Refinery gross margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the difference
between net sales and cost of products sold by our refineries’ total throughput volumes for the
respective periods presented. Net realized and net non-cash unrealized economic hedging
gains and losses included in the combined refining segment gross margin are not allocated to
the individual refineries. Cost of products sold does not include any depreciation or
amortization. Refinery gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is
important to investors in evaluating our refinery performance as a general indication of the
amount above our cost of products that we are able to sell refined products. Each of the
components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of products sold) can be reconciled
directly to our statement of operations. Our calculation of refinery gross margin may differ from
similar calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a
comparative measure.
Our calculation of refinery gross margin excludes the sales and costs related to our Mid-Atlantic
business that we report within the refining segment. The following table reconciles the sales and

depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and
foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of
competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation.
Excluding the impact of hedging activities, refinery gross margin per throughput barrel decreased
in a manner generally consistent with the decrease in industry benchmarks. The GC 3:2:1
declined to $12.02 in the first six months of 2016 from $20.40 in the first six months of 2015. Our
crude oil purchases are based on pricing tied to WTI that, in recent quarters, has experienced
price volatility relative to Brent crude oil reflective of the decline in global and domestic crude oil
prices. During
62
Table of Contents
the first six months of 2016, this differential decreased to an average of $0.18 per barrel from an
average of $4.60 per barrel for the first six months of 2015. Our El Paso refinery margins have
historically benefited from the WTI Midland/Cushing crude oil differential. However, this
differential has been volatile, has narrowed over the past year, and at times has shifted to a
premium rather than a discount. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the WTI
Midland/Cushing differential averaged a discount of $0.02 per barrel, compared to an average
discount of $1.25 for the first six months of 2015. This differential continues to be volatile and
fluctuates based on local crude oil production, crude oil outflows at Midland and Cushing and
regional refining throughput volumes.
Refinery gross margin was also affected by net realized and unrealized economic hedging
losses of $5.8 million for the first six months of 2016, compared to net realized and unrealized
economic hedging losses of $15.8 million for the first six months of 2015. We enter into hedge
contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price risks or to fix sales margins on a portion of
our future gasoline and distillate production. Unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related
to our economic hedging instruments are the result of differences between forward crack spreads
and the fixed margins from our hedge contracts. We incur unrealized commodity hedging losses
when forward spreads are in excess of our fixed contract margins. Hedging gains or losses are
included within cost of product sold, directly impacting our refining gross margin.
Other impacts to margin include the net cost of RINs, which was $25.7 million for the first six
months of 2016, compared to $12.7 million for the first six months of 2015. This $13.0 million
increase in RINs cost primarily results from an industry increase in the unit cost of RINs. Our
refined product sales volume decreased to 37.3 million barrels during the first six months of 2016
from 42.3 million barrels during the first six months of 2015. Offsetting these negative impacts on
our overall refining margin was the impact to cost of products sold of non-cash lower of cost or
market ("LCM") inventory recoveries of $40.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to a recovery of $4.9 million for the same period in 2015.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Direct operating
expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in energy, chemical and catalyst
expense of $6.2 million due to lower natural gas prices. Substantially offsetting this decrease
were increases in railcar lease expense of $2.1 million due to new short-term leases in 2016,
increased maintenance expense of $1.8 million due to maintenance projects at the Gallup
refinery and an increase in property tax expense of $1.7 million.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to expenses related to a 2015 supply agreement
termination and a 2015 blender tax credit received of $1.1 million, decreases in information
technology expenses of $0.7 million and outside support services expenses of $0.3 million.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased due to additional
depreciation associated with recently capitalized logistics assets.

Refinery gross margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the difference
between net sales and cost of products sold by the refinery's total throughput volumes for the
respective periods presented. Refinery net sales include $3.2 million and $37.2 million related
to crude oil sales during the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refinery gross
margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is useful in evaluating refinery
performance as a general indication of the excess of the refined product sales amount over the
related cost of products sold. Each of the components used in this calculation (net sales and
cost of products sold) can be reconciled to corresponding amounts included in the statement
of operations. Our calculation of refinery gross margin may differ from similar calculations of
other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Refining gross margins depend on both the price of crude oil or other feedstock and the price of
refined products. Factors affecting the prices of petroleum based commodities include supply and
demand in crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products

NTI gross margin decreased primarily due to lower crack spreads on barrels sold during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and a volume decrease in barrels sold due to lower throughput in
the three months ended June 30, 2016. Gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, includes a non-cash recovery of NTI's LCM reserve values to state inventories at the
lower of cost or market prices, increasing gross margin by $35.6 million and $38.2 million,
respectively. Other impacts to margin include the net cost of RINs, which was $4.8 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The increase in the net cost was primarily the result of an industry increase in the
unit cost of RINs. Partially offsetting the decrease in overall gross margin was an increase in
NTI's retail gross margins of $2.4 million period over period.
Direct operating expenses. Direct operating expenses increased due primarily to higher refining
personnel costs as a result of higher staffing levels, partially offset by a $3.5 million favorable
settlement related to the remediation of NTI's wastewater lagoon and lower natural gas costs
during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses relates primarily to lower legal expense and lower insurance costs. This
overall decrease was partially offset by higher equity-based compensation expense and higher
costs resulting from shared services provided by Western Refining.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to
increased refining assets placed in service since June 30, 2015.

Refinery gross margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the difference
between net sales and cost of products sold by the refinery's total throughput volumes for the
respective periods presented. Refinery net sales include $6.7 million and $59.0 million related
to crude oil sales during the first six months of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Refinery
gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we believe is useful in evaluating
(3)
refinery performance as a general indication of the excess of the refined product sales amount
over the related cost of products sold. Each of the components used in this calculation (net
sales and cost of products sold) can be reconciled to corresponding amounts included in the
statement of operations. Our calculation of refinery gross margin may differ from similar
calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a
comparative measure. NTI's refinery cost of products sold for the first six months of 2016 and
2015 excludes non-cash lower of cost or market adjustments to state refining inventory values
at the lower of cost or market prices.

Gross margin
Refining gross margins depend on both the price of crude oil or other feedstock and the price of
refined products. Factors affecting the prices of petroleum based commodities include supply and
demand in crude oil, gasoline and other refined products. Supply and demand for these products
depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and
foreign political affairs, production levels, logistics constraints, availability of imports, marketing of
competitive fuels, crude oil price differentials and government regulation.
NTI gross margin decreased primarily due to lower crack spreads on barrels sold in the six
months ended June 30, 2016, partially offset by increased sales volumes of 0.5%. The decrease
in sales and cost of sales was primarily due to lower selling prices of refined products and lower
crude cost, respectively, in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Cost of products sold also
includes the impact of non-cash LCM inventory recoveries of $46.7 million and $49.0 million,
respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 to state inventories at the lower of
cost or market prices. Other impacts to margin include the net cost of RINs, which was $10.3
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $5.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the net cost was primarily the result of an industry increase
in the unit cost of RINs.
Direct operating expenses. The increase in direct operating expenses was due primarily to
higher spending on refinery maintenance projects due to the more temperate weather
experienced in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period. The higher direct operating
expenses were also driven by higher retail personnel costs in the 2016 period. These increases
in costs were partially offset by reduced utilization of third party trucking firms in North Dakota
due primarily to a shift in 2016 whereby NTI is purchasing more crude oil from barrels already on
the pipeline or at storage facilities as opposed to at the wellhead.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses relates primarily to higher equity-based compensation expense resulting from new
grants and performance award adjustments.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to
increased refining assets placed in service since June 30, 2015, the most significant of which
were improvements to a firewater system, truck loading terminal and parking facilities along with
retail stores acquired under capital leases.

Gross margin
WNRL's gross margin increased by $2.5 million primarily due to increased fee based revenue of
$6.8 million resulting from higher mainline movement volumes compared to 2015. Also
contributing to the increase were $2.0 million in asphalt trucking revenues without comparable
activity in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased wholesale fuel margins of
$3.8 million, a decrease of $2.0 million in crude oil truck gathering revenue and a $1.1 million
margin decrease in lubricant sales. Wholesale fuel sales revenues decreased due to a lower
average price per gallon sold in the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $1.60 compared to
$2.08 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Direct operating
expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in maintenance expense of $1.3 million and
operating materials and supplies of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher employee expenses of
$0.8 million that were primarily the result of increased drivers in our truck fleet and outside
support services of $0.5 million due to in-line inspections for pipeline segments and various tank
repairs.
WNRL's logistics maintenance costs are generally cyclical in nature. WNRL's terminal facilities
are subject to recurring maintenance for normal wear and related maintenance costs are
generally consistent from period to period. Routine service cycle for tank inspections and
maintenance at WNRL's storage facilities is generally every 10 years. Pipelines are also subject
to routine periodic inspections. When WNRL changes the service use of a storage tank,
maintenance costs will generally be higher due to increased costs of tank cleaning and
hazardous material disposal. The cost of WNRL's maintenance is dependent upon the level of
repairs deemed necessary as a result of the inspection of the specified asset.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased primarily due to a decrease in professional and legal services of $0.6 million related
to 2015 business acquisition activity.
Gain on disposal of assets, net. The increase in gain on disposal of assets, net was primarily due
to the sale of assets related to WNRL's lubricant sales activities in California during the current
period.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased due to the ongoing
expansion of WNRL's Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems.

Gross margin
WNRL's gross margin increased by $9.2 million primarily due to increased fee based revenue of
$13.0 million resulting from higher mainline movement volumes compared to 2015. Also
contributing to the increase were $3.7 million in asphalt trucking revenues without comparable
activity in 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreased wholesale fuel margins of
$3.2 million, a decrease of $3.3 million associated with crude oil truck gathering revenues and a
$1.8 million decrease in margin from lubricant sales. Wholesale fuel sales revenues decreased
due to a lower average price per gallon sold in the first six months of 2016 of $1.41 compared to
$1.90 for the first six months of 2015.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Direct operating
expenses increased primarily due to an increase in outside support services of $2.2 million due
to in-line inspections for pipeline segments and various tank repairs and higher employee
expenses of $1.9 million resulting from an increase in the number of drivers in our truck fleet,
partially offset by a decrease in chemical expenses of $0.7 million specifically due to price
declines of chemical additives used in the pipeline transportation process and by lower fuel
expense of $0.9 million for our transportation department.
WNRL's logistics maintenance costs are generally cyclical in nature. WNRL's terminal facilities
are subject to recurring maintenance for normal wear and related maintenance costs are
generally consistent from period to period. Routine service cycle for tank inspections and

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased primarily due to decreased professional and legal services of $0.8 million related to
2015 business acquisitions and corresponding debt transactions and other taxes of $0.3 million.
Gain on disposal of assets, net. The increase in gain on disposal of assets, net was primarily due
to the sale of assets related to WNRL's lubricant sales activities in California during the current
period.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased due to assets
capitalized in WNRL's TexNew Mex Pipeline Acquisition and the ongoing expansion of WNRL's
Delaware Basin and Four Corners logistics systems.

Merchandise margin is a measure frequently used in the convenience store industry to
measure operating results related to merchandise sales.
Gross Margin. Retail gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net
sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and
amortization). The decrease in retail gross margin was the result of lower same store retail fuel
gross margin of $1.7 million, partially offset by increased same store merchandise gross margin
of $0.9 million. The net effect of one retail outlet added in April of 2015, four retail outlets closed
in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and one retail outlet added in May of 2016 was an
increase in retail gross margin of $0.2 million.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Direct operating
expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased from the three months ended
June 30, 2015. There was an increase in same store direct operating expenses of $0.5 million
and the net effect of the retail outlet added in April of 2015, four outlets that closed in the third and
fourth quarters of 2015 and one retail outlet added in May of 2016 was a $0.1 million increase in
expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased cardlock employee expenses of
$0.2 million.

Gross Margin. Retail gross margin is a non-GAAP performance measure that we calculate as net
sales (including intersegment sales) less cost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation and
amortization). The net effect of 31 new retail outlets added during January of 2015, one retail
outlet added in April of 2015, four retail outlets closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and
one new retail outlet added during May of 2016 was an increase in retail gross margin of
$2.1 million. The increase in retail gross margin was also the result of increased same store
merchandise gross margin of $1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in cardlock gross margin
of $1.8 million due to lower sales volumes.
Direct Operating Expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Direct operating
expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased from the six months ended June 30,
2015. The net effect of 31 retail outlets added during January of 2015, one added in April of 2015,
four retail outlets closed in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and one new retail outlet added
during May of 2016 was an additional $0.2 million in expenses. Additionally, there was an
increase in same store employee and maintenance expense of $1.1 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, partially offset by a decrease in same store environmental expense of $0.2 million.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased cardlock employee expenses of
$0.5 million.

Outlook
Our refining margins, excluding hedging activities, were weaker at the Gallup, El Paso and St.
Paul Park refineries in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. The
GC 3:2:1 decreased from an average of $22.76 per barrel for the three months ended June 30,
2015, to an average of $13.15 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The GC 3:2:1 for July
2016 averaged $11.84 per barrel.
The St. Paul Park refinery benchmarks its refining margin against the Group 3 6:3:2:1 benchmark
crack spread. The Group 3 6:3:2:1 refers to the approximate refining margin resulting from
processing six barrels of WTI crude oil to produce three barrels of gasoline, two barrels of diesel
fuel and one barrel of residual fuel. Prices are derived from PADD II Group 3 conventional gas
and ultra-low diesel fuel prices and the price of Western Canadian Select (“WCS”) crude oil for
residual fuel. This benchmark decreased from an average of $14.48 per barrel for the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to an average of $8.50 per barrel for the three months ended
June 30, 2016. The Group 3 6:3:2:1 averaged $8.10 per barrel for July 2016.
Both Western and NTI base crude oil purchases on pricing tied to WTI. The WTI
Midland/Cushing differential can have a significant impact on refining margins at El Paso. The
WTI Midland/Cushing differential averaged a discount of $0.17 per barrel for the second quarter
of 2016, which, compared to a discount of $0.60 per barrel that we realized in El Paso during the
second quarter of 2015, negatively impacted our El Paso refining margins in the current quarter.
The WTI Midland/Cushing differential has averaged a discount of $0.51 per barrel thus far in the
third quarter of 2016.
The discounts to WTI for Bakken Shale crude oil and WCS crude oil can have a significant
impact on refining margins at St. Paul Park. The Bakken/WTI discount averaged $0.64 per barrel
for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.06 per barrel for the second quarter of 2015. The
Bakken/WTI discount averaged $0.25 per barrel for July 2016. The WCS/WTI discount averaged
$13.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2016 versus $8.57 per barrel for the second quarter of
2015. The WCS/WTI discount averaged $12.66 per barrel for July 2016.
The prices of crude oil and refined products have been volatile thus far in 2016. Continued
volatility in these prices may impact the carrying value of our inventories and result in additional
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments. An increase in prices, such as we experienced in
the first six months of 2016, may positively impact the carrying value of our inventories, while a
decrease in these prices could negatively impact our inventory carrying values. Also, during the
first six months of 2016, we experienced volatility in the pricing of RINs. We expect continued
volatility as the industry strives to meet RFS obligations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and Western revolving
credit facility availability. To a lesser extent, we also generate liquidity from the issuance of
securities.
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $198.3 million, including NTI cash of
$24.6 million and WNRL cash of $17.6 million, restricted cash of $1.3 million and no direct
borrowings under the Western revolving credit facility. Western had $510.5 million in total
liquidity as of June 30, 2016, defined as Western’s cash and cash equivalents plus net
availability under Western's revolving credit facility. Western, NTI and WNRL had net availability
under their revolving credit facilities of $353.1 million, $229.2 million and $279.3 million,
respectively.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we paid $859.9 million in cash and issued 17.1 million
shares of Western common stock adjusted slightly for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We
incurred $500 million of additional secured indebtedness under the amended term loan credit
agreement to partially fund the Merger consideration. See Note 21, Acquisitions, in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
WNRL borrowed $145.0 million under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility on October 30, 2015,
to partially fund the purchase of Western's TexNew Mex Pipeline System. WNRL repaid
$125.0 million of its outstanding direct borrowings under the WNRL Revolving Credit Facility
during the six months ended June 30, 2016. We had direct borrowings of $7.5 million under the
NTI revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2016. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt, in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information regarding our financing.
On May 16, 2016, WNRL entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the issuance and
sale by WNRL of 3,750,000 common units representing limited partner interests in WNRL. The
closing of the offering occurred on May 20, 2016. WNRL also granted the underwriter an option to
purchase up to 562,500 additional WNRL common units on the same terms. The underwriter fully
exercised the option on June 1, 2016. See Note 22, WNRL, in the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Our board of directors has periodically approved various share repurchase programs authorizing
us to repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock, per program. Our board of
directors approved our current $200 million share repurchase program in September of 2015 (the
"September 2015 Program") that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. We have
repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $75.0 million under the
September 2015 Program. As of June 30, 2016, we had $125.0 million remaining in authorized
expenditures under the September 2015 Program.

Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
Commodity price fluctuation is our primary source of market risk.
Commodity Price Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as
well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations. Our financial results
can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices that depend on many factors,
including demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products; changes in the economy;
worldwide and domestic production levels; worldwide inventory levels; and governmental
regulatory initiatives. Our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may
utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations or to
fix sales margins on future gasoline and distillate production.
In order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility, we have generally applied
a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level. In the past,
circumstances have occurred, such as turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand, that
have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level. We
may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances.
We maintain inventories of crude oil, other feedstocks and blendstocks and refined products with
values that are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by worldwide economic
conditions, regional and global inventory levels and seasonal conditions.
At June 30, 2016, we held 10.6 million barrels of crude oil, refined product and other inventories
valued under the LIFO valuation method with an average cost of $63.81 per barrel. At June 30,
2016, the excess of the current cost of our crude oil, refined products and other feedstocks and
blendstocks inventories over aggregated LIFO costs was $113.8 million.
All commodity futures contracts, price swaps and options are recorded at fair value and any
changes in fair value between periods are recorded under cost of products sold in our
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We selectively utilize commodity hedging instruments to manage our price exposure to our LIFO
inventory positions or to fix margins on certain future sales volumes. The commodity hedging
instruments may take the form of futures contracts, price and crack spread swaps or options and
are entered into with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy. The financial instruments
used to fix margins on future sales volumes do not qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore,
changes in the fair value of these hedging instruments are included in income in the period of
change. Net gains or losses associated with these transactions are reflected within cost of
products sold at the end of each period.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of the Business
Northern Tier Energy LP ("NTE LP", "NTI" "Northern Tier" or the "Company") is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Western Refining, Inc. ("Western") operating as a downstream energy company
with refining, retail and logistics operations that serve the Petroleum Administration for Defense
District II (“PADD II”) region of the United States. NTE LP holds 100% of the membership interest
in Northern Tier Energy LLC (“NTE LLC”). NTE LP is a master limited partnership (“MLP”) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.
NTE LP includes the operations of NTE LLC, St. Paul Park Refining Co. LLC (“SPPR”), Northern
Tier Retail Holdings LLC (“NTRH”) and Northern Tier Oil Transport LLC (“NTOT”). NTRH is the
parent company of Northern Tier Retail LLC (“NTR”) and Northern Tier Bakery LLC (“NTB”). NTR
is the parent company of SuperAmerica Franchising LLC (“SAF”). SPPR owns a 17% interest in
MPL Investments Inc. (“MPLI”) and a 17% interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC
(“MPL”). MPLI owns 100% of the preferred interest in MPL, which owns and operates a 465,000
barrel per day (“bpd”) crude oil pipeline in Minnesota (see Note 6). NTOT is a crude oil trucking
business in North Dakota that collects crude oil directly from wellheads in the Bakken shale and
transports it to regional pipeline and rail facilities.
Western indirectly owns 100% of both Northern Tier Energy GP LLC ("NTE GP") and NTE LP.
Western, through its subsidiary NT InterHold Co LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NT
InterHold Co") as the owner of the general partner of NTE LP, has the ability to appoint all of the
members of the NTE GP's board of directors.
On December 21, 2015, Western and NTE LP announced that they had entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21, 2015 ("the Merger Agreement") with
NTE GP and Western Acquisition Co, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Western ("MergerCo") whereby Western would acquire all of Northern Tier's
outstanding common units not already owned by Western (the "Merger"). Under the terms of the
Merger Agreement, each NTI common unit held by a Northern Tier unitholders other than
Western and its subsidiaries (“NTI Public Unitholders”) was converted into the right to receive,
subject to election by the NTI Public Unitholders and proration, (i) $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a
share of Western common stock, (ii) $26.06 in cash without interest or (iii) 0.7036 of a share of
Western common stock. The election was subject to proration to ensure that the aggregate cash
paid and Western common stock issued in the Merger will equal the total amount of cash and
number of shares of Western common stock that would have been paid and delivered if all NTI
Public Unitholders received $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a share of Western common stock per
Northern Tier common unit. On June 23, 2016 following the approval of the Merger by NTI
common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was
successfully completed. The transaction resulted in approximately 17.1 million additional shares
of WNR common stock outstanding. Subsequent to this transaction, NTI continues to exist as a
limited partnership and became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western (see Note 19).
As of June 30, 2016, the St. Paul Park refinery owned by SPPR, which is located in St. Paul
Park, Minnesota, had total crude oil throughput capacity of 97,800 barrels per stream day.
Refining operations include crude fractionation, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, reforming,
alkylation, sulfur recovery and a hydrogen plant. The refinery processes predominately North
Dakota and Canadian crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene,
asphalt, propane, propylene and sulfur. The refined products are sold primarily in the Upper
Great Plains of the United States.
As of June 30, 2016, NTR operated 170 convenience stores under the SuperAmerica brand and
SAF supported 114 franchised stores which also utilize the SuperAmerica brand. These 284
SuperAmerica stores are primarily located in Minnesota and Wisconsin and sell gasoline,
merchandise and, in some locations, diesel fuel. There is a wide range of merchandise sold at
the stores including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. The merchandise sold
includes a significant number of proprietary items. NTB prepares and distributes food products
under the SuperMom’s brand primarily to SuperAmerica branded retail outlets.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
results for the periods reported have been included. Operating results for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016, or for any other period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements of NTE LP at that
date but does not
90
include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in
the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, appropriately represent, in all material
respects, the current status of accounting policies and are incorporated herein by reference.
Principles of Consolidation
NTE LP is a Delaware limited partnership which consolidates all accounts of NTE LLC and its
subsidiaries, including SPPR, NTRH and NTOT. All intercompany accounts have been
eliminated in these condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s common equity interest in MPL is accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Equity income from MPL represents the Company’s proportionate share of net
income available to common equity owners generated by MPL.
The equity method investment is assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts or
circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When the loss is deemed to be other than
temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in operating income. See Note 6 for further information
on the Company’s equity method investment.
MPLI owns all of the preferred membership units of MPL. This investment in MPLI, which
provides the Company no significant influence over MPLI, is accounted for as a cost method
investment. The investment in MPLI is carried at a value of $6.8 million at both June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, and is included in other noncurrent assets within the condensed
consolidated balance sheets.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Operating Segments
The Company has two reportable operating segments; Refining and Retail (see Note 18 for
further information on the Company’s operating segments). The Refining and Retail operating
segments consist of the following: 
Refining – operates the St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery, terminal and related assets, NTOT
and includes the Company’s interest in MPL and MPLI, and
Retail – comprised of 170 Company operated convenience stores and 114 franchisee operated
convenience stores as of June 30, 2016, primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The retail
segment also includes the operation of NTB.
Inventories
Crude oil, refined product and other feedstock and blendstock inventories are carried at the lower
of cost or market ("LCM"). Cost is determined principally under the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
valuation method to reflect a better matching of costs and revenues for refining inventories. Costs
include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing
condition and location. Ending inventory costs in excess of market value are written down to net
realizable market values and charged to cost of sales in the period recorded. In subsequent
periods, a new LCM determination is made based upon current circumstances relative to, and not
to exceed, the original LCM reserve that was established in fourth quarter 2014. The Company
has LIFO pools for crude oil and other feedstocks and for refined products in its Refining segment
and a LIFO pool for refined products inventory held by the retail stores in its Retail segment.
Retail merchandise inventory is valued using the average cost method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Such assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
•
•
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized based on the fair value of the asset.
When property, plant and equipment depreciated on an individual basis is sold or otherwise
disposed of, any gains or losses are reported in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income. Gains on the disposal of property,
91
plant and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of sale. If a loss
on disposal is expected, such losses are generally recognized when the assets are classified as
held for sale.
Expenditures for routine maintenance and repair costs are expensed when incurred. Refinery
process units require periodic major maintenance and repairs that are commonly referred to as
“turnarounds.” Turnaround cycles vary from unit to unit but can be as short as one year for
catalyst changes to as long as six years. Turnaround costs are expensed as incurred.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility due to fluctuations in crude oil,
refined products, and natural gas prices. The timing of certain commodity purchases and sales
also subject the Company to earnings and cash flow volatility. To manage these risks, the
Company may use derivative instruments associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil,
refined products, and natural gas to hedge volatility in our refining and operating margins. The
Company may use futures, options, and swaps contracts to manage price risks associated with
inventory quantities above or below target levels. Crack spread and crude differential futures and
swaps contracts may also be used to hedge the volatility of refining margins.
All derivative instruments, except for those that meet the normal purchases and normal sales
exception, are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are
classified depending on the maturity date of the underlying contracts. Changes in the fair value of
the Company's contracts are accounted for by marking them to market and recognizing any
resulting gains or losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. Gains and losses from derivative activity specific to managing price risk
on inventory quantities both above and below target levels are included within cost of sales.
Derivative gains and losses are reported as operating activities within the condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company enters into crude oil forward contracts to facilitate the supply of crude oil to the
refinery. These contracts may qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception
because the Company physically receives and delivers the crude oil under the contracts and
when the Company enters into these contracts, the quantities are expected to be used or sold
over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business. These transactions are
reflected in the period that delivery of the crude oil takes place. When forward contracts do not
qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, the contracts are marked to market each
period through the settlement date, which is generally no longer than one to three months.
Renewable Identification Numbers
The Company is subject to obligations to generate or purchase Renewable Identification
Numbers ("RINs") required to comply with the Renewable Fuels Standard. The Company's
overall RINs obligation is based on a percentage of domestic shipments of on-road fuels as
established by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). To the degree the Company is
unable to blend the required amount of biofuels to satisfy its RINs obligation, RINs must be
purchased on the open market to avoid penalties and fines. The Company records its RINs
obligation on a net basis in accrued liabilities when its RINs liability is greater than the amount of
RINs earned and purchased in a given period and in other current assets when the amount of
RINs earned and purchased is greater than the RINs liability.
In 2010 and 2011, the EPA issued partial waivers with conditions allowing a maximum of 15%
ethanol to be used in certain vehicles. Future changes to existing laws and regulations could
increase the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum
fuels. Because the Company does not produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of
renewable fuels that must be blended into its products could displace an increasing volume of
the Company's refineries' product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and materially
adversely affecting our ability to issue dividends to the Company's unitholders. The purchase
price for RINs is volatile and may vary significantly from period to period. Historically, the cost of
purchased RINs has not had a significant impact upon the Company's operating results. The
Company anticipates 2016 will be consistent with this history.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services are provided to customers, title
is transferred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenues are recorded net of discounts granted to customers. Shipping and other transportation
costs billed to customers are presented on a gross basis in revenues and cost of sales.
Nonmonetary product exchanges and certain buy/sell crude oil transactions, which are entered
into in contemplation one with another, are included on a net cost basis in cost of sales. The
Company also enters into agreements to purchase and sell crude oil to third parties and certain
of these activities are recorded on a gross basis.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income excludes depreciation and amortization of refinery assets and the direct labor and
overhead costs related to the operation of the refinery. These costs are included in the
condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in the
depreciation and amortization and direct operating expenses line items, respectively.
92
Excise Taxes
The Company is required by various governmental authorities, including federal and state, to
collect and remit taxes on certain products. Such taxes are presented on a gross basis in
revenue and cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. These taxes totaled $111.9 million and $107.0 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $218.9 million and $203.0 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Accounting Developments
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,”
which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard’s core principle is that a
company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 which
deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. This guidance will now be effective for the
Company's financial statements in the annual period beginning after December 15, 2017. The
Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and does not expect
adoption will have a material impact on NTE's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases,” which replaces the existing
guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840. This new guidance is effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with
early adoption permitted. The guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under
which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.  Both finance
leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (ROU) asset and
a corresponding lease liability.  For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense
and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a
straight-line total lease expense.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption
of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04 "Liabilities – Extinguishment of Liabilities
(Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products," which
aligns recognition of the financial liabilities related to prepaid stored-value products (for example,
prepaid gift cards), with Topic 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, for non-financial
liabilities. In general, certain of these liabilities may be extinguished proportionally in earnings as
redemptions occur, or when redemption is remote if issuers are not entitled to the unredeemed
stored value. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements.
The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will
have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06 "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) –
Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments" which will reduce diversity of practice in
identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments. ASU 2016-06 clarifies that the nature of an
exercise contingency is not subject to the “clearly and closely” criteria for purposes of assessing
whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for
separately as a derivative. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted subject to certain
requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting
standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),"
which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The
guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified
good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The effective date and transition
requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition
requirements of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this
new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote
disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 "Compensation – Stock Compensation,"
which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for equity-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual
forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash
flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements.
The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will
have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As of June 30, 2016, Western indirectly owns 100% of both Northern Tier Energy GP LLC ("NTE
GP") and NTE LP. On December 21, 2015, Western and NTE LP announced that they had
entered into the Merger Agreement with MergerCo and NTE GP whereby Western will acquire all
of NTE LP's outstanding common units not already owned by Western (see Note 19). The
transaction closed on June 23, 2016 (see Note 19).
The Company has engaged in several types of transactions with Western and its subsidiaries
including crude and feedstock purchases, asphalt purchases, finished product purchases and
railcar leases. Additionally, the Company is party to a shared services agreement with Western
and Western Refining Logistics, LP whereby the Company both receives and provides
administrative support services. The shared services agreement was entered into with Western
as of September 1, 2014, and was approved by the Conflicts Committee of the board of directors
of NTE GP. On May 4, 2015, Western Refining Logistics, LP joined as a party to this agreement.
The services covered by the shared services agreement include assistance with treasury, risk
management and commercial operations, environmental compliance, information technology
support, internal audit and legal.
MPL is also a related party of the Company. Prior to September 30, 2014, the Company had a
crude oil supply and logistics agreement with a third party and therefore had no direct supply
transactions with MPL prior to that date. Beginning on September 30, 2014, the Company began
paying MPL for transportation services at published tariff rates. Additionally, the Company owns
a 17% interest in MPL (see Note 6) and generally receives quarterly cash distributions related to
this investment.

4. INCOME TAXES
NTE LP is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. However, NTRH,
the parent company of NTR and NTB, is taxed as a corporation for federal and state income tax
purposes. No provision for income tax is calculated on the earnings of the Company or its
subsidiaries, other than NTRH, as these entities are pass-through entities for tax purposes.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 1.3%
and 2.2%, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effective tax rate
was 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company's consolidated federal and state expected statutory tax rates were 40.4% and 41.7%,
respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the fact that only the retail operations of the
Company are taxable entities.

of cost or market reserve.
In order to state the Company's inventories at market values that were lower than its LIFO costs,
the Company reduced the carrying values of its inventory through LCM reserves of $87.7 million
and $134.4 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
6. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT
The Company has a 17% common equity interest in MPL. The carrying value of this equity
method investment was $87.7 million and $82.1 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of the equity method
investment was $5.8 million and $5.9 million higher, respectively, than the underlying net assets
of the investee, respectively. The Company is amortizing this difference over the remaining life of
MPL’s primary asset (the fixed asset life of the pipeline).
The Company received $4.3 million and $2.1 million in distributions from MPL in the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4.3 million and $5.8 million,
respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Equity income from MPL was
$4.5 million and $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $10.0 million and $7.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,

8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are comprised of franchise rights and trade names amounting to $33.8 million
at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the franchise rights and trade name intangible asset values were $12.4 million and $21.4 million,
respectively. These assets have an indefinite life and are not amortized, but rather are tested for
impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of
the intangible asset has been reduced below carrying value. Based on the testing performed as
of June 30, 2016, the Company noted no indications of impairment.
9. DERIVATIVES
The Company is exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined
products (primarily gasoline and distillate), and natural gas used in its operations. To reduce the
impact of price volatility on its results of operations and cash flows, the Company uses
commodity derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options. The Company
uses the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting
in these instruments. The Company uses swaps primarily to manage its price and margin
exposure. The positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a
daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with the Company's stated commercial
risk management policy. The Company considers these transactions economic hedges of market
risk but has elected not to designate these instruments as hedges for financial reporting
purposes.
The Company recognizes all derivative instruments, except for those that qualify for the normal
purchase and normal sales exception, as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets and any related net gain or loss is recorded as a gain or
loss in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Observable quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 2 as described
in Note 12) are considered to determine the fair values for the purpose of marking to market the
derivative instruments at each period end.
Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk
The Company periodically uses futures and swaps contracts to manage price risks associated
with inventory quantities both above and below target levels. The Company also periodically
uses crack spread and crude differential futures and swaps contracts to manage refining margins.
Under the Company's risk mitigation strategy, it may buy or sell an amount equal to a fixed price
times a certain number of barrels, and to buy or sell in return an amount equal to a specified
variable price times the same amount of barrels. Physical volumes are not exchanged and these
contracts are net settled with cash.
The objective of the Company's economic hedges pertaining to crude oil and refined products is
to hedge price volatility in certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase crude oil
inventories. The level of activity for the Company's economic hedges is based on the level of
operating inventories, and generally represents the amount by which inventories differ from
established target inventory levels. The objective of the Company's economic hedges pertaining
to natural gas is to lock in the price for a portion of the Company's forecasted natural gas
requirements at existing market prices that are deemed favorable.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had open commodity derivative
instruments as follows:

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
The following tables provide information about the fair values of the Company's derivative
instruments as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the line items in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See Note 12 for additional
information related to the fair values of derivative instruments.
The Company is required to post margin collateral with a counterparty in support of our hedging
activities. Funds posted as collateral were $2.5 million and $6.0 million as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The margin collateral posted is required by counterparties and cannot be
offset against the fair value of open contracts except in the event of default. The Company nets
fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same
counterparty under master netting arrangements, including cash collateral assets and
obligations. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis.

Market and Counterparty Risk
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its
risk mitigating arrangements. The counterparties are large financial institutions with long-term
credit ratings of at least BBB+ by Standard and Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s. In the event of default,
the Company may be subject to losses on a derivative instrument’s mark-to-market gains. The
Company does not expect nonperformance of the counterparties involved in its risk mitigation
arrangements.
10. DEBT
ABL Facility
On September 29, 2014, NTE LLC and its subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated
asset-based ABL Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the
lenders and as collateral agent for the other secured parties (the "ABL Facility"). The borrowers
under the ABL Facility are SPPR, NTB, NTR and SAF, each of which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of NTE LLC.
Lenders under the ABL Facility hold commitments totaling $500 million, which is subject to a
borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Facility
matures on September 29, 2019. Borrowings under the ABL Facility can be either base rate
loans plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% or LIBOR loans plus a margin ranging from
1.50% to 2.00%, subject to adjustment based upon the average historical excess availability. The
ABL Facility also provides for a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% per
annum, subject to adjustment based upon the average utilization ratio, and letter of credit fees
ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum payable quarterly, subject to adjustment based upon the
average historical excess availability. The ABL Facility may be used for general corporate
purposes, including to fund working capital needs and letter of credit requirements. The
Company incurred financing costs associated with the new ABL Facility of $3.0 million which will
be amortized to Interest expense, net through the date of maturity.
The ABL Facility is guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by NTE LLC and its subsidiaries
and will be guaranteed by any newly acquired or formed subsidiaries, subject to certain limited
exceptions. The ABL Facility and such guarantees are secured on a first priority basis by
substantially all of NTE LLC's and such subsidiaries’ cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and inventory and on a second priority basis by NTE LLC's and such subsidiaries’
fixed assets (other than real property).
The ABL Facility contains certain covenants, including but not limited to limitations on debt, liens,
investments, and dividends as well as the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio in certain circumstances.
As of June 30, 2016, the borrowing base under the ABL Facility was $290.9 million and
availability under the ABL Facility was $229.2 million (which is net of $54.2 million outstanding
letters of credit and $7.5 million in direct borrowings). The borrowers under the ABL Facility had
$7.5 million in borrowings under the ABL Facility at June 30, 2016, located in Long-term debt on
the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
2020 Secured Notes
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $350.0 million of outstanding
aggregate principal of our 7.125% senior secured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Secured Notes”). A
portion of these notes were issued with an offering premium of $4.2 million, which is being
amortized to Interest expense, net over the remaining term of the notes. Additionally, professional
service costs were incurred in both the issuance of the 2020 Secured Notes and the
establishment of the ABL Facility which are presented within Long-term debt in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of these costs at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 was $10.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively.
The 2020 Secured Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by all
of the Company’s existing and future 100% direct and indirect subsidiaries on a full and
unconditional basis; however, there are certain obligations not
98
guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis as a result of subsidiaries being released as
guarantors. A subsidiary guarantee can be released under customary circumstances, including
(a) the sale of the subsidiary, (b) the subsidiary being declared “unrestricted,” (c) the legal or
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture, or (d) liquidation or
dissolution of the subsidiary. Separate condensed consolidated financial information is not
included as the guarantor company, NTE LP, does not have independent assets or operations.
The 2020 Secured Notes and the subsidiary note guarantees are secured on a pari passu basis
with certain hedging agreements by a first-priority security interest in substantially all present and
hereinafter acquired tangible and intangible assets of NTE LLC and each of the subsidiary
guarantors and by a second-priority security interest in the inventory, accounts receivable,
investment property, general intangibles, deposit accounts and cash and cash equivalents
collateralized by a $500 million secured asset-based ABL Facility with a maturity date of
September 29, 2019. Additionally, the 2020 Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by NTE LP. NTE LP's creditors have no recourse to the
assets of Western and its subsidiaries. Western's creditors have no recourse to the assets of NTE
LP and its subsidiaries. The Company is required to make interest payments on May 15 and
November 15 of each year, which commenced on May 15, 2013. There are no scheduled
principal payments required prior to the 2020 Secured Notes maturing on November 15, 2020.
The outstanding $350.0 million in 2020 Secured Notes are registered with SEC through two
separate registrations occurring in October 2013 and January 2015.
At any time prior to the maturity date of the notes, the Company may, at its option, redeem all or
any portion of the notes for the outstanding principal amount plus unpaid interest and a make-
whole premium as defined in the indenture. If the Company experiences a change in control or
makes certain asset dispositions, as defined under the indenture, the Company may be required
to repurchase all or part of the notes plus unpaid interest and, in certain cases, pay a redemption
premium.
The 2020 Secured Notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability,
subject to certain exceptions, of the Company to incur additional debt or issue preferred equity
interests, to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire its equity interests, to make certain
investments, loans and advances, to sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets, to merge,
consolidate, lease or sell substantially all of the Company’s assets, to suffer a change of control

Western indirectly owns 100% of Northern Tier Energy GP LLC and 100.0% of the limited
partnership interest in NTE LP.
Merger with Western
On December 21, 2015, Western and NTE LP announced that they had entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21, 2015 ("the Merger Agreement") with
NTE GP and Western Acquisition Co, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Western ("MergerCo") whereby Western would acquire all of Northern Tier's
outstanding common units not already owned by Western (the "Merger"). Under the terms of the
Merger Agreement, each NTI common unit held by a Northern Tier unitholders other than
Western and its subsidiaries (“NTI Public Unitholders”) was converted into the right to receive,
subject to election by the NTI Public Unitholders and proration, (i) $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a
share of Western common stock, (ii) $26.06 in cash without interest or (iii) 0.7036 of a share of
Western common stock. The election was subject to proration to ensure that the aggregate cash
paid and Western common stock issued in the Merger will equal the total amount of cash and
number of shares of Western common stock that would have been paid and delivered if all NTI
Public Unitholders received $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a share of Western common stock per
Northern Tier common unit. On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger by NTI
common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger was
successfully completed. The transaction resulted in approximately 17.1 million additional shares
of WNR common stock outstanding. Subsequent to this transaction, NTI continues to exist as a
limited partnership and became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western (see Note 19).
Distribution Policy
Prior to our merger with Western, the Company generally made distributions, if any, within
60 days after the end of each quarter, to unitholders of record as of the applicable record date.
The board of directors of the Company's general partner adopted a policy pursuant to which
distributions for each quarter, if any, would equal the amount of available cash the Company
generated in such quarter, if any. Distributions on the Company's units were in cash. Available
cash for each quarter, if any, was determined by the board of directors of the Company's general
partner following the end of such quarter. Distributions were expected to be based on the amount
of available cash generated in such quarter. Available cash for each quarter was generally equal
the Company's cash flow from operations for the quarter, excluding working capital changes, less
cash required for maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures, reimbursement of expenses
incurred by the Company's general partner and its affiliates, debt service and other contractual
obligations and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of our
general partner deemed necessary or appropriate, including reserves for turnaround and related
expenses, working capital, and organic growth projects. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Company declared and paid a prorated quarterly distribution for the period April
1, 2016, to June 13, 2016, which was paid on June 23, 2016, to unitholders of record as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
99
Subsequent to the merger with Western, Northern Tier changed its distribution policy to distribute
cash to entities controlled directly or indirectly by Western on a discretionary basis with respect to
timing and amount, subject to maintaining cash reserves sufficient to cover expected working
capital needs, turnaround and capital spending needs, debt service, hedging net losses, and
certain other contractual obligations deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors
of our general partner.

quarters in the year ended December 31, 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2016:

From the beginning of the year to immediately prior to our merger with Western on June 23, 2016,
the Company's common units issued and outstanding increased by 114,047, which was primarily
attributable to the conversion of phantom units into common units upon vesting (see Note 14).
Upon our merger with Western, 100% of our limited common units were indirectly owned by
Western.

As defined in GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. GAAP describes three approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the
market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple
valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated
by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income
approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as
cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations
about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be
required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current
replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would
cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted
for obsolescence.
Accounting guidance does not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when
measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. Accounting guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in
100
•
•
•
applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market
participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are
given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest
priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which
transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2 – Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by
market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1,
which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with
internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
The Company uses a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and
endeavors to use the best information available. Accordingly, valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs are favored. The assessment of the significance of a particular input
to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and
liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s current asset and liability accounts contain certain financial instruments, the
most significant of which are trade accounts receivables and trade payables. The Company
believes the carrying values of its current assets and liabilities approximate fair value. The
Company’s fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-
term duration of the instruments, the Company’s historical incurrence of insignificant bad debt
expense and the Company’s expectation of future insignificant bad debt expense, which includes
an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.

14. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
Prior to Northern Tier's merger with Western, the Company maintained the 2012 Long-Term
Incentive Plan ("LTIP"). Effective upon the closing of the Merger, Western's board of directors
adopted and assumed the LTIP and amended and renamed the LTIP to the Northern Tier Energy
LP Amended and Restated 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Amended LTIP"). The Amended
LTIP changed, among other things, the unit of equity from a unit of NTI common partnership
interest to a share of Western common stock and the administrator of the plan was changed from
the board of directors of the NTE GP to the board of directors of Western or its applicable
committee. All unvested equity awards at the time of the Company's merger with Western were
exchanged for new awards under the Amended LTIP consistent with the terms of the Merger
Agreement.
The Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of $3.4 million and $2.9 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively and $8.0 million and $5.5
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively, related to these plans.
This expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

AMENDED LTIP
Approximately 0.2 million Western common share equivalents are reserved for issuance under
the Amended LTIP as of June 30, 2016. The Amended LTIP permits the award of stock options,
restricted stock, phantom stock, dividend equivalent rights, stock appreciation rights and other
awards that derive their value from the market price of Western's common stock. As of June 30,
2016, approximately 0.8 million shares of equity denominated awards and approximately $9.1
million in cash denominated awards were outstanding under the Amended LTIP. The Company
recognized the expense on all LTIP awards ratably from the grant date until all units vested.
Service-based awards generally vested ratably over a three-year period beginning on the
award's first anniversary date and performance-based awards generally vested following the end
of the measurement period which, for the performance-based phantom awards, had traditionally
been three years after the commencement of the measurement period. Compensation expense
related to service-based phantom awards was based on the grant date fair value as determined
by the closing market price on the grant date, reduced by the fair value of estimated forfeitures.
Compensation expense related to performance-based phantom awards was based on the grant
date fair value as determined by either the closing price on the grant date and management's
estimates on the number of units that ultimately vested in the case of awards with company
performance based criteria or by third-party valuation experts in the case of awards with market
based criteria. For awards to employees, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate which was
subject to revision depending on the actual forfeiture experience.
As of June 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost for stock and cash awards under
the Amended LTIP was $22.4 million.
Restricted Common Units
Legacy NTI Service-based Restricted Common Unit Awards
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no restricted common units outstanding as all restricted
common units were exchanged upon the Company's merger with Western. As a replacement for
these awards, for every one unvested outstanding restricted common unit, 1.0323 shares of
Western phantom stock were issued to the participant with all vesting dates remaining
unchanged.

Western Service-based Phantom Stock Unit Awards
As a result of the Merger, both the previously outstanding service-based restricted and phantom
common unit awards were exchanged with 0.8 million service based awards of Western phantom
stock. Upon vesting, Western may settle these awards in common stock, cash or a combination
of both, in the discretion of the board of directors of Western or its applicable committee. The new
Western phantom stock awards participate in dividends on an equal basis with Western's
common shareholders. However, dividends for phantom stock awards are paid in cash only upon
vesting. In the event that unvested phantom stock awards are forfeited or canceled, any unpaid
dividends on the underlying awards are also forfeited by the grantee. For phantom stock awards
outstanding at June 30, 2016, the forfeiture rates ranged from zero to 30%, depending on the
employee pay grade classification.
Legacy NTI Performance-based Phantom Common Unit Awards
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no performance-based phantom common units
outstanding as all performance-based phantom common units were exchanged in accordance
with the Merger. Western issued (a) fixed-value cash denominated awards for the pre-merger
time period pertaining to the legacy NTI performance-based phantom common unit awards
based upon the performance multiples achieved through March 31, 2016 (the most recently
completed quarter prior to the Merger date) and (b) variable-value cash denominated awards for
the post-merger time period pertaining to the legacy NTI performance-based phantom common
unit awards. Both the fixed value and variable value awards were converted to cash
denominated awards at a rate of $21.1049 in cash for every one unvested outstanding
performance-based phantom common unit prior to the Merger.
Pre-Merger Period Service-Based Cash Denominated Awards
As of June 30, 2016, Western had $4.5 million in unvested fixed value, cash denominated
awards applicable to the Company's pre-merger period ("Legacy Performance Awards"). These
awards consisted of performance awards issued in both 2015 and 2016 at a weighted average
performance multiple at the time of conversion of 190.5%. The vesting dates of the Legacy
Performance Awards remained unchanged and are now subject only to service conditions.
These awards have a weighted average term until maturity of 1.8 years. The related expense is
amortized over the remaining service period using the straight-line method and recognized in
selling, general and administrative expenses. In the event that unvested Legacy Performance
Awards are forfeited or canceled, all dividend rights associated with the grant are also forfeited
by the grantee. The forfeiture rates on the Legacy Performance Awards range from 5% to 20%,
depending on the employee's pay grade classification.
Post-Merger Period Performance-Based Cash Denominated Awards
As of June 30, 2016, the Western had $4.6 million in unvested variable value, cash denominated
awards applicable to the Company's post-merger period (the "Performance Cash Award").
Assuming a threshold EBITDA is achieved and the participant meets the service conditions
throughout the vesting term, participants are entitled to a payout under the Performance Cash
Award based on the Company’s achievement of two criteria compared to the performance peer
group selected by the compensation committee of Western's board of directors over the
performance period: (a) return on capital employed, referred to as a performance condition, and
(b) total shareholder return, referred to as a market condition. The average of these two
conditions is then multiplied by a third condition relating to Western's average safety rate over the
performance period relative to the comparable average safety rate of the refining industry as
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and can range between 85% for relatively poor
safety performance to 115% for relatively superior safety performance.
The Company accounts for the performance and market conditions in each Performance Cash
Award as separate liability awards and remeasures the expected liability each period.

15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors one qualified defined contribution plan for eligible employees. Eligibility
is based upon a minimum age requirement and a minimum level of service. Participants may
make contributions of a percentage of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue
Service limits. In 2016, the Company provides a non-matching contribution of 3.0% of eligible
compensation and a matching contribution at the rate of 100% of a participant’s contribution up to
6.0%. Total Company contributions to the Retirement Savings Plans were $1.6 million for both
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4.2 million and $4.0 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Cash Balance Plan
The Company sponsors a defined benefit cash balance pension plan (the “Cash Balance Plan”)
for eligible employees. Company contributions are made to the cash account of the participants
equal to 5.0% of eligible compensation. Participants’ cash accounts also receive interest credits
each year based upon the average thirty-year United States Treasury bond rate published in
September preceding the respective plan year. Participants become fully-vested in their accounts
after three years of service. The net periodic benefit cost related to the Cash Balance Plan for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively,
related primarily to current period service costs.

17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is the subject of, or party to, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of
matters. Certain of these matters are discussed below. While the results of these commitments
and contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the final
resolution of the foregoing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Legal Matters
On February 20, 2015, a customer served a complaint in the United States District Court for the
District of Minnesota alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiff
purports to bring the action also on behalf of others similarly situated and seeks statutory
penalties, injunctive relief, and other remedies. The Company is vigorously defending itself. This
action is in its preliminary stages.
Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the
environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment
and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites.
Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
accruals for remediation and closure obligations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million,
respectively. Of the $8.4 million and $8.6 million accrued, $2.5 million and $2.6 million are
recorded on a discounted basis at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These
discounted liabilities are expected to be settled over at least the next 22 years. At June 30, 2016,
the estimated future cash flows to settle these discounted liabilities totaled $2.9 million, and are
discounted at a rate of 1.95%. Receivables for recoverable costs from the state, under programs
to assist companies in clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks at retail marketing
outlets, and others were $0.1 million and $0.2 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. Costs associated with environmental remediation are recorded in direct operating
expenses in the statement of operations.
On June 3, 2014, SPPR was issued a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Permit/State
Disposal System Permit by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") relating to its
upgraded wastewater treatment plant at its St. Paul Park refinery. This permit required the
refinery to conduct additional testing of its remaining lagoon. The testing was completed in the
fourth quarter of 2014 and following the Company's review of the test results and additional
discussions with the MPCA, the Company plans to close the remaining lagoon. The MPCA
accepted the Company's remediation plan in the fourth quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company estimates the remaining remediation costs to be
approximately $5.9 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, subject to receiving final bids from
contractors. In connection with the Company's December 2010 acquisition of the St. Paul Park
refinery, among other assets, from Marathon Petroleum Company LP ("Marathon"), the Company
entered into an agreement with Marathon which required Marathon to share in the future
remediation costs of this Lagoon, should they be required. During the three months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with
Marathon and received $3.5 million pursuant to this settlement which was recorded as a
reduction of direct operating expenses.
Franchise Agreements
In the normal course of its business, SAF enters into ten-year license agreements with the
operators of franchised SuperAmerica brand retail outlets. These agreements obligate SAF or its
affiliates to provide certain services including information technology support, maintenance,
credit card processing and signage for specified monthly fees.
18. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has two reportable operating segments: Refining and Retail. Each of these
segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they
offer. The segment disclosures reflect management’s current organizational structure.
Refining – operates the St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery, terminal, NTOT and related assets,
and includes the Company’s interest in MPL and MPLI, and
Retail – operates 170 convenience stores primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The retail
segment also includes the operations of NTB and SAF.

19. MERGER TRANSACTION
On December 21, 2015, Western entered into the Merger Agreement, by and among Western,
MergerCo, NTI and Northern Tier Energy GP LLC, the general partner of NTI and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Western (“NTI GP”). On June 23, 2016, following the approval of the Merger
by NTI common unitholders, all closing conditions to the Merger were satisfied, and the Merger
was successfully completed. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, MergerCo merged with and into NTI, the separate limited liability company existence
of MergerCo ceased and NTI continued to exist, as a limited partnership under Delaware law and
as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Western, as the surviving entity in the Merger.
Prior to the Merger, NT InterHoldCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Western ("NT InterHoldCo"), owned 100% of the membership interests in NTI GP
and 38.3% of NTI’s outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in NTI (“NTI
Common Units”). NT InterHoldCo also owned 100% of the membership interests in Western
Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and holder of 100% of the
membership interests in MergerCo (“MergerCo HoldCo”). Following the Merger, NTI GP
Refining  Retail  Other Total
$1,093.1 $138.0 $33.4 $1,264.5
remained the sole general partner of NTI, the NTI Common Units held by Western and its
subsidiaries were unchanged and remained issued and outstanding, and, by virtue of the Merger,
all of the membership interests in MergerCo automatically converted into the number of NTI
Common Units (excluding any NTI Common Units owned by Western and its subsidiaries)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Consequently, NT
InterHoldCo and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MergerCo HoldCo, became the sole limited
partners of NTI.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Western paid $859.9 million in cash and issued 17.1 million
shares of Western Common Stock adjusted slightly for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.
Based upon the consideration elections made by NTI common unitholders, this cash and
Western Common Stock was allocated among NTI common unitholders as follows:
NTI common unitholders who made a valid “Mixed Election” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), or who made no election, received $15.00 in cash and 0.2986 of a share of
Western Common Stock for each such NTI common unit held.

NTI common unitholders who made a valid “Cash Election” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) received $15.357 in cash and 0.28896 of a share of Western Common Stock,
prorated in accordance with the Merger Agreement for each such NTI common unit held.
NTI common unitholders who made a valid “Stock Election” (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) received 0.7036 of a share of Western Common Stock for each such NTI common
unit held.
