foreign elements bent on undermining the peace and reconciliation process,   
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the outcome of the pledging conference held in Brussels, on 
22 and 23 April 2009, as it constitutes a sign of renewed commitment by the international

human rights and international humanitarian law by legal provisions, law enforcement and 
activities to protect the civilian population,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the commitment made by the Transitional Federal Government to ensure
