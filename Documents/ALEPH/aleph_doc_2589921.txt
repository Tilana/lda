DATE AND SIGNATURES PAGE
This  report  is  effective  as  of  11  May  2016.  See  Appendix  A,  Feasibility  Study  Contributors  and  Professional  Qualifications,  for  certificates  of  qualified
persons. These certificates are considered the date and signature of this report in accordance with Form 43-101F1.
Cautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Reserves and Resources
Reserve and resource estimates included in this report have been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for
Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral
Reserves. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for public disclosure by a Canadian company
of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the
United  States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),  and  reserve  and  resource  information  contained  in  this  report  may  not  be  comparable  to
similar  information  disclosed  by  U.S.  companies.  In  particular,  the  term  "resource"  does  not  equate  to  the  term  "reserves".  Under  U.S.  standards,
mineralization  may  not  be  classified  as  a  "reserve"  unless  the  determination  has  been  made  that  the  mineralization  could  be  economically  and  legally
produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.
The SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning "measured mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources"
or "inferred mineral resources" or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute "reserves" by U.S. standards in
documents  filed  with  the  SEC.  You  are  cautioned  not  to  assume  that  resources  will  ever  be  converted  into  reserves.  You  should  also  understand  that
"inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. You
should also not assume that all or any part of an "inferred mineral resource" will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated
"inferred mineral resources" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. You are cautioned not to assume that all or
any  part  of  an  "inferred  mineral  resource"  exists  or  is  economically  or  legally  mineable.  Disclosure  of  "contained  ounces"  in  a  resource  is  permitted
disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute "reserves" by SEC
standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of "reserves" are also not the
same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as "reserves" under SEC standards. Accordingly, information
concerning mineral deposits set forth in this report may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S.
standards.

Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project
Form 43-101F1 Updated Pre-Feasibility Study
1.
SUMMARY

xx
The Bayovar 12 project, located within the Sechura basin in northern Peru, hosts a major deposit of what is considered to be the most reactive sedimentary
phosphate rock in the world (Reactive Phosphate Rock or “RPR”). The project’s relatively simple mine plan and flow sheet will produce a natural phosphate
fertilizer that is suitable for use as direct application phosphate rock (DAPR) that can be applied directly to many soils without the need for conventional acid
pre-treatment of the rock or the addition of other manufactured chemical compounds. Sechura RPR, due to its high reactivity, can outperform more expensive
and non-organic single and triple-superphosphate fertilizers when used in tropical soil and climatic conditions.
The Project has been investigated here as an open pit mine and beneficiation plant to produce 24% P2O5 and 28% P2O5 DAPR products for local and
international markets that will be suitable for organic certification. The results of this updated prefeasibility study indicate that phosphate resources contained
on the Bayovar 12 concession are both technically and commercially feasible to produce and ship these DAPR products in both the near and long-term
development of the concession.
The original PFS dated December 11, 2015 was based on producing two direct application phosphate rock (DAPR) products, one at 24% P2O5 and the
other at 28% P2O5 in parallel process lines that were each capable of producing 500,000 tonnes of DAPR per year (mtpa). The first process line started at a
reduced capacity of 300,000 mtpa in Year 1 ramping up to full production in Year 4. The second process line commenced at full production (500,000 mtpa) in
Year 3.
The  results  of  the  original  PFS,  while  not  unacceptable  by  comparative  standards,  were  deemed  by  FCV  to  be  inadequate  to  obtain  attractive  project
financing so it undertook a new look at The Project to improve the project economics. The mineral resources stayed the same but a new mine plan was
developed to shorten waste rock hauls while making the 13 phosphate beds more accessible. The two process lines were combined into a single process
line having a capacity of 1 million mtpa. The same two products, 24% P2O5 DAPR and 28% P2O5   DAPR, will be batch-produced from the single process
line. The new mine plan and project design were estimated for capital and operating costs, and an updated financial model was developed. This report is the
PFS Update to the original Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project PFS report.
1.1
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND OWNERSHIP
The Bayovar 12 concession is located in the Province of Sechura, Department of Piura in northwestern Peru. The property is located approximately 950 km
north of the Peruvian capital, Lima, 65 km south of the town of Sechura and 90 km southwest of Piura. The concession is approximately 40 km east of the
fishing village of Puerto Rico, which is situated on the southern margin of Sechura Bay on the Pacific coast of Peru.
The Bayovar 12 concession is located approximately 15 km northeast of Vale’s operating Miski Mayo Phosphate Mine and directly east of the Fosfatos del
Pacifico (FOSPAC) phosphate reserve area.
The concession is connected by sealed road to tidewater and the JPQ marine port facilities 40 km to the west, which is owned by Focus’s Peruvian partners,
Trabajos  Maritimos  S.A.  and  Inca  Terminals  and  Mining  Inc  who  are  marine  transport  and  service  providers.  The  marine  port  facility  is  used  by  JPQ
principally for the export of gypsum currently mined from the Bayovar 12 Concession and for phosphate rock produced locally from adjacent concessions.
The JPQ port terminal was previously used to export phosphate rock extracted from the Bayovar Mine, prior to its acquisition by Vale.

MINERAL TENURE
1
Juan Paolo Quay S.A.C (JPQ) is the title holder of the Bayovar 12 mining concession. On March 26, 2015, Focus (via Peruvian subsidiary Agrifos) acquired
an outright 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ, by paying $4 million cash to the owners of JPQ. The remaining 30% interest in JPQ is owned by
Trabajos Maritimos S.A. and Inca Terminals and Mining Inc., subsidiaries of Grupo Romero (Peru) and Mamut Andino C.A. (Ecuador), respectively.
The Bayovar 12 Concession comprises 12,575 hectares and was acquired by JPQ in 2007 under a contract with state company Activos Mineros S.A.C. for
the exploitation of gypsum rock by open pit methods from the claim.
1.3
GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION
The Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit occurs in the Sechura Basin, a shallow north trending basin situated in northwestern Peru. The basin is filled by a
thick sequence of interlayered marine sediments including phosphorite, diatomite, sandstone, shale and volcanic tuff, ranging in age from Eocene (56.0 to
33.90 Ma) at the base to Pliocence (5.33 to 2.58 Ma) in the upper basin.
The phosphate bearing units occur in the upper 135 to 215 m of the Miocene (23.22 to 5.33 Ma) strata in the basin, within the Zapallal Formation. The
phosphorite beds are comprised primarily of massively bedded phosphate pellets with lesser grains and fragments of diatoms, volcanic glass; evaporate
salts; quartz; feldspar; sponge fragments; gypsum, mica flakes and organic matter. The phosphate is marine in origin and is generally in the form of the
mineral francolite, a fluorhydroxycarbonate apatite.
The apatite is generally in the form of individual pellets although agglomerations of pellets, oolites, laminae, nodules and fragments of teeth, bones or shells
are also present. The pellet grain size ranges from 0.4 to 2.0 mm in diameter, with larger pellets occurring in the phosphorite beds while finer grained pellets
occur in the diatomite.
The diatomite ranges in color from white to brown to olive green. The diatomite generally has high porosity, often on the order of 90%; as a result of this and
its resistance to compaction, the specific gravity is very low, typically the wet density is around 1.5.
The Zapallal Formation stratigraphy dips gently to the east within the Bayovar 12 Concession. No faulting or folding was identified within the concession.
Focus has intercepted 16 distinct and correlatable phosphorite beds (identified as PH01 through PH16) across the concession. Focus and Golder have
interpreted the upper 13 phosphorite beds (PH01 to PH13) as Diana ore zone beds that have been modeled as mineral resources. The phosphorite beds
range in thickness from 0.31 meters to 1.76 meters. The individual phosphorite beds exhibit relatively uniform thickness and P2O5 grade profiles across the
concession; however, there is a pronounced zonation of P2O5 grades in both the phosphorite and diatomite beds that effectively divides the Diana ore zone
into an Upper Diana ore zone and Lower Diana ore zone.
1.4
EXPLORATION STATUS
Detailed exploration drilling activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to the Phase 1 (2014) and Phase 2 (2015) Focus exploration
programs.
The Phase 1 exploration program resulted in the completion of 20 HQ (63.5 mm core diameter) vertical core holes totaling 2,027 m while the Phase 2
exploration program added an additional 42 HQ vertical core holes totaling 3,944 m for an overall project total of 62 drill holes and 5,971 m. The drill hole
total depths for both programs ranged from 81 to 131 m (mean of 96 m); total depth variation was due to the location relative to the Tablazo.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

The Phase 1 drilling was conducted on a nominal 800 by 800 m spaced grid covering approximately 27.36 km2 (2,736 Ha) of the total 125.75 km2 (12,575
Ha) of the Bayovar 12 Concession. The Phase 1 drilling program concentrated on the western portion of the Bayovar 12 Concession.
The Phase 2 drilling expanded the nominal 800 by 800 m spaced drilling grid towards the east of the Phase 1 drilling, while also including some closer 400
by 400 m spaced drilling to allow for evaluation of shorter range thickness and grade variability. As of the effective date of this technical report, a significant
portion (approximately 65%) of the concession remained undrilled.
1.5
DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS
As of the effective date of this technical report there has been no phosphate development work undertaken on the Bayovar 12 Concession.
Mining activity on the Bayovar 12 Concession property is limited to small scale surface mining of quaternary age gypsum that occurs at surface on the low
ground immediately east of the Tablazo. The gypsum mining operation is carried out by JPQ, using a dozer to push the gypsum into piles that are then
loaded  on  to  a  small  road  haul  truck  using  an  excavator.  The  gypsum  is  then  transported  by  truck  to  the  JPQ  port  facility  on  Sechura  bay  where  it  is
stockpiled prior to loading onto ships.
1.6
MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES
1.6.1
Mineral Resource
Mineral Resources are subdivided into classes of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, with the level of confidence reducing with each class respectively.
Mineral Resources are always reported as in situ tonnage and are not adjusted for mining losses or mining recovery.
Geological modelling and subsequent mineral resource estimation was performed by Golder in accordance with Golder internal modelling and resource
estimation guidelines and in accordance with the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines (May 2003 edition).
The  geological  data  compilation,  interpretation,  geological  modelling  and  Mineral  Resource  estimation  methods  and  procedures  are  described  in  the
following sections.
1.6.2
Geological Database and Interpretation
All  available  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  drill  hole  data  and  observations  provided  by  Focus  were  compiled  and  loaded  into  a  geological  database.  Golder
independently reviewed all phosphorite bed picks and correlations. The phosphorite-diatomite contact roof and floor picks performed by the Focus drill site
geologists were reviewed by Golder using the drill hole descriptive geological logs, core photographs and the down hole analytical results.
Once the drill hole geological intervals were reconciled with the downhole analytical results, Golder performed a review of the overburden, phosphorite and
diatomite  bed  correlation  interpretations  that  were  provided  by  Focus.  Correlation  fences  were  created  in  both  the  east-west  and  north  south  directions
across the Bayovar 12 Concession. All 62 of the Focus drill holes were included in the correlation fences.

1.6.3
Stratigraphic and Structural Model
3
Stratigraphic and structural data from the verified geological database was imported to the StratModel™ application of the Ventyx MineScape geological
modelling and mine planning software in preparation for the construction of a gridded stratigraphic and structural model.
The stratigraphic grid model comprises gridded structure surfaces for each modeled overburden, phosphate, interburden and underburden unit. The structure
grids created represent the individual unit roof, floor, vertical thickness (roof minus floor) and true thickness. The stratigraphic model is based on a series of
gridded elevation and thickness horizons, with grid cell geometry of 50 by 50 m (east-west by north-south).
There were no faults included in the Bayovar 12 model schema as none were identified in the drill hole geological data nor were any faults identified in a
review of the regional geological mapping coverage for the area surrounding the Bayovar 12 Concession.
1.6.4
Density/Specific Gravity
To facilitate the conversion of modelled volumes to tonnes Golder calculated dry basis and wet basis relative density values for all modelled phosphorite
beds and waste units using relative density and moisture analyses data collected during the Phase 2 exploration drilling program. In a similar manner,
default dry basis and wet basis relative density values were calculated for the diatomite interburden units and the overburden and underburden units.
1.6.5
Grade Model
Using the verified modelling database and the finalized stratigraphic  and  structural  model,  a  phosphate  grade  gridded  model  was  developed  using  the
StratModel application of MineScape. The grade model was developed using the same 20 by 20 m spaced grid that was used for the stratigraphic and
structural grid model.
The grade grid model comprises gridded surfaces for each modeled grade parameter for each individual phosphate and diatomite bed; the grade model grid
surfaces are spatially associated with the corresponding stratigraphic model grid surfaces. The grade parameters included in the model were: P2O5; Al2O3;
CaO; Fe2O3; MgO; and SiO2.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
No metallurgical testing has been performed prior to 2014 on the phosphorite layers underlying the Bayovar 12 Concession. The phosphorite layers are
extensive and similar to those being mined by Vale (Bayovar Concession 2) and to those being developed by Fosfatos del Pacifico (Bayovar Concession 9).
The unconsolidated phosphorite layers from Concessions 2 and 9 do not require grinding. The bench-scale test program for Bayovar 12 phosphorite layers
examined the proven unit operations for recovering concentrate from the ore at Concessions 2 and 9.
The bench-scale testing in 2014/15 was performed by Jacobs Engineering (Jacobs) to develop a process for recovering a phosphate rock product from the
Bayovar 12 phosphorite layers. The work by Jacobs is summarized in the reports “Beneficiation Testing Focus Ventures Ltd.,” “Scrubbing, Settling, and
Filtration Testing” and “Focus Bench Scale Flow Sheet Validation”.
1.7.1
Metallurgical Samples
The metallurgical testing was performed on two sets of samples.
Focus Ventures geology team in Peru took the first set of samples from air-dried drill cores. Jacobs’ preparation and characterization of these samples are
described in Sections 13.1.1 and 13.1.2. Testing these samples was directed at
M3-PN140103

recovering a phosphate rock concentrate containing +29% P2O5 that was suitable for conversion to phosphatic fertilizer by acidulation and granulation.
The second sample set comprised two composite samples – one for phosphorite layers 2 through 6 and the other for phosphorite layers 11 to 13, both of
which had been prepared by ALS, an analytical laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia. ALS had previously dried and crushed the cores to obtain a
representative  sample  for  chemical  analysis.  The  two  representative  composites  were  prepared  from  PQ  diameter  drill  core  drilled  specifically  for
metallurgical test work. Testing these samples was directed at recovering a concentrate containing +24% P2O5 that was suitable for use as direct application
phosphate rock (DAPR). Jacobs’ chemical analysis of these two composites is discussed in Section 13.1.4.
1.7.2
Bench-Scale Tests Of Individual Layer Samples
1.7.2.1
Drum Scrubbing and Desliming
Drum scrubbing is a proven unit operation for disaggregating unconsolidated phosphorite. The retention time and slurry % solids for drum scrubbing were
investigated using the larger composite samples (PH02, PH06, and PH13).  The scrubbing parameters selected for subsequent tests were 37% solids slurry
and 3 minutes retention time for all 13 composite samples.
When the confirmation tests were performed on each composite sample, the samples were moistened to about 30% moisture prior to scrubbing at 37% solids
for 2 minutes.
1.7.2.2
Attrition Scrubbing and Desliming
The purpose of attrition scrubbing is to disaggregate the remaining diatomite so that it can be removed by desliming. One stage and two-stage attrition were
tested. The lab data indicated that the % P2O5 of the deslimed attrition cell discharge was not significantly different for one or two stage attrition; however, two
stage attrition reduced the recovery of P2O5 by as much as 6%.
Drum scrubbing used moist samples diluted to 37% solids with 3 minutes retention time. Attrition scrubbing used the +53 µm from the drum discharge diluted
to 55% solids with 12 minutes retention time. The deslimed attrition cell discharge, including the >600 mm, contained 26.1% P2O5 on average, which is
below the normal minimum for phosphate rock sold for use in phosphoric acid plants, but is suitable for use as DAPR.
The final washed products were sieved at 600 µm and 150 µm to determine which fraction was causing the grade dilution. Except for PH01, the grade
dilution was consistently caused by the 150/53 µm fraction, which averaged 22.7% of the composite weight and 23.8% P2O5. Combining the +600 µm and
the 600/150 µm fractions gave an average yield of 19.9% weight with 29.5% P2O5, which meets the normal minimum for commercial phosphate rock used to
manufacture phosphoric acid, but the yield is low.
To achieve the normal minimum grade for commercial phosphate rock with an improved yield it is necessary to upgrade the 150/53 µm fraction by flotation.
Flotation is not a required component in the current Bayovar 12 flowsheet for the production of DAPR, however results of laboratory test work by Jacobs on
the 150/53 µm fraction can be found in Jacobs, 2015A “Beneficiation Testing Focus Ventures Ltd.”
The apatite mineral at Bayovar 12 has a relatively low P2O5 content due to:
·
CO3 substitution for PO4 in the crystal lattice
·
The apatite grains are not completely liberated
·
Quartz, feldspar, and calcium sulfate are not completely removed by beneficiation
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

The upper layer (PH01) produces lower % P2O5 concentrate with higher cadmium content and therefore will be monitored closely during exploitation. The
chemical compositions of composites PH02 to PH13 indicate that the phosphate rock can readily be converted to phosphoric acid (% P2O5 > 28.5 and
Calcium Oxide Ratio (COR) < 1.65) and high analysis fertilizers (MER < 0.100).
Bayovar  phosphate  concentrates  typically  contain  +5%  CO2.  The  substitution  of  CO3  for  PO4  in  the  crystal  lattice  causes  the  Bayovar  phosphate
concentrates to be highly reactive and well suited for use as direct application phosphate rock (DAPR).
The laboratory data indicate the simple washing flowsheet with desliming at 53 µm can produce a concentrate averaging more than 24% P2O5 except for
layers  PH01  and  PH02.  If  PH01  is  excluded,  the  yield  and  P2O5  grade  average  44.6%  and  24.8%  respectively.  The  average  grade  of  +24%  P2O5  is
acceptable for DAPR. To bring the washed products from PH01 and PH02 up to a grade of 24% P2O5 it will be necessary to coarsen the tertiary slimes cut
point. Similarly, to obtain washed products with a composite grade of 28% P2O5 from layers PH03 to PH13 it will be necessary to coarsen the tertiary slimes
cut point.
1.7.3
Metallurgy Conclusions
Testing of individual phosphorite layers established a robust process for production of a 29% P2O5 concentrate suitable for the manufacture of phosphoric
acid. The same testwork demonstrated that the phosphorite layers were also suitable for the production of two qualities of DAPR. Focus selected the DAPR
flowsheet to take advantage of the ease of beneficiation and unique reactivity of the Bayovar 12 phosphorite ores, and suitability as a natural fertilizer on the
acid/slightly acidic soils typical throughout Latin America. Preliminary analysis indicated that the estimated capital and operating costs of a mine and plant for
producing export quality phosphate concentrate suitable for manufacturing phosphoric acid were greater than for a similar operation producing DAPR.
The data from the same test work were used to establish a simpler flowsheet for producing 24% P2O5 DAPR (Mode A) and 28% P2O5 DAPR (Mode B).
The flowsheet for producing two qualities of DAPR is illustrated as a block flow diagram in Figure 1-1. Mode A produces 24% P2O5 DAPR by (tertiary
desliming) at 53 µm and Mode B produces higher grade DAPR by coarsening the tertiary desliming cut point to reject lower grade near size material. The
hydrosizer (tertiary) cut point may be adjusted by increasing the teeter bed density set point and increasing the flow of teeter water.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION AND CLASSIFICATION
Phosphate Mineral Resources were estimated for each individual phosphorite bed from PH01 through PH16.
Resource volumes and grade were estimated for each phosphorite and diatomite bed using the corresponding unit roof and floor grids from the structural grid
model. The volumes for each phosphorite and diatomite bed were then converted to tonnes using the phosphorite bed specific relative density values.
Mineral  resources  have  been  classified  into  Measured,  Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  using  area  of  influence  polygons  around  points  of
observation. Classification was performed individually for each phosphorite bed using drill hole intercepts on the floor of the unit for the location of the point
of observation. The area of influence polygons were
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

generated on the floor surface for each phosphorite bed rather than on the horizontal plane to allow for the dip of stratigraphy.
Golder performed a statistical and geostatistical analysis of the phosphorite bed thickness and P2O5 grade data. Given the relatively limited dataset (62 drill
holes) and the general uniformity of thickness and grade across the concession area for most of the phosphorite beds, the preliminary review of the thickness
and P2O5 variograms suggested a broad range for the variograms.
The resultant areas of influence classification parameters used by Golder for the Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral Resource estimate are as follows:
·
Measured Mineral Resources – 400 m spacing between points of observation
·
Indicated Mineral Resources – 800 m spacing between points of observation
·
Inferred Mineral Resources – 1,600 m spacing between points of observation

MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES
1.9.1
Estimated Phosphorite Reserves
The Bayovar 12 phosphate deposit has been delineated over an area of approximately 34 km2. The deposit consists of sixteen mineralised units. This
Mineral Reserve Estimate only concerns the upper 13 of the 16 total modelled units (capas). The lower three beds, PH14, PH15 and PH16, were excluded
from the mineral reserve estimate due to limited thickness and low grades.
1.9.2
Mining Model Development
1.9.2.1
Criteria for Determination of ROM Phosphorite
Run of Mine (ROM) mining surfaces were created to account for anticipated 7.5-cm roof and 7.5-cm floor dilution gain where the phosphorite capa was
greater than the minimum mineable thickness of 30 cm. These assumed dilution and mining loss factors are based on extracting the phosphorite with surface
miners to recover the entire thickness of the
M3-PN140103

8
capas (plus dilution) to calculate ROM tonnages. ROM quality surfaces were also developed to account for the dilution gains using the quality data from the
geological resource model.
1.9.2.2
Beneficiation Plant Yield and Project Quality Model
Beneficiation  plant  yields  were  estimated  using  a  set  of  capa-specific  predictive  equations  that  are  driven  by  the  ROM  (feed)  P2O5  quality.  Yield
recommendations  developed  by  Metallurgy  QP  Glenn  Gruber  and  equations  were  based  on  the  results  of  the  laboratory  testing  performed  on  the
metallurgical, geological holes drilled during 2014 and 2015.
1.9.2.3
Development of the 3D Block Model for Pit Optimisation
After  developing  the  ROM  and  product  surfaces,  the  mineral  resource  model  was  blocked  into  3D  cells  20  m  by  20  m  by  1.6  m  in  the  X,  Y,  and  Z,
respectively, for the purposes of pit optimization, totaling 21.7 M blocks were created. The 20x20x1.6m blocks were sub-blocked to smaller size blocks in
some areas to suspect the capas and interburden boundaries.  The smallest subblock size is 5x5x0.2m.
1.9.2.4
Mineral Reserve Estimation Methodology
The assessment of surface-mineable phosphorite reserves within the Project area was based on a 20-year mine plan open-pit design which accounts for the
effects of highwall laybacks on the estimated 20-year mineable reserve.
The 3D block resource model formed the initial basis of mining volume estimates for the extent of the project area. Using the modifying mining factors and
plant performance yield and quality predictions, the blocks were populated with an economic value for the purpose of conducting Lerchs Grossmann (LG) pit
optimization. Based on the requirement of the 20-year, 1.0 M tonnes phosphate concentrate (product tonnes) per year mine plan, the final pit configuration
was designed on the $90/tonne of phosphate concentrate pit optimizations.
IMC started with the Golder pit design and expanded the design as needed to develop the updated 20 year Mineral Reserve. Pit boundary assessments
were completed by IMC over a range of unit revenue values for phosphate concentrate (i.e., saleable product), with unit costs for mining, processing, general
and administration, production transportation, etc. to assure the robustness of the modified pit design.
The design criteria for the final pit configuration are shown in Table 1-2 below.

For the Bayovar 12 Phosphate Deposit 20-year LOM plan, the total estimated Proven and Probable ROM Reserves are 58.7Mt (dry basis) with an average
ROM P2O5 grade 12.93%. Total phosphate concentrate (product) tonnes after beneficiation are estimated to be 20.70 Mt (dry basis) with an average product
P2O5 grade of 26.24%. The overall ROM strip ratio (SR) is estimated to be 7.19 dry tonnes of waste per dry tonne of ROM phosphorite. The overall product
SR is estimated to be 20.4 Mt (dry) of waste per tonne of phosphate concentrate, requiring the removal of approximately 422.5 Mt of waste over the life of the
mine.
1.9.4
Potential For Future Reserve Expansion
As stated in Section 15.2.4, the Mineral Reserves Estimate is based solely on the 20-year mine plan open-pit design with highwall laybacks and a target
production rate of 1.0 M tonnes (dry) of phosphate concentrate per year. Although Mineral Resources exist outside the 20 year mine plan pit, the mine
schedule and Mineral Reserves were limited to the 20 year pit shell.
1.10
MINING METHOD
The Project Site is contained within a low-lying, open, generally flat area, with elevations varying from 0 m to 30 m above mean sea level (amsl). The
Bayovar 12 phosphorite deposit dips between 1°and 2° toward the north-northeast with sixteen primary capas, thirteen of which will be mined. Front end
loaders (FEL) are the primary method of waste stripping with surface miners to extract the phosphorite and a portion of the interburden. All waste will be
hauled to a waste storage facility (WSF), while phosphorite will be hauled to the plant using trucks.
The  phosphorite  extraction  will  be  executed  by  a  multiple  bench  open-pit  haul-back  mine.  Initial  mining  requires  ex-pit  storage  of  waste  rock,  both
overburden and interburden. Once a sufficient volume has been excavated, the waste rock is back-hauled into the mined-out area.
M3-PN140103
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

For the 1.0 Mtpy mine production plan, overburden will be stripped by Focus personnel. Overburden excavation will advance ahead of the phosphorite
extraction in 5-m height production benches. Interburden will be stripped and removed with a front-end loader, or when the interburden is too thin, a dozer or
surface miner.
To minimize mining dilution while maximizing recovery and production capabilities, the phosphorite will be mined with GPS controlled surface miners.
The mine plan maximizes the number of available production faces for the various capas throughout the plan life in order to accommodate blended plant
feed requirements. Production equipment is included in the plan to source ore from multiple capas and maintain the blend and feed tonnage to the plant. The
ROM stockpile has been designed as “fingers” to enable separation of individual or similar capas to provide feed for both mineral concentrates, which require
slightly different ore characteristics.
The data from the test work were used to develop a flowsheet for producing 24% and 28% DAPR phosphate concentrate. Both mineral concentrates include
scrubbing, attrition, and desliming to reach the required P2O5 concentrate grade. Capas were assigned to a plant operation mode using the majority process
required to reach an acceptable concentrate P2O5 quality of 24% and or 28%. Mode A operation will produce a 24% P2O5 DAPR product through tertiary
desliming at 53µm and Mode B operation will produce 28% DAPR) by coarsening the tertiary desliming at 105µm to reject lower grade near size material.

Optimization was conducted on Measured and Indicated Resources only; Inferred Resources were treated as waste. To prevent the optimized pits from
encroaching on the Bayovar road, a 180-m offset buffer zone were established.
Figure 1-2 shows the pit phases, external waste dumps, and input backfilling where phosphorite mining is completed at the end of Year 5. The 20 year pit
limit is shown as a bold dashed line.  Figure 1-3 shows the pit progress at the end of Year 20.

Mine waste will be used to construct the TSF containment embankment. The Phase 1 TSF embankment (constructed during pre-production) will require
approximately, 2.6 Mm3 of material placed in engineered lifts to 95% compaction. The Phase 2 embankment will require 3.3 Mm3 of engineered material and
construction will need to be completed during years 4 through 6.

The external waste dumps have been designed to store up to 134 M bcm of waste rock with the volume required calculated using a 20% swell factor.
Backfilled waste within the open pit will accommodate 371 M bcm, also using a 20% swell factor for volume calculations.
Maximum in-pit backfill (IB) volumes were determined for each year by offsetting the pit toe 150 m and building lifts in 10 m increments until the facility crest
intersected original topography.
Mine haul road will require upgrading with crushed aggregate to support the weight of the haul trucks given the low bearing capacity of the road surfaces.
Primary mine fleet requirements will include a maximum of two 1000 tph surface miners, four 31 cubic metre FEL, four track dozers, thirty seven 90-tonne
haul trucks with 110 cubic metre coal beds, graders, compactors, water trucks, and other ancillary mining equipment.

RECOVERY METHODS
The phosphate beneficiation plant processes mined phosphate ore to produce phosphate concentrate. The ore is mined from thirteen phosphate-rich capas.
A single plant will beneficiate the Bayovar 12 ore. Mode A will produce on average 500,000 dry mtpy of DAPR concentrate annually with a target grade of
24% P2O5. Mode B will produce 500,000 dry mtpy of DAPR with a target grade of 28% P2O5. The beneficiation process consists of desliming, dewatering to
15%  moisture  and  drying  to  4%  moisture  using  unit  operations  including  drum  washing,  size  classification,  attrition  scrubbing,  hydraulic  classification,
filtering, and fluid bed drying. The process uses seawater throughout: the product is not rinsed with freshwater to remove salts.
Each process plant consists of the following unit operations: as shown in Figure 1-4. Mode A and Mode B are essentially identical except for the cut point for
fines in the tertiary classifying hydrosizer. The cut point will be set at 53 µm to make 24% P2O5 DAPR (Mode A) while the cut point will be set at 105 µm to
make 28% P2O5 DAPR (Mode B).

The test work showed that the phosphate recovery for Mode A is 81.5% P2O5 and for Mode B it is 66.4% P2O5 as shown in Table 1-6 below.

Mode A will process 1.31 million mtpa of ore and produce 500,000 dry mtpy of concentrate with a grade of 24% P2O5. The capas designated for Mode A
contain 11.4 percent P2O5, 6.4 percent water soluble salts (WSS) and 30 percent moisture. Testwork showed that the overall recovery of P2O5  is  81.5
percent. Losses are due to P2O5 reporting to slimes during washing, attrition scrubbing and classification with a 1 percent loss to dust and shrinkage. The
plant operating availability is 85 percent based on 7,446 operating hours per year.
Mode B will process 1.50 million mtpa of ore and produce 500,000 dry mtpy of concentrate with a grade of 28% P2O5. The capas designated for Mode B
contain 14.3 percent P2O5, 3.9 percent water soluble salts (WSS) and 30 percent moisture. Testwork shows that the overall recovery of P2O5 is 66.4 percent.
Losses are due to P2O5 reporting to slimes during attrition scrubbing and classification with a 1 percent loss to dust and shrinkage. The plant operating
availability is 85 percent based on 7446 operating hours per year.

The infrastructure for the Bayovar 12 Project includes site access and concentrate haulage roads, a port facility for shipping concentrate overseas, power
supply and a new power transmission line, a seawater pipeline for process water supply, ancillary building facilities, a reverse osmosis water treatment plant
to deliver desalinated and potable water for human consumption, fire protection and sanitary septic facilities, site communications, and the Tailings Storage
Facility (TSF).
1.12.1
Site Access & Concentrate Haulage
Access to the Bayovar 12 plant is from the Bayovar-Chiclayo Highway, which is located approximately 17 km west of the Pan American Highway.
The  proposed  plan  for  the  Bayovar  12  mine  is  to  haul  concentrate  to  the  Port  of  Bayovar  along  the  Bayovar-Chiclayo  Highway  over  a  distance  of
approximately 43 km to the port facility owned by JPQ shareholders using contractor-owned, 35-tonne end-dumping trailers.
1.12.2
Concentrate Shipping
The project is planning to use the port facilities owned by its partner, JPQ, located in the Port of Bayovar. The facility is a medium depth port that handles
small Handysize ships that have a capacity of 20,000 long tons deadweight (DWT) – 28,000 DWT and Handysize ships, with a capacity of 28,000 – 40,000
DWT. The port has been actively shipping gypsum for JPQ from open stockpiles.
1.12.3
Power Transmission And Main Substation
Utility power is available from a 220 kV power transmission line which runs parallel to the route of the Pan American Highway. To supply power to the
Bayovar 12 plant, a 220 kV 16-kilometer power transmission line from the La Niña substation to the Bayovar 12 main substation will need to be constructed.
It would be stepped down at the main plant substation to the distribution voltage of 13.8 kV.
1.12.4
Seawater Supply System
The Bayovar 12 process plant operates using seawater that will be pumped at a maximum flow rate of 1,978 m3/h. The seawater intake and vertical turbine
pump platforms will be mounted on the existing JPQ ship loading conveyor structure.
The delivery points for the seawater is the plant Seawater Pondfrom which process water will be pumped to the various unit processes. A stream from the
Seawater Pond will be taken to a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant, whose brine product will be discharged to the seawater ponds. The current
design calls for a 36” HDPE seawater pipeline running 45 km from the seawater intake pumps to the seawater ponds. The seawater pipeline will run in an
open trench parallel to the Bayovar-Chiclayo highway.
1.12.5
Water Desalination System
A packaged 4.5 m3/h (20 gpm) reverse osmosis plant has been included to supply desalinated potable water for human use and consumption for each.
These plants can each produce 108 m3/d. The sizing of the RO plant is based on a consumption of 100 gallons per day per person for approximately 300
people on site per day at full production. Each RO plant is a single pass, 8-membrane system based on a fresh water (permeate) recovery of 50% and a salt
rejection of 99.5%.

Tailing Disposal
19
The Bayovar 12 TSF will consist of approximately 9.8 Mm2 of available storage area as shown in Figure 1-6. The TSF is designed so that tailings can be
impounded to a maximum height of 6.0 m, with spillway discharge and 1.0 meter freeboard.
Figure 1-6: Tailing Storage Facility
1.12.7
Surface Water Management
Surface water diversions will be necessary for occasional rains and during El Niño years. Most surface water will report to the open pit where it will be
channeled to collection sumps from where it will be pumped to the seawater or tailings ponds.
Diversion ditches and associated culvert systems, as well as ponds, sumps and pipelines, will be designed to address the majority of surface water flow at
the project site. Water diversions will also be needed along the length of the south side of the Bayovar-Chiclayo highway to protect the berms of the TSF from
erosion to prevent breaching of the slimes in the impoundment.
1.13
MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS
The Bayovar 12 project, located within the Sechura basin in northern Peru, hosts a world-class deposit of what is arguably the most reactive sedimentary
phosphate rock fertilizer in the world (Reactive Phosphate Rock or “DAPR”). The project will produce a highly sought-after, organic DAPR fertilizer. This
product will service the rapidly-growing oil palm market in the Americas, especially the organic palm oil plantations of Colombia and Ecuador, including the
local Peruvian market where phosphate nutrient needs are currently met entirely by imports.

1.13.1
Prices Paid Fob Bayovar For Dapr
20
Two mines close to Focus’ Bayovar project have been producing and selling DAPR for several years. Fosyeiki S.A.C. and Corporación Agrosechura Peru
S.A.C. produce and export ~22-24% P2O5 rock by truck and ship to Ecuador, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Colombia. Fosyeiki’s product is claimed to range from
22-24% P2O5 and its sales volumes appear to be limited by its production capacity. FOB prices by ship to Central America have ranged from US$163 per
tonne to US$195 per tonne. FOB prices achieved by Agrosechura by truck to Bolivia and Ecuador have ranged up to US$220 per tonne.
1.13.2
Price Assumption For 24% P2o5 Dapr Product
Retail prices of DAPR to organic farmers in Peru have remained fairly constant at about US$320 per tonne for the past few years. In Malaysia, Bayovar rock
is currently being marketed by Union Harvest for US$160-170 per tonne. This Prefeasibility Study assumes a wholesale price of US$145 per tonne for
Focus’ 24% P2O5 product.
1.13.3
Price Assumption For 28% P2o5 Dapr Product
Several studies conducted by governmental organizations over the past decade have shown that on plantations located in areas with acidic soils and high
rain fall, Sechura DAPR competes agronomically with Super Single Phosphate (SSP), achieving similar or higher crop yields. Consequently DAPR and
SSP tend to compete directly and prices are similar, as seen in countries such as Brazil.
Focus will therefore be looking to displace SSP sales in South and Central America with a cheaper but more effective product. This Prefeasibility Study
assumes a wholesale price of US$185 per tonne for Focus’ higher grade product, which represents approximately a 25% discount to SSP prices in Latin
America.
1.14
CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
1.14.1
Mining Capital Costs
The estimated capital expenditure or capital costs (CAPEX) for the Bayovar 12 Project consists of two components:
(1) The initial CAPEX to design, permit, pre-strip, construct, and commission the mine, plant facilities, ancillary facilities, and utilities. The initial CAPEX also
includes indirect costs for engineering, construction management, and Owner’s costs.
(2) The sustaining CAPEX for facilities expansions, mining equipment additions, replacements and re-builds, expected replacements of process equipment
and ongoing environmental mitigation activities;
The capital cost estimates reported in this section address the construction of a phosphate beneficiation plant capable of producing one million tonnes of
DAPR concentrate (dry basis) from two process lines at full production.
Capital  requirements  associated  ore  production  include  purchasing  mobile  mine  equipment  for  stripping  overburden,    interburden  material  and  to  mine
phosphorite beds. Preproduction Year -1 mining is capitalized, as are the construction of berms and lifts for the TSF.
All  mining  will  be  performed  by  Focus  using  company-owned  equipment  and  company  employees.  The  mine  plan  for  the  1.0  Mtpy  beneficiated  rock
concentrate production was estimated based on 20 years of production.
Capital expenditures incorporate all mining equipment costs, tailings facility and mine haul road development. The mining cost model includes costs for
ongoing reclamation during the 20 years of operation, but did not take into account
M3-PN140103

Plant Capital Costs
The Bayovar 12 beneficiation plant has been designed to produce 1 million tonnes per annum of 24% Mode A & 28% Mode B DAPR, for an initial plant
capital cost is estimated to be $95.7 million which includes 20% contingency but does not include mining, pre-stripping, Owner’s cost or IGV (Table 1-8).
The sustaining capital cost for the Bayovar 12 plant is based on an unspecified $1 million per year for 20 years totaling $20 million. This sustaining capital
cost is in addition to annual maintenance, services, and supplies that are components of the operating cost estimate. The unspecified sustaining capital
costs would cover replacements of the seawater pumps and slurry pumps, replacement of the vacuum pump for the belt filter, relining of the concentrate
dryer, and similar unscheduled equipment replacements.
Initial CAPEX includes an estimate of contingency based on the accuracy and level of detail of the cost estimate. The purpose of the contingency provision is
to  make  allowance  for  uncertain  cost  elements  which  are  predicted  to  occur,  but  are  not  included  in  the  cost  estimate.  These  cost  elements  include
uncertainties concerning completeness and

OPERATING COSTS
1.15.1
Mine Operating Costs
Operating costs of phosphate ore production including overburden and interburden stripping costs $39.72/tonne of concentrate see Table 1-10.
Overburden stripping, interburden stripping and phosphorite mining will be performed by Focus using company-owned equipment and company employees
The mine cost model assumes the pre-production in Year -1 and that all pre-production mining is capitalized. After start-up, all overburden waste stripping
will be expensed as an operating cost.
The mine plan for the 1.0 million mtpa phosphate concentrate production was estimated based on 20 years of production. The estimates encompassed all
costs associated with all mining, phosphate rock and overburden handling, phosphorite stockpile processing, and other mine support services required for
the delivery of phosphorite ore to the beneficiation plant. The operations support includes estimates for road grading, scraping, dust suppression, haul road
maintenance, and other miscellaneous support activities. The supervision and administration function encompasses the cost of salaried supervisory and
administrative personnel stationed at the mine and pickup truck fleet operations and maintenance.
M3-PN140103

The mine operating cost build up includes: wages for salaried and hourly labor, detailed equipment costs per hour of operation, hours estimates based on
mining  rate  and  haulage  profiles,  estimates  for  equipment  maintenance  consumables  and  labor  hours,  infill  drilling  costs,  dewatering  costs,  and  road
construction costs.

1.15.12
Reclamation And Closure
Much of reclamation is going to be concurrent with mining from the backfilling of the open pit with waste. An allowance for reclamation and closure was
included in the cash flow of $1.26 million for the life of the mine to cover monitoring. Reclamation will be limited to removal of structures that will be offset by
sale of equipment and structures from the plant.
1.15.13
Salvage Value
At end of the mine life an estimated salvage value was shown of $10.0 million has been included mainly from salvaging the large diameter HDPE pipe used
for the seawater supply line, and the tailings line.

Taxation
1.15.14.1
Depreciation
Ten-year straight line method for depreciation has be used for both initial and sustaining capital.
1.15.14.2
Income Tax
A corporate income tax rate of 26% was included in the economic model. This is applied to net profits of the company.   Income taxes paid are estimated to
be $418.1 million.
1.15.14.3
Value Added Tax
Value  added  tax  (IGV)  is  levied  on  the  supply  of  goods  and  services  subject  to  the  tax.  The  financial  model  applies  an  18%  rate  and  IGV  tax  is  also
reimbursed and it is assumed that the IGV paid and IGV recovered are the same; it is shown in the working capital section.

The project was based on a combination of equity and debt financing.
1.15.14.5
Net Income after Tax
Net Income after Tax amounts to $1,189 million.
1.15.14.6
NPV and IRR
The NPV calculation includes Years 1 through 20 and adds the pre-production capital in Years -2 and -1. The economic analysis indicates that the project
has an after-tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 26.3% with a payback period of 3.9 years and a Net Present Value at 7.5% of $457.7 million.
The  sensitivity  analysis  shown  in  Table  1-18  compares  the  project  discounted  cash  flow,  IRR,  and  payback  period  against  the  base  case  when  the

INTRODUCTION

PURPOSE
30
31
In 2015, Focus Ventures Ltd (FCV) commissioned M3 Engineering and Technology Corporation (M3) to prepare a prefeasibility study (PFS) for the Bayovar
12 Phosphate Project (the Project) in Piura Department, Peru. The Project Contains a large, open pittable, soft rock phosphate resource that is areally
extensive across Bayovar Concession #12 in NW Peru.
The original PFS compiled the results of mineral resource estimates, metallurgical studies, mine engineering, process/plant engineering, engineering of
infrastructure, environmental and social studies, development of capital and operating costs, and an indepth financial model. The results were reported in a
January 5, 2016 press release and the PFS was published in February 2016. The technical report conformed to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI
43-101) and summarized the outcomes of an engineering study completed by several authors to Prefeasibility Study (PFS) standards.
The original PFS was based on producing two direct application phosphate rock (DAPR) products, one at 24% P2O5 and the other at 28% P2O5 in parallel
process lines that were each capable of producing 500,000 tonnes of DAPR per year (mtpa). The first process line started at a reduced capacity of 300,000
mtpa in Year 1 ramping up to full production in Year 4. The second process line commenced at full production (500,000 mtpa) in Year 3.
The  results  of  the  original  PFS,  while  not  unacceptable  by  comparative  standards,  were  deemed  by  FCV  to  be  inadequate  to  obtain  attractive  project
financing so it undertook a new change in scope focusing on the mine and plant in order to improve the project economics. The mineral resources remained
unchanged but a new mine plan was developed to shorten waste rock hauls while making the 13 phosphate beds more accessible. The two process lines
were combined into a single process line having a capacity of 1 million mtpa. The same two products, 24% P2O5 DAPR and 28% P2O5   DAPR, will be
batch-produced from the single process line. The new mine plan and project design were estimated for capital and operating costs, and an updated financial
model was developed. This report is the PFS Update to the original Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project PFS report (Effective Date December 18, 2015).
The Project is located in the Sechura desert, a marine depression near the coast of NW Peru. The mine consists of selective open pit mining of phosphate
beds  in  a  sequence  of  diatomite  beds  of  Miocene  age.  The  PFS  Update  investigates  various  aspects  of  the  Project  including  the  land  status,  mineral
resource  development,  mining  methodology,  metallurgy  and  process  methodology,  geotechnical  and  hydrological  characterization,  plant  engineering,
environmental  engineering,  capital  and  operating  cost  estimation  and  financial  analysis  to  determine  whether  the  Bayovar  12  Project  is  technically,
commercially, socially, and environmentally feasible.
FCV began work on the Bayovar 12 concession, one of several mineral concessions in the Sechura desert in 2013.
The mineral resource estimate was completed by Golder Associates (Golder), a global consulting company with a participating office in Calgary, Alberta.
The mineral resources are based on 62 drill holes a have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 (Golder, 2015).
To-date, the following have been completed:
·
Drilling of 62 exploration holes for a total of 5,971 meters of exploration drilling;
·
Developed  mineral  resource  estimates  for  Measured,  Indicated,  and  Inferred,  according  to  CIM  definitions  and  compliant  with  NI  43-101  reporting
requirements,

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
4.1
LOCATION
41
The Bayovar 12 Concession is located in the Sechura Province, Piura Region of northwestern Peru (Figure 4-1). The property is located approximately 950
km north of the Peruvian capital, Lima, 65 km south of the town of Sechura and 90 km southwest of Piura. The concession is approximately 40 km east of the
fishing village of Puerto Rico, situated on the southern margin of Sechura Bay on the Pacific coast of Peru.
The  Bayovar  12  Concession  is  located  approximately  15  km  northeast  of  Vale’s  operating  Miski  Mayo  Phosphate  Mine  Figure  4-2.  The  Bayovar  12
Concession  is  directly  east  of  the  Fosfatos  del  Pacifico  (FOSPAC)  phosphate  reserve  area  and  directly  south  of  the  GrowMax  Agri  Corp.  phosphate
exploration properties.
The concession is connected by sealed road to tidewater and the JPQ marine port facilities 40 km to the west. The marine port facility is used by JPQ
principally for the export of gypsum currently mined from the Bayovar 12 Concession and for phosphate rock produced locally from adjacent concessions.
The JPQ port terminal was previously used to export phosphate rock extracted from the Bayovar Mine, prior to its acquisition by Vale. The JPQ marine port
facilities  are  owned  by  Focus’s  Peruvian  partners,  Trabajos  Maritimos  S.A.  and  Inca  Terminals  and  Mining  Inc,  who  are  marine  transport  and  service
providers. The marine port facility is used principally for the export of gypsum currently mined from the Bayovar 12 Concession and for phosphate rock
produced locally from adjacent concessions. The JPQ port terminal was previously used to export phosphate rock extracted from the Bayovar Mine, prior to
its acquisition by Vale.
The Pan-American Highway crosses the claim at its eastern end and power transmission lines for Vale’s Bayovar Mine transect the Property at its northern
end.
The  following  sections  contain  information  relating  to  mineral  titles,  legal  agreements  as  well  as  permitting  and  regulatory  matters  in  Peru.  The  Golder
Qualified Person is not qualified to verify these matters and has relied upon information provided by Focus including lease agreements and legal opinions
concerning Focus’ mineral and surface rights prepared by Asociado a Baker & McKenzie International, a Peruvian law firm, for the benefit of Focus.
4.2
MINERAL TENURE
Juan Paolo Quay S.A.C (JPQ) is the title holder of the Bayovar 12 mining concession (Cueva, 2015). On March 26, 2015, Focus (via Peruvian subsidiary
Agrifos) acquired an outright 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ, by paying $4 million cash to the owners of JPQ. The remaining 30% interest in
JPQ is owned by Trabajos Maritimos S.A. and Inca Terminals and Mining Inc., subsidiaries of Grupo Romero (Peru) and Mamut Andino C.A. (Ecuador),
respectively.
The Bayovar 12 Concession comprises 12,575 hectares and was acquired by JPQ in 2007 under a contract with state company Activos Mineros S.A.C. for
the exploitation of gypsum rock by open pit methods from the claim. The boundary node coordinates for the Bayovar 12 Concession are presented in Figure
4-3.

In Peru, concessions are map-registered using a grid system at the Instituto Geologico, Minero y Metalurgico (“INGEMMET”) and the Superintendencia
Nacional  de  Registros  Publicos  (“SUNARP”).  Concessions  can  be  granted  for  either  metallic  or  non-metallic  minerals  and  allow  both  exploration  and
exploitation. Mining concessions are granted for an indefinite period; however, in order to maintain concessions in good standing, titleholders must pay a
Mining Good Standing license fee equal to US$3.00 per hectare per year.
4.3
SURFACE RIGHTS
Under Peruvian law, holding a mining concession does not grant title for surface rights. JPQ was granted surface rights access for 99 years and a 30 year
land use easement (renewable) under agreements signed with the community of San Martin de Sechura (Fundacion Comunal San Martin de Sechura).
4.4
AGREEMENTS AND ENCUMBRANCES
On January 14, 2014, Focus (via Agrifos), signed a formal option agreement for the acquisition of shares in JPQ, the titleholder of the Bayovar 12 mining
concession, where Focus (via Agrifos) had the option to acquire a 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ by fulfilling the following;
·
Completing a positive PFS within 48 months from February 26 2014, being the date (the “Permit Date”) that the Company received an exploration permit from
the Peruvian authorities;
·
Spending at least US$1,000,000 on exploration and drilling of the property within 12 months of the Permit Date (completed as of the effective date of this
technical report); and
·
Paying to JPQ a minimum of US$4,000,000 and a maximum of US$7,000,000 as follows:
i)
US$50,000 on signing of the Letter of Intent (paid as of the effective date of this technical report);
ii)
US$200,000 on signing of the formal option agreement (paid);
iii)
US$750,000 no later than six months after the Permit Date (paid);
iv)
US$3,000,000 no later than the earlier of the option exercise or 12 months of the Permit Date;
On March 26, 2015, Focus (via Agrifos) acquired an outright 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ, by paying $4 million cash to the Vendors,
thereby cancelling its previously granted option agreement to earn such interest. Focus committed to spending a minimum of US$14 million in development
of the Project, without dilution to the Vendors' remaining 30% interest. Focus has agreed to complete a PFS by December 31, 2015. Failure to complete the
PFS requires the payment of a US$500,000 penalty, plus additional $500,000 penalty payments for each additional year that the study is not completed, up
to a maximum of US$2,000,000 in penalty payments.

Port  and  loading  services  for  the  future  export  of  phosphate  rock  will  be  provided  by  the  Vendors  at  commercial  rates  at  the  Puerto  Bayovar  Maritime
Terminal located 40 km west of the Bayovar 12 Project. Focus will retain a right of first refusal for the purchase of the Vendors’ 30% interest in JPQ. In order
to fund the purchase and for further advancement of the Bayovar 12 Project, Focus executed a US$5.0 million secured loan facility with Sprott Resource
Lending Partnership, of which US$3.5 million was outstanding at the time of writing.
In April 2015, Focus completed the sale to Radius Gold Inc. of a royalty equal to 2% of Focus’ 70% interest in future phosphate production from the Bayovar
12 Project for the sum of US$1.0 million. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Focus has the right for 12 months to buy back one-half of the royalty for
US$1.0 million. If Radius decides to sell any of its royalty interest in the future, Focus will retain a first right of refusal.
4.5
MINING ROYALTIES AND TAXES
In order to maintain concessions in good standing, titleholders must pay a Mining Good Standing license fee equal to US$3.00 per hectare per year.
Under Peruvian mining laws, Concession holders must reach an annual production of at least US$100.00 per hectare in gross sales within six (6) years from
January 1st of the year following the date the title was granted. If there is no production on the concession within that period, the titleholder must pay a
penalty of US$6.00 per hectare or US$1.00 for small scale miners and US$0.50 for artisan miners, during the 7th through 11th years following the granting of
the concession. From the 12th year onwards, the penalty is equal to US$20.00 per hectare under the general regime, US$5.00 for small scale miners and
US$3.00 for artisan miners. The titleholder is exempt from the penalty if exploration expenditures incurred during the previous year was 10 times the amount
of the applicable penalty. Failure to pay the license fees or the penalty for two consecutive years will result in the forfeiture of the concession.
The concession holder also has a royalty agreement with the local community of San Martin de Sechura (Fundacion Comunal San Martin de Sechura) and
Activos Mineros S.A.C. The concession holder maintains title by sustaining an annual production of 80,000 tonnes of gypsum rock and by paying each a
royalty of $0.60 per tonne mined. This royalty is also applicable for any other non-metallic minerals extracted via a simple conversion formula.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES
Golder is not aware of any environmental liabilities on the Bayovar 12 Project property.
4.7
PERMITTING
Mining  reconnaissance  or  prospecting  does  not  require  an  environmental  assessment.  The  Environmental  Regulations  for  Mining  Exploration  Projects
requires the submittal of an Environmental Declaration for projects that include a maximum of 20 drill holes and less than 10 ha of disturbed areas or tunnels
up  to  50  m  long;  for  projects  exceeding  20  drill  holes,  10  ha  of  disturbed  area  or  tunneling  in  excess  of  50  m,  a  Semi-detailed  Environmental  Impact
Assessment is required to be submitted prior to any exploration activities. Focus received its initial environmental permit for the Phase 1 drill program on the
22 January, 2014, and on the 15th January 2015 for the Phase 2 drill program.
As per Environmental Mining Regulations, the mining concession holder must submit an Environmental Impact Assessment once the exploration stage of
the project is complete and prior to the commencement of mining activities.

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
5.1
PHYSIOGRAPHY
The Focus Bayovar 12 Project area is situated within the Sechura Desert in northwestern Peru. The Sechura Desert occurs as a continuous narrow strip
along much of the Pacific coast of Peru, stretching inland from 20 to 100 km, covering an area of approximately 22,000 km2.  The  desert  slopes  gently
westward from the foothills of the Andes mountain range to the Pacific Coast. In the Bayovar area the desert is partially bound on the western side by the
Illescas Mountains that form the Illescas Peninsula on the southern margin of Sechura Bay (Figure 5-1).
The generally featureless, low-relief character of the Sechura Desert (Figure 5-1) is marked in the Bayovar area by several distinct physiographic features,
namely the Virilla Estuary, the Tablazo and the Sechura Depression (Figure 5-1). The physiographic features present are a result of combined local uplift
and subsidence as well as erosional activity.
Figure 5-1: Typical Landscape on the Bayovar 12 Concession
The Virilla Estuary is a network of shallow channels that connect Sechura Bay on the Pacific Coast with Ramon Lake, a large inland lake situated north of
the project area. While the region is classified as a desert and there is limited year-round surface water present, the area is subject to tsunami and flooding
associated with weather and seismic events occurring along the nearby pacific coast. The Bayovar 12 project area was impacted by the floodway associated
with the 1998 El Niño event which saw widespread flooding in the low ground surrounding the Virrilla Estuary to the north.
The Tablazo (Figure 5-2) is a prominent regional scale flat-topped table land that runs north-south through the Bayovar area, separating a central plateau of
higher ground from lower ground to the north, east and west. The steep ridge line
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
49
marking the edge of the Tablazo ranges in height from 15 to 75 m amsl; elevation on top of the Tablazo ranges from 15 to 75 m amsl compared to 0 to 10 m
amsl on the lower plain to the east and 30 to 60 m amsl on the low ground to the west that separates the Tablazo from the Illescas Mountains. The Bayovar
12 property straddles the eastern ridge of the Tablazo, with the western third of the property situated on top of the Tablazo and the eastern two thirds falling
on the low ground east of the Tablazo ridge line.
Figure 5-2: Tablazo Ridge on the Bayovar 12 Concession, Looking West
The Sechura Depression is a steep sided, flat bottomed, topographic depression that transects the Tablazo, breaking it into northern and southern regions.
The floor of the Sechura Depression is approximately 35 m below mean sea level. The northeastern limit of the Sechura depression is located adjacent to
the southwestern limit of the Bayovar 12 Concession boundary.
Much of the Bayovar 12 project surface area is marked by a thin layer of hard packed sand, thin gravel and localized gypsum, all of which are quaternary in
age. Large crescent shaped barchan sand dunes (Figure 5-3) that slowly migrate across the property in a north-easterly direction are present across most of
the project area. Vegetation in the Bayovar12 Project area is sparse, consisting for the most part of drought tolerant low bushes (Figure 5-3 and Figure 5-4)
sparse grass and salt tolerant plants in lower elevation areas.

CLIMATE
The Bayovar 12 Project area is situated within the mild desert climate of the Sechura Desert. The Sechura Desert climate is heavily influenced by the
confluence of the Humboldt (cold water) and Equatorial (warm water) ocean currents that circulate in contrary directions; this typically results in zones of high
temperature and low precipitation.
The proximity to the Pacific Ocean results in relatively moderate temperatures year round; the mean monthly temperature in the summer months (December
to April) is approximately 25°C and in the winter months (May to October) is approximately 18°C. The annual precipitation is approximately 50 millimetres
(mm) of rain but can increase to in excess of 150 mm in El Niño years. Wind in the Bayovar 12 Project area is predominantly from the southeast, with
average wind speed values of 4.1 metres per second (m/s; weak breeze); peak gusts are generally around 7 m/s (moderate breeze).
A summary of the historical climate data for the project area, sourced from the Sechura, Peru weather station data as compiled on the www.weatherbase.com
website (accessed September 2015), is presented in Figure 5-2. The historical climate data was collected over a 30 to 112 year period.

ACCESSIBILITY
The  Bayovar  12  project  area  is  accessible  year  round  via  a  series  of  multi-lane  sealed  roads  and  highways  (Figure  5-3).  The  Pan-American  Highway
crosses the eastern end of the property and the Chiclayo-Bayovar road (Figure 5-5)
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
53
transects the property. A network of un-maintained drill roads and access roads for minor surface gypsum mining operations provide four wheel drive vehicle
access to the remainder of the property.
Figure 5-7: Chiclayo-Bayovar Road on the Bayovar 12 Concession with the Tablazo in the Background
Travel time from Piura to the Bayovar 12 Concession is approximately 1.5 hours by car via the Pan-American Highway. Piura is serviced by a modern
domestic airport with commercial daily service to Lima and other airports in the region. Air travel flying time from Piura to Lima is approximately 1.5 hours.
The concession is also located 40 km inland by paved road from the JPQ marine port facility (Figure 5-6) near the fishing village of Puerto Rico, located in
Sechura Bay on the pacific coast. Water depth adjacent to the jetty at the JPQ port facility is approximately 8 m, currently allowing for loading of 24,0000
Deadweight tonnage (DWT) capacity vessels.

LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE
The Bayovar 12 project area is approximately 40 km by paved multi-lane road from the JPQ port facility located near the fishing village of Puerto Rico,
located on Sechura Bay on the pacific coast. The JPQ port facility is situated adjacent to the Vale port facility where phosphate from Vale’s Miski Mayo
operation (Bayovar Mine) is loaded for shipping.
Power  transmission  lines  for  the  Vale  Miksi  Mayo  Bayovar  Mine  also  transect  the  northwest  corner  of  the  Focus  Bayovar  12  property  (Figure  4-3).  An
easement for power transmission lines to the FOSPAC property also transects the northwest corner of the Bayovar 12 property.
Mining operation at the Bayovar 12 property could be conducted year-round and would not be affected by the climate.

OWNERSHIP HISTORY
Figure 5-9: Regional Access
55
56
On January 14, 2014, Focus’ Peruvian subsidiary, Agrifos, signed a formal option agreement for the acquisition of shares in JPQ, the titleholder of  the
Bayovar 12 mining concession. On March 26, 2015, Focus (via Agrifos) acquired an outright 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ, by paying $4
million cash to JPQ, thereby cancelling its previously granted option agreement (see Section 4, Property Description and Location, for details pertaining to
the agreement).
The Bayovar 12 Concession was acquired by JPQ in 2007 under a contract with state company Activos Mineros S.A.C. for the exploitation of gypsum rock
and other non-metallic minerals by open pit methods from the concession.
Prior to the acquisition of the Bayovar 12 Concession by JPQ from Activos Mineros S.A.C in 2007, stretching back to the 1950’s there have been numerous
government and commercial entities that have owned portions of the overall Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit as summarized in Nardi and Gruber (2008)
and  Apaza  (2012).  Historical  entities  with  interests  in  the  Bayovar  area  include  Minerales  Industriales  del  Peru  (MIDEDSA),  ESSO-Homestake,  Minera
Bayovar S.A., Kaiser Aluminum and PROBAYOVAR.
Golder has not been able to establish historical land tenure boundaries for the various past owners in the region. As a result, it is possible that a portion or all
of the current Bayovar 12 Concession area may have been included in the land holdings of some of these historical operators in the Bayovar-Sechura
Phosphate deposit.
6.2
EXPLORATION HISTORY
The phosphate deposits of the Bayovar area were discovered in 1955 during regional oil and gas exploration. Phosphorite was discovered in the immediate
project area in an abandoned road cut in 1958.
As mentioned in the previous section, there were a number of different historical entities with interests in portions of the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit
since its discovery in the 1950’s; however, Golder has not been able to establish what, if any, historical exploration work may have been conducted within
the boundary of the area that now comprises the Bayovar 12 Concession area. There are no records of any historical exploration activity specific to the
property prior to JPQ ownership in 2007.
JPQ  performed  limited  reconnaissance  exploration  work  on  the  Bayovar  12  Concession  in  2012;  however,  Golder  and  Focus  could  not  verify  the
methodology and results from the 2012 JPQ work to a level where they could be relied upon for use in the geological modelling process and resultant
resource estimates. As a result the 2012 JPQ work was not used for modelling and resource estimation as reported in this technical report.
The  only  significant  detailed  exploration  programs  on  the  Bayovar  12  Concession  are  the  Phase  1  (2014)  and  Phase  2  (2015)  exploration  programs
implemented by Focus; a detailed discussion of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 Focus exploration programs is presented in Section 10 of this Technical Report.
The drill holes from the Focus Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs are presented in Figure 6-1.

PRODUCTION HISTORY
As of the effective date of this technical report there has been no commercial phosphate mining production from the Bayovar 12 Concession property.
Mining activity on the Bayovar 12 Concession property is limited to small scale surface mining of quaternary age gypsum that occurs at surface on the low
ground immediately east of the Tablazo. The gypsum mining operation is carried out by JPQ, using a dozer to push the gypsum into piles that are then
loaded on to a small road haul truck using and excavator. The gypsum is then transported by truck to the JPQ port facility on Sechura bay where it is
stockpiled prior to loading onto ships.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION

7.1
REGIONAL GEOLOGY
7.1.1
Regional Stratigraphy
The following section summarizes the regional geology as presented by McClellan (1989), Cheney et al., (1979) Bech (2009) and references therein.
The  Bayovar-Sechura  Phosphate  Deposit  occurs  in  the  Sechura  Basin  (Figure  7-1),  a  shallow  north  trending  basin  situated  in  northwestern  Peru.  The
Sechura Basin is bordered by the Illescas Mountains to the west and the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the east. The basin is filled by a thick sequence
of interlayered marine sediments including phosphorite, diatomite, sandstone, shale and volcanic tuff, ranging in age from Eocene (56.0 to 33.90 Ma) at the
base to Pliocence (5.33 to 2.58 Ma) in the upper basin.
The Sechura basin formed as a result of subsidence along the paleo-continental shelf. Cycles of uplift and subsidence modified the basin during its long
infilling history, with basement faults partially controlling basin geometry during deposition. The stratigraphy is subhorizontal, dipping gently at 2° to 3°
across the basin.
The phosphate bearing units occur in the upper 135 to 215 m of the Miocene (23.22 to 5.33 Ma) strata in the basin, within the Zapallal Formation. The
Zapallal  Formation  comprises  a  cyclical  series  of  interlayered  marine  basin  fill  diatomites  and  phosphorites  with  lesser  sandstone  and  tuff.  A  detailed
discussion of the Zapallal Formation stratigraphy and structure is presented in the section below.
The  Zapallal  Formation  is  underlain  by  older  Miocene,  Oligocene  and  Eocene  age  marine  basin  fill  sedimentary  units  which  unconformably  overlay
metamorphic and igneous basement rocks of Paleozoic (541 to 252 Ma) and Precambrian (greater than 541 Ma) in age. As a result of late Eocene basement
uplift and basin subsidence the Paleozoic basement is exposed in the Illescas Mountains along the western margin of the basin.
The Zapallal Formation is unconformably overlain by Pliocene age interbedded coquina, sandstone and shale. The stratigraphy is capped by a thin cover of
unconsolidated Quaternary (2.58 Ma to present) age alluvial and aeolian sand with localized occurrences of gypsum.
7.1.2
Zapallal Formation Detailed Stratigraphy
The marine basin fill Zapallal Formation is subdivided into four members, which are in turn subdivided into distinct units or zones (Figure 7-2). The formation
and its subdivision presented from oldest to youngest are as follows:
·
Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member
§
Tuffaceous  Diatomite  –  Thickness  is  in  excess  of  50  m,  predominantly  foraminifera-rich  diatomite  with  numerous  thin  beds  of  tuff  and  three  isolated
phosphorite beds; P2O5 grades in the phosphorite beds range from 10 to 18 wt% and from 1 to 3 wt% in the diatomite. The upper contact is gradational with
the overlying Diana ore zone (note: please refer to Section 2.5 of this technical report concerning the usage of the term “ore zone”).
§
Diana ore zone – Mean thickness of 39 m (range of 36 to 41 m). The zone is subdivided into seven regionally correlatable phosphorite beds alternating with
diatomite beds. The Diana ore zone contains the highest P2O5 grades (ranging from 10 to 25 wt% in the phosphorite beds and 3 to 7 wt% in the diatomite
beds) and thickest phosphorite bearing zones in the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit. The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Grey Tuff.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
§
60
Grey Tuff – Thickness ranges from 0 to 21 m. Comprises generally massive beds of soft grey diatomaceous tuff. Preservation of the unit varies across the
area due to variable and locally significant erosion by the overlying Clam Bore Sandstone. There are no identified or correlatable phosphorite beds present
within  the  unit  and  no  significant  presence  of  phosphate  pellets,  resulting  in  negligible  P2O5  grades.  The  upper  contact  with  the  overlying  Clam  Bore
Sandstone is marked by a hiatus and angular unconformity; units below the unconformity dip to the east while units above dip to the southeast.
·
Clam Bore Sandstone Member – Thickness ranges from 0 to 23 m; the unit is thinnest in the southern portion of the basin and thickest in the north and
western portions of the basin. Comprises fine to medium grained quartz sand with abundant trace fossils across most of the basin; in areas where the unit is
thicker the upper portion of the unit comprises a limestone coquina (oyster bank). The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Zero ore zone.
·
Upper Diatomite and Phosphorite Member
§
Zero (or Cero) ore zone – Mean thickness of 6 m (range of 3 to 11 m). Comprises a single thick phosphorite bed (the Zero Bed) and is overlain by diatomite;
P2O5 grade in the Zero Bed can be up to 18 wt.%, with a mean P2O5 grade of 9 wt.% over the entire zone (phosphorite and overlying diatomite). The upper
contact is gradational with the overlying Inca Diatomite.
§
Inca  Diatomite  –  Mean  thickness  of  10  m  (range  of  5  to  17  m).  Comprises  massive  beds  of  diatomite  with  minor  pellets  but  no  distinct  or  correlatable
phosphorite beds; P2O5 grade ranges from 1.0 to 2.8 wt% throughout the unit. The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Minerva ore zone.
§
Minerva ore zone – Mean thickness of 26 m (range of 23 to 35 m).  Comprises two to three phosphorite beds interlayered with diatomite; overall P2O5 grade
in the phosphorite beds is lower than those in the other zones with grades generally in the 5 to 6 wt.% range although in areas where the unit thins there is
often an associated increase in P2O5 grade, with values in the 8 to 10 wt.% range. Grades in the diatomite beds range from 2 to 3 wt% P2O5. The upper
contact is gradational with the overlying Quechua Diatomite.
§
Quechua Diatomite – Mean thickness of 17 m (range of 12 to 19 m). Comprises massive beds of diatomite with localized occurrences of one or two thin
phosphorite beds. Grade across the unit (diatomite and localized phosphorite inclusive) is typically 2 wt% P2O5. The upper contact is gradational with the
overlying Barren Diatomite Member.
·
Barren Diatomite Member – Thickness range of 0 to 31 m. Comprises massive diatomite and mica flakes are commonly present. There are no identified or
correlatable  phosphorite  beds  present  within  the  unit  and  no  significant  presence  of  phosphate  pellets,  resulting  in  negligible  P2O5  grades.  The  upper
contact is marked by a hiatus and angular unconformity separating the Miocene Zapallal Formation from overlying Pliocene sandstone and shale; units
below the unconformity dip to the southeast while units above are horizontal.

7.1.3
Regional Structure
As identified in the detailed discussion of the Zapallal Formation, there are two regional scale angular unconformities identified as impacting the stratigraphy
in the basin. The uppermost unconformity occurs at the top of the Zapallal Formation (Figure 7-2), marking the contact between barren diatomite of Miocene
age and coquina, sandstone and shale of the overlying Pliocene sedimentary units. The second unconformity occurs within the Zapallal Formation, marking
the contact between the Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member and the Clam Bore Member.
There are isolated occurrences of regional scale faulting and folding in the basin, including a regional scale fault that transects the FOSPAC Bayovar 9
concession to the west, but for the most part the stratigraphy has seen minimal post-depositional tectonic modification.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
7.2
PHOSPHORITE AND DIATOMITE COMPOSITION
63
The phosphorite beds (Figure 7-1) are comprised primarily of massively bedded phosphate pellets with lesser grains and fragments of diatoms, volcanic
glass; sodium, potassium and magnesium salts; quartz; feldspar; sponge fragments; gypsum, mica flakes and organic matter. The phosphate is marine in
nature and is generally in the form of fluorhydroxycarbonate apatite.
The apatite is generally in the form of individual pellets although agglomerations of pellets, oolites, laminae, nodules and fragments of teeth, bones or shells
are also present. The pellets are generally subrounded but elongated and irregular shaped pellets also present. The pellet grain size ranges from 0.4 to 2.0
mm in diameter, with larger pellets occurring in the phosphorite beds while finer grained pellets occur in the diatomite.
The pellets range in color from white to brown to black. Although the apatite pellets and other grains and fragments are generally well sorted within the beds,
most of the pore space is filled in with fine fragments of diatoms and silt. The specific gravity of individual pellets is typically around 2.9.
Figure 7-3: Typical Phosphorite Bed Showing Layering of Phosphorite (dark) and Diatomite (light)
7.2.1
Diatomite
The diatomite beds are comprised primarily of massively bedded aggregates of microscopic diatom fragments with variable finer grained apatite pellets and
lesser grains and fragments of volcanic glass, shell and bone fragments and sponge fragments. The diatoms are typically composed of opaline silica.
The diatomite ranges in color from white to brown to olive green. The diatomite generally has high porosity, often on the order of 90%; as a result of this and
its resistance to compaction, the specific gravity is very low, typically around 1.5.
7.3
PROPERTY GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION
The Zapallal Formation stratigraphy dips gently to the east within the Bayovar 12 Concession (Figure 7-3). No faulting or folding was identified within the

As a result of Quaternary erosional surfaces, the uppermost members of the Zapallal Formation, namely the Upper Diatomite and Phosphorite Member and
the Barren Diatomite Member, were absent within the Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling area. This included the absence of the Zero ore zone phosphorite bed
(lower most phosphorite bed in the Upper Member) that is present several kilometres to the west on the FOSPAC Bayovar 9 Concession. As the stratigraphy
is dipping gently to the east, it is possible that the upper portion of the Zapallal Formation may be encountered when planned exploration drilling on the
property advances to the east.
Focus has intercepted 16 distinct and correlatable phosphorite beds (identified as PH01 through PH16) across the concession. Focus and Golder have
interpreted the upper 13 phosphorite beds (PH01 to PH13) as Diana ore zone Beds with the lower three beds (PH14 to PH16) interpreted as phosphorite
beds occurring in the underlying Tuffaceous Diatomite unit. The literature on the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit generally identifies seven regionally
correlatable phosphorite beds in the Diana ore zone; however, Focus and Golder interpret the six additional phosphorite beds encountered in the Diana ore
zone as locally continuous and correlatable beds that aren’t necessarily present or correlatable across the entire basin.  Summary thickness and P2O5 grade
statistics for the phosphorite are presented in Table 7-2 Phosphorite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary Statistics Table 7-2. Summary thickness and
P2O5 grade statistics for the diatomite beds are presented in Table 7-3, Diatomite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary Statistics.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
65
The  individual  phosphorite  beds  exhibit  relatively  uniform  thickness  and  P2O5  grade  profiles  across  the  concession;  however,  there  is  a  pronounced
zonation of P2O5 grades in both the phosphorite and diatomite beds that effectively divides the Diana ore zone into an Upper Diana ore zone and Lower
Diana ore zone.
The Upper Diana ore zone phosphorite beds (PH01 through PH05) exhibit high mean grades and are separated by low grade diatomite beds with mean
grades all below 2 wt.% P2O5.
Below PH05 there is a marked change in the nature of the diatomite beds with mean grades all in excess of 2 wt.% P2O5. The sole exception is diatomite
bed IB11, located between PH10 and PH11, which consistently exhibits mean P2O5 grades below 2 wt.% across the concession. Because of the signature
low grade profile, the IB11 diatomite was used by both Focus and Golder as a marker bed during the correlation process.
The Zapallal Formation units are interpreted to continue in all directions beyond the limits of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programs. Due to concession
boundary limits planned future exploration drilling will concentrate on expanding the resource to the east of the Tablazo ridge, where the phosphorite beds
are closer to surface due to lower surface elevations.

DEPOSIT TYPES
The following section summarizes the deposit type and genetic model as presented by Simandl et al. (2012), Mosier (in Cox and Singer, 1992), Garrison
(1992), Follmi (1996) Froelich et al. (1988), and Cheney et al. (1979).
The  Bayovar-Sechura  phosphate  deposit  is  a  sedimentary  phosphate  deposit,  also  commonly  referred  to  as  upwelling  phosphate  deposits,  stratiform
phosphate deposits or phosphorite deposits. Sedimentary phosphate deposits are stratiform bodies that commonly comprise alternating mineralized and
barren zones; the individual zones can range from sub-metre thickness up to tens of metres thick, with the overall thickness of mineralized and  barren
sequence commonly forming in excess of several hundred metres. The deposits typically cover significant areal extents, often extending for tens or hundreds
of kilometres in their maximum lateral dimensions.
Sedimentary phosphate deposits are biochemical in origin. The formation of sedimentary phosphate deposits occurs throughout geological time, spanning
as far back as the Proterozoic (2,500 to 542 Ma) to the present day. On the basis of stratigraphy the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit formed during the
middle  Miocene  with  most  of  the  phosphate  deposition  occurring  between  8.5  to  7  Ma  (Garrison,  1992).  Modern  sedimentary  phosphate  deposits  are
currently  forming  off  the  Pacific  coast  of  Peru  under  similar  depositional  conditions  and  controls  that  were  in  place  during  the  Miocene  deposition  and
formation of the Bayovar Phosphate deposit (Froelich et al., 1988).
Both  paleo  and  modern  sedimentary  phosphate  deposits  typically  develop  in  marine  sedimentary  basins  that  occur  along  passive  continental  margins.
Conditions favourable for the depositional and biochemical process are found in areas of warm paleoclimate (or current climate for modern day equivalents),
typically occurring between the 40th parallels at the time of deposition. The water depth at time of deposition and biogenic activity can range from 40 m to in
excess of 300 m.
Sedimentary phosphate deposits form in marine sedimentary basins where upwelling, nutrient-rich, cold waters interact with the warm surface seawater
layer,  creating  favourable  conditions  for  intense  algal  bloom.  Algal  blooms  develop  as  algae  multiply  at  rapid  rates  in  nutrient  rich,  shallow  marine
environments (allowing for significant sunlight input to aid in the photosynthetic process). During algal blooms the algae biomass increases significantly as
algae multiply. The combination of high biomass and rapid multiplication of the algae often leads to toxic and/or anoxic conditions that prove fatal to both
algae and other marine organisms.
Cycles of algal bloom and death lead to significant seafloor accumulation of organic phosphate released by the algae along with accumulation of skeletons,
scales, fecal pellets and other organic debris from algae and other marine life forms in areas of upwelling activity. The decomposition of the phosphate
bearing  organic  debris  by  bacteria  along  with  the  dissolution  of  fish  bones  and  scales  result  in  the  precipitation  of  phosphate  minerals  in  an  anoxic
environment within the unconsolidated seafloor sediment near the sediment-water interface. This process is known as phosphogenesis.
Multiple cycles of marine regression and transgression and cycles of upwelling activity result in changes in the depositional environment and associated
biochemical processes occurring within the host marine sedimentary basin. These changes commonly result in the cyclical nature of the deposits, where the
deposit comprises a series of alternating phosphorite and barren (or non-phosphorite) horizons of varying thickness.
The primary phosphate minerals present in most sedimentary phosphate deposits are microcrystalline Fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) or Francolite (carbonate-
rich Fluorapatite; Ca5(PO4)2.5(CO3)0.5F). The phosphate minerals in sedimentary phosphate deposits commonly occur as pellets, oolites, laminae, nodules
and fragments of teeth, bones or shells.
The  host  rocks  and  the  barren  horizons  within  the  sedimentary  phosphate  deposits  are  most  commonly  diatomite  although  mudstone,  marl,  limestone,
volcanic ash and sandstone are also known to occur depending on changes in the depositional environment and sediment input within the basin.

EXPLORATION
9.1
SUMMARY OF NON-DRILLING EXPLORATION ACTIVITY
70
Detailed exploration activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to exploration drilling during the Phase 1 (2014) and Phase 2 (2015)
Focus exploration programs.
There  have  been  no  surface  geochemical  sampling  programs  conducted  on  the  Bayovar  12  Concession  and  there  have  been  no  surface  or  airborne
geophysical surveys conducted on the Bayovar 12 Concession.
The only non-drilling exploration activity on the Bayovar 12 Concession was the development of a digital topography model in August 2014.
9.2
DIGITAL SURFACE (TOPOGRAPHY) MODEL
Focus engaged Pacific Geomatics Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada, in August 2014 to prepare a Digital Surface Model (DSM) for the Bayovar 12 Concession.
The DSM covered the entire extent of the 2014 Focus exploration area as well as most of the remainder of the Bayovar 12 Concession. In August 2015 the
coverage was extended by an additional 79km2 to cover the entire Bayovar 12 Concession and surrounding areas (Figure 9-1).
The DSM was prepared using 1.5 m SPOT6 Tristereo satellite imagery. Gross errors were fixed in the DSM in stereo. The easting and northing data was
adjusted by Pacific Geomatics Ltd. to fit with available 0.50 m data for the area. Although DSM models differ from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) in that
DSM’s do not process out features like vegetation and building, there are no such features present on the Bayovar 12 Concession.

DRILLING
10.1
DRILLING SUMMARY
Detailed exploration drilling activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to the Phase 1 (2014) and Phase 2 (2015) Focus exploration
programs.
The Phase 1 exploration program resulted in the completion of 20 HQ (63.5 mm core diameter) vertical core holes totaling 2,027 m while the Phase 2
exploration program added an additional 42 HQ vertical core holes totalling 3,944 m for an overall project total of 62 drill holes and 5,971 m. The drill hole
total depths for both programs ranged from 81 to 131 m (mean of 96 m); total depth variation was due to the location relative to the Tablazo. All of the Phase 1
and Phase 2 drill holes were completed to their planned total depths; no drill holes were lost or abandoned due to technical or ground issues. A summary of
the Phase 1 and Phase 2 Focus drill holes is presented in Figure 10-1.
The Phase 1 drilling was conducted on a nominal 800 by 800 m spaced grid covering approximately 27.36 km2 (2,736 Ha) of the total 125.75 km2 (12,575
Ha) of the Bayovar 12 Concession. The Phase 1 drilling program concentrated on the western portion of the Bayovar 12 Concession. The Phase 2 drilling
expanded the nominal 800 by 800 m spaced drilling grid towards the east of the Phase 1 drilling, while also including some closer 400 by 400 m spaced
drilling to allow for evaluation of shorter range thickness and grade variability. As of the effective date of this technical report, a significant portion of the
concession remained undrilled.

DRILLING RESULTS
All 62 of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 drill holes intercepted the full sequence of target phosphorite beds. The entire sequence of 16 phosphorite beds spanned
a total mean thickness of 47.4 m (range of 43.3 to 50.6 m) including interburden diatomite beds. Depths from surface to the roof of the upper most phosphorite
bed (PH01) ranged from 62.6 m below surface in the Tablazo area to 25.5 m below surface in the low area to the east of the Tablazo (overall mean of 39.8 m
below surface). The floor of the lower most phosphorite bed (PH16) ranged from 104.4 m below surface in the Tablazo area to 73.1 m below surface in the
low area to the east (overall mean of 86.8 m below surface).

Core recovery for all units was very good, with mean core recovery of 99% (range of 42% to 100%) during the Phase 1 program and mean core recovery of
99% (range of 19% to 100%) during the Phase 2 program. There were 125 occurrences with core recovery less than 90% and 19 occurrences where core
recovery was less than 50%. The core recovery within the phosphorite beds mirrored the overall recovery values with a mean of 99% (range of 42% to 100%)
but with 34 occurrences of recovery less than 90% and two occurrences where core recovery was less than 50%.

Overall  the  Rock  Quality  Designation  (RQD)  for  all  units  was  fair  to  excellent  with  a  mean  RQD  of  76%  (range  of  0%  to  100%).  The  RQD  within  the
phosphorite beds showed a slight improvement over the RQD for all units, with a mean of 85% (range of 0% to 100%), considered good to excellent.
A total of 6,980 half core (hand split) samples were collected through the entire diatomite (4,494 samples) and phosphorite (2,845 samples) sequence in all
62 drill holes. Sample interval lengths ranged from 0.08 to 0.97 m (mean of 0.25 m) in the phosphorite and 0.01 to 1.27 m (mean of 0.58 m) in the diatomite. A
detailed discussion of the analysis methods and the analytical results from the sampling program are presented in Section 11 of this technical report.
10.3
DRILLING PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGY
The following sections detail the exploration drilling program procedures and methodology employed by Focus during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 Focus
exploration programs.
10.3.1
Drilling Methodology
All 62 drill holes in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 Focus Exploration programs were drilled by RAM Peru S.A.C using two skid-mounted Boart Longyear (one LY-
44 and one LM-75 model) wireline drill rigs (Figure 10-2) with a maximum depth capacity of approximately 530 m for HQ core drilling. All 62 drill holes were
drilled vertical, recovering HQ size (63.5 mm core diameter) core. Downhole directional surveys were not performed on the drill holes; given the short total
length of the holes, the orientation of stratigraphy or fabrics in the rocks (oriented normal to the drill hole) and the broad overall drill spacing (400 to 800 m
centres) lateral deviation of the drill holes was deemed negligible.
Drilling  was  conducted  on  a  single  12  hour  shift  each  day.  Typical  drilling  rate  was  1  to  1.5  days  per  drill  hole.  Drilling  of  the  20  Phase  1  drill  holes
commenced on March 1, 2014 and was completed on April 5, 2014 while drilling of the 42 Phase 2 drill holes commenced on April 14, 2015 and was
completed on May 20, 2015.
Drill site supervision, core logging and sampling duties were performed by Focus senior geologists and technical personnel.

Figure 10-2: Drilling on the Bayovar 12 Concession
10.3.2
Drill Hole Location Methodology
All drill hole platforms were located by Focus senior geologists using a handheld Garmin GPS. The planned drill holes were located on a nominal 800 by
800 m spaced grid with the exception of a small area where drilling was performed on 400 by 400 m centres to allow for evaluation of short range variability.
In total the Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling covered approximately 27.36 km2 (2,736 Ha).
After completion, drill holes are sealed with a cement monument (Figure 10-3) and marked clearly using PVC pipe or wooden stakes to withstand wind and
sand dune cover. The drill hole name, total depth and completion date were inscribed in the cement monument prior to the cement setting.
On completion of the drill program all cement monuments were surveyed by a professional land surveyor using Total Station GPS to record collar surveys to
an accuracy of +/-0.1m in X, Y and Z dimensions. The surveying was performed by Peruanas de Inversiones R & L S.A.C., of Chiclayo Peru.

Core Handling And Visual Logging Methodology
Exploration Data Collection and Documentation
All measurements, observations, sample intervals and other associated information collected during the core logging and sampling process were recorded
by the Focus geologists directly into an Excel drill hole logging datasheet for each individual drill hole. All digital data entry was performed by the geologist at
the time of logging rather than being transcribed at a later date. All information pertaining to an individual drill hole was recorded on specialized tabs within
the single excel file for that drill hole, allowing for single source for records for each individual drill hole. The drill hole logging datasheet included tabs for:
·
Collar location and completion details;
·
Drill hole orientation;
·
Downhole lithology observations;
·
Phosphate mineralization observations;
·
RQD and Total Core Recovery measurements and calculations;
·
Geotechnical observations and measurements;
·
Sampling intervals and analytical QA/QC insertion records; and,

Core Handling
79
Core was boxed at the drill site and transported to the secure core logging facility (Figure 10-4) by Focus or RAM drilling personnel on a daily basis. The
core boxes were laid out sequentially and visually inspected to ensure all boxes were accounted for and that core boxes and depth markers were clearly
labeled and in the correct downhole order.
For the phase 1 drill program the Focus core logging facility was located inside the secure (gated and armed guard) JPQ port facility. The core logging area
was purpose built and included areas for logging, core splitting and sampling. Core was stored on covered steel core racks while awaiting logging and
sampling. For the Phase 2 drilling program up to present, logging and storage facilities were re-located to a secured property in Piura (Figure 10-5).

M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
80
Figure 10-5: Core Storage Racks at the Focus Phase 2 Core Logging Facility
Core Photography
Before core splitting, logging and sampling commenced each complete core box was photographed using a tripod mounted digital camera and photos were
archived for reference purposes (Figure 10-6). The core photography set up was standardized so that all core box photographs were consistent in terms of
quality, scale and resolution. Drill hole names and depth marker blocks were oriented so as to be clearly read in each photograph. In addition to the core box
photographs, detailed close-up photographs were also taken for any stratigraphic, structural, mineralization or other features of interest. All photos were
labeled using a systematic numbering system that clearly indicates drill hole name and depth interval in the photograph name. Photographs were reviewed
by the geologist to ensure they met the required standards prior to splitting the core.
Geotechnical Logging
Once photographed the core was reoriented and fitted together as appropriate prior to measuring the length of core recovered for every drill interval and
calculating the Total Core Recovery; the recovered length and Total Core Recovery were recorded in the drill logging sheet. The RQD was also calculated
for each drill run by counting the number of whole core pieces that were equal to or greater than 10 cm in length. The RQD results were recorded in the drill
logging datasheet. Observations on the spacing, frequency and infill material on joints and fractures were also recorded in the drill logging datasheet.

Figure 10-6: Example Core Box Photograph
Core Splitting
Once the Total Core Recovery, RQD and other geotechnical observations were recorded on the whole core, a longitudinal cut line was marked on the core
by  the  logging  geologist.  The  logging  geologist  also  marked  the  core  to  indicate  which  side  would  be  sampled  and  which  side  would  be  retained  for
reference so that the same side of the core was submitted from consecutive sample intervals to avoid any sample selection bias.
Once marked up the core was moved to the sample splitting stations in the Focus core facility. The core for the entire drill hole was split longitudinally by
hand by Focus technical personnel. A core technician placed individual core segments in a form to hold the core in place on the splitting bench. A 3 to 5 mm
deep groove was then cut along the longitudinal cut line on the core segment using a hand saw (Figure 10-7). A cleaver was then placed in the cut and
gently struck with a hammer to split the core in half (Figure 10-8). This procedure was used on most of the core except in instances where the material was
very soft, in which case it was split by a knife or sampling spoons. This core splitting method allowed for the best results in terms of maintaining core segment
integrity (over a mechanical vise style sample splitter or water cooled saw) as well as providing a natural fracture surface that allowed for easy evaluation of
fine textural features and estimation of apatite pellets that was not possible on the polished cut surfaces created by a rock saw.

Descriptive Logging
Once split, both halves of the core segments were carefully returned to the core box and then the boxes were returned to the core logging benches and laid
out in down hole order to allow for detailed logging of the lithology, structure and mineralization.
Lithology  descriptions  included  down  hole  depth  intervals,  color,  grain  size,  porosity,  facies  type,  interpreted  unit  name  and  a  detailed  comment  or
description of each interval. A new interval record was created in the descriptive log any time a change in the color, grain size, facies or geological unit
occurred.  The  logging  geologist  marked  observed  and  interpreted  geological  unit  and  facies  interval  boundaries  on  the  core  during  the  visual  logging
process (Figure 10-9). All lithology interval descriptions were then recorded directly into the drill logging datasheet by the logging geologist (Figure 10-10).

Figure 10-10: Geologist Entering Data and Observations
Grade Estimation
Once the lithology logging process was completed and the geological unit and facies boundaries were determined and marked on the core by the logging
geologist, the diatomite and phosphorite intervals identified in the visual logging process were inspected by the logging geologist using a magnified hand
lens. Using the hand lens and a set of percentage composition estimation charts the logging geologist identified grade zones based on estimating the apatite
pellet contents in each interval (Figure 10-11). Individual diatomite and phosphorite intervals were subdivided into multiple grade intervals whenever there
were 5% changes (positive or negative) in the estimated pellet content.
The grade estimation process for all 62 Phase 1 and Phase 2 drill holes was performed by two senior geologists to minimize variability and/or bias in the
grade  estimation  process.  The  two  senior  geologists  regularly  cross  checked  each  other’s  estimates  to  ensure  they  were  consistently  estimating  grade
intervals.
Once the grade intervals were established and marked on the drill core, the logging geologist recorded the percentage, type (pellets, ooids, teeth, bone
fragments etc.), grain size, shape, color and a detailed description for each interval directly into the drill logging datasheet.
Once  the  grade  estimation  process  was  completed  the  core  was  ready  for  the  sampling  process.  A  detailed  discussion  of  the  sampling,  analyses  and
analytical QA/QC process is presented in Section 11 of this technical report.

DRILLING FACTORS IMPACTING ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF RESULTS
It  is  Golder’s  opinion  that  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  exploration  programs  were  carried  out  by  Focus  personnel  according  to  appropriate  professional
methodologies and procedures, including those presented in the CIM Exploration Best Practice Guidelines (August 2000 edition). The methodology and
procedures  were  well  defined  and  documented  prior  to  commencing  with  the  drilling  and  sampling  programs.  All  components  of  the  programs  were
conducted according to the methodology and procedures and were well documented by Focus technical personnel. All Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration
work for the drilling programs appears to have been performed by experienced and qualified personnel, including Focus personnel as well as third party
contractors.
The overall drill core recovery was very good (mean of 99%), and was very good within the phosphorite beds (mean of 99%). The RQD was fair to excellent
overall (mean of 76%) and was good to excellent within the phosphorite beds (mean of 85%). All drill holes were completed to their planned total depths and
all drill holes intercepted the complete sequence of phosphorite and diatomite beds as predicted prior to drilling.
Golder  is  not  aware  of  any  factors  or  concerns  regarding  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  results  from  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  Focus  exploration
programs.
10.5
INTERPRETATION OF DRILLING RESULTS
The drilling results from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs were reviewed and interpreted independently by the Focus senior geologists and by
the Golder Qualified Person. Drill hole lithology and grade data was used to confirm the roof and floor picks for each of the phosphorite intervals as well as
the various overburden, interburden and underburden units. Drill hole fences were used to confirm the hole to hole correlation of the phosphorite beds and

overburden, interburden and underburden units. A detailed discussion of the interpretation and geological modelling process is presented in Section 14 of
this technical report.

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
11.1
SAMPLE SUMMARY
Sampling and phosphate analyses activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to sampling of exploration drill core during the Focus
Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs.
As part of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs a total of 6,980 half core (hand split) samples were collected through the entire diatomite (4,494
samples)  and  phosphorite  (2,845  samples)  sequence  in  all  62  drill  holes.  Sample  interval  lengths  ranged  from  0.08  to  0.97  m  (mean  of  0.25  m)  in  the
phosphorite and 0.10 to 1.27 m (mean of 0.58 m) in the diatomite.
All Phase 1 and Phase 2 samples were submitted to Certimin laboratory in Lima, Peru for primary analyses. Pulp duplicates were submitted to the SGS
Laboratory in Lima for secondary check assay analyses.
The standard analytical package performed on all diatomite and phosphorite samples was as follows:
·
P2O5 (gravimetric analysis);
·
major oxides (ICP-OES analysis); and,
·
SiO2 (gravimetric analysis).
In  addition  to  the  analyses  indicated  above,  samples  were  collected  and  submitted  to  Certimin  for  moisture  and  relative  density  analysis  by  water
displacement method during Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programs. Due to sample handling and processing issues with the Phase 1 density samples it
was determined by Focus and Golder that the Phase 1 relative density samples had experienced moisture loss due to air drying and the samples and
analytical results were deemed unreliable for determining moisture content and relative density. During Phase 2 exploration work Focus personnel applied
special sample selection and handling procedures to ensure collection of reliable relative density samples for the individual phosphorite and interburden
beds as well as for  the general overburden and underburden units.
The following sections detail the sample selection, collection, transport, preparation and analyses procedures and methodology employed by Focus during
the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs.
11.2
SAMPLING METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES
11.2.1
Sample Interval Identification
Sample intervals were marked on the drill core and recorded in the drill logging datasheet by the Focus logging geologist.  Sample interval lengths ranged
from 0.08 to 0.97 m (mean of 0.25 m) in the phosphorite and 0.10 to 1.27 m (mean of 0.58 m) in the diatomite.
Focus sampled the entire continuous sequence of diatomite and phosphorite in each drill hole so that there were no gaps in the downhole sampling record.
This was done to provide detailed interburden dilution grade data and to allow for the potential evaluation of bulk mining of closely spaced during later
modelling, mine planning and processing activities. The continuous sampling also provided flexibility in adjusting phosphorite and diatomite boundaries
should the analytical results support such adjustment in areas where the contacts were gradational or grade variation was difficult to assess.

11.2.2
Sample Collection And Packaging
88
Once each sample interval was recorded in the drill logging datasheet the logging geologist selected each sample in sequence (Figure 11-1) and placed
each one inside a plastic sample bag pre-labeled with the sample number. A sample tag was also placed inside the sample bag before the bag was sealed
with a cable tie (Figure 11-2). When the core was moist the phosphorite samples were wrapped in brown paper (Figure 11-3) before being placed in the
sample bags to prevent the phosphorite sample from sticking to the sample bag. The sample number and the sample interval from and to depths were
recorded in the directly into the drill logging datasheet by the logging geologist.
The sealed sample bags were then placed in 70 litre plastic sample barrels (Figure 11-4). Each sample barrel held 43 packaged samples; once full the
barrels were sealed with a metal clamp and were held in the core facility until a shipment batch (approximately 8 barrels) were ready for transport to the
primary analytical laboratory facility.
The remaining un-sampled core was carefully reorganized in the core box and the lids were returned to the boxes before they were racked on the metal core
storage racks at the logging facility.

Insertion Of Field Quality Assurance/Quality Control Standards
Field QA/QC samples were inserted into the sampling stream by the logging geologist during the sampling process. The QA/QC field standards used by
Focus included:
·
¼ Core Duplicates – ¼ core duplicate assay sample (using half of the split core that was retained for reference purposes.
·
Coarse Blanks – coarse, locally sourced diatomite from the barren Upper Diatomite Series (above the Diana ore zone). Five samples were processed and
analysed for P2O5 (gravimetric analysis) at Certimin and 5 samples were analysed at SGS (both laboratories located in Lima, Peru); all of the coarse blank
characterization samples returned P2O5 values of less than 5 wt.%.
·
Pulp Blanks – Three commercially prepared pulp blanks were purchased from Canadian Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Canada. The pulp blanks (P5B,
CDN-BL-4 and CDN-BL-10) were sourced from igneous rocks and were not ideally suited to phosphate and will be replaced with a more appropriate matrix
matched commercial pulp blank in the future.
·
Certified  Reference  Materials  –  Four  commercially  prepared  certified  reference  material  standards  (CRM’s)  were  purchased  from  Geostats  Pty  Ltd  of
Australia. The CRM’s were matrix matched from sedimentary phosphate in Tunisia and Australia. The following standards were used by Focus:
§
GPO 14 - 24.52 wt.% P2O5
§
GPO 16 - 17.76 wt.% P2O5
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
§
GPO 17 – 13.55 wt.% P2O5
§
GPO 18 – 15.09 wt.% P2O5
91
The field standards were inserted randomly into the sample number sequence by the logging geologist. The field standards were placed in a plastic sample
bag and secured with a cable tie in the same fashion as the regular analytical samples. Generally, one CRM and one blank (either coarse or pulp blank) was
inserted every 20 samples but were not inserted at regular intervals or at the same location in each drill hole. The logging geologist generally tried to insert
the mineralized CRM standards within zones of similar estimated grade of mineralization in the sample sequence before, within or immediately after the
mineralized sample. Blanks were inserted at the end of mineralized runs to measure carry-over etc.
Each sample submission batch was nominally the same size (43 samples) and was designed to include as a minimum the following standards in each
batch:
§
2 ¼ Core duplicates
§
2 CRM’s (grade matched to the estimated mineralization)
§
2 blanks (either coarse or pulp)
A detailed discussion of the QA/QC analysis and results is presented later in this section.

SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES
11.3.1
Primary And Secondary Analytical Laboratories
All  sample  preparation  and  primary  analyses  for  all  samples  from  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  exploration  programs  was  performed  at  the  Certimin  S.A
(Certimin)  laboratory  in  Lima  Peru.  The  Certimin  laboratory  is  an  ISO  9001:2008  and  ISO  14001:2004  certified  and  Peruvian  Government  National
Accreditation Service (INDECOPI) accredited analytical laboratory with certificates in good standing (certificate renewal date : May 2019). Certimin has
significant experience providing analytical services to the phosphate exploration and other exploration industries in Peru.
As part of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 analytical QA/QC programs, select pulp duplicates were submitted to the SGS del Peru S.A.C. (SGS) Laboratory in
Callao  (Lima)  Peru  for  the  purpose  of  performing  check  assay  analyses.  The  SGS  laboratory  is  an  ISO  9001:2008  certified  and  Peruvian  Government
National Accreditation Service (INDECOPI) accredited analytical laboratory with certificates in good standing (certificate renewal date : December 2017).
SGS has significant experience providing analytical services to the phosphate exploration and other exploration industries in Peru.
11.3.2
Sample Preparation
All Phase 1 and Phase 2 sample preparation work was performed at the Certimin laboratory. Focus personnel delivered the samples to the sample receiving
area (Figure 11-5). Certimin immediately inspected the sample batch and sample submission sheets from Focus to ensure all samples were accounted for
and the required analyses were clearly indicated.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

Figure 11-5: Certimin Sample Reception and Check-In Area
The Focus samples were then checked into the laboratory computer database and a bar code label was printed and placed on each sample bag; a unique
sample bar code was provided for the sample preparation phase and then a second unique sample bar code was provided for the analytical sample upon
completion of the sample preparation process.
Once the samples were checked in to the database they were weighed on a balance (Figure 11-6) and the value was entered in to the database sample
record. Temperature and humidity were recorded (once daily at 8 am) in the sample reception and weighing area to ensure that all samples are processed
and weighed under constant conditions.
The samples were then placed on trays and dried in an oven (Figure 11-7) to remove any free moisture.
Following the drying process, the samples move to the primary crusher (Figure 11-8) where they were crushed to pass a 2 mm (#10 mesh) screen. Quartz
was used to clean the crusher after every 10 samples.
The crushed material was then passed through a riffle splitter to separate the sample and reject material. Every 43 samples Certimin creates a lab duplicate
sample; for batches of less than 43 samples they will prepare a minimum of one lab duplicate sample.
The reject from the riffle splitter was placed in a sample bag and then placed in rice bags and stored in the reject storage area (stored for up to three months).

Figure 11-8: Primary Crusher
Following crushing and splitting, the sample then moved to a disc grinder (Figure 11-9) where it was milled to pass a 106 micron (#140 mesh) screen. The
disc grinder was cleaned with quartz every 5 samples.
The milled product was then weighed, entered into the computer system and placed in a sample envelope. A new sample bar code was assigned to the
milled sample and the sample was placed in a box (Figure 11-10) with the other samples from the batch prior to being delivered to the analytical laboratory
for analyses.
Prior to delivering the sample boxes to the analytical laboratory the laboratory internal standards and replicates were inserted into the sample batch. The
laboratory internal standards were assigned sample number bar codes and were packaged in the same manner as the analysis samples so they couldn’t be
identified as standards by the analytical laboratory personnel.

The Laboratory internal standards and replicates were inserted into each sample batch according to the following schedule:
·
2 laboratory duplicates;
·
1 blank;

·
1 standard rock;
·
1 standard oxide;
·
1 pulp duplicate; and,
·
1 reject duplicate.
Following the completion of the analyses, the remaining analysis sample material was returned to the sample preparation area and the samples were stored
in boxes (Figure 11-11) along with the sample reject material for three months.
Typical sample preparation processing time, from receipt of the samples to delivery to the analytical lab, was two days.

11.3.3
Sample Analyses
The standard analytical package performed on all diatomite and phosphorite samples was as follows:
§
P2O5 by gravimetric analysis (Figure 11-12);
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
§
97
major oxides by ICP-OES analysis (Figure 11-13); and,
§
SiO2 by gravimetric analysis.
During the Phase 1 analytical program the standard analytical package was performed on all samples (both phosphorite and diatomite) while during the
Phase  2  program  P2O5  (gravimetric  analysis)  was  first  performed  on  all  samples  followed  by  major  oxides  (ICP-OES  analysis)  and  SiO2  (gravimetric
analysis).
In  addition  to  the  analyses  indicated  above,  samples  were  collected  and  submitted  to  Certimin  for  moisture  and  relative  density  analysis  by  water
displacement method during Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programs. Due to sample handling and processing issues with the Phase 1 density samples it
was determined by Focus and Golder that the Phase 1 relative density samples had experienced moisture loss due to air drying and the samples and
analytical results were deemed unreliable for determining moisture content and relative density. During Phase 2 exploration work Focus personnel applied
special sample selection and handling procedures to ensure collection of reliable relative density samples for the individual phosphorite and interburden
beds as well as for  the general overburden and underburden units.
Balances for the gravimetric analyses undergo annual calibration/certification and are checked daily using a set of mass standards. The Certimin ICP-OES is
set up to run a check analysis on a suite of internal standards and blanks every 30 samples.
Following  completion  of  the  required  analyses  the  results  are  reviewed  by  the  laboratory  internal  QA/QC  manager  to  ensure  all  internal  standard  and
replicate analysis results are within the accepted tolerance. Once approved the database reassigns the original client sample number to the record in the
database and the analysis certificates and data spreadsheets are prepared and delivered to the client.
11.3.4
Analytical Results
Analyses were performed by Certimin on a total of 6,980 samples from the entire diatomite (4,494 samples) and phosphorite (2,845 samples) sequence in all
62 drill holes.
A summary of the analytical results for the individual phosphorite beds is presented in Table 11-1. A summary of the analytical results for the individual
diatomite beds is presented in Table 11-2.

SAMPLE SECURITY
All drill core from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programs was transported back to the secure core logging and storage facility on a daily basis. The core
logging and storage facility is located inside a locked compound with an armed security guard at the JPQ port facility.
All core logging and core sampling was performed at the secure Focus core logging facility. The core facility was a purpose built structure adjacent to the
Focus field office and consisted of plywood walls with plastic windows and a sheet metal roof. Core logging benches were positioned along the walls of the
logging area, with core splitting benches located in a separate area. A work bench for storing sampling supplies, field standards and blanks, laptops and
other core logging and sampling materials was located down the center of the core logging facility
The Sample selection and packaging was performed by Focus geologists and core technicians under the supervision of the Focus project manager.
The drill core was placed in core boxes immediately upon removal from the core barrel. Once a core box was complete a box top was prepared with the drill
hole number, box number and depth from and to intervals and the top was then placed on the core box.
All core was transported to the secure core storage facility on a daily basis; core was never left unattended at the drill site. The drill core was stored in
covered core boxes and racked on metal core racks while awaiting logging. The core racks are located outside but have a sheet metal roof covering them to
protect them from direct sunlight and the elements.

standards,  duplicates  and  blanks  to  evaluate  analytical  precision,  accuracy  and  potential  contamination  during  the  sample  preparation  and  analytical
process. The field QA/QC samples were inserted by Focus geologists during the core logging process; for details on the field QA/QC sample insertion
process please refer to Section 11.2.3 of this technical report.
In addition to the field inserted QA/QC samples, Focus selected 64 pulps after sample preparation at Certimin and submitted them to SGS for check assay
purposes during Phase 1. No check assay information was provided for Phase 2.
The QA/QC sample summary and insertion rates for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs are presented in Table 11-4.

Certified Reference Material Standards.
Focus used four commercially prepared phosphate CRM standards to monitor laboratory analytical accuracy. The CRM standards were purchased from
Geostats Pty Ltd. of Australia. The CRM’s were matrix matched from a sedimentary phosphate in Tunisia. The following standards were used by Focus:
·
GPO 14 - 24.52 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.288)
·
GPO 16 - 17.76 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.147)
·
GPO 17 – 13.55 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.117)
·
GPO 18 – 15.09 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.117)
A total of 294 blind CRM standards were submitted to Certimin for analysis for the two phases. Focus and Golder prepared and evaluated QA/QC control
charts for each of the CRM standards (Figure 11-14). The CRM control charts show that all CRM standard results fell within the upper and lower warning
limits for P2O5 grade. All four CRMs show an upward drift in the last two lots of samples submitted on May 17, 2015 and May 25, 2015. While the results are
within the acceptable tolerance, the accuracy of the analysis should be monitored to avoid any positive bias.

Coarse and Pulp Duplicates
Focus submitted blind coarse duplicates comprising ¼ core samples (half of the core split retained for reference purposes) to the primary laboratory and pulp
duplicates for check assays at a secondary laboratory to evaluate for analytical precision.
A total of 294 blind coarse duplicates were submitted to Certimin for analysis during Phase 1 and 2. Focus and Golder prepared and evaluated QA/QC
control charts comparing the original and duplicate analyses performed at Certimin (Figure 11-15, Control Charts – P2O5 Coarse and Pulp Duplicates). The
P2O5 control charts identified a two occurrences where a duplicate analysis was significantly different to the primary analysis (6.34 wt.% versus 13.07 wt.%
and 1 wt% versus 2.02 wt%).
A  total  of  64  pulp  duplicates  were  submitted  to  SGS  for  check-assay  analysis  in  Phase  1.  No  information  on  check-assay  analysis  from  Phase  2were
provided. Golder prepared and evaluated QA/QC control charts comparing the original Certimin and duplicate SGS analyses (Figure 11-15, Control Charts –
P2O5 Coarse and Pulp Duplicates) for Phase 1. The P2O5 control charts identified a small cluster of pulp duplicates that fall outside of the control limits; this
cluster occurs at the low grade end of the results and is a result of the difference between the P2O5 detection limits for Certimin and SGS. All remaining
duplicate analyses returned results matching the original analysis.

Coarse and Pulp Blanks
Focus used two commercially prepared pulp blank standards and one internally prepared (by Focus) coarse blank standard to monitor potential laboratory
sample preparation and analytical contamination. The pulp blank standards were purchased from Canadian Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Canada. The pulp
blank standards (P5B, CDN-BL-4 and CDN-BL-10) were sourced from igneous rocks and were not ideally suited to phosphate and will be replaced with a
more appropriate matrix matched commercial pulp blank in the future. The coarse blank standard was prepared using locally sourced diatomite from the
barren Upper Diatomite Series (above the Diana ore zone). Five samples were processed and analysed for P2O5 (gravimetric analysis) at Certimin and five
samples were analysed at SGS (both laboratories located in Lima, Peru); all of the coarse blank characterization samples returned P2O5 values of less than
5 wt.%.
A total of 252 blind blank standards were submitted to Certimin for analysis. Focus and Golder prepared and evaluated QA/QC control charts for the pulp and
coarse  blank  standards  (Figure  11-16).  The  majority  of  the  coarse  blank  standards  plotted  within  the  control  limit  of  5.0  wt.  %  P2O5.  There  were  three
episodes where the coarse blank standards exceeded the warning limit of 3.0 wt% P2O5 from the samples submitted on April 28, May 17 and May 25 2015.
This could have been resulted from the coarse blank sample containing lenses with higher phosphate content, as pulp Material used for making the coarse
blank standard should be reviewed. All of the pulp blanks plotted at or below 1.0 wt.% P2O5 and well within the control limit of 3.0 wt.% P2O5 for the coarse
blanks.

Certimin Internal Laboratory Analytical Quality Assurance And Quality Control
In addition to the field based QA/QC program implemented by Focus, Certimin also performed their own internal analytical QA/QC program that included the
insertion  of  blind  CRM  standards,  duplicates  and  blanks  to  evaluate  analytical  precision,  accuracy  and  potential  contamination  during  the  sample
preparation and analytical process. The laboratory standards were a combination of blind standards inserted by laboratory sample preparation and QA/QC
personnel prior to analysis, as well as routine testing of reference standards during the analytical process (i.e. during ICP-OES analysis).
11.5.3
Qualified Person Comment On Analytical Quality Assurance And Quality Control Program
It  is  Golder’s  opinion  that  the  Focus  QA/QC  protocol  and  the  laboratory  internal  QA/QC  protocol  applied  during  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  exploration
program were appropriate, followed and well documented during the analytical process. It is Golder’s opinion that analytical samples showing no significant
bias and that the quality of Certimin analyses results can be considered reliable for use in estimating Mineral Resources.
11.6
PRIMARY LABORATORY AUDIT
As part of the 2014 Qualified Person site visit the Golder Qualified Person performed a laboratory audit visit to the During the laboratory audit visit the Golder
Qualified Person reviewed the sample chain of custody, sample receiving, sample preparation, analytical process and reporting of results procedures with
the senior Certimin laboratory personnel, including the Certimin manager for internal QA/QC; the Focus database and QA/QC manager was also present on
the site visit as well as a senior technical manager from the Golder Lima office.
The Certimin sample receiving, sample preparation, analytical and sample storage areas were visited and standard laboratory procedures were reviewed
with the technical personnel responsible for each area or analysis. Golder also reviewed the internal laboratory QA/QC documentation present at each stage
of  the  process;  this  documentation  included  daily  records  of  temperature  and  humidity  in  sample  receiving  and  sample  preparation  areas,  scale  and
analytical instrument daily standard calibration records, annual inspection/certification seals and/or certificates for scales and analytical instruments and the
results of monthly and annual round robin testing results for the analytical instruments.
11.7
QUALIFIED PERSON STATEMENT ON SAMPLING, ANALYSIS AND QUALITY CONTROL
It is Golder’s opinion that appropriate chain of custody and internationally recognized sample selection, sample preparation, analysis and QA/QC procedures
were  followed  during  the  sample  preparation  and  analytical  process  for  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  exploration  programs.  It  is  Golder’s  opinion  that  the
samples collected during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs were of high quality and were representative of the phosphorite mineralization
within the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession with no significant sample bias.

DATA VERIFICATION
12.1
DATA VERIFICATION PROCEDURES
12.1.1
Focus Data Verification
107
As Golder personnel were not involved directly during the implementation of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs the primary quality control and
data verification measures taken were in the form of a desktop review of the data and observations provided by Focus. As the procedures and methodology
used in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration programs were developed collaboratively by Focus and Golder personnel, Golder is satisfied that the data and
observations  from  the  exploration  programs  can  be  considered  reliable  for  use  in  geological  modelling  and  resource  estimation.  The  key  areas  of  the
exploration program data and observation verification carried out by Golder are presented in the following sections.
Drill Hole Collar Location Verification
The Golder Qualified Person visited 12 of the 62 drill hole locations on the Bayovar 12 Concession property in order to verify and document the reported drill
hole locations. The drill holes visited for collar location verification were selected at random by the Golder Qualified Person while in the field to ensure there
was no bias in drill hole selection by the Focus personnel. The Golder Qualified Person did not conduct a site visit during the Phase 2 drilling program;
however, Golder personnel were on site performing geotechnical logging and collection hydrogeological data and confirmed the presence of a number of the
Phase 2 drill holes.
Drill hole collar monuments, indicating the drill hole name, completion date and depth, were photographed (Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2) and drill hole collar
coordinates for each of the 12 drill holes visited were recorded using a handheld non-differential GPS. The handheld GPS coordinates were compared to the
surveyed collar coordinates and differences in easting and northing were calculated. The results of the collar coordinate comparison are presented in Table
12-1. The differences between the drill hole verification coordinates and the surveyed collar coordinates are within the error limits of the handheld GPS.
Logging and Sampling Procedure Verification
Golder did not actively participate in the implementation of the Phase 1 exploration drilling and sampling program; however, Golder did work collaboratively
with Focus to develop the exploration drilling, logging, sampling and analytical program procedures and methodology that was implemented. The Golder
Qualified Person was able to observe the implementation of the core splitting, logging and sampling procedures during the Qualified Person current personal
inspection site visit (Figure 12-3 and Figure 12-4).  Golder provided senior geological support during the implementation of the Phase 2 exploration drilling
program; additionally, Golder personnel were directly involved in geotechnical logging and collection of hydrogeological data for two of the Phase 2 drill
holes.

Golder also performed a desk top review of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 descriptive logs, sample interval data, analytical data and core photos provided by
Focus to verify that all data and observations were collected in a manner consistent with the prepared exploration drilling, logging, sampling and analytical
program procedures and methodology.
Geological Data and Interpretation Verification
Geological  data  and  interpretation  verification  performed  by  Golder  was  in  the  form  of  a  desktop  review  of  the  descriptive  logs,  sample  interval  data,
analytical data and core photos to ensure the geological database was free from typographic errors or omissions.
Golder prepared graphic logs for each of the 62 drill holes using all available data for each drill hole. Lithology intervals were reviewed and where minor
errors or omissions were identified Golder performed these adjustments. Likewise, Golder reviewed phosphorite and diatomite bed correlations between drill
holes and where minor errors or omissions were identified Golder performed these adjustments.
Analytical Data Verification
Analytical data verification performed by Golder includes cross referencing the spreadsheet analytical data against pdf copies of the Certimin laboratory
certificates to ensure the analytical database was free from typographic errors or omissions.
Golder  independently  compiled  and  reviewed  the  Focus  analytical  QA/QC  analyses  results  (see  Section  11  for  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  analytical
QA/QC review), including analytical blank, standard and duplicate analyses for test work performed by Certimin as well as reviewing check-assay analyses
performed at SGS Peru, the secondary laboratory.
Basic statistics of the analytical data were reviewed by Golder on a unit by unit basis to evaluate the potential for phosphorite bed miscorrelations as well as
to identify any potential outliers or errors. The modelled grade parameters were also reviewed by Golder on a unit by unit basis as a final check for potential
miscorrelations, outliers or errors.
Golder did not independently collect samples to submit for analyses.
12.2
LIMITATIONS ON DATA VERIFICATION
As discussed previously, JPQ performed limited reconnaissance exploration work on the Bayovar 12 Concession in 2012; however, Golder and Focus could
not verify the methodology and results from the 2012 JPQ work to a level where they could be relied upon for use in the geological modelling process and
resultant resource estimates. As a result the 2012 JPQ work was not used for modelling and resource estimation as reported in this technical report.
Given the fact that the Focus Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programs were designed such that the Focus drill hole spacing pattern was complete on its own
and did not rely on any previous work for points of observation, Golder does not see the exclusion of the 2012 JPQ work as an issue or limitation that impacts
the reliability or representativeness of the current geological model and the resultant Mineral Resource estimate.
12.3
QUALIFIED PERSON STATEMENT ON DATA VERIFICATION
It  is  Golder’s  opinion  that  the  exploration  data  and  observations  from  the  62  drill  holes  completed  during  the  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  exploration  drilling
programs have been appropriately verified for the purpose of completing a geological model, estimating Mineral Resources and preparing an NI 43-101
compliant Mineral Resource estimate technical report.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
112
No metallurgical testing has been performed prior to 2014 on the phosphorite layers underlying the Bayovar 12 Concession. The phosphorite layers are
extensive and similar to those being mined by Vale (Bayovar Concession 2) and to those being developed by Fosfatos del Pacifico (Bayovar Concession 9).
The unconsolidated phosphorite layers from Concessions 2 and 9 do not require grinding. The bench-scale test program for Bayovar 12 phosphorite layers
examined the proven unit operations for recovering concentrate from the ore at Concessions 2 and 9.
The bench-scale testing in 2014/15 was performed by Jacobs Engineering (Jacobs) to develop a process for recovering a phosphate rock product from the
Bayovar 12 phosphorite layers. The work by Jacobs is summarized in the reports “Beneficiation Testing Focus Ventures Ltd.,” “Scrubbing, Settling, and
Filtration Testing” and “Focus Bench Scale Flow Sheet Validation”. Jacobs has operated a laboratory and pilot plant for evaluating phosphate ore samples
since 1977. The Metallurgical laboratory does not have ISO certification, but the chemist is a member in good standing of the Association of Fertilizer and
Phosphate Chemists (AFPC) and participates in the AFPC quality control program. The analytical laboratory normally uses check sample 22 and AFPC
approved procedures to chemically analyze samples.
13.1
METALLURGICAL SAMPLES
The metallurgical testing was performed on two sets of samples.
Focus Ventures geology team in Peru took the first set of samples from air-dried drill cores. Jacobs’ preparation and characterization of these samples are
described in Sections 13.1.1 and 13.1.2. Testing these samples was directed at recovering a phosphate rock concentrate containing +29% P2O5 that was
suitable for conversion to phosphatic fertilizer by acidulation and granulation.
The second sample set comprised two composite samples – one for phosphorite layers 2 through 6 and the other for phosphorite layers 11 to 13, both of
which had been prepared by ALS, an analytical laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia. ALS had previously dried and crushed the cores to obtain a
representative  sample  for  chemical  analysis.  The  two  representative  composites  were  prepared  from  PQ  diameter  drill  core  drilled  specifically  for
metallurgical test work. Testing these samples was directed at recovering a concentrate containing +24% P2O5 that was suitable for use as direct application
phosphate rock (DAPR). Jacobs’ chemical analysis of these two composites is discussed in Section 13.4.
13.1.1
Preparation Of 13 Individual Layer Composites
For  purposes  of  metallurgical  testing,  13  composite  samples  were  prepared,  each  representing  a  major  phosphorite  layer  drilled  in  the  Bayovar  12
concession. The Focus geological team selected the drill holes used for making the composite samples. Table 13-1 identifies the composite samples and
the drill holes from which the cores for the 13 phosphorite layers were obtained. The samples are arranged in the table below from the top layer (PH01) to the
bottom (PH13).

The above samples and the sample inventory sheets were received in good condition. The core samples for all composites except PH01 and PH04 were
dried at nominally 100 ºC, weighed, stage crushed in a roll crusher to pass 3 mm, then blended and riffle split to obtain a head sample and 1000 gram
aliquots for subsequent testing. PH01 and PH04 were weighed as received, stage crushed in a roll crusher to pass 3 mm, then blended and riffle split to
obtain a head sample and 1000 gram aliquots for subsequent testing. PH01 and PH04 were not dried.
13.1.2
Sample Characterization
A portion of the head sample for each composite was pulverized and chemically analyzed using AFPC approved procedures.
The water-soluble salt content of each pulverized sample was measured by weight loss after water washing and rinsing on a filter with a glass frit. The
mineral density of each composite was determined by water displacement using a pycnometer. The bulk density of dry crushed material for each composite
was determined with a graduate cylinder, by recording the sample weight and then the volume before (loose bulk density) and after consolidation (tamped
bulk density).
The data obtained for each composite are presented in Table 13-2. Composite PH01 contained more Fe2O3 and Al2O3 than the other composites and also
had the highest mineral density (specific gravity) and bulk density.
QEMSCAN analysis performed at the Colorado School of Mines determined that the major minerals in the washed material (+53 µm) were predominantly
apatite, with lesser quantities of gangue minerals such as quartz, feldspars, and gypsum. The washed material was examined as three size fractions, +600
µm, 600/150 µm, and 150/53 µm. The QEMSCAN report is presented in Jacobs, 2015, “Beneficiation Testing Focus Ventures Ltd.”  For the +600 µm fraction,
the percentages of liberated apatite particles were low for PH01 (8%), PH02 (60%), and PH04 (40%), and ranged from 68% to 93% for the other composites.
For the 600/150 µm fraction, the percentages of liberated apatite particles were below 40%, except for PH01, PH04, PH10, and PH11.
For the 150/53 µm fraction, the percentage of liberated apatite particles was greater than 90%, except for PH01 and PH04, in which only 13% and 42% of the
phosphate particles were liberated. This size fraction contained more quartz and feldspar than the coarser fractions.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

Concentrates obtained from the other Bayovar phosphorite deposits are typically low grade for export phosphate rock. For Bayovar 12 many of the apatite
particles in the +600 µm and 600/150 µm fractions are not liberated, partly explaining why the average P2O5 content of the washed concentrate seldom
exceeds 30%. Also, the quartz, feldspars, and gypsum in the 150/53 µm fraction are diluents that lower the P2O5 content of the washed concentrates.
The -53 µm fraction of the phosphorite from Bayovar 12 is comprised mostly of diatomite, with some carbonate minerals and clays.
13.1.3
Sample Representation
The Focus geological team selected the drill holes so that the 13 composite samples would have P2O5 contents similar to those of the 13 phosphorite layers
(NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Technical Report on the Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project). The P2O5 contents are compared onTable 13-3. As shown on the
table, the P2O5 contents of the composite samples are similar to the weighted average P2O5 contents of the corresponding phosphorite beds. The mean
difference of the 13 data pairs was 0.73% P2O5.
The P2O5 contents of the composite samples are considered not representative of the P2O5 contents of the indicated resource, if the mean difference of
0.73% P2O5 is significantly greater than 0.00% P2O5. The 90% confidence limits of the mean difference can be determined from the following relationship.
mean ± t x std. deviation/(count)0.5, where
mean = 0.73 from Table 13.1.3
t = 1.796 from student t value for a = 5% at 12 degrees freedom
std. deviation = 1.76 from Table 13.1.3
count = 13 from Table 13.1.3, (13)0.5 = 3.606
lower 95% limit = 0.73 – 1.796 x 1.76/3.606 = 0.73 – 0.88 = -0.15
upper 95% limit = 0.73 + 1.796 x 1.76/3.606 = 0.73 + 0.88 = 1.61
The 90% confidence limits (-0.15 ≤ 0.73 ≤ 1.61) include 0 and therefore the P2O5 contents of the composite samples used for metallurgical tests did not differ
significantly from the P2O5 contents of the indicated resources at the 5% level.

The samples, labeled as 1 of 2 and 2 of 2, were received in good condition. Sample 1 of 1 comprised PH02, PH03, PH04, PH05, and PH06 in proportion
with the indicated resource tonnage. At the time the sample was prepared, it was envisioned that PH 01 would not be processed because it made lower
grade concentrate than the other phosphorite layers. Sample 2 of 2 comprised PH11, PH12, and PH13 in proportion with the indicated resource tonnage.
Phosphorite layers PH07, PH08, PH09, and PH10 were not considered in this particular round of test work.

BENCH-SCALE TESTS OF INDIVIDUAL LAYER SAMPLES
13.2.1
Drum Scrubbing And Desliming
Drum scrubbing is a proven unit operation for disaggregating unconsolidated phosphorite. The retention time and slurry % solids for drum scrubbing were
investigated using the larger composite samples (PH02, PH06, and PH13). Dry ore was placed in a 20 cm diameter drum and diluted to 37% solids, 45%
solids, or 50% solids and rotated at 49% of critical speed for 2 minutes, 2.5 minutes, and 3 minutes respectively. The drum discharge was wet screened at 53
µm. The laboratory data indicated that the yield and % P2O5 of +53 µm material were similar for each condition; however, the wet screening technique may
have confounded the data because soft lumps were pushed through the screen by hand. Based on visual observation, the fewest soft lumps remained after
scrubbing at 37% solids. Consequently, the scrubbing parameters selected for subsequent tests were 37% solids slurry and 3 minutes retention time for all
13 composite samples.
PH01 and PH04 composites were not dried prior to drum scrubbing at 37% solids. For the other composites, dry sample was added to the scrubber and
diluted to 37% solids. The general perception was that the moist samples were more completely disaggregated by drum scrubbing than the dried samples.
When the confirmation tests were performed on each composite sample, the samples were moistened to about 30% moisture prior to scrubbing at 37% solids
for 2 minutes. A comparison of the yields and % P2O5 of the +53 µm material is provided in Table 13-5. The yields expressed on Table 13-5 are based on dry
material without salt.

The first two rows of Table 13-5 deal with PH01 and PH04, which were tested in a moist condition both times. The yield was lower by 3.5% weight and the
grade was higher by 0.6 % P2O5 for the confirmation tests.
For the remaining 11 comparisons on Table 13-5, the “A” set of tests was performed by adding dry sample to the scrubber, and the “B” set of tests were
performed by adding moist samples to the scrubber. On average, the yield from moist samples was 11.8 % weight lower than the yield from dry samples. The
grade of +53 um material obtained from moistened samples averaged 24.5% P2O5 compared to 18.9% from dry samples. The data demonstrate that drying
the samples before testing changes the test result and that moistening samples before they are tested can reverse the effect of drying.
The average P2O5 content of the +53 µm material recovered from moist samples after the drum scrubbing and desliming step was 24.5 % P2O5, which is a
suitable grade for direct application phosphate rock (DAPR).
The scrubbing procedure using moist sample instead of dry sample is an important consideration for future tests. Preferably future metallurgical samples
should not be dried prior to scrubbing. Drying appears to make the samples more refractory to scrubbing by hardening the diatomite aggregates. If the future
samples have been dried, a 5-minute rehydration period prior to scrubbing should be allowed.
13.2.2
Attrition Scrubbing And Desliming
The purpose of attrition scrubbing is to disaggregate the remaining diatomite so that it can be removed by desliming. In a commercial plant the attrition feed
% solids will be controlled by the primary cyclone underflow. The slurry viscosity is increased by the diatomite and the cyclone underflow is expected to be
about 55% solids. Consequently the laboratory attrition tests were performed at 55% solids.
M3-PN140103

One stage and two-stage attrition were tested. The lab data indicated that the % P2O5 of the deslimed attrition cell discharge was not significantly different for
one or two stage attrition; however, two stage attrition reduced the recovery of P2O5 by as much as 6%.
Attrition cell retention times of 8 minutes, 12 minutes, and 16 minutes were tested. The test data did not show significant changes in the yield or P2O5 content
of the +53 µm material due to retention time. Nevertheless, 12 minutes retention was selected for confirmation tests.
The attrition scrubber discharge was wet screened and the size fractions were analyzed to investigate the desliming cut points of 53 mm, 74 mm, 105 mm,
and 150 mm. The P2O5 content of the <600 mm coarse product with progressively finer cut points is presented in Table 13-6. Similarly, the weight yield of
<600 mm coarse product with progressively finer cut points is presented in Table 13-7. Only the <600 mm fraction is dealt with here because the >600 mm
must undergo a second stage of attrition.
From Table 13-6 it is apparent the 600/150 mm fraction has a higher and more consistent P2O5 content than the three fractions with finer cut points. The %
P2O5 declines as the cut point becomes progressively finer, averaging 29.25% for the 600/150 mm fraction and declining to an average 25.58% for the
600/53 mm fraction.
From Table 13-7 it is apparent that the 600/150 mm fraction has lowest weight recovery (average = 34.86%) and the most variable weight recovery (standard
deviation  =  ±16.77%)  of  the  four  size  fractions.  There  is  considerable  variation  in  weight  recovery  from  layer  to  layer,  which  means  that  performance
predictions depending on particle size are specific to each layer.

The yields of slimes (-53 mm) and product (+53 mm) after drum scrubbing, desliming, attrition scrubbing, and desliming of each composite sample are shown
on Table 13-8, as are the P2O5 contents of the slimes and product. Drum scrubbing used moist samples diluted to 37% solids with 3 minutes retention time.
Attrition scrubbing used the +53 µm from the drum discharge diluted to 55% solids with 12 minutes retention time. The deslimed attrition cell discharge,
including the >600 mm, contained 26.1% P2O5 on average, which is below the normal minimum for phosphate rock sold for use in phosphoric acid plants,
but is suitable for use as DAPR.

The final washed products were sieved at 600 µm and 150 µm to determine which fraction was causing the grade dilution. Except for PH01, the grade
dilution was consistently caused by the 150/53 µm fraction, which averaged 22.7% of the composite weight and 23.8% P2O5. Combining the +600 µm and
the 600/150 µm fractions gave an average
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
120
yield of 19.9% weight with 29.5% P2O5, which meets the normal minimum for commercial phosphate rock used to manufacture phosphoric acid, but the yield
is low.
To achieve the normal minimum grade for commercial phosphate rock with an improved yield it is necessary to upgrade the 150/53 µm fraction by flotation.
Flotation is not a required component in the current Bayovar 12 flowsheet for the production of DAPR, however results of laboratory test work by Jacobs on
the 150/53 µm fraction can be found in Section 3.10 of Jacobs, 2015 “Beneficiation Testing Focus Ventures Ltd.,”.
13.2.3
Observation Of Apatite Liberation
When apatite particles are classified as liberated that means that less than 5% of the particle area was gangue, classified as a middling means 5% to 35% of
the particle area was gangue, and classified as locked means that more than 35% of the particle area was gangue. Practically, the Bayovar 12 apatite
particles were either liberated or middling, as only trace amounts of locked particles were observed.
The liberation of phosphate (apatite) in three size fractions is summarized in Table 13-9.
With  the  exception  of  PH01  and  PH04,  the  150/53  µm  apatite  particles  were  well  liberated.  Generally  the  600/150  µm  apatite  particles  were  not  well
liberated. The +600 µm apatite particles were normally better liberated than the 600/150 µm apatite particles; however the chemical analyses did not support
that observation (see Table 13-7). Very likely the 600/150 µm apatite particles had gangue smeared on their surfaces which gave them the appearance of
middling and locked particles.

Additional Drum Scrubbing And Desliming
As stated in Section 13.2, there was concern that the wet screening technique may have confounded the data because soft lumps were pushed through the
screen by hand.
Composite samples 1 of 2 and 2 of 2 were drum scrubbed for 3 minutes at 37% solids and then wet screened at 600 µm and 53 µm to obtain +600 µm,
600/53 µm, and -53 µm fractions. The soft lumps remaining after scrubbing were not pushed through the screens by hand. The test results are summarized in
Table 13-10 and Table 13-11.

The above data show that considerable acid insoluble material remained in the 600/53 µm and +600 µm fractions when the soft lumps are not forced through
the screen by hand. Consequently the total +53 µm material after drum scrubbing and primary desliming would contain less than 24% P2O5. Focus Ventures
intends to produce direct application phosphate rock (DAPR) containing a minimum of 24% P2O5. Consequently, further processing by attrition scrubbing
and desliming would required to complete disaggregation of the diatomite and allow the production of DAPR containing more than 24% P2O5.

Vacuum Filter Leaf Tests
Filtration tests were performed on the 600/53 µm product from sample 1 of 2 and sample 2 of 2 to determine the filter cake moisture content and the filtration
unit area for dewatering service and also for dewatering plus counter current washing service. Sieve analysis of each filter cake was performed and the
results are summarized in Table 13-12.
The original particle size distribution of the filter feed was 100% passing 600 µm and 100% coarser than 53 µm. The presence of 3.5% to 4.6% weight of -53
µm in the filter cakes is attributed to the disaggregation of diatomite lumps during filtration and sieving.

If  the  filter  feed  had  been  attritioned  and  deslimed  the  diatomite  aggregates  would  have  been  removed  and  the  P2O5  analysis  of  the  feed  would  have
increased. The diatomite remaining in the filter feed also adversely influenced the filtration, as shown in Table 13-13.

The  unit  area  of  4.0  m2/t/h  for  dewatering  service  (D  only)  is  excessive  because  the  cake  dry  time  exceeded  the  cake  form  time  due  to  the  remaining
diatomite reducing the rate of water removal. The expected unit area for dewatering and rinsing of properly scrubbed and deslimed Bayovar concentrate
would be in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 m2/t/h. The expected unit area for dewatering only of properly scrubbed and deslimed Bayovar concentrate would be less
than 0.3 to 0.5 m2/t/h.
The moisture content of the above filter cakes ranged from 24% to 24.7%. This high moisture content is attributed to moisture held within the voids of the
remaining diatomite aggregates. The expected moisture content of properly scrubbed and deslimed Bayovar concentrate filter cake would be 15 to 18% by
weight.
The counter current rinsing did not reduce the cadmium content of the filter cakes, so the dimensions of the filters can be based on tonnage rate and the unit
area for dewatering only.
13.3.3
Nac Analysis Of Filter Cake
The percentage of available P2O5 for each filter cake was determined by neutral ammonium citrate analyses (NAC). The filter cakes from sample 1 of 2 and 2
of 2 contained 6.06% and 8.90% available P2O5, respectively. According to the International Fertilizer Association (IFA), phosphate rock with more than 5.4%
available P2O5, as determined by NAC analysis, has a “High” classification for Direct Application.
13.3.4
Attrition Scrubbing Of +600 µm Material
The +600 µm material recovered after drum scrubbing and desliming contained aggregates of diatomite because the soft diatomite lumps had not been
pushed through the screen by hand. The +600 µm material from sample 1 of 2 and sample 2 of 2 was attritioned for 6, 9, 12, and 15 minutes and then
deslimed  at  53  µm.  The  high  diatomite  content  significantly  increased  the  slurry  viscosity  and  consequently  the  %  solids  of  the  attrition  feed  had  to  be
reduced from 55% to 40% by weight to. Figure 13-1 presents the P2O5 grade vs. recovery after the attrition cell discharge was deslimed at 53 µm. Generally,
the recovery decreased and the grade increased as attrition time increased. The lower right most points on Figure 13-1 are for 6 minutes attrition, and the
next 3 points up and to the left are for 9, 12, and 15 minutes attrition. For sample 1 of 2 there was no improvement in grade after 9 minutes. For sample 2 of 2
the grade continued to improve as attrition time increased. Twelve 12 minutes of attrition were required to attain a grade of 24% P2O5 for sample 2 of 2.

Static Cylinder Settling Tests
Several settling tests were performed on -53 µm material from samples 1 of 2 and 2 of 2 to select an appropriate flocculant and to determine the unit area for
thickening the material to about 20% solids. Arrmaz flocculant #1 performed well for both samples and was used for the remainder of the settling tests. The
test results are summarized in Table 13-14. The unit area requirement is reduced by adding flocculant or by increasing the feed slurry % solids. The unit area
requirements for conventional thickeners were excessive.

MATERIAL ISSUES AND DELETERIOUS ELEMENTS
As shown in Table 13-2, the phosphorite layers contain water-soluble salt, ranging from about 3% to 8% weight. The salt must be removed from the plant
water system with the tailings to avoid saturation of the process water. Consequently, recycle water must be recovered upstream of the tailings pond. The salt
bleed stream (tailings) will dictate the makeup water required by the plant.
The Apatite mineral at Bayovar 12 has a relatively low P2O5 content due to:
·
CO3 substitution for PO4 in the crystal lattice
·
The apatite grains are not completely liberated

Table 13-15 gives the chemical quality of combined concentrate obtained from each composite by drum scrubbing, desliming, attrition scrubbing, desliming,
size classification and flotation of the 150/53 µm fraction.
The upper layer (PH01) produces lower % P2O5 concentrate with higher cadmium content and therefore will be monitored closely during exploitation. The
above chemical compositions of composites PH02 to PH13 indicate that the phosphate rock can readily be converted to phosphoric acid (% P2O5 > 28.5 and
COR < 1.65) and high analysis fertilizers (MER < 0.100).
Bayovar phosphate concentrates typically contain +5% CO2 and +10% LOI (at 1000°C), which indicates that concentrates exceeding 30% P2O5 may be
obtained by calcination to remove water of hydration as well as organic and inorganic carbon. The substitution of CO3 for PO4 in the crystal lattice causes the
Bayovar phosphate concentrates to be highly reactive and well suited for use as direct application phosphate rock (DAPR).

The Jacobs data for washed products after drum scrubbing, primary desliming, attrition scrubbing of 600/53 µm, attrition scrubbing of +600 µm, secondary
desliming, and tertiary desliming are presented on Table 13-16. The “Deviation” given in the last row of the table is calculated by dividing the standard
deviation by the mean.
The grade Deviations for the +600 µm and 600/53 µm are relatively small. In other words the +600 µm and 600/53 µm have similar grades for all phosphorite
layers. Except for PH01, the +600 µm and 600/53 µm fractions consistently contain well in excess of 24% P2O5. The grade Deviation for the 150/53 µm
fraction is 11.1%. This increased deviation results from the variable amount of near size gangue minerals in the different layers.
The % weight Deviations for the three size fractions are very large, indicating that the relative proportions of +600 µm, 600/53 µm, and 150/53 µm fractions
differ considerably from layer to layer.
The laboratory data indicate the simple washing flowsheet with desliming at 53 µm can produce a concentrate averaging more than 24% P2O5 except for
layers  PH01  and  PH02.  If  PH01  is  excluded,  the  yield  and  P2O5  grade  average  44.6%  and  24.8%  respectively.  The  average  grade  of  +24%  P2O5  is
acceptable for DAPR. To bring the washed products from PH01 and PH02 up to a grade of 24% P2O5 it would be necessary to coarsen the tertiary slimes cut

slimes cut point.

CONCLUSIONS
Testing of individual phosphorite layers established a robust process for production of a 29% P2O5 concentrate suitable for the manufacture of phosphoric
acid. The same testwork demonstrated that the phosphorite layers were also suitable for the production of two qualities of DAPR. Focus selected the DAPR
flowsheet to take advantage of the ease of beneficiation and unique reactivity of the Bayovar 12 phosphorite ores.
The flowsheet for producing two qualities of DAPR is illustrated as a block flow diagram in Figure 13-2. With reference to Figure 13-2, 24% P2O5 DAPR is
produced when the tertiary desliming cut point is adjusted to 53 µm and 28% P2O5 DAPR is produced when the tertiary desliming cut point is adjusted to 105
µm. Coarsening the cut point from 53 µm to 105 µm rejects more lower grade near size material and thereby increases the concentrate grade. The hydrosizer
(tertiary) cut point may be adjusted by increasing the teeter bed density set point or by increasing the flow of teeter water.

RECOVERY ASSUMPTIONS
13.6.1
Recovery Assumptions
Figure 13-2: DAPR Flowsheet, Mode A (24%) and Mode B (28%)
126
127
Statistical analysis of the lab data show that concentrate yield is predictable based on the P2O5 content of the plant feed; however, from Tables 13-7 and 13-
16 it is evident that the particle size distribution (PSD) varies considerably from layer to layer.
The proposed beneficiation plant has two operating modes. Mode A is for producing nominally 24% P2O5 concentrate and Mode B is for producing nominally
28% P2O5 concentrate. Once the mine pit is fully opened, material from layers PH01, PH02, PH05, PH07, PH08, PH09 and PH10 will normally be treated
with  the  plant  in  Mode  A  and  material  from  layers  PH03,  PH04,  PH06,  PH11,  PH12,  and  PH13  will  be  treated  with  the  plant  in  Mode  B.  The  process
disaggregates the unconsolidated phosphorite material and then separates it according to size into a coarse fraction enriched in phosphate (concentrate)
and a fine fraction that is phosphate poor (waste). Because recovery is dependent on both the PSD and the P2O5 content of the plant feed, the concentrate
yield is predicted layer-by-layer and block-by-block within the geologic model. The concentrate yield increases if the P2O5 content of the plant feed increases
and the yield decreases if the P2O5 content of the plant feed decreases.
Test data and projected run of mine (ROM) data for Mode A are presented on Table 13-17.
The weight recovery (yield) of concentrate from each phosphorite layer is projected based on the laboratory results, considering the % P2O5 and % soluble
salt of the plant feed. The projected yield = (lab yield x ROM % P2O5 / lab feed % P2O5) x (1-%Salt/100).
Examples:
>600 µm concentrate for PH01
yield = Test % Wt >600 µm x ROM % P2O5 / Test feed % P2O5 x (1-ROM %salt/100)
yield = 1.18 x 12.33 / 15.42 x (1-6.51/100) = 0.88 % of ROM (dry basis with salt)
600/53 µm concentrate for PH02
yield = Test % Wt 600/53 µm x ROM % P2O5 / Test feed % P2O5 x (1-ROM %salt/100)
yield = 43.64 x 11.15 / 11.35 x (1-7.71/100) = 39.58 % of ROM (dry basis with salt)
Because the tertiary desliming cut point is 53 µm in Mode A, no recovery adjustment to the 600/53 µm fraction is required.
The combined yield is the sum of the >600 µm and 600/53 µm concentrate size fractions. The 27.493 million metric dry tons of ROM processed in Mode A is
projected to contain 1.77 million tons salt, 10.614 million tons of concentrate, and by difference 15.110 million tons of -53um (-270 mesh) plant waste.
The  %  P2O5  of  concentrate  recovered  from  each  phosphorite  layer  is  projected  to  be  the  same  as  the  %  P2O5  of  the  concentrate  recovered  from  the
composite sample of that layer by laboratory testing. This projection holds if the ROM % P2O5 differs from the composite sample tested. The weight averaged
concentrate grade from Mode A is projected to be 24.14% P2O5. The projected Mode A LOM feed tonnes in Table 13-17 are 1.3% higher than those forecast
in mine production schedule Table 16-1. The projected Mode B LOM feed tonnes in Table 13-18 are 1.3% lower than those forecast in Table 16-1. The total
LOM feed tonnes for combined products is balanced.

Table 13-17: Projected Grade and Yield of Resources Processed from Operating Mode A (24%)
128
Test data and projected resource data for Mode B are presented on Table 13-18.
The weight recovery (yield) of concentrate from each phosphorite layer is projected based on the laboratory results, considering the plant feed % P2O5 and %
soluble salt.
The projected yield = lab yield x resource % P2O5 / lab feed % P2O5 x (1-%Salt/100). For Mode B, the concentrate size fractions are +600 µm and 600/105
µm. Consequently the laboratory data for the 600/53 µm concentrate fraction must be adjusted to 600/105 µm. The adjustments for each phosphorite layer
are based on the data in Tables 13-6 (grade) and 13-7 (recovery)
Examples:
+600 µm concentrate for PH03
yield = Test % Wt >600 µm x ROM % P2O5 / Test feed % P2O5 x (1-ROM %salt/100)
yield = 7.69 x 17.52 / 19.38 x (1-5.23/100) = 6.59 % of ROM (dry basis with salt)
600/53 µm fraction for PH04
yield = Test % Wt 600/53 µm x ROM % P2O5 / Test feed % P2O5 x (1-ROM %salt/100)
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
yield = 59.31 x 13.59 / 20.37 x (1-5.35/100) = 37.45
129
Because the tertiary desliming cut point is 105 µm in Mode B, a recovery adjustment to the 600/53 µm fraction is required. The recovery adjustments are
shown on Table 13-18.
600/105 µm concentrate for PH04
yield = 600/53 µm % of ROM x recovery adjustment
yield = 37.45 x 88.72% = 33.23 % of ROM (dry basis with salt)
The combined yield is the sum of the +600 µm and 600/105 µm concentrate size fractions. The 31.278 million metric dry tons of ROM processed by Mode B
is projected to contain 1.207 million tons salt, 10.269 million tons of concentrate, and by difference 19.802 million tons of plant waste.
The  %  P2O5  of  concentrate  recovered  from  each  phosphorite  layer  is  projected  to  be  the  same  as  the  %  P2O5  of  the  concentrate  recovered  from  the
composite sample of that layer by laboratory testing. This projection holds if the resource % P2O5 differs from the composite sample tested. The grade
adjustment to the 600/53 µm depends on the phosphorite layer and the desliming cut point. The weight averaged concentrate grade produced by Mode B is
projected to be 28.83% P2O5.
The grade adjustments for a cut point of 105 µm are shown on Table 13-18.
Example:
600/53 µm fraction for PH04
fraction % P2O5 = lab grade = 28.48% P2O5
600/105 µm concentrate for PH04
Concentrate % P2O5 = lab grade + adjustment
Concentrate % P2O5 =28.48 +1.00 = 29.48 P2O5

RECOMMENDATIONS
The individual layer test work used composite samples prepared from the cores of nine drill holes within the global resource. Subsequent resource drilling
and chemical analyses of 62 drillholes indicate that the average grade of the phosphorite layers has increased from 12.7% to 13.7% P2O5. It is therefore
recommended that additional testing be performed with core samples of phosphorite layers from different locations within the proposed mine pit to determine
if the recovery assumptions and predicted concentrate grades are applicable over the entire mine pit. The proposed number of drill holes to be included in
this variability testing is five for the first 5-year mining block and two each for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 5-year mining blocks, for a total of 11 holes. If the proposed
test work results demonstrate that the recovery assumptions and predicted concentrate grades are valid over the entire mine pit, the variability testing may be
terminated and pilot plant testwork initiated. However, if the recovery assumptions and predicted concentrate grades are not applicable over the entire mine
pit, more variability testing within the problematic mining blocks would be recommended prior to pilot plant testing.
Additional settling tests and if applicable, filtration tests are recommended to establish unit area requirements for high rate thickeners and filtration rates for
concentrates prepared according to the flowsheet. This work could be performed in conjunction with the variability testing program. Future bench-scale
metallurgical  testing,  if  practical,  should  be  performed  with  samples  that  have  not  been  dried.  If  dried  samples  are  available  for  use,  they  should  be
rehydrated to approximate the insitu moisture content prior to testing.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
14.1
DEFINITION OF MINERAL RESOURCES
131
For estimating the phosphate Mineral Resources for Bayovar 12 Project, Golder has applied the definitions of “Mineral Resource” as set forth in the CIM
Definitions Standards adopted May 10, 2014  (CIMDS) by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Council.
Under CIMDS, a Mineral Resource is defined as:
“…a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral
Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling.”
Mineral Resources are subdivided into classes of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, with the level of confidence reducing with each class respectively.
Mineral Resources are always reported as in situ tonnage and are not adjusted for mining losses or mining recovery.
14.2
MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY
14.2.1
General
Geological  modelling  and  subsequent  mineral  resource  estimation  was  performed  by  the  Golder  Qualified  Person  in  accordance  with  Golder  internal
modelling  and  resource  estimation  guidelines  and  in  accordance  with  the  CIM  Estimation  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  Best  Practice
Guidelines (May 2003 edition).
The  geological  data  compilation,  interpretation,  geological  modelling  and  Mineral  Resource  estimation  methods  and  procedures  are  described  in  the
following sections.
14.2.2
Geological Database
All available Phase 1 and Phase 2 drill hole data and observations provided by Focus were compiled and loaded into an MS Access geological database.
Using the database Golder performed a series of in-house visual basic scripts, designed to review and identify common problems in geological base data,
on the raw data to ensure that the base data were free of errors or omissions.
Golder identified a limited number of minor typographic errors and omissions that were reviewed with Focus personnel prior to being corrected by Golder.
Based on the differences identified between the collar elevation versus the DEM topography model elevation it was decided that the precision of the DEM
data  were  more  reliable  than  the  collar  elevation  surveys,  and  as  a  result,  all  collar  elevations  were  adjusted  to  the  topography  surface  elevation.  The
structural model was reviewed for all drill holes to ensure this adjustment did not result in the creation of structural anomalies and none were identified.

Geological Interpretation
Once the geological base data was reviewed and deemed to be free of errors or omissions Golder independently reviewed all phosphorite bed picks and
correlations.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
132
Golder used Golden Software’s Strater™ program to assist with the unit picks and correlation. The lithological data and observations, sample intervals and
analytical results for each drill hole were imported into Strater and a series of downhole geological logs were created for each of the 62 Focus Phase 1 and
Phase 2 drill holes. The phosphorite-diatomite contact roof and floor picks performed by the Focus drill site geologists were reviewed by Golder using the
drill hole descriptive geological logs, core photographs and the down hole analytical results.
The review process identified a small number of occurrences where the phosphorite bed roof and floor contacts were not consistent with the analytical
results; for example, a sample identified as occurring above the roof of the phosphorite bed in the geological log returned P2O5 grade results consistent with
the phosphorite bed rather than the overlying diatomite bed. Minor mismatches between roof and floor contacts logged in the field and analytical results are
not surprising given the gradational nature of the phosphorite and diatomite contacts and the difficulty in estimating subtle decreases or increases in the
apatite pellet content in the drill core when establishing geological unit contacts during core logging. The instances were reviewed with Focus personnel
prior to being adjusted by Golder to ensure the geological intervals were consistent with the analytical results.
Once the drill hole geological intervals were reconciled with the downhole analytical results, Golder performed a review of the overburden, phosphorite and
diatomite bed correlation interpretations that were provided by Focus. Using the Strater drill hole geological logs, correlation fences were created in both the
east-west and north south directions across the Bayovar 12 Concession. An example of the fence sections used for correlation purposes is presented in
Figure  14-1.    All  62  of  the  Focus  drill  holes  were  included  in  the  correlation  fences.  Golder  reviewed  the  drill  hole  to  drill  hole  correlations  for  each
overburden, phosphate and diatomite bed in the sequence.
As a result of this review process, a small number of phosphorite bed miscorrelations were identified by Golder; the miscorrelations commonly occurred in
sequences where there were numerous thin, closely spaced phosphorite beds and units were incorrectly correlated between holes. There were also a few
isolated instances where a unit was inadvertently mislabelled in the Focus drill hole record, resulting in a miscorrelation. The miscorrelations were reviewed
with Focus personnel prior to being adjusted by Golder to ensure the geological intervals were properly correlated across the Focus drilling area.
Any  revisions  to  the  drill  hole  unit  picks  and  or  unit  correlations  were  tabulated  and  updated  in  the  geological  database  prior  to  commencing  with  the
geological modelling process.
14.2.4
Topographic Modelling
Focus provided Golder with topography data for the project area in the form of a Digital Surface Model (DSM) in registered raster file format (.tif). The DSM
was prepared by Pacific Geomatics Ltd. (in August 2014) using 1.5 m SPOT6 Tristereo satellite imagery. Gross errors were fixed in the DSM in stereo. The
easting and northing data was adjusted by Pacific Geomatics Ltd. to fit with available 0.50 m data for the area. Although DSM models differ from Digital
Elevation Models (DEM) in that DSM’s do not process out features like vegetation and building, there are no such features present on the Bayovar 12
Concession.

Figure 14-1: Example of Correlation Fence Section
The  DSM  covered  the  entire  extent  of  the  Focus  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  exploration  program  area  as  well  as  most  of  the  remainder  of  the  Bayovar  12
Concession. Golder processed the DSM provided to extract the data as ASCII format xyz point data.
The  ASCII  xyz  format  elevation  data  were  then  imported  into  MineScape  StratModel  and  gridded  using  a  10  by  10  m  grid  covering  the  Bayovar  12
Concession. The gridded topography surface was then contoured on 2 m contour intervals and visually inspected to evaluate for potential problem areas.
The contoured topography surface was compared against publically available lower resolution SRTM and ASTER topography data for the area to ensure
there were no significant differences in the DSM based topography model.
As a final check of the modelled topography surface, drill hole collar elevations were compared against the topography model elevations at the drill hole
collar coordinates. For the most part the surveyed collar elevations were in good agreement with the topography elevations but there were a small number of
isolated holes with differences in excess of 1 m (mean difference of 0.77 m, range of 0.07 to 4.11 m).
Based on the differences identified between the collar elevation versus the DSM topography model elevation it was decided that the precision of the DSM
data were more reliable than the collar elevation surveys, and as a result, all collar elevations were adjusted to the topography surface elevation. Once the
stratigraphic and structural model was generated (see below) the model surfaces were reviewed for all drill holes to ensure this adjustment did not result in
the creation of structural anomalies and none were identified.

14.2.5
Stratigraphic And Structural Model
134
Stratigraphic and structural data from the verified geological database was imported to the StratModel™ application of the Ventyx MineScape geological
modelling and mine planning software in preparation for the construction of a gridded stratigraphic and structural model.
The  stratigraphic  and  structural  grid  modelling  process  in  StratModel™  is  controlled  by  a  schema  that  defines  the  rules  and  procedures  used  in  the
construction of the stratigraphic and structural model. The schema includes parameters that indicate the type of interpolator, search radii, and extrapolation
distances to be used in the modelling process.  The schema also defines the stratigraphic sequence and the conformable and non-conformable relationships
between adjacent stratigraphic units, as well as the relationships between stratigraphic units and structural features.
The stratigraphic grid model comprises gridded structure surfaces for each modeled overburden, phosphate, interburden and underburden unit. The modeled
units in their stratigraphic order are presented in Figure 14-2. The structure grids created represent the individual unit roof, floor, vertical thickness (roof minus
floor) and true thickness.
There were no faults included in the Bayovar 12 model schema as none were identified in the drill hole geological data nor were any faults identified in a
review of the regional geological mapping coverage for the area surrounding the Bayovar 12 Concession.
A planar interpolator was used for thickness calculations while a Finite Element Method interpolator was used for surface calculations. The stratigraphic
model is based on a series of gridded elevation and thickness horizons, with grid cell geometry of 50 by 50 m (east-west by north-south).

Development of the MineScape stratigraphic and structural model is an iterative process involving gridding the data, checking the results by way of visual
review of cross sections and structure isopleth maps, and then adding interpretive control points where needed before re-gridding. For the sake of brevity an
example of a representative geological section from the Bayovar 12 model is presented in Figure 14-3, Representative Cross Section from the Geological
Model  and  a  representative  structure  isopleth  map  is  presented  in  Figure  14-4,  Representative  Phosphorite  Bed  Thickness  Isopleth  Map;  all  additional

14.2.6
Density/Specific Gravity
To facilitate the conversion of modelled volumes to tonnes Golder calculated dry basis and wet basis relative density values for all modelled phosphorite
beds and waste units using relative density and moisture analyses data collected during the Phase 2 exploration drilling program. The replaces the global
default relative density values used during the previous Mineral Resource estimate report.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
136
In instances where there were three or more relative density samples for a specific phosphorite unit, a mean value was calculated using the dry density data
and a wet density value was calculated using the dry density data and moisture data specific to that phosphorite unit. Where there were fewer than three
relative density samples for a specific phosphorite unit a mean value was calculated using the dry density data and a wet density value was calculated using
the dry density data and moisture data from the entire set of phosphorite relative density analyses (Table 14-1).
In a similar manner, default dry basis and wet basis relative density values were calculated for the diatomite interburden units and the overburden and
underburden units (Table 14-2).
14.2.7
Grade Model
Using the verified modelling database and the finalized stratigraphic  and  structural  model,  a  phosphate  grade  gridded  model  was  developed  using  the
StratModel application of MineScape. The grade model was developed using the same 20 by 20 m spaced grid that was used for the stratigraphic and
structural grid model.
The grade grid model comprises gridded surfaces for each modeled grade parameter for each individual phosphate and diatomite bed; the grade model grid
surfaces are spatially associated with the corresponding stratigraphic model grid surfaces. The grade parameters included in the model were: P2O5; Al2O3;
CaO; Fe2O3; MgO; and SiO2.
Ply basis grade samples were composited on a unit basis, creating a single composite sample interval for each phosphorite bed and each diatomite bed that
is intersected in each drill hole. The grade composites were length and density weighted. The composited grade data were then gridded using a Finite
Element Method interpolator.

Grade  isopleth  maps  were  prepared  for  each  gridded  grade  parameter  for  each  individual  phosphate  unit.  The  grade  contours  were  compared  against
postings from the drill hole composites to ensure the model was representative of the base drill hole analytical data. For the sake of brevity a representative
grade isopleth map from the Bayovar 12 model is presented in Figure 14-5; all additional grade isopleth maps, including coverage for all 16 phosphate units,
are  available  on  the  Focus  website  (www.focusventuresltd.com)  in  a  downloadable  supplemental  graphics  package  (pdf  format)  for  the  Bayovar  12
Concession geological model.
Summary statistics for the composite grade parameters were also reviewed for each individual phosphate unit. Any potential outliers or issues identified in
the visual inspection and statistical review were followed up by Golder to ensure the model was free from erroneous data, compositing errors or interpolation
errors.
14.3
MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION AND CLASSIFICATION
Using the finalized stratigraphic and structural model and the grade model, Golder estimated phosphate Mineral Resources for the Bayovar 12 Concession
using  the  StratModel  application  of  MineScape.  Phosphate  Mineral  Resources  were  estimated  for  each  individual  phosphorite  bed  from  PH01  through
PH13. The lower three beds, PH14, PH15 and PH16, were excluded from the resource estimate due to limited thickness and low grades.
As per NI 43-101 guidelines and CIMDS definitions the Mineral Resources were reported as in situ tonnage and were not adjusted for mining losses or
mining recovery. No minimum mining thickness or grade cut-off parameters were applied.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
140
Resource volumes and grade were estimated for each phosphorite and diatomite bed using the corresponding unit roof and floor grids from the structural grid
model. The volumes for each phosphorite and diatomite bed were then converted to tonnes using the phosphorite bed specific relative density values.
Golder performed classification of the Mineral Resources in the StratModel application of MineScape according to the CIMDS definitions as referenced in NI
43-101. Mineral resources have been classified into Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource using area of influence polygons around points of
observation. A point of observation is defined as a complete intercept of the bed (both roof and floor intercepted) with core recovery within the bed exceeding
90%.
Classification  was  performed  individually  for  each  phosphorite  bed  using  drill  hole  intercepts  on  the  floor  of  the  unit  for  the  location  of  the  point  of
observation. The area of influence polygons were generated on the floor surface for each phosphorite bed rather than on the horizontal plane to allow for the
dip of stratigraphy.
To aid in establishing Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource area of influence polygons for use in resource classification, Golder performed a
statistical and geostatistical analysis of the phosphorite bed thickness and P2O5 grade data. The review included evaluation of basic descriptive statistics as
well as a preliminary review of variograms for phosphorite thickness and P2O5 grade for all 16 phosphorite beds. Given the relatively limited dataset (62 drill
holes) and the general uniformity of thickness and grade across the concession area for most of the phosphorite beds, the preliminary review of the thickness
and P2O5 variograms suggested a broad range for the variograms.
Figure 14-5: Representative Phosphorite Bed P2O5 Grade Isopleth Map
Golder recommends that additional close spaced drilling is required to improve the evaluation of close range variance and hopefully improve the variogram
modelling. Golder recommends that the geostatistics be evaluated further once
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
additional  drilling  and  analytical  data  are  available  to  determine  if  the  results  support  a  less  conservative  area  of  influence  based  classification  for  the
Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral Resources.
The resultant areas of influence classification parameters used by Golder for the Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral Resource estimate are as follows:
141
·
Measured Mineral Resources – 400 m spacing between points of observation
·
Indicated Mineral Resources – 800 m spacing between points of observation
·
Inferred Mineral Resources – 1,600 m spacing between points of observation
For the sake of brevity a representative Mineral Resource Classification map from the Bayovar 12 Mineral Resource estimate is presented in Figure 14-6,
Representative Mineral Resource Classification Map; all additional Mineral Resource Classification maps, including coverage for all 13 phosphorite beds,
are  available  on  the  Focus  website  (www.focusventuresltd.com)  in  a  downloadable  supplemental  graphics  package  (pdf  format)  for  the  Bayovar  12
Concession Mineral Resource estimate.

As a result of the area of influence classification parameters applied and the 800 m nominal spacing of drill holes across most of the drill coverage, the bulk
of the classified mineral Resources fall within the Indicated and Inferred mineral resource categories. A small area of Measured Mineral Resources was
classified in the area of the 400 m spaced infill drilling. Additional infill drilling to 400 m spacing between drill holes will be required for the estimation of
additional Measured Mineral Resources under the current Mineral Resource classification parameters.

Mineral Reserve Estimates
15.1
General
146
The Mineral Reserve update developed by IMC uses the mineral resource model developed by Golder as described in Section 14 and expanded the open
pit  to  develop  the  20  Year  Mineral  Reserve  encompassing  the  increased  production  of  P205  products  during  Years  1  through  3.  The  Mineral  Reserve
increases by 7.5% from 54.7 to 58.8 million dry tonnes. The updated open pit design criteria are the same as developed by Golder for the previous design
work presented in the Pre-Feasibility Study dated December 18, 2015. The design criteria are included in this section for completeness.
In  accordance  with  NI  43-101  for  estimating  Resources  and  Reserves  of  the  Focus  Bayovar  12  Phosphate  Project,  IMC  has  applied  the  definitions  of
“Mineral Resource” and “Mineral Reserve,” as set forth in the updated CIM Definition Standards (CIMDS), effective in May 10, 2014, by the Canadian Institute
of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum Council.
A Mineral Reserve is defined as,
“…the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may
occur  when  the  material  is  mined  or  extracted  and  is  defined  by  studies  at  Pre-Feasibility  or  Feasibility  level  as  appropriate  that  include  application  of
Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. The reference point at which Mineral
Reserves are defined, usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations where the
reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being
reported. The public disclosure of a Mineral Reserve must be demonstrated by a Pre-Feasibility Study or Feasibility Study.”
A Mineral Reserve is subdivided into two classes, Proven and Probable, with the level of confidence reducing with each class respectively. The CIMDS
provides for a direct relationship between Indicated Mineral Resources and Probable Mineral Reserves, and between Measured Mineral Resources and
Proven Mineral Reserves. Inferred Mineral Resources cannot be combined or reported with other categories.
Except as stated herein, IMC is not aware of any modifying factors exogenous to mining engineering considerations (i.e., competing interests, environmental
concerns, socio-economic issues, legal issues, etc.) that would be of sufficient magnitude to warrant excluding reserve tonnage below design limitations, or
reducing reserve classification (confidence) levels from Proven to Probable, or otherwise.

ESTIMATED PHOSPHORITE RESERVES
15.2.1
INTRODUCTION
The Bayovar 12 phosphate deposit has been delineated over an area of approximately 34 km2. The deposit consists of sixteen mineralised units. This
Mineral  Reserve  Estimate  only  concerns  the  upper  13  of  the  16  total  modeled  units.  No  additional  mineralization  outside  the  deposit  modeled  was
considered in the Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates.
The updated Mineral Reserve statement is effective May 11, 2016.

MINING MODEL DEVELOPMENT
15.3.1
Criteria For Determination Of ROM Phosphorite
147
ROM mining surfaces were created by Golder in Ventyx, Minescape software Version 4.119 to account for anticipated 7.5-cm roof and 7.5-cm floor dilution
gain where the phosphorite capa was greater than the minimum mineable thickness of 30 cm. These estimated dilution and mining loss factors are based on
extracting the phosphorite with surface miners to recover the entire thickness of the capas to calculate ROM tonnages. ROM quality surfaces were also
developed to account for the dilution gains using the quality data from the geological resource model.
15.3.2
Beneficiation Plant Yield And Product Quality Model
Once the ROM model had been developed and checked, a product model was developed in Vulcan to account for yields due to plant beneficiation. Golder
developed the Vulcan product model using the recommendations published by Mr. Glenn Gruber (Gruber) in November 2015. Beneficiation plant yields are
estimated using a set of capa-specific predictive equations that are driven by the ROM (feed) P2O5 quality. Gruber based his updated recommendations and
equations on the results of bench-scale metallurgical testing performed on the metallurgical, geological holes drilled during 2014 and 2015. The overall
effects of mining losses, dilution gains, and beneficiation on production are discussed in further detail in Section 16.5.
IMC has relied exclusively upon the process plant yields developed and recommended by Gruber and has not independently verified the results of this
analysis.
15.3.3
Development Of The 3D Block Model For Pit Optimisation
After developing the ROM and product surfaces, the Golder Vulcan model was blocked into 3D cells 40 m by 40 m by 1.6 m in the X, Y, and Z, respectively,
for the purposes of pit optimisation. Using the same limits as the Vulcan resource model, approximately 21.7 M blocks were created. In areas requiring better
definition of the phosphorite capas and interburden, sub-blocks were created with a minimum size of 5x5x0.2m. The relevant ROM and product quality
attributes for each block were populated using Vulcan’s block calculation file (bcf). The 3D block model was checked against the Minescape estimates of
ROM and product tonnages and qualities to ensure that data integrity was maintained and that volumes, tonnages, or assay data were the same prior to 3D
blocking. After review, the 3D block model was loaded into Maptek’s Vulcan mine planning and mine design software for pit optimisation.
The 3D block model was transferred to IMC for use in the updated open pit design and mine production schedule. IMC has reviewed the procedures used to
develop the 3D block model and its attributes and accepts it for use in the development of the updated mineral reserve estimate.
15.3.4
Mineral Reserve Estimation Methodology
The assessment of surface-mineable phosphorite reserves within the project area was based on a 20-year mine plan open-pit design which incorporates
highwall  laybacks  on  the  estimated  20-year  mineable  reserve.  The  pit  design  resulted  from  a  targeting  process  beginning  with  pit  optimisation  and
proceeding through final pit design. The development of the 20-year mine plan pit is discussed in Section 16.
IMC started with the Golder pit design and expanded the design as needed to develop the updated 20 Year mineral reserve. The pit boundary assessments
were completed over a range of unit revenue values for phosphate concentrate on a dry basis (i.e. saleable product), with unit costs for mining, processing,
general and administration, production transportation etc. Golder’s unit costs shown in Table 15-1 below, were based on their experience and studies on
similar deposits.

Cost based on Golder’s experience
The 3D block model loaded into Vulcan formed the initial basis of volume estimates for the extent of the project area. Using the modifying mining factors and
plant performance yield and quality predictions, the blocks were populated with an economic value for the purpose of conducting LG pit optimisation.
Based on the requirement of the 20-year, 1.0 M tonnes phosphate concentrate (product tonnes) per year mine plan, the Golder final pit configuration was
designed on the $90/tonne of phosphate concentrate pit optimisations. The resulting pit shell limits for these incremental pits were used for phasing design,
refinement of the pit shell and developing the mine plan and schedule.
The design criteria for the final pit configuration are shown in Table 15-2 below.

Mineral Reserve Estimation Statement
The Phosphate Mineral Reserves expressed as mined phosphorite dry tonnes and phosphate concentrate (product in dry tonnes) are shown in Table 15-4
and Table 15-5. The Mineral Reserve Estimate is based on a minimum capa thickness of 30 cm and a 6% P205 cutoff grade for the run of mine (ROM)
phosphorite. IMC considers the criteria used to define the 20-year mineral reserve to be reasonable for public reporting. This assumes the reserve would be
exploitable using open-pit mining methods.

The Measured and Indicated Resource Estimates are inclusive of the Resources comprising the Proven and Probable Reserve Estimates described under
Mineral Resource Estimates. The Mineral Reserve is limited by the 20 year production schedule and pit design. There are mineral resources outside of the
pit  design  which  meet  the  economic  criteria  to  be  Mineral  Reserves  if  the  time  frame  was  extended  beyond  20  years.  Figure  15-1  shows  the  final  pit
geometry without the mine waste rock backfill.
15.3.6
Discussion of Potential Impacts of Factors on Mineral Reserve Estimate
The potential impacts to the mineral reserve estimate in the previous Pre-Feasibility Study are still valid and are included here.
Golder used gridded models of density for the resource and reserve estimates where available and applied the beneficiation model developed by Mr. Glenn
Gruber (Gruber) to model expected mass yields and phosphate concentrate tonnages due to beneficiation. Gruber’s evaluation and recommendations were
based on the results of the metallurgical testing performed on the geological drill hole samples drilled in 2014 and 2015.
A basic assumption of this Report is that the estimated phosphorite Resources and Reserves at the Project have a reasonable prospect for development
under the existing circumstances, and assuming a reasonable outlook for all issues that may materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimates.
Failure to achieve reasonable outcomes in the following areas could result in significant changes to the Resources and Reserve estimates presented in this
Report.
Golder estimated a roof mining dilution gain of 7.5 cm, a floor dilution gain of 7.5 cm, and a geology and recovery factor of 100 percent. These assumed
dilution and mining loss factors are based on extracting the phosphoritic beds using surface miners with closed spaced drilling to define bed horizons and
integrated GPS to control dilution and recovery.

A market for the product at current and forecasted prices of US$145/tonne and US$185/tonne on a dry basis for Product A (24% P205) and Product B (28%
P205) phosphate concentrate product respectively at the Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project was used for the reserve estimate.
15.3.7
Potential for Future Reserve Expansion
As stated in Section 15.2.4, the Mineral Reserves Estimate is based on the 20-year mine plan open-pit design with highwall laybacks and a target production
rate of 1.0 M tonnes (dry) of phosphate concentrate per year. Although Mineral Resources exist outside the 20-year mine plan pit, the mine schedule was
limited to the 20-year mine life. Mineral Resources outside of the designed pit were not considered in the Mineral Reserves Estimation. However, there is
strong indication of future mineral reserve expansion through further economic evaluation.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
The mine plan and production schedule are updated from the Pre-Feasibility Study dated December 18, 2015 to include:
·
A change in the plant configuration to a single line plant which will produce two direct application phosphate rock fertilizer (DAPR) products: Product A with a
target grade of 24% P2O5 and Product B at 28% P2O5;
·
An increase in the plant production in Year 1 to 760,000 dry tonnes of product and to 1 million tonnes of dry product starting in Year 2;
·
An adjustment to the mine sequence to maximize the in-pit backfill with waste rock;
·
Changes in the capacity of loading and hauling fleets and a switch to an owner-operated fleet;
·
An accelerated program of pre-production stripping
·
The inputs to the mine design and plan related to the geotechnical parameters and mining model are the same as the previous Pre-Feasibility Study and are
included in this report for completeness.
The annual mine production schedule is summarized in Table 16-1. The mine schedule has a target of approximately one million dry tonnes of the combined
two products per year with stockpiling of the products at the plant and port load out area to absorb the fluctuations in the mine schedule and shipping
schedule. Figure 16-1 is a general arrangement of the pit area, plant, and tailings storage facility (TSF). The pit is shown at the end of mining which includes
a major portion of it backfilled with waste. Waste rock not placed in the pit backfills will be stored on surface to the west and south of the pit or used for
embankments. The TSF embankments will be constructed with mine waste in two stages.

MINING OVERVIEW
156
The Project Site is contained within a low-lying, open, generally flat area, with elevations varying from 0 m to 30 m above mean sea level (amsl). The
Bayovar 12 phosphorite deposit is a shallow-sea sedimentary deposit dipping between 1°and 2° toward the north-northeast with sixteen primary capas,
thirteen of which will be mined. Due to the geological and topographic characteristics of the deposit, the overburden and a portion of the inter-bed waste will
be mined with front end loaders (FEL) and the phosphorite ore and the remaining inter-bed waste with selective surface miners. The waste will be hauled
with 89 tonne capacity trucks to the waste storage areas and phosphorite will be hauled the plant using the same size trucks. The trucks are equipped with
110 cubic meter boxes to maximize the carrying capacity of the trucks due to the low density of the materials being hauled.
The phosphorite extraction will be executed by a multiple bench open-pit mine progressing from south to north which will minimize the haul distance for the
waste tonnages throughout the mine life (waste to ore ratio including pre-production stripping and ore stockpiling is 7.19). The pit is sub-divided into 13
mining phases each with independent access for mining the ore and waste and hauling it to the respective locations. The sequence is similar to the previous
study which evaluated the pit sequence to start the mine in the lower waste stripping area of the deposit. Once a sufficient volume has been excavated, the
waste rock is back-hauled into the mined-out area. Incorporating the in-pit backfill (IB) design slopes and required mined-out area necessary to allow waste
rock to be backfilled within the pit, the in-pit backfilling will begin during Year 3 and continue for the balance of the 20 year schedule. During pre-production
through Year 2, waste will be delivered to ex-pit dumps to the south and west of the pit.  Waste will be delivered to the ex-pit dumps in subsequent years
when the haul distance is shorter to an adjacent ex-pit dump than to a pit backfill area. This occurs when stripping of the upper benches in a new mining
phase is started. The 423 million dry tonnes (511 million bcm’s) of waste removed over life of the production schedule is divided between the backfill within
the pit limits (73%) and the ex-pit dumps (26%) and TSF embankment construction (1%) on a bcm basis.
The front end loader (FEL) buckets (31 cubic meter) and the 89 tonne truck beds (110 cubic meter) are oversized due to the low density of the materials. The
overburden and interburden will be mined with the FEL, assisted by dozers where the interburden is thin. To minimize mining dilution and maximize recovery
and production capabilities, the phosphorite will be mined with GPS controlled selective surface miners. The mined phosphorite will then be loaded into the
89-tonne trucks either directly from the surface miner discharge conveyor, or using the FEL from the surface miner windrow.
The mine plan strives to maximize the number of available production faces for the various capas throughout the plan life in order to accommodate blended
plant feed requirements. Production equipment is included in the plan to source ore from multiple capas and maintain the blend and feed tonnage to the
plant. Additional flexibility is planned with ROM stockpile “fingers” to enable separation of individual or similar capas to provide feed during planned and
unplanned mine shutdowns. Phosphorite delivered from the stockpile will be loaded by a dedicated FEL to the mill feed hopper to blend ROM ore as best as
possible to meet the plant’s ROM % P2O5 grade requirements and product shipping schedule.
Figure 16-2 shows a typical pit arrangement with overburden stripping, phosphorite mining and  progressive closure using in-pit back-fill in the south part of
the pit.

SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER CONSTRAINTS
Precipitation in the region is strongly influenced by the El Niño phenomenon. El Niño is characterized by above normal water temperatures in the equatorial
Pacific Ocean that results from periodic changes in current patterns. These events occur cyclically, on average every 10 years. Not all El Niño warm current
events  result  in  high  precipitation  in  the  project  area.  The  total  annual  rainfall  without  the  presence  of  a  strong  El  Niño  is  very  low  with  a  mean  of
approximately 23.2 mm. Extreme precipitation events that have the potential to cause substantial flooding occur every 50 years on average. During the
strong El Niño event that occurred in December 1997 to April 1998, total rainfall amounted to 1,238.8 mm. During this event, water inundated the low lying
Sechura basin, including the planned Open Pit Area (OPA) and tailing storage facility (TSF), to an elevation of approximately 3m amsl forming the second-
largest lake in Peru (Figure 16-3). The flood level achieved during the 1997-1998 El Niño event is the highest in the historical record and is applied as the
design El Niño Event. The limits of this lake are used as the basis for protection berms that will be constructed around the facilities. A  5  m  high  flood
protection berm will be constructed along the north margin of the OPA that will tie-in to the TSF embankment at the east end. The flood protection berms
have a crest elevation of 5 m, with a 20 m crest width and 5H to 1V side slopes.
Storm water that collects in the open pit from direct precipitation will need to be managed. In addition, the topography of the area results in offsite run-on of
surface water from the tablazo west of the open pit, into the pit. As the ex-pit waste dumps are built to the south and west of the open pit, the upper surface of
them can be sloped away from the pit to divert the run off away from the pit.  Some areas of offsite run-on can be diverted and prevented from flowing directly
into the pit. The flat surface on the south and east sides of the pit does not allow storm water to be channeled and directed offsite. Crest berms along the pit
crest are proposed to prevent surface water flows into the pit from these flat areas. Storm water that falls directly on the pit or that cannot be diverted will be
collected in sumps in the pit that will be pumped to the TSF.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
158
During the phased development of the pit, the area of the open pit and areas of offsite runoff that will contribute to the pit inflows will vary. The largest open pit
area that will collect storm water is at the end of Year 2 prior to any pit backfill. The occurrences of pit flooding due to storm runoff will be infrequent, thus the
planned pumping system would consist of portable diesel-powered pumps. This would provide the flexibility needed to assure a rapid response, as required
and reduce non-productive periods. The water would accumulate in a sump in the lowest areas of the pit, and the option exists for discharge of water to either
the TSF or other storm-water storage facility. Pumping capacity should be provided to accommodate the 20 year event with limited disruption to operations
with a pumping capacity of 120 l/sec to 220 l/sec with an 85 m head gain. This pumping capacity should be in addition to the predicted seepage inflows. The
mining activity during a year will be in multiple phases at differing elevations so ore mining can occur on higher benches if the pit bottom is flooded for short
periods of time.
It is expected that sections of the surface water diversions will become in-filled with drifting sand and so it is proposed only to construct these when dictated
by the phased open pit mining plan and in advance of a predicted El Niño event. The diversion channels will be unlined and typically have average bottom
width of 10 m, a depth of 2 m and 2H to 1V side slopes. Total excavation required will be of the order of 110,000 m3.
Figure 16-3: Lake formed by El Niño Extreme Event of 1997-1998
Available information indicates that the static water table is close to the ground surface in the OPA. The pit will mine down to approximately 80 m below the
water table. The permeability of the Overburden and Interburden is based on 17 packer tests completed in geotechnical drill holes and the test  results
indicate low hydraulic conductivities of the Overburden and Interburden materials (Table 16-2). Due to the low hydraulic conductivities, dewatering wells
were

considered impractical for the pit development. The groundwater conditions are considered to be fully saturated for the full pit depth below mean sea level.

The open pit will be backfilled as mining progresses. Based on the current mine plan, the maximum open area will occur when Year 2 is complete. The
approximate area of the Year 2 pit is 1.76 km2 which is similar to the Phase 1 pit presented in the previous Pre-Feasibility Study which is approximately
1,200 m wide by 1,300 m long with a total area of approximately 1.56 km2. The seepage flow model was not re-examined for the new pit design and the
results of the previous work are included below.
A preliminary transient seepage flow model was set up using the seepage module in SLIDE™. The transient analysis was run for a period of three years at
three month time steps. The three year time frame generally corresponds with the rate that the pit phases will be developed to their full depth.
The combined seepage discharge from the floor and the side slopes of the pit at the end of Year 3 was estimated to be 7,550 m3/day (87 l/sec). Most of the
seepage will evaporate from the moist walls of the pit. Average daily evaporation rates (4.45 mm/day) applied over the open pit area are 6,950 m3/day (80
l/s); slightly less than the estimated seepage inflows, suggesting that some management of seepage inflows should be anticipated. Anticipated seepage
rates are estimated to be in the order of 2,400 m3/day (28 l/sec).
Recently excavated faces are anticipated to generate seepage and seepage inflows from the working face will be managed through trenches and channels
to convey water to sumps at the lowest level of the pit where solutions will be pumped to the TSF. Pit seepage is estimated to add approximately 4.0% to the
tailings inflow rate and the tailings pond is sized to accommodate these additional inflows. Periods of lower evaporation and contributions from storm water
will result in greater pumping rates.
Refinement  of  the  water  balance  for  the  TSF  sizing  and  evaluating  the  feasibility  of  pumping  the  seepage  inflows  to  the  tailings  impoundment  will  be
important for the feasibility level study under consideration.
The pit will extend, at its deepest, to approximately 80 m below the phreatic surface. Due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the materials, it is not anticipated
that the pit walls will depressurize significantly, and geotechnical stability modelling for the pit slopes has been carried out with this assumption.
Golder evaluated the geologic, hydrologic, and geotechnical conditions for the design basis pit as detailed in Section 16.5. For prefeasibility planning Golder
recommends a 26° overall wall angle. The open pit depth will reach approximately 80 m below the ground water table.  Based on hydrogeological test data
and indicated low hydraulic conductivities, dewatering wells are considered impractical for the pit development. The groundwater conditions are considered
to be fully saturated for the full pit depth below mean sea level. Numerical seepage analyses and experience at similar nearby mines indicates that dry open-
pit mining will be feasible and predicted groundwater seepage inflows will be manageable allowing for mining of the deposit with 65˚ temporary dig face
angles. The bench design allows the bench faces to ravel as they dry and weather to angles as flat as 35° while maintaining 8.5 m safety benches.
Based on measured in situ material density and moisture-density (proctor test) laboratory results, Golder estimates an average waste rock swell factor of 30%
from “in-situ” to loaded into a truck.  IMC has reviewed documented swell
M3-PN140103

160
factors for loosely consolidated materials and selected a 20% swell for both truck calculations and waste storage volumes for this Updated Pre-Feasibility
Study (see Table 16-24) . Waste rock will be stacked in an external WSF early in the mine life and backfilled into the mined-out pit when pit advancement
provides sufficient room for backfilling. External WSF are designed to an overall slope of 3.5H to 1V and the internal backfill (IB) are designed to an overall
slope of 2.5H to 1V.
Mining recovery of the phosphorite was estimated based on an anticipated 7.5 centimetres of mining roof dilution gain and 7.5 cm of floor dilution gain.
These at-grade dilution parameters were used to allow 100% recovery of the phophorite beds and were incorporated into the resource block model.
The mining method for the project will require mine haulage trucks. Excavator/truck mining will require stable haul roads and mine working surfaces for all pit
levels  and  for  all  materials,  including  the  extraction  of  the  phosphorite.  Furthermore,  the  excavator/truck  method  will  require  the  construction  and
maintenance of permanent rock haul roads to the ex-pit WSF, maintenance facility, and ROM stockpile storage area adjacent to the processing plant.

Open Pit Ground Investigation
This  Updated  Pre-Feasibility  Study  relied  on  the  work  completed  by  Golder  for  the  previous  PFS  and  the  discussion  of  that  work  is  included  here  for
completeness. Limited geotechnical characterization has been carried out in the open pit area. Golder reviewed the geotechnical core logging database for
exploration core holes JPQ-14-1 through 20 and JPQ-15-21 through 62. Geotechnical core logging was performed by Focus geologists collecting rock mass
rating (RMR) parameters (Bieniawski, 1989). Rock mass ratings were assigned for each core interval.
Two geotechnical drill holes (JPQ2015-61 and 62) were completed in the OPA from May 11th to 20th, 2015. An additional geotechnical borehole (SPF-GT-
01) was completed in the TSF in September 2015. Table 16-4 lists the borehole location, depth, and orientation. The borehole locations are shown on Figure
16-3. Borehole SPF-G-01 was relatively near the OPA and based on the horizontal continuity of the geologic strata, the geotechnical information from this
borehole was considered relevant for the open pit recommendations.
Drilling was performed using wireline diamond coring methods, collecting HQ core. Standard penetration testing (SPT) was performed to collect blow count
information and collect samples in the split spoon sampler. Additional material was collected from the core samples stored in Piura from the May 2015
drilling program, at the time of the September field program. Sampling of SPF-GT-1 included split spoon samples at typically 5 m spacing and undisturbed
core intervals.

In-situ hydraulic conductivity (Packer) testing was performed over typically 10 m intervals. Table 16-2 lists the results of the packer testing. The hydraulic
conductivity  of  the  Interburden  is  generally  higher  than  the  overburden  and  the  geometric  mean  is  four  times  higher.  This  higher  permeability  in  the
Interburden could be attributed to preferred flow along the capas.
Table 16-5 summarizes the laboratory testing that has been completed. Testing is mostly limited to the Overburden and Clambore units. Only one sample
(which  was  disturbed)  of  the  Interburden  material  has  been  collected  and  tested.  No  testing  or  drilling  information  is  available  for  the  underburden  that
underlies the mineralized zone. All geotechnical testing was performed at Golder’s testing laboratory in Lima, Peru.

Open Pit Geology
The geological sequence defined by the block model and identified in drillholes comprises the following lithological units from top to bottom:
·
Quaternary Alluvium/Aeolian deposits – Present at surface from 0 to 10 m thick.  Unconsolidated sand.  The Quaternary deposits occur at the surface and are
anticipated to be dry.
·
Clambore Sandstone – Present on tablazo above the water table 10 to 20 m thick
·
Overburden  –  Present  on  the  lower  approximate  10  to  20  m  of  the  tablazo  above  the  water  table  and  extending  35  m  bmsl  (below  mean  sea  level).
Overburden is composed of diatomaceous silt.  The beige and gray Overburden are considered to have similar geotechnical properties based on available
data and were combined into the same unit.
·
Interburden and Capas – Present from 35 m bmsl to the base of the mineralized sequence at approximately 75 m to 85 m bmsl. Interbedded phosphorite
seams (capas) occur throughout the sequence.
·
Underburden – Present below the floor of the open pit.  Composed of tuffaceous diatomite with numerous thin beds of tuff
The Clambore Sandstone will have very limited exposure in the open pit. The open pit will be developed almost entirely in the diatomaceous Overburden
and Interburden units below the water table.

Strength Parameters
163
The available geotechnical information from the Bayovar 12 OPA is not sufficient to develop site specific strength parameters for the geotechnical units that
are present. A detailed geotechnical program will be needed to support future feasibility slope design recommendations.
The geologic units that will comprise the majority of the pit walls are the same geologic units that are being successfully mined at the nearby Vale, Bayovar,
Miski Mayo open pit and that were evaluated at a feasibility level at the Fosfatos Bayovar 9 projects. The ground water level at the Miski Mayo mine is near
the ground surface, similar to Bayovar 12. The groundwater level at Bayovar 9 is approximately 50 m below the ground surface.
Comparison of the laboratory index testing from Bayovar 12 collected during the previous Prefeasibility study to the testing from Fosfatos Bayovor 9 deposit
indicate the geotechnical properties are very similar and similar strength parameters may be anticipated.
The Clambore Sandstone is a non-plastic, fine sand to silt and classified as poorly graded sand with silt and a sandy silt. SPTs at shallow depth (5 m) met
refusal indicating the material is cemented.
The  moisture  content,  Atterberg  limits,  and  grain  size  distribution  for  the  samples  from  the  May  and  September  2015  drilling  programs  indicate  the
Overburden and Interburden materials classify as high plasticity clay (CH) or elastic silt (MH). The moisture contents and liquid limits of the Overburden and
Interburden samples are extremely high reflecting the highly porous nature of the diatomaceous materials. The moisture content of the Overburden was
approximately 50% and as much as 83%. The Overburden and Interburden are fine grained with nearly 100% passing the #200 mesh screen. The fines are
65% to 75% silt size particles.
One  triaxial  shear  test  was  completed  from  an  undisturbed  sample  from  borehole  SPF-GT-01.  This  sample  was  taken  from  the  gray  diatomaceous
Overburden unit. The sample was handled and transported to the laboratory to limit sample disturbance. Three tube samples were collected from the HQ
core sample at the laboratory. Consolidated undrained triaxial tests were completed at confining pressures of 320 kPa, 640 kPa, and 1,280 kPa. Triaxial test
results are provided in Golder 2015b and Mohr-Coulomb drained and undrained strength parameters are summarized in Table 16-6.

The triaxial test stress-strain plots show a significant reduction in strength from the peak strength at failure to the residual strength after failure. Table 16-6
includes an estimate of the residual Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters after initial failure.
The Interburden is a pure diatomite and the Overburden and Underburden are a silty (tuffaceous) diatomite. Diatomite is an organogenetic sedimentary rock
which is composed almost entirely of diatom fossils. Diatoms are microscopic single celled plants that grow in marine and fresh water. The diatom skeletons
are  composed  primarily  of  silica.  Diatomite  has  unusual  geotechnical  properties  including  high  porosity,  high  water  content,  and  low  unit  weight.  The
strength of the diatomite is transitional between a very weak rock and hard clay.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016

The strength of a clay is typically related to its prior stress history. The diatomaceous sediments of the Lower Zapallal Formation were likely subjected to a
considerably greater depth of burial and are over-consolidated with respect to their current depth. Past lower ground water levels may have also contributed
to pre-consolidation stress.
Studies carried out elsewhere on the behavior of diatomite indicate that unlike typical clay deposits, the undrained shear strength of diatomite in the pre-yield
state (stress state lower than the yield stress) is independent of the consolidation stress level. When the consolidation stress is higher than the yield stress
the  compressibility  of  the  diatomite  increases  dramatically.  The  microstructure  of  the  diatomite  remains  unchanged  in  the  pre-yield  state  but  changes
significantly in the vicinity of the yield stress. The breakage of diatom particles and the compression of inter-particle pores between the diatom particles in the
post yield state contribute to the high compressibility of the diatomite.
The review of the literature indicates that diatomite does have properties that are distinct from typical clay or silt soils but general estimates of yield stress and
strength of diatomite require site specific testing.
The triaxial test result obtained from borehole SPF-GT-01 is consistent with the behavior of diatomite in which the diatomite has a much higher peak strength
than  would  be  predicted  by  its  stress  history.  However,  when  the  peak  strength  is  exceeded,  the  strength  decreases  to  a  residual  value  and  the
compressibility increases. This compression and reduction of pore space will cause an increase pore pressure and further reduce the shear strength. This
type of soil behavior is capable of producing large scale slope failures if the peak yield strength is exceeded.
Often when designing with soils that have a have a strain weakening behavior, engineers will design using the residual strength. Alternatively, designs may
be  based  on  peak  strength  values  applying  higher  target  factors  of  safety.  Typically,  pit  slopes  are  designed  to  target  factors  of  safety  of  1.3  for  static
conditions and 1.0 for pseudostatic loading. Appropriate target factors of safety when designing with peak strengths must consider the level of confidence in
the  geotechnical  model,  potential  for  local  areas  of  weakness  or  structures,  and  potential  triggering  mechanisms  such  as  high  water  pressures  or
earthquakes.
16.4.4
Stability Analyses
The geologic units that will comprise the majority of the pit walls are the same geologic units that are being successfully mined at the nearby Vale, Bayovar,
Miski Mayo open pit and that were evaluated at a feasibility level at the Fosfatos Bayovar 9 projects. The ground water level at the Miski Mayo mine is near
the ground surface, similar to Bayovar 12. The groundwater level at Bayovar 9 is approximately 50 m below the ground surface.
Assessment of ability to successfully develop stable slopes for the Bayovar 12 project at this prefeasibility level is based in large part on the experience at
these similar nearby properties.
The available geotechnical information from the Bayovar 12 OPA is not sufficient to develop site specific strength parameters for the geotechnical units that
are present. To evaluate the feasibility of development of stable slopes for the Bayovar 12 project based on available information, the geotechnical properties
that were developed for the Bayovar 9 project were applied to the Bayovar 12 design cross sections and water table condition. Overall slope angles of 26°
were analyzed considering the slope recommendations at Bayovar 9 ranged from 26° to 30° and the higher water table condition at Bayovar 12 would imply
flatter slope angles.  Information on the Underburden is lacking and the potential presence of weaker materials below the floor of the pit could influence
stability. The Underburden strength was assumed to have the same strength as the Interburden and Overburden materials.
A generalized geotechnical model was developed that placed the top of the Overburden at an elevation of 0 m amsl.  The Overburden extends to a depth of
35 m (35 m bmsl). The Interburden and capas extend from a depth of 35 m to 75 m to the pit floor. A second generalized model was developed for the pit
slopes that mine back onto the tablazo on the southwest side of the design pit where the overall slope height will be up to 100 m. Materials exposed in the
upper slopes on the tablazo, above the water table, include 10 m thick beige Overburden and 15 m thick Clambore Sandstone. Undrained shear strength
properties were applied to the soil units below the water table in a total stress analysis based
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
165
on the low permeability of the materials and expectation that the rate of mining and backfill will be rapid relative to the recovery of negative pore pressures
developed through unloading. Effective stress parameters were applied above the water table. Peak strength parameters have been applied targeting higher
factors of safety than are typically applied for pit slope design. The parameters applied in the stability models are summarized in Table 16-7.

Factors of safety were computed using Spencer’s method of slices. Stability analyses were carried out for static conditions as well as pseudostatic loading to
simulate earthquake shaking. A pseudostatic coefficient of 0.22 was applied based on one-half of the peak acceleration resulting from an earthquake with a
return period of 475 years (10% probability of exceedance in 50 years) of 0.43g, estimated for the Bayovar 9 site. Stability analysis results are summarized in

Stability analyses applying peak strength parameters developed for similar rock types at a nearby project area resulted in high factors of safety.
Therefore, pending additional site specific geotechnical characterization to support feasibility level design recommendations, overall 26-degree inter-ramp
slopes are recommended. The wall design will be constructed in 10 m benches with bench face angles and catch bench widths varying by the geotechnical
units described in Table 16-9. A summary of these bench face angles by geotechnical unit is provided in Table 16-9 below.

Surface and Groundwater Management
16.4.5.1
Groundwater
166
As discussed in Section 16.2, the hydraulic conductivity of the Overburden and Interburden materials is low and dewatering in advance of mining is not
considered practical. The average seepage flux rate into the pit at its maximum depth was estimated to be of the order of 4.84 mm/day while the average
daily  evaporation  rate  is  4.45  mm/day;  slightly  less  than  the  estimated  seepage  inflows  suggesting  that  some  management  of  seepage  inflows  will  be
necessary. Seepage inflows will be pumped to the TSF.
The pit will extend at its deepest part to approximately 80 m below the phreatic surface. Due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the materials and the rate of
mining and backfilling, it is not anticipated that the pit walls will depressurize significantly, and geotechnical stability modelling for the pit slopes has been
carried out with this assumption.
16.4.5.2
Surface Water
The higher ground surface elevations on the tablazo along the west side of the open pit results in several areas that cannot be diverted and will contribute
run-on to the open pit. The ground surface is essentially flat with the exception of the slope from the tablazo at an elevation of 25 m to the east where the
ground surface is at sea level elevation.  Storm water that falls on the flat surface areas is assumed to be retained in surface depressions and will not
generate runoff. Precipitation that falls on the slope along the west side of the open pit will runoff toward the pit. Diversion channels can convey this runoff
around the north and south ends of the pit area. However there are offsite run-on areas that cannot be diverted and will need to be managed with storm water
that falls directly onto the pit. Storm water diverted around the north side of the pit may be channelled across or under the highway north of the OPA. Storm
water diverted around the south side of the open pit will accumulate in the flat areas southeast of the open pit and west of the tailings due to the lack of
surface gradient to convey surface water offsite. For planning purposes, diversion channels should have 10 m wide bottom width, 2H to 1V side slopes, 2 m
deep, with a minimum 1% gradient. The diversion channels would be unarmored. Channels will require maintenance to remove accumulated windblown
sand prior to storm events and potentially repair following storm events if significant damage occurs.
Where surface water cannot be diverted and offsite runoff does not flow directly into the pit, Crest berms are proposed at the crest of the open pit to prevent
surface water from flowing into the pit. The berms should be constructed as dictated by the phased pit construction. Recommended berm dimensions are to
an elevation of 1 m amsl and will have a nominal 3 m top width and 3H to 1V side slopes. The crest berm costs are assumed to be included in mining costs.
Figure 16-1 indicates aspects of Site-wide surface water management. The design is based on the previous PFS pit which is similar to the Updated PFS pit
with the new design extending farther south. The site water management approach will be very close to the one presented in Figure 16-4.

Open-pit Trafficability
Haul roads will be required within the open pit to achieve the following actions:
·
Removal of waste rock to the waste storage facility
·
Removal of phosphorite to the beneficiation plant
·
Removal of waste rock to the in-pit backfill
·
Removal of waste rock to the tailings embankments
·
The size and specification of the haul roads is dependent on the largest anticipated vehicles required to use the haul roads.
One  California  Bearing  Ratio  (CBR)  test  at  three  degrees  of  compaction  was  completed  on  a  sample  of  Interburden  material  collected  from  bore  hole
JPQ2015-61. Testing was performed at compaction levels of 90%, 95%, and 100% of the maximum standard Proctor density under saturated conditions. The
test results are summarized in Table 16-10 for various degrees of compaction.

Table 16-11 provides typical values of CBR for a range of soil materials. The value obtained from the Interburden suggests the material will provide a poor
road base. However, substantial increase in the CBR can result when fine grained soils are tested in an unsaturated condition. And well compacted dry
diatomaceous Overburden and Interburden soils may achieve CBR values of 10% to 15%. Also, conclusions on trafficability cannot be made based on the
results of one test. Therefore, it is recommended that additional testing be performed on the Overburden, Clambore Sandstone, Quaternary sands and other
potential materials that may provide a more suitable road base. Testing should be performed for saturated and unsaturated conditions.

Based on the information currently available and knowledge of the character of the diatomaceous materials that will provide the subgrade for the haulage
roads and the anticipated seepage inflows that will occur as a result of mining below the water table, trafficability is anticipated to be an issue that could
reduce haulage productivity or result in additional costs for import of suitable road base.
16.4.5.4
Open-pit Monitoring
Monitoring  of  the  excavations  will  be  a  routine  aspect  of  the  operation  and  will  require  a  high  degree  of  visual  inspection  and  monitoring  of  ground
conditions. Monitoring may include the following actions:

Mining Model
16.5.1
ROM Model
The Run Of Mine (ROM) model used for this updated PFS is the same model that Golder used for the previous PFS and the development of the ROM model
is included here. IMC carried out random checks to verify its accuracy. The grid-based surface stratigraphic model used to estimate resources (geological
model) was used as the basis for developing a ROM model for mine planning, design and scheduling. A ROM block model is distinguished from a geological
model in that the ROM model identifies reserves to be mined whereas the geological model describes the in-situ resource. Mining surfaces were created to
account for an anticipated 7.5 cm roof dilution and 7.5 cm floor dilution gain where the phosphorite capas were greater than the minimum mining thickness of
30  cm.  Phosphorite  capas  less  than  30cm  were  excluded  from  the  mine  plan.  The  anticipated  dilution  at  the  roof  and  floor  should  allow  mining  with
essentially no losses based on the accuracy of extracting the phosphorite capas using GPS controlled surface miners. ROM quality surfaces were developed
to account for the mining dilution gains. Dilution samples from the drillhole cores were used to model P2O5 dilution quality surfaces for each modelled capa
using the same methodology used to model in-situ qualities. Due to insufficient dilution density data, the dilution material (interburden) was assumed to have
a dry and wet density of 0.76 and 0.98 g/cm3 respectively.
The effects of dilution result in a reduction of P2O5 quality from in situ to ROM; given a constant roof and floor dilution gain, the overall reduction of P2O5
grade is dependent on capa thickness. The consistency and quality of a blended plant feed will have a significant effect on plant recovery and performance.
It follows therefore that opportunities to increase the overall recovery of phosphorite exist by carefully managing the mining process.
16.5.1.1
Sources of Loss and Dilution
Phosphorite dilution will occur primarily at the seam roof and floor, however this occurs through a range of complex mechanisms. Given that the interburden
material will be stripped using backhoe and subsequently mined using a selective surface miner, allocating loss and dilution to each capa to modify the in
situ resource to a run of mine ore is necessary. Management of interburden stripping and phosphorite mining operating practices to manage loss and dilution
will be important to delivering to the plant a consistent feed. The economics of phosphorite mining depend on the ability to use highly productive equipment
and also to minimize dilution and maximize recovery. This is particularly true since the thickness of the capas varies within the deposit. Therefore,  the
incentive to take advantage of the economies of scale means that a compromise must be reached between rate of progress and the care required to control
the  resulting  ROM  phosphorite  quality.  The  issue  of  losses  and  dilution  with  respect  to  mining  accuracy,  edge  losses  and  effects  of  water  are  further
discussed below.
16.5.1.2
Mining Accuracy
The  estimation  of  mining  recovery  and  dilution  depends  on  the  concept  of  mining  accuracy.  Whenever  an  attempt  is  made  to  separate  materials  at  an
interface, it must be accepted that sometimes the actual separation point will be high, and sometimes it will be low. The resulting cut surface will therefore be
an approximation of the actual interface and will likely be a function of the surface miner which has an accuracy reported by the manufacturer of 7.5 cm.
Based on this understanding, Golder developed a ROM model with a 7.5cm dilution gain at the roof and floor for mine planning purposes. The average
interburden thickness (material overly the phosphorite capa) is 1.5m. To manage roof and floor
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
170
dilution during mining, Golder envision a pre-drilling exercise on a dense grid (50m x 50m) to define the roof and floor surfaces of the phosphorite capas.
These trial data would be used to develop a 3D mining surface representing the roof and floor of each capa which will be delivered to the surface-miner
equipped with GPS to control the surface miner excavation to maintain overall recovery of the phophorite bed. Based on the accuracy of the surface miner
and the pre-established 3D data grid which delineates the location of the capa roof and floor in x-y-z,  IMC believes that 7.5cm roof and floor dilution is
reasonable as the unit operations proposed to strip the interburden is envisioned as follows;
·
Step 1 – strip interburden material (with truck shovel) to an approximate 0.3m height above phosphorite capa
·
Step 2 – finish stripping with surface-miner to the pre-determined 7.5cm above capa roof
·
Step 3 – mine phosphorite capa with the surface-miner calibrated to excavate the capa with the number of passes dependent on mining thickness.
16.5.1.3
Other losses and effects of water
In  areas  where  the  surface  miner  cannot  recover  all  of  the  phosphorite  capa,  front  end  loaders  or  backhoes  could  be  used.  In  addition,  wet  working
conditions may lead to additional levels of loss. However, the amount of such losses will only be determined once mining has started and no accounting for
such losses has been included in the ROM model.
16.5.2
Vulcan Product Model
Golder applied the beneficiation model provided by Gruber in November 2015 to the Vulcan ROM model to simulate the effects of beneficiation and predict
phosphate  concentrate  product  tonnages  and  qualities.  Gruber  based  his  recommendations  on  the  results  from  the  chemical  and  metallurgical  testing
performed  on  the  geological  drillhole  samples  drilled  from  May  to  December  2014  by  Focus.  Golder  relied  upon  the  expertise  of  QP  Glenn  Gruber’s
evaluation of the testing data and did not review the accuracy of the results provided in the metallurgical test database. Gruber provided his evaluation and
recommendations to Golder in a technical report in November 2015. Gruber issued a revised version of this report (Rev B) in November 2015. Golder relied
upon the expertise of Gruber’s beneficiation model reports to estimate the recovered tonnes of concentrated phosphate and product qualities.
16.5.2.1
Beneficiation Model Overview
The  beneficiation  model  developed  by  Gruber  simulates  the  unit  operations  proposed  for  the  full-scale  beneficiation  plant.  A  simplified  diagram  of  this
process has been provided by Gruber and is presented in Figure 16-4 below.
M3-PN140103

Figure 16-5: Beneficiation Process Flow Diagram (after Gruber 2015)
Data from the testwork were used to develop a flowsheet for producing 24% (Product A) and 28% (Product B) DAPR phosphate product since Focus intends
to develop the deposit for the production of direct application fertilizer to take advantage of its high reactivity characteristics and for which it is suitable for use
on acidic soils. To generalise the beneficiation process, Gruber segregated the scrubbing and attrition process schemes by capa based on a capa’s

172
susceptibility through processing to reach the required P2O5 concentrate grade.  Capas were assigned to a Product using the majority process required to
reach an acceptable concentrate P2O5 quality of 24% and or 28%.
Gruber concluded that a 24% P2O5 DAPR product through tertiary desliming at 53µm and a higher grade (28% P2O5 DAPR ) product by coarsening the
tertiary desliming to 105µm to reject lower grade near size material.

PIT AND PHASE DESIGN
The grid-based stratigraphic mining model described in Section 16.5 was converted to a sub-blocked model comprising of 40-m by 40-m by 1.6-m parent
blocks  and  5-m  by  5-m  by  0.2-m  sub-blocks  for  pit  optimisation  purposes.  The  block  model  contained  all  information  needed  to  assign  a  block  value,
including recovered waste rock volumes, ROM tonnages and % P2O5 by capa, and recovered product tonnages and % P2O5 by capa. The block model was
exported to IMC for the development of the updated mine production schedule and Mineral Reserve estimate. The goal of the resource optimisation analysis
was to determine the optimised Resources that will satisfy a 20-year mine production plan. The target annual production rate for the mine plan commences at
760Kt ramping up to 1.0 Mt (dry basis) of processed concentrate for a total of 20.7 Mt of DAPR for the planned life of mine. The optimised resource was
defined as the phosphorite with the best product yield and lowest resultant strip ratio.
Optimisation was conducted on Measured and Indicated Resources only; Inferred Resources were not included in the mine plan. To prevent the optimised
pits from encroaching on the Bayovar road a 180-m offset buffer zone was established from the Bayovar road.
The final pit was sub-divided into 13 mining phases which would be scheduled over the pre-production period and the 20 year mine production schedule.
The pit design parameters presented in Table 16-14 are used in all the pit phase designs.  All phase designs have independent haul roads for the removal of
the mined materials to their destinations: plant, in-pit backfill, ex-pit dumps or the TSF embankment.  The sequence of the phase designs progresses from
south to north across the pit.  This approach has shorter waste hauls for the early years when all the waste is placed in the ex-pit dumps to the south and
west of the pit. The waste tonnage is significantly more than the ore tonnage with the waste to ore ratio being 7.19 / 1 dry tonnes.
The ore, product and waste tonnages are shown in Table 16-15 and the phase sequence is illustrated on Figure 16-6. The mining schedule progresses
through the phases in the order they are numbered, but at any point in time, more than one phase will be mined (with the exception of pre-production and
Year 20).

MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE AND MINING SEQUENCE
177
The mine production schedule targets the production of 760,000 tonnes of combined Products A and B during Year 1 and approximately 1 million tonnes of
combined Products A and B each year for the remaining pit life through Year 20.  The tonnage of product and the split between Products A and B vary, but
between mining and the plant stockpiles there will be sufficient flexibility to maintain the production schedule. The tonnages of product, ROM ore and waste
are all shown in dry tonnes. Table 16-1; the summary of the mine schedule is repeated as Table 16-16 .
For the Updated Pre-Feasibility Study, the pit and phase designs have horizontal 5m high benches in the phosphorite capas and interbeds, even though the
beds dip 1 to 2 degrees to the east – northeast. The tabulation of the tonnages and grades are summarized by capas on the 5m benches for the production
schedule. The mining of the capas and some of the interbeds will be mined with GPS controlled selective surface miners which can closely follow the dip of
the beds. The annual schedule shown in Table 16-17 does not try to target the exact 1 million dry tonnes of product each year, but comes close based on the
percent of a 5m bench that is mined at the end of each mining period and over the 20 year mine schedule produces slightly more product than targeted. For
the Feasibility Study, the mine and plant schedules will be refined to reflect the product production tonnages more closely. For mine development planning,
the short range mining plan and schedule will incorporate the dip of the beds in the daily, weekly and monthly production schedules.  As well, for the short
range plans, the pit phases will be sub-divided with one area mining ore and an adjacent area mining the interburden waste being removed to expose the
next ore capa.
The mine schedule begins in Phase 1 at the south end of the pit during pre-production and the overburden, interburden above Capa 1 and the majority of the
Capa 1 are mined from Phase 1. The 137,189 tonnes of ore are stockpiled at the plant for processing in Year 1. During Year 1, ore is mined from Phase 1
and the overburden stripping and mining in the upper capas is being done in Phase 2. During Year 2, mining is completed in Phase 1 (down to capa 13), the
middle and lower capas are mined in Phase 2 and the overburden stripping has begun in Phase 3. This progression through the mining phases continues for
the remaining years, with three phases being mined in most years. Table 16-17 shows the active mining phases in each year (the term ‘yes’ in the table
indicates that the overburden is being mined in the phase during the particular year). Figures 16-6 through 16-15 illustrate the mining schedule at the end of
pre-production and years -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20.
The production schedule has both Products A and B being produced in each year in varying amounts. The products are related to the capas being mined per
Table 16-17.  In some years, the capas being mined for Product A (24% P2O5) do not produce the target +24% grade based on the test work to date (for
example, Capa 1 produces a 23.85% product and Capa 2 a 22.50%). Blending of the plant products or adjustments to the hydro-sizer in the plant will be
done to achieve the target product grade. Additional test work is planned prior to the Feasibility Study to develop a more detailed grade – recovery curve by
capa.. On a 12 month basis, it is shown in Table 16-18 that this can be achieved, but it may not always happen on a weekly or monthly basis due to mining
locations and the mining sequence through the phases. In these cases, some blending of product will be required at the plant depending on the product
sales and shipping schedules.
An example of a monthly schedule was done for Year 5 and is summarized in Table 16-18. During Year 5, Phases 3, 4 and 5 are being mined, with Phase 3
in the lower capas, Phase 4 in capas 2 through 13 and Phase 5 in overburden stripping for the majority of the year and ore from Capa 1 at the end of the
year. In this example, the ore and waste materials are in BCM’s and the ore and waste rates are uniform each month and the tonnage of product varies
depending on the yields from the various capas.  In reality, the mining rates will be adjusted based on product orders and blending requirements.
In the three phases mined during Year 5, each one is tabulated on 5m benches and a bench is completed for the entire phase before progressing to the next
bench below. During months 1 through 4, the +24% P2O5 specification for Product A is not met because the source for Product A is Capa 2 which has a
22.50% P2O5 product yield. In the later months, Product B does not always meet its 28% specification because its source is Capa 13 during these months
which has
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
178
an average yield of 27.81% P2O5.  It is envisioned that by allowing the ore rate to the plant to fluctuate and adjustments to the yield cut in the plant based on
what Capa is providing the ore, the product specifications can be met in shorter time frames than annually.

Waste Rock Storage Facilities
The mine waste (overburden and interburden) will be stored or used in three areas: in ex-pit dumps to the south and west of the pit, as backfill in the mined-
out pit areas and for the construction of TSF embankment and berms (haulage costs of which are included in mining costs). Controls around the pit for water
runoff during El Niño events are not allocated at this time in the waste placement schedule and would be re-allocated from the ex-pit dumps. All of the waste
is placed outside of the pit through the end of Year 2, at which time mining Phase 1 is completed. Pit backfilling with waste begins during Year 3 with 75m
offset from the active mining areas. The pit backfill is constructed in three phases: lower backfill (up to the -30m elevation), upper backfill (from -30m to pit rim
elevation) with a 50m setback from the crest of the lower backfill and waste stacked within the pit limit above the upper backfill. The volume of all waste
dumps is based on a 20% swell from bcm to in-dump lcm. The design criteria for the various dumps are presented in Table 16-19.
The waste storage schedule is shown on Table 16-20 in bcm with the conversion from dry tonnes to bcm being 1.32 (bcm/dmt) for interburden and 1.10 for
overburden. Once the in pit backfill volume becomes available during Year 3, the majority of the waste is put back into the pit during Years 3 through 11. After
Year 11, all of the waste is placed either in the pit as backfill or within the pit outline as stacked waste above the backfill.

Mine waste will be used to construct the TSF containment embankment in two phases. The Phase 1 TSF embankment will be constructed as part of upfront
capital expenditures from pre-stripping and will require approximately 2.6 million bcm of overburden placed in engineered lifts to 95% compaction. The
Phase 2 embankment is constructed during Years 5 and 6 and will require 3.40 million bcm. The material for the Phase 2 will be delivered to the Phase 2
embankment area late in year 4 and again in early year 6; this smooths the operating truck requirements. The engineered fill will need to be placed at near
optimum moisture contents. Overburden stripped from above the water table will require addition of water to reach optimum moisture and material stripped
from below the water table may need to be spread and dried to reach optimum moisture. The updated PFS tailings design is smaller than the original design
and during a wet year, there may be some release of decant water from the facility. This will be further addressed during the Feasibility Study as the tailings
volumes may adjust with further design enhancements in the plant, notably making use of re-cycled processed water.

MINE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The  equipment  selection  for  the  project  is  dependent  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  annual  material  movement  requirements,  bench  height,  pit
configuration, number of mining faces and the required selectivity of the mining equipment in waste rock and phosphorite. Based on these factors, 1,000 tph
continuous surface miners were selected as the primary loading fleet for phosphorite. These machines are large enough to produce the annual tonnages
required and are able to efficiently load the 90-tonne (110 cubic metre bed) class of trucks selected to transport phosphorite to the plant or ore stockpile.
Overburden stripping and interburden waste will be mined with a 31 cubic metre front end loader with thinner interburden zones mined with the surface
miner. The large FELs are used to efficiently expose phosphate concentrate leaving a temporary face angle of approximately 65˚. Several 405-horsepower
(hp) dozers are used to prepare the working surface and to create access to the work area, and  provide support for the excavators at mining faces. Waste
rock haulage is accomplished with a fleet of 90-tonne capacity end-dump trucks. The 31 m3 FEL can load these 90-tonne trucks with overburden in three
passes and four passes for the inter-burden. The exposed phosphorite is mined with surface miners, and is hauled directly to the plant hopper or to a ROM
stockpile using 90-tonne capacity end-dump trucks. The surface miners can continuously load the trucks.
The  mine  is  scheduled  to  operate  720  twelve-hour  shifts  per  year  using  four  crews.  Table  16-21  illustrates  the  available  operating  minutes  per  shift.
 Availability and utilization factors, as shown in Table 16-22 were applied to calculate number of units required for the major mining equipment.  Table 16-23
is a summary of the major mining equipment utilized in the initial fleet during pre-production and the maximum number of units.
The reference to specific manufacturers’ equipment is to illustrate the size and type of mining equipment and is not intended to be a recommendation by IMC
of a specific manufacturer.

The ore and waste haulage represents the number of units in the mining fleet, 53% of the initial mine equipment capital  and 56% of the life of mine operating
cost, thus attention has been given to minimizing haul distances and maximizing the carrying capacity of each truck.  The truck beds are 110 cubic meter (a
coal bed option) due to the low density of the materials.  Table 16-25 summarizes the hauling capacity of the trucks for each material: ore, interburden and
overburden.  Due to the high moisture content, only the interburden fills the truck in both tonnage capacity and volume capacity.  The ore and overburden fill
the truck to tonnage capacity, but not to volume capacity.

Mine  haul  roads  will  require  upgrading  with  crushed  aggregate  to  support  the  weight  of  the  haul  trucks  given  the  load??  bearing  capacity  of  the  road
surfaces. As such, haul roads were classified in two categories: in-pit haul roads that provide access to the mining faces are required in each mining phase;
and ex-pit haul roads, which provide access from the pit crest to the beneficiation plant, waste rock storage facilities and other surface facilities. Both the in-
pit and ex-pit haul roads were designed at 25 m width, including berms and ditches.
The in-pit haul roads within each mining phase are temporary and those on the leading wall of a mining phase will be mined out by the subsequent mining
phase.  The roads and ramps on the in-pit backfill and the ex-pit dumps are also somewhat temporary, but will require surfacing due to the nature of the
dumped material.  Ex-pit haul roads are permanent throughout the mine life and are extended or shortened incrementally to match the advancing mine
phases.
Pit centroids by mining phase, in-pit backfill centroids, ex-pit WSF centroids, and overfill centroids were approximated for each year using the face and waste
dump advances and the weighted average elevation.  Haul profile routes from the annual pit centroids to the corresponding in-pit backfill, ex-pit WSF, and
overfill centroids were created by increments of uniform road gradients.  A maximum grade of 8 percent was used based upon the truck specifications and
anticipated ground conditions
The haul profile segments of distance, grade and rolling resistance were entered into an excel file and then transferred to a database as input to a haulage
simulation program based on Caterpillar©’s Fleet Production and Cost Analysis (FPC) software.  The simulation results provide the estimate waste rock and
phosphorite haul times and the required truck shifts to move the ore and waste materials from sources to destinations.  Up-hill speeds were regulated by the
rim pull curves, grade of the segment and the rolling resistance assigned to the segment with the maximum speed limited to 56 kph on long flat hauls. Down-
hill maximum speed was restricted to 29 kph on the 8% gradient. The inputs to the simulation runs are shown in Table 16-25 and the truck capacities are
previously shown in Table 16-24.  The

trucks used for the Updated Pre-Feasibility Study are 90 mt trucks with a 110 cubic metre coal bed being loaded with a 31 cubic meter FEL or the surface

The average haul times (not including the fixed times of loading and dumping) by year and material type are shown in Table 16-26.  The haul times vary
depending on the depth in the pit and the distance to the plant or waste destination.  The shorter haul times for Interburden reflect that much of this material is
placed as in-pit backfill, while the longer haul times for Overburden are indicative of placement as both backfill and in the ex-pit dump. Once the backfill
operations for interburden waste begin in Year 3, the waste haul times become fairly uniform.

The surface miner shift requirements for ore and some interburden are based on the shift productivity of 4,894 bcm for ore and 5,108 bcm for interburden.
 The front end loader shift requirements for overburden and interburden are based on the shift productivity of 10,658 bcm in overburden and 12,044 bcm in
interburden.  The truck shift requirements are based on the haulage simulation results.  The balance of the major equipment shift requirements are based on
the number of work areas and type of work for each piece of equipment.  Table 16-27 summarizes the operating shifts by year for each equipment type.

MINE PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS
200
The mine personnel requirements are summarized on Table 16-28 for the supervision, engineering and geology personnel, and Table 16-29 for the hourly
mine operations and maintenance personnel.  The personnel operating the surface miner, the front end loader and the motor graders are assigned based on
the number of units in the fleet, and the balance of the equipment operating personnel are based on the total number of units operating.  Some cross training
of operators is assumed for the truck drivers, dozer operators and service crew.  For the total manpower requirements on the payroll, a 10% VSA allocation to
cover vacations, sick leave and absenteeism is included.  The hourly labor is based on four crews, so only one quarter of the personnel listed on the bottom
of Table 16-29 would be on the property during a particular shift.  The salaried staff would work days only with the exception of the shift supervisors who
would rotate with their assigned crew.

PROCESS (BENEFICIATION) DESCRIPTION
202
203
The Bayovar 12 process plant has been designed to produce two phosphate concentrate products totaling 1 million mtpa, having minimum assays of 24 or
28%  P2O5  DAPR  
in  roughly  equal  proportions.  The  process  plant  is  designed  for  batch  operation  so  that  it  can  easily  switch  from  one  phosphate
concentrate product to the other with a minimum of down-time, according to the product demand and the mine extraction schedule.
The plant feed consists of phosphorite beds (Capas) consisting of phosphate pellets hosted in diatomite. The plant feed consists of 13 separate capas
numbered 1 through 13.  The lowest number capa is the highest in the mine stratigraphy. A testwork program has demonstrated that some of the capas are
more suitable for producing 24% P2O5  DAPR while others are more suitable to produce 28% P2O5 DAPR. The mine plan offers considerable flexibility for
the selective mining and blending of various capas to optimize process plant design with particular reference to P2O5 recoveries and throughput rates for
each of the products. These features, when combined with 85% plant availability, offer the opportunity to optimize the plant design parameters presented
below at feasibility level.
The beneficiation process consists of washing, scrubbing, and three stages of desliming, concentrate dewatering and concentrate drying to a target of four
percent  moisture.  Unit  operations  consist  of  drum  washing,  size  classification,  attrition  scrubbing,  hydraulic  classification  with  hydrocyclones  and  a
hydrosizer, belt filtration and rotary drying. The two DAPR products use identical process unit operations, except that the cut point for the 28% P2O5 DAPR is
higher, eliminating lower grade fines. The beneficiation process will utilize seawater and some recycled process water. The final DAPR products will not
rinsed with fresh water to remove salts so that approximately 6,000 ppm NaCl will remain in the product.
Samples  for  metallurgical  testing  were  collected  by  Focus  Venture’s  geology  team  in  Peru.  Jacobs  Engineering  performed  testwork  described  in  the
following reports to determine the plant’s design parameters.
Belt weigh scales and samplers will be located throughout the plant for metallurgical accounting and product quality control.
Each process plant consists of the following unit operations as shown in Figure 17-1.

GRADE AND RECOVERIES
Applying the test results for each ore layer indicated that the phosphorite recovery for Operating Mode A is 81.5% with a grade of 24.1% P2O5  and  for
Operating Mode B it is 66.4% with a grade of 28.8% P2O5 (Table 17-1).
In operation it is likely that the desliming cut point would be slightly less than 105 um so as to reduce the grade to 28% P2O5 and increase phosphorite
recovery to more than 70%. For example, desliming at 74 um (200 mesh) in Operating Mode B is projected to produce a concentrate containing 27.7% P2O5
at 82% P2O5 recovery.

PROCESS PLANT DESIGN
17.3.1
Design Basis
The plant is designed to produce up to 1,000,000 dry mtpa of combined 24% and 28% P2O5 DAPR concentrate.
The plant equipment is sized for the 28% P2O5 product because it has a lower yield, requiring more feed and producing more tailings.
For both products, the first two desliming steps are performed with hydrocyclones to reject the -53 micron particles. The third desliming step is performed with
a hydrosizer.  For 24% P2O5 product, the hydrosizer cut-point is adjusted to remove the remaining slimes less than 53 microns. When 28% P2O5 product is
produced, the hydrosizer cut-point is adjusted to remove particles less than 105 microns.
Product recovery losses are due to phosphate (P2O5) reporting to slimes during attrition scrubbing and classification. There is an additional 1 percent loss of
phosphate concentrate to dust and shrinkage. The plant operating availability is 85% based on 7,446 operating hours per year.
The plant performance for each type of product is shown in Table 17-2.

Run-of-Mine (ROM) Ore Handling
The ROM handling area is designed to stockpile sufficient phosphorite beds from different capas to accommodate to have sufficient material on hand to
blend a consistent feed to the plant for either DAPR product.
Haul trucks deliver ore from the open pit mine to designated areas on the stockpile. The stockpile has a total storage capacity of 14 days (104,030 dry
tonnes); seven days of storage for 50,644 dry tonnes of ore for 24 percent P2O5 DAPR and seven days of storage for 53,383 dry tonnes of ore for 28 percent
 P2O5 DAPR.  Front end loaders transfer the ore at a rate of 373.5 dry mtph to the Feed Bin at the head of the Plant. The feed travels from the Feed Bin via a
belt feeder to the Drum Washer Feed Conveyor that delivers the ore to the Drum Washer.
The ROM handling area consists of stockpile, feed bin, belt feeder, belt conveyor, and assorted chutes.
The ROM metallurgical sampler, located across the Drum Washer Feed Conveyor, samples wet, salt-bearing feed material entering the plant. A belt scale
will determine the weight of the ore entering the plant and a self-cleaning magnet will remove tramp iron before it enters the Drum Washer.

Drum Washing, Scalping, and Cyclone Classification
211
The phosphorite feed discharges from the Drum Washer Feed Conveyor into the Drum Washer (Figure 17-4), where it is mixed with a proportional amount of
process water to form a slurry with a density of 25% solids. The drum washing equipment is designed to disaggregate the unconsolidated phosphate pellets
from the diatomite/clay gangue and water soluble salts by tumbling and washing action. Testwork shows that the optimum drum washer retention time is 3
minutes.
The drum washer slurry discharges onto a scalping screen with 18 mm screen openings. The screen oversize is estimated to be approximately 1% of the
drum  washer  solids  and  consists  of  low  phosphate  grade  chunks  of  diatomite  with  an  average  phosphate  grade  of  8%  P2O5 . The  scalping  screen  is
equipped with wash sprays that keep the material moving across the screen deck. The oversize material is rejected and conveyed to a bunker where it is
periodically loaded from the bunker onto trucks and disposed of at the Waste Rock Storage Facility. The screen undersize material and water pass through
the screen into the Drum Discharge Washer Sump.
The washed phosphate pellets and slimes pass through the scalping screen and collect in a sump that is then pumped to the primary cyclone cluster, where
slimes are separated as cyclone overflow from phosphate concentrate in the cyclone underflow. Water is added at the sump to dilute the slurry to a density of
20% solids. A primary cyclone feed pump sends the slurry from the drum washer discharge sump to the primary cyclone cluster. The metallurgical shift
sampler is located ahead of the primary cyclone cluster. It collects a slurry sample that represents what the scrubbing process will “see”. Most of the soluble
salt is removed in the drum washing phase and the “clots” of diatomite from interburden will be removed by the scalping screen, both ahead of the sampler.
The primary cyclones are set to separate at 53 microns (-270 mesh). The cyclone overflow stream flows by gravity to the tailing tank from where it is pumped
to the Tailings Storage Facility.
The cyclone underflow, with a slurry density of 50% to 55% solids, is the product stream. This stream flows to the primary attrition scrubbers for further
disaggregating and concentrating.

17.3.4
Primary Attrition Scrubbing
The primary attrition scrubbers (Figure 17-5) are arranged in pairs of intense scrubbing machines that disaggregate the low grade phosphate concentrate
from more diatomite and clay gangue material. The attrition scrubbers operate at a high slurry density of 50% - 55% solids. Testwork showed that a retention
time of 12 minutes was required.
In  this  circuit,  the  primary  attrition  scrubbers  are  arranged  into  two  parallel  rows  of  six  5-cubic  meter  attrition  cells,  each.  Each  bank  of  primary  attrition
scrubbers discharges into an attrition screen feed tank, which then is pumped to an attrition screen. The attrition screens remove phosphate pellets that are
larger than 600 micron (28 mesh) for additional scrubbing via the secondary attrition scrubbers. The attrition screen underflow is directed to the secondary
cyclone feed tank.

17.3.5
Secondary Attrition Scrubbing, Size Classification, Cyclone Classification, and Hydraulic Sizing
The secondary attrition scrubbers, shown on Figure 17-5 are required to beneficiate the +600 micron phosphate pellets via intense scrubbing. Testwork
indicates that the retention time in secondary attrition scrubbing is also 12 minutes at a slurry density of 50 - 55 percent solids. The current arrangement is to
have two parallel banks of four 2.1-cubic meter attrition cells, each.
The secondary attrition scrubbers discharge to the secondary cyclone feed tank where it is combined with the undersize from attrition screens, where both
streams are diluted to 20% solids. The secondary cyclone feed pump pumps the slurry to the Secondary Cyclone cluster where the cut size of 53 microns
separates slimes from phosphate pellets.  The slimes report to the tailings tank while the underflow from the secondary cyclones reports to the hydrosizer for
further classification at a slurry density of 55% solids.
The hydrosizer in the redesigned plant will consist of two 3.1-m x 3.1-m cones that will handle a flow of 239 mtph of phosphate concentrate and additional
“teeter” water. The hydrosizer utilizes an upward flow of water to fluidize light-density particles into an overflow stream and allow the coarser, denser particles
to settle in the underflow stream. For 24% P2O5 DAPR, the overflow stream will normally contain particles sizes of -53 microns (-270 mesh). For 28% P2O5
DAPR overflow stream normally contains -106 microns particles (-150 mesh). The hydrosizer overflow will gravity flow to the tailing tank from where it will be
pumped to the TSF. The hydrosizer underflow is the final washed product stream at a slurry density of 65% to 70% solids. This stream of approximately 212
mtph of product will flow by gravity to the concentrate belt filter. A metallurgical sample will be taken between the hydrosizer underflow and the belt filter.
17.3.6
Belt Filtering
The hydrosizer underflow discharges into the distribution box above the concentrate belt vacuum filter. An auger inside the distributer box spreads a uniform
thickness of slurry across the width of the belt filter. The belt vacuum filter dewaters the phosphate concentrate and returns the filtrate solution to the process
solution as make-up water at the secondary cyclone feed tank. The filter cake drops from the belt filter onto a bucket elevator that loads the concentrate dryer
feed bin.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
214
The belt vacuum filter reduces the concentrate moisture from 35 percent to 15 percent. The tests indicated that rinsing the filter cake with seawater water
does not reduce the cadmium content, therefore the filter was sized for dewatering without a rinsing. The Metsim simulation calculated the remaining salt
content at 0.6 percent in both the 24% the 28% P2O5 DAPR final products.
Figure 17-6: General Arrangement for Concentrate Belt Vacuum Filter
17.3.7
Concentrate Drying and Product Storage
The dewatered filter cake is stored in the concentrate dryer feed bin. A screw feeder meters the filtered cake into the rotary concentrate dryer at a rate of 160
mtph at 15% moisture.
The dryer heats the concentrate from 25° C to 120° C. The target product moisture is 4%. The dryer fuel is liquefied natural gas (LNG). A blower supplies air
to the burner, which supplies approximately 80 million BTU/h. The rotary dryer has replaced the fluid bed dryer that was quoted in the original PFS because
fluid bed dryers start having problems with fines below 100 microns. The rotary dryer in the current design is 4-m diameter by 32-m long.  It is a tire driven unit
powered by a 200 HP motor. The off-gas handling includes a combustion chamber, an off-gas cyclone and a baghouse dust collector. The baghouse dust is
collected and returned as product to the system. LNG fuel for drying accounts approximately 40% of the plant operating cost. This study accounts for LNG
being delivered daily by truck.
The dry phosphate concentrate discharges from the rotary dryer to a discharge conveyor and onto a bucket elevator that lifts the concentrate to the top of four
product silos. The phosphate concentrate is routed to individual silos via a pair of diverter gates and tubular drag conveyors. Each product silo has a 7-hour
retention time and a volume of approximately 438 cubic meters of storage. Each silo is fitted with a bin vent and an unloading spout.
After storage the final product is loaded into haul trucks, delivered to the port facility and loaded onto ships for market. The port facility is owned and operated
by a Juan Paulo Quay (JPQ,) a third party and part Owner of the Bayovar 12 concession.
17.3.8
Metallurgical Sampling and Product Control
Grade  control  is  essential  to  the  success  of  the  Bayovar  12  plant.  The  current  plant  flowsheet  uses  a  belt  crosscut  sampler  on  the  drum  washer  feed
conveyor  to  determine  the  head  grade,  and  metallurgical  slurry  samplers  ahead  of  the  primary  cyclones  for  process  control,  on  the  discharge  of  the
hydrosizer ahead of the belt filter to measure the
M3-PN140103

215
product grades and on tailings stream to determine recovery and losses. Shift samples will be assayed at the onsite laboratory. Future need for an onstream
analyzer will be evaluated once the plant is up and running.
The single process line will produce two products in a batch operation of the plant. Switching from 28% P2O5 DAPR to 24% P2O5 DAPR will not be a
problem since the grade of the initial 24% product after the switchover will have a slightly higher grade due to the remaining 28% product in the dryer.
Switching from 24% to 28% product will require extra care since plant will not want to dilute the 28% product with 24% product. The residence time in the 32-
m long concentrate dryer will be approximately 20 minutes.
17.3.9
Tailings Storage Facility
Overflow from the primary and secondary clusters and the hydrosizer are collected in a tank and pumped directly to the TSF. Due to the very slow settling
rate, it is impractical to reclaim water in a thickener. The tailing slurry contains approximately 11 percent solids.
The TSF consists of a tailing tank, 800 HP slurry pumps, an 8.6 km 20” pipeline, and tailings storage impoundments.
17.3.10
Water Systems
The Bayovar 12 plant site uses 1,591 cubic meters per hour of seawater to beneficiating the ore. Seawater Pumps deliver water via a pipeline from the Port
of  Bayovar  to  a  seawater  pond  located  at  the  Bayovar  mine  site.  The  seawater  pond  is  large  enough  to  accommodate  24  hours  of  water  for  the  plant
operation and maintain a reserve for the firewater system. Seawater is used at the scalping and attrition screens, cyclone feed tanks, hydrosizer and for
cleaning the concentrate filter cloth.
A small seawater desalination plant produces desalinated water for potable use at the plant, offices and ancillary facilities. The desalination plant uses a
reverse osmosis unit that is capable of producing 2.9 m3/h of desalinized water.
Four 250 HP, horizontal centrifugal pumps deliver the seawater via a 32” HDPE pipeline. The Seawater Pond measures of 75 m by 100 m and a depth of 9.8
m.  The  seawater  pond,  the  seawater  pond  pumps,  firewater  system,  desalination  plant  and  desalinized  water  tank,  potable  water  plant  and  tank  and
associated equipment are located at the Bayovar 12 plant site.
The current plant design recycles overflow from the secondary cyclones in order to decrease the make-up water demand and increase the tailings slurry
density, which in turn reduces the volume of tailings storage required.  Recycled water is piped to the drum washer, scalping screen spray and primary
cyclone feed tank.
It is not currently possible to reclaim water with a tailing thickener because the settling rate is too slow to be practical. The tailings stream removes most of
the phosphorite feed’s original salt content to the TSF, where the tailings eventually reach saturation and salt precipitates. Recovering water from the tailings
pond is not practical due to slow settling solids and salt saturation of supernatant water in the TSF. Consequently, with the exception of some recycled water
from the secondary cyclone overflow, the plant uses the seawater once and disposes of it in the TSF.
17.3.11
Capital Equipment for Plant and Infrastructure
The Bayovar 12 plant consists of two planned process lines, each having a capacity of producing 1,000,000 tonnes per year of DAPR concentrate. Each
process line has identical equipment from the ROM feed section (Areas 100 & 105) to the concentrate drying loadout section (Areas 550 & 555). The tailings
lines from the two process lines come together in a large pump box prior to pumping to the TSF.
Table 17-5 is a summary of the major equipment required for the two process lines. This list includes all of the significant process equipment as well as the
major equipment components that support the plant infrastructure. Costs

for the equipment mainly reflect budgetary pricing that was provided by reputable manufacturers for the Bayovar 12 project.  These costs were used to build
up the capital cost estimate described in Section 21.

PLANT RAW MATERIALS
17.4.1
Ore
The plant will produce 1,000,000 mtpy of DAPR with a grade of either 24 percent or 28 percent P2O5. The product grade will be selected based on the
availability of mined ore or market conditions. Both grades will be produced by using different blends of ore and by using the same equipment at different
operating conditions. A stockpile will hold 14 days of feed material.
For 1,000,000 mtpy of 24 percent P2O5 DAPR 2,640,740 mtpy of dry ore will be processed having a grade of 11.43 percent P2O5, 6.37 percent water soluble
salts (WSS) and 30 percent moisture.
For 1,000,000 mtpy of 28 percent P2O5 DAPR 2,783,733 mtpy of dry ore will be processed having a grade of 14.26 percent P2O5, 3.86 percent water soluble
salts (WSS) and 30 percent moisture.
17.4.2
Water
The plant will require 1,591 cubic meters per hour of seawater. It will be stored in a pond with 24 hours of retention time. A desalination plant on site will
produce 2.9 cubic meters per hour of desalinated water for the laboratory and employees’ personal use.
Recycling secondary cyclone overflow to the drum washer instead of sending it to the tailing pond lowers the required seawater by 400 cubic meters per
hour.
It is not practical to reclaim tailing water with a thickener due to the low settling rate of the very light fine particles. The soluble salt is dissolved and pumped
with the tailings to the TSF preventing the process water from becoming saturated with salt.
17.4.3
Electrical
Electric power is delivered from a nearby 138 kV transmission line to a substation on site.
17.4.4
Fuel for Dryer
Diesel fuel and gasoline arrives on site by truck. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the dryer arrives on site by truck.
17.4.5
Air
A plant air compressor will deliver 400 ACFM at 125 psi of plant air and instrument air for the plant.

PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
220
The infrastructure for the Bayovar 12 Project includes site access and concentrate haulage roads, a port facility for shipping concentrate overseas, power
supply and a new power transmission line, a seawater pipeline for process water supply, ancillary building facilities, a reverse osmosis water treatment plant
to deliver desalinated and potable water for human consumption, fire protection and sanitary septic facilities, site communications, and the Tailings Storage
Facility (TSF).
Several of these project components are described in more detail in other sections of this report, and only a general description of the relevant aspects of the
project infrastructure-related components is given here.
18.1
TRANSPORTATION
18.1.1
Site Access and Site Roads
The Bayovar 12 mining concession is crossed by the Pan American Highway on its eastern side (Figure 18-1) which connects the city of Piura to the north
with Chiclayo to the south. The Chiclayo-Bayovar Highway is a two-lane paved road that connects to the Pan American Highway to the Port of Bayovar to
the west and this road runs diagonally across the concession. Access to the Bayovar 12 plant is from the Chiclayo-Bayovar Highway, which is located
approximately 17 km west of the Pan American Highway. Administration facilities are located 100 meters south of the Chiclayo-Bayovar Highway.
Figure 18-1: Overall Site Plan
Transportation to and around the site will be unpaved roads developed to accommodate the demands of the project.  The soft overburden lends itself to low
cost road building with graders, dozers, and scrapers without any need for blasting or supporting MSE walls. Culverts will need to be installed where washes
cross the roads.

Concentrate Haulage
The proposed plan for the Bayovar 12 mine is to haul concentrate to the Port of Bayovar along the Chiclayo-Bayovar road over a distance of 45 km to the port
facility owned by JPQ shareholders. Currently, JPQ hauls gypsum from the
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
221
Bayovar  12  concession  using  trucks  to  its  port  for  shipment  to  plants  in  Ecuador.  JPQ  currently  produces  80,000  tonnes  of  gypsum  per  year  from  the
concession.
A dedicated contract concentrate hauler has estimated the haulage rate of $5.09 per tonne. The trucks that will be 35-tonne end-dumping trailers. The round-
trip to the Port of Bayovar including loading, transporting, unloading, returning, and driver breaks is estimated to require 3 hours, based on an over-the-road
speed of 45 km/hr.. For 1 million tonnes of concentrate per year, 28,575 round-trips will be required annually which translates to 78 truckloads per day, based
on a 365-day year. Currently, FCV has established that concentrate hauling will be conducted during during daylight hours on a12-hour day shift basis, only.
For this reason, 100 percent truck availability, since truck maintenance will be handled on the off-shift. At this rate, FCV will need to ship 6.5 truckloads of
phosphate concentrate per hour which extends to approximately 20 trucks running.
18.2
PORT FACILITIES
The project is planning to use the port facilities owned by its partner, JPQ, located in the Port of Bayovar (Figure 18-2). The facility is a medium depth port
that handles small Handysize ships that have a capacity of 20,000 long tons deadweight (DWT) – 28,000 DWT and Handysize ships, with a capacity of
28,000 – 40,000 DWT. The port has been actively shipping gypsum from open stockpiles.
Figure 18-2: Port Image
JPQ solicited an engineering report from Consultora e Inmobilaria Volcan (CIVSA) of Arequipa, Perú for improvements to JPQ’s port facility so that it could
handle  DAPR  phosphate  concentrates  delivered  from  the  Bayovar  12  mine.  The  improved  port  facility  would  include  a  scale  house,  a  45,000-tonne
warehouse for keeping phosphate concentrates dry and protected from the wind, a feed bin, a loading conveyor, a ship loader, a truck wash for exiting
concentrate trucks,

ancillary buildings, and sanitary sewer facilities (Figure 18-3). The concept for the port is that a 35-tonne truck passes the security control gate, is weighed on
the incoming scale and dumps into the warehouse. Upon exiting the port, the empty truck is weighed on the outgoing scale to record the weight of the load
delivered. A front end loader scoops phosphate concentrate into a 15-tonne capacity dump truck which transfers the material to the feed bin. The loading
conveyor has a capacity of 500 tonnes per hour.
Figure 18-3: Port Facilities Flow Diagram
Figure 18-4 is a conceptual general arrangement prepared by CIVSA for the study. CIVSA’s design can handle reception of 210 tonnes per hour equaling 6
trucks per hour. The warehouse will be a covered facility that is equipped with dust collection. The feed bin will be housed at the base of a small building into
which the 15-tonne trucks will dump the concentrate. The feed belt conveyor to the ship loader will be covered to eliminate phosphate dust from falling into
the harbor. The feed belt conveyor will dump onto the ship loader belt that will load the Handy size ships. The ship will have to be moved manually to spread
the load in the ship’s hold, as the ship loader stinger, or loading spout has a fixed position.

Port power distribution will tap into an existing 22.9 kV power line and transform to low voltages for operations.
The port improvement execution schedule is estimated to take 12 months of construction, the cost will be borne by JPQ and recovered through port usage
costs.
18.3
POWER TRANSMISSION LINE AND SITE POWER
Utility power is available from a 220 kV power transmission line which runs parallel to the route of the Pan American Highway. To supply power to the
Bayovar 12 plant, a 138 kV 16-kilometer power transmission line from the La Niña substation to the Bayovar 12 main substation will need to be constructed
(Figure 18-1). Power would be stepped down at the plant site to the distribution voltage of 13.8 kV.
The  Bayovar  12  power  transmission  line  route  will  parallel  the  transmission  line  that  supplies  power  to  Vale’s  Bayovar  mine  (Figure  18-5),  skirting  the
southern edge of the El Niño floodway embankment and then crossing the Bayovar-Chiclayo highway to the plant.

Figure 18-5: Existing Power Transmission Line to Vale’s Bayovar Mine
An opportunity exists for FCV to share a 138 kV power transmission line needed to serve the FOSPAC plant. FCV has had preliminary discussions with
FOSPAC who are amenable to sharing costs for infrastructure. The power line would run along the same route as the proposed Bayovar 12 power line. In
this case, FCV would tap the FOSPAC 138 kV line at a disconnect switch, and install a 700 meter transmission line to the Bayovar 12 substation. The
savings from sharing the power transmission line with FOSPAC would be on the order of $2 million in initial capital.
18.4
SEAWATER SUPPLY PIPELINE
The  Bayovar  12  process  plant  operates  on  seawater  that  will  be  pumped  at  a  flow  rate  of  1,591  m3/h.  The  delivery  point  for  the  seawater  is  the  plant
seawater pond from which process water will be pumped to the various unit processes. A small stream from the seawater pond is taken to a reverse osmosis
(RO) desalination plant, whose brine product will be discharged back into the seawater ponds. Filtrate from the vacuum belt filter will also be discharged to
the seawater ponds. There are no plans at this time to reclaim supernatant water from the TSF.
The seawater inlets will be located along the ship loading wharf at JPQ’s facility in the Port of Bayovar. The seawater intakes will be omni directional heads
fitted to the upstream end of the intake system pipeline located some distance into the sea from the shoreline. Entrance velocity is expected to be lower than
0.091 m/s. Eddies through the intake are eliminated thus head loss at the seawater intake is reduced to a negligible level – < 0.2 millimeters.
The seawater intakes will be piped to a bank of four, 250 HP, corrosion resistant horizontal centrifugal pumps that will be mounted on shore at a pump station
at the port loadout. The seawater intakes will be mounted from a platform from which piping will run to the pump station. Intake pipes will be coupled to a
header that that is downstream of the pump station.

Figure 18-6: Seawater Intake
The overland route for the seawater supply pipeline will follow the Bayovar-Chiclayo highway along the south side of the road. The route, which is 45
kilometers long, is relatively flat (Figure 18-7) reaching a maximum elevation of 62 meters amsl. The triangle indicates the location of the proposed plant site
on the tablazo at an elevation of 32 meters amsl.
Figure 18-7: Elevation Profile of the Proposed Seawater Supply Pipeline to Bayovar 12 Plant

The seawater supply pipeline will consist of 32-inch HDPE pipe using the appropriate pressure ratings (SDR 11, 13.5 and SDR 17) that correspond to
elevations. The pipeline will be laid in a trenchand covered. The design will include expansion capacity and air vacuum release valves to prevent pipeline
collapse.
FCV is investigating using TUBI technology, self-contained, mobile pipe extrusion station to fabricate HDPE pipe onsite or along the pipeline route as it is
laid.  A  TUBI  system  can  produce  lengths  of  pipe  up  to  1000  feet  that  are  longer  than  commercially  available  40  and  50-foot  lengths.  Benefits  of  TUBI
technology include: reducing freight, reducing the number of field welds which leads to reduced handling steps and installation time, and includes 100% X-
ray quality control technology.
The seawater supply pipeline will initially discharge into the Seawater Pond which measures 100-m long by 75-m wide by 9.8-m deep. The pond will be
designed with a partition so that maintainance and cleaning can be performed on on side of the Seawater Pond while the other side is operationg.

Fire protection will be achieved with a skid mounted, dual pump fire water system. The pumps, one electric and one diesel (back-up pump) are sized to
deliver 227 m3/h (1,000 gpm) for 120 minutes. The firewater pumps will draw directly from the seawater ponds. A buried firewater loop serving process
facilities, mine facilities, and ancillary facilities will provide water to hydrants at a spacing of approximately 100 meters.
Two septic sewer facilities have been designed for the plant site.  Each will consist of a septic tank and a leach field. The larger system (3,000 gal tank) will
serve the Administrative Facilities. The second (1,000 gal tank) will serve the Mine Facilities and the plant control room.
18.8
SITE COMMUNICATIONS
Site  telephone  and  internet  services  will  be  provided  by  local  providers.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  Bayovar  12  site  will  use  physical  cable  for
telecommunications,  and  for  internet  communications.  The  hub  for  site  communications  will  reside  in  the  Administration  Building  with  fiber  optic
communications to the plant facilities.
The  mine  radio  system  will  include  one  base  station  and  a  control-tower  station  at  the  mine  from  which  all  mining  equipment  and  haul  trucks  will  be
dispatched and controlled, and a number of repeater stations will be installed. One station will provide coverage to the tailing area, and others are required to
extend coverage throughout the mine site and to the Port of Bayovar.
Telephone and data communications including voice, data and internet communications will be provided for the mine site and the Port of Bayovar. The
communications system will connect to a central communications center, which will include a telephone/fax PBX and network servers for email, internet and
data services. Other network servers to manage site operations and for data storage will also be located in the central communications center, with the
exception of the process servers which will be located at the processing facility. The mine site telephone system will link all essential areas of the site
together, and through the satellite system, to outside of the project site.
All vehicles will be equipped with radios and essential personnel will have hand-held radios. Key personnel will also be equipped with mobile telephones.
Cellular phones will have coverage to the Port of Bayovar as a safety precaution.
18.9
TAILINGS DISPOSAL
The Bayovar 12 TSF will consist of approximately 9.8 Mm2 of available storage area as shown in Figure 18-18. The TSF is designed so that tailings can be
impounded to a maximum height of 6.0 m, with spillway discharge and 1.0 meter freeboard.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
237
Figure 18-18: Tailing Storage Facility
The containment embankment cross section (refer to Figure 18-19) consists of the open pit waste spread and compacted with 5:1 (H: V) side slopes, and a
20.0-meter wide crest, and a geotextile lined downstream face for erosion control. The TSF is expected to have the capacity for 58.8 million cubic meters of
tailings, an average loading rate of approximately 2.5 million cubic meters per year (Mm3/yr), and an operating life of 20 years.
Figure 18-19: Tailing Embankment Cross Section
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
238
The TSF is located partially in the floodway of a potential El Niño extreme event so the dam for the TSF will be constructed to the planned height shown on
the drawings.
Operational criteria applied as a basis for the TSF layout and sizing included a tailing delivery rate of 2.5 Mm3/yr for a total projected tailing production
volume of 49.8 Mm3. The tailings are delivered in a slurry with 11% solids. The containment accounts for natural passive evaporation.
A Stage 1 TSF with a surface area of 5.0 million square meters (Mm2) is designed for containment and evaporation of six years of production. The Stage 2
TSF adds 4.8 Mm2 of surface area for subsequent year’s production.
The dam foundation design will be supported on cohesive silts and clays. The groundwater level was recorded at 5 m below the ground surface,
Tailings Water Management System
The proposed surface water management system is that the runoff generated in the upstream catchment area discharges into the TSF.  Considering the
large evaporation rate and the large extent of the TSF, it is expected that this runoff can be  evaporated to the environment.
During an El Niño event, the runoff generated can be discharged into the TSF.  In this case, a spillway across the crest of the north dike is proposed to
control overflows during extreme events.
18.10
SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT
The climate in the Sechura desert in the Bayovar 12 area is dry and windy. Surface water diversions will be necessary for occasional rains and during El
Niño years.  Most surface water will report to the open pit where it will be channeled to collection sumps from where it will be pumped to the seawater or
tailings ponds.
Diversion ditches and associated culvert systems, as well as ponds, sumps and pipelines, will be designed to address the majority of surface water flow at
the project site. Water diversions will also be needed along the length of the south side of the Bayovar Chiclayo highway to protect the berms of the TSF from
erosion to prevent breaching of the slimes in the impoundment

MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS
19.1
OVERVIEW
The  Bayovar  12  project,  located  within  the  Sechura  basin  in  northern  Peru,  hosts  a  major  deposit  of  what  is  arguably  the  most  reactive  sedimentary
phosphate rock fertilizer in the world (Reactive Phosphate Rock or “RPR”). This project’s relatively simple mine plan and flow sheet will produce a natural
phosphate  fertilizer  that  is  suitable  for  use  as  direct  application  phosphate  rock  (DAPR)  that  can  be  applied  directly  to  many  soils  without  the  need  for
conventional acid pre-treatment of the rock or the addition of other manufactured chemical compounds. DAPR is most effective when used on acid soils such
as those which form the bulk of tropical South American soils1. Agronomic research has demonstrated that Sechura RPR, due to its high reactivity, can
outperform more expensive and non-organic single- and triple-superphosphate fertilizers when used in tropical soil and climatic conditions (e.g.Bolland and
Gilkes, 19812).
The deposit is located near tidewater in an established phosphate mining district in Northern Peru on the doorstep of a large and growing market for fertilizer
products. The region is witnessing a rapid expansion of farming particularly for oil palms -an increasingly important cash crop - and organically cultivated
food products. The favorable dissolution kinetics of DAPR  have already made it the preferred fertilizer for oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia and
it is also a natural fit for  plantations of the region where it is located.
The project will produce a highly sought-after, organic DAPR fertilizer. This product will service the growing oil palm market in the Americas, especially the
organic palm oil plantations of Colombia and Ecuador, including the local Peruvian market where phosphate nutrient needs are currently met entirely by
imports. In addition, by achieving organic certification of its products, Focus aims to become the supplier of choice of natural phosphate fertilizer for organic
producers throughout the Americas where 18% of the world's organic farmland is located.
19.2
INTRODUCTION
This preliminary market analysis is based on:
1.
Marketing reports commissioned during 2015 by Focus Ventures;
2.
Internal research into recent sales prices achieved for DAPR in the Americas;
3.
A short study commissioned by Focus on making blended fertilizer products using Bayovar RPR, and;
4.
An internal report on the Peruvian fertilizer market based on Peruvian government statistics.
Concentrate production will be phased in over three years with initial production of 300k tpa in year 1, rising to 1,000k tpa by year 4 for a mine life of 20
years. 249 M tonnes of Measured and Indicated Resources remain for extraction after the initial 20 year mine life.
The process plant has been designed to produce two natural phosphate rock fertilizer products: a 24% P2O5 RPR for use as an organic DAPR and a higher
grade + 28% P2O5 product suitable for blending with other natural nutrients to make customized multi-nutrient organic fertilizers.

The  project  is  located  close  to  the  tropical  regions  of  western  Central  and  South  America,  on  the  doorstep  of  a  large  and  growing  market  for  fertilizer
products. It is anticipated from the results of published research studies that both of these products will be able to outperform the highly-soluble manufactured
chemical fertilizers in the acid soils of the targeted markets.

KEY MARKETS
19.3.1
Oil Palms
Palm oil recently displaced soya as the most consumed edible oil worldwide. In 2014 over 50 million tonnes of palm oil were produced. The growth in palm
oil production has been rapid because it is a high-yield, low-cost crop which produces over 5 times as much oil per hectare as other oleaginous species. The
oil also has a greater variety of uses than competing crops and is used in the production of soaps, cosmetics, ice cream, chocolate bars etc.
Oil palms only grow in tropical regions and thrive on acidic soils which are typically low in nutrients and require significant fertilizer use3. In an extensive
study  by  Ng et al  (2013)  of  Indonesian  and  Malaysian  plantations  -where  the  majority  of  the  world's  oil  palm  plantations  are  located  the  application  of
Bayovar  DAPR  optimized  palm  nutrition  and  oil  yields.  In  Southeast  Asia  it  remains  the  preferred  oil  palm  plantation  fertilizer  and  commands  premium
pricing. Depending on plant maturity and soil characteristics optimum annual application rates of natural phosphate rock concentrate range from 300 kg to 1
tonne per hectare.
A  rapid  expansion  is  underway  in  the  Latin  American  oil  palm  sector.  For  example,  in  1999  there  were  roughly  150,000  hectares  under  cultivation  in
Colombia which had grown to 477,000 by 20134. The Colombian government is targeting continued expansion to 3-million hectares of plantations by the
year 2020 – a + 6 -fold increase over 2013 levels.
In Ecuador, oil palm cultivation has grown by 7% per year for the past 10 years with over 250,000 hectares in production by 2012. In Peru, oil palms were first
planted at Tochache in the Department of San Martin in the Peruvian Amazon in 1973. By the year 2000, nearly 15,000 hectares were planted with oil palm5.
By 2012, the area under cultivation had

grown  to  just  under  60,000  hectares.  Today,  another  100,000  to  200,000  hectares  of  plantations  are  proposed  or  planned  for  the  region  of  Loreto  in
northeastern Peru.

Organic Farms
Much of the expansion in oil palm cultivation in Central and South America focused on the production of organic palm oil. This will be an important part of
Focus’ long term marketing strategy.
Phosphate rock from Bayovar is a natural mineral product. This study contemplates that it will be mined and processed without the addition of, or reaction
with, any other chemical compounds which will allow Focus to obtain organic certification for its products.
Organic farming represents an increasingly large share of the world’s agricultural industry. Since 1990 the market for organic food and other products has
grown rapidly, reaching $72 billion worldwide at the end of 20137. The area of organically managed farmland globally grew at a compound rate of 8.9% per
annum between 2001-2011. As of 2013, approximately 43 million hectares worldwide were farmed organically. Consumer demand for organically produced
goods has grown by double digits during most years since the 1990s, providing market incentives for U.S. farmers

across a broad range of products, and now represents between 4-5% of U.S. food sales: close to a US$30 billion8  market. Eighteen percent of the world’s
organic farmland is in Latin America9.
Focus  plans  to  produce  large  quantities  of  product  with  a  consistent  and  predictable  chemical  composition  and  P2O5  percentage,  which  demonstrates
highly-soluble chemical behavior in acidic soils. It is one of only a few sources of natural phosphate nutrient available for large scale organic farms and
plantations. Numerous papers that have highlighted the excellent agronomic effectiveness of phosphate rock from the Sechura district are listed on the
following link; http://www.focusventuresltd.com/i/pdf/Sechura_RPR_References.pdf
Focus  will  be  seeking  organic  certification  of  its  products  as  soon  as  possible  after  production  has  commenced,  and  will  be  targeting  west  coast  Latin
American and North American organic producers.

PERUVIAN FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION
The  fertilizer  market  in  Peru  is  relatively  immature;  only  a  small  percentage  of  Peru’s  farmland  is  regularly  fertilized.  As  a  result,  Peruvian  agricultural
productivity  is  relatively  low  but  as  investment  drives  modernization,  fertilizer  use  should  increase  accordingly.  Peru  does  not  produce  fertilizers  in  any
significant quantities; all chemical fertilizers consumed in the country - more than 900,000 tonnes of fertilizer per year are imported from the USA, Canada,
Russia and Colombia. Figure 19-3 shows how Peruvian consumption of fertilizers has risen steadily over the last few years. Up to mid-July 2015, the country
imported 596,196 tonnes of fertilizers implying annual consumption in excess of 1 million tonnes for the year. Ironically, despite being one of the largest
producers of phosphate rock in the Americas, with one of if not the most natural phosphate rock known, more than 99% of Peru’s production of Sechura
phosphate rock is  exported abroad for the production of soluble chemical fertilizers.

SECHURA REACTIVE PHOSPHATE ROCK: CHARACTERISTICS & AGRONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS
RPR can be defined as natural phosphate rocks that release their phosphorus into plant-available form at a fast enough rate, even on only mildly acidic soils,
to maintain crop and pasture production over time as well as soluble phosphorus fertilizer does. In general the effectiveness of DAPR is greater with long-
term and perennial crops than for short-term

or annual crops, due to its slower release into the soil. DAPR has been used successfully for many tree crops in Asia including rubber, palm oil and tea.
Sechura RPR has been shown to be one of the most reactive10 in the world, and an effective slow-release phosphate fertilizer under favorable conditions 11
Table 19-1 below, shows the solubility spectrum developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) for phosphate rocks. The test values
quantify the natural ability of phosphate rock to breakdown under ambient conditions.

The neutral ammonium citrate solubility of Sechura rock has been measured by the International Fertilizer Association (IFA) at between 5 to 9% putting at the
upper end of the highly reactive classification and making it ideally suited for use as a direct application phosphate rock12 13. A full range of solubility tests
were carried out for Focus by Jacobs on four processed samples from Bayovar 12 during bench scale metallurgical test work consisting of Plant Line 1 and
Plant Line 2 product and two composites. All samples returned excellent solubilities described below.

The whole rock solubility reported in Table 19-2 indicate high solubilities, and there is little doubt that Sechura RPR is highly-reactive and one of the world’s
best RPRs for use as DAPR.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that Sechura RPR is a highly effective source of phosphorus that can equal or outperform the agronomic performance
of manufactured, water soluble fertilizers in acid soils with elevated rainfall. The soil and climatic conditions in large parts of Central and South America (acid
soils with high rainfall) are ideal for maximizing the agronomic performance of Sechura RPR and the rock should perform as well as manufactured fertilizers
such as single superphosphate (SSP).
An important consideration for farmers is that DAPR usually costs much less per tonne than SSP and other manufactured fertilizers. Also, DAPR’s slower
phosphorus-release characteristic doesn’t overwhelm the phosphorus

capacity of the soils. DAPR releases phosphorus over a 3-4 year profile providing consistent long-term nutrients to the crops.
As discussed above, Sechura RPR is particularly well suited for use on palm oil plantations and has been used on plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia for
some  years.  It  is  advertised  by  large  distributors  of  fertilizer  products  as  THE  premium  phosphate  fertilizer.  The  rapid  expansion  underway  in  the  Latin
American oil palm sector represents a major opportunity for Focus’ DAPR production. This market will be an important part of Focus’ long-term marketing
strategy.

PRICES PAID FOB BAYOVAR FOR DAPR
Two mines close to Focus’ Bayovar project have been producing and selling DAPR for several years. Fosyeiki S.A.C. and Corporación Agrosechura Peru
S.A.C. produce and export ~22-24% P2O5 rock by truck and ship to Ecuador, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Colombia. Fosyeiki’s product is claimed to range from
22-24% P2O5 and its sales volumes appear to be limited by its production capacity. FOB prices by ship to Central America have ranged from US$163/T to
US$195/T. FOB prices achieved by Agrosechura by truck to Bolivia and Ecuador have ranged up to US$220/T.
19.7
PRICES PAID BY PERUVIAN FARMERS FOR DAPR
The Peruvian agricultural ministry (MINAGRI) compiles pricing information for direct application phosphate rock from across Peru, broken down by region for
the years 2013 to 2015. Quantities sold throughout Peru are not reported by MINAGRI. Generally DAPR is used by organic farmers who cannot use chemical
fertilizers or pesticides on their crops. The average retail price paid by the farmer in Peru for DAPR has remained fairly constant at about US$320/T. Prices
are consistently lowest (US$200-240/t) in the regions of Cajamarca, Amazonas and San Martin closest to Piura with lower transport costs. Farmers in Loreto
are paying the most for DAPR, currently about US$510/T. Junín is the region with the largest number of organic farmers in Peru. The price of DAPR in Junín
is US$210/T currently.
19.8
OTHER DAPR SALES IN THE AMERICAS
Recent sales of DAPR in North and South America are summarized below.
·
Fertoz, Wapiti mine, BC, Canada: C$200/T (US$150/T) for 20% P2O5 rock
·
Dusolo Fertilizers, Bomfim mine, Brazil, C$93 – C$110/T (US$70-83/T) low grade 15% P2O5 rock
·
B&A Mineracao, Bonito Mine, Brazil, US$185/T for 20% P2O5 rock.
19.9
PRICE ASSUMPTION FOR 24% P2O5 DAPR PRODUCT
Retail prices of DAPR to organic farmers in Peru have remained fairly constant at about US$320 per tonne for the past few years. In Malaysia, Bayovar rock
is currently being marketed by Union Harvest for US$160-170/T. This Pre-Feasibility Study assumes a wholesale price of US$145/t for Focus’ 24% P2O5
product.
19.10
PRICE ASSUMPTION FOR 28% P2O5 DAPR PRODUCT
Several studies conducted by governmental organizations over the past decade have shown that on plantations located in areas with acidic soils and high
rain fall, Sechura RPR competes agronomically with SSP, achieving similar or higher crop yields. Consequently RPR and SSP tend to compete directly and
prices are similar, as seen in countries such as Brazil.
Focus will therefore be looking to displace SSP sales in South and Central America with a cheaper but more effective product. This Pre-Feasibility Study
assumes  a  wholesale  price  of  US$185/t  for  Focus’  higher  grade  product,  which  would  represent  approximately  a  25%  discount  to  SSP  prices  in  Latin
America.

BLENDED RPR PRODUCTS
245
Focus has retained a consulting soil scientist and fertilizer expert to advice on opportunities to produce simple RPR-based blended products. RPR can
easily be blended with other nutrients. From a spreading perspective, it is easiest if these are in fine granular form to ensure even spreading and avoid
segregation on transport. The most commonly deficient nutrients that need addition are sulphur, which can be added as gypsum* or fine elemental sulphur
(S), potassium (K) which can be added as standard grade potash or sulphate of potash, and magnesium which can be added as dolomite or magnesium
oxide, and of course nitrogen (N). Any form of fertilizer N can be blended, but preferably in fine or prilled form. In late 2015 Focus was investigating carrying
out field trials of Sechura RPR blends at a palm oil plantation in Peru to compare its efficacy versus other fertilizers.
*There is a substantial resource of high quality gypsum on the Bayovar12 concession which forms an evaporite layer approximately 0.4 - 1m thick within 0 -
2m of the surface. There is a small mining operation on the concession exploiting the gypsum and producing about 80kt per year.
19.12
SALES CONTRACTS
No  sales  contracts  or  off-take  agreements  exist  at  the  time  of  writing  of  this  report.  Focus  has  had  preliminary  discussions  with  a  number  of  potential
consumers of DAPR in South and Central America and will be running agronomic trials with these potential customers during 2016.

GENERAL REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
246
Peruvian legislation requires that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) be completed and approved when projects of public or private investment are
undertaken  that  are  likely  to  cause  significant  and  negative  environmental  impacts.    This  requirement  also  extends  to  any  modifications,  extensions  or
diversification of existing projects if these changes in size, scope or circumstances could generate new or increased negative environmental impacts.
The competent authority that will be in charge of the review and approval of the Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (dEIA) is the National Service for
Environmental Certification for Sustainable Investment (SENACE), created by Law N° 29968; however, some dEIAs are expressly excluded from SENACE
review by Supreme Decree, Article 1.3 Law N° 29968. SENACE is in the process of implementing functions and will start its competences on December
28th, 2015.
This section provides a synthesis of the current regulations framework related to authorizations and permits for the current Project description. Table 20-1
includes the competent authorities these procedures are related to.

Climate and Meteorology
The analysis of the meteorological conditions was performed based on the official records available from three regional meteorological stations: San Miguel;
Chusis;  and  Bernal,  located  in  the  Piura  Region,  near  the  Project,  and  operated  by  the  National  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Service  of  Peru
(SENHAMI).
The climate in the study area is influenced by variations in the equatorial belt and by the changes of direction (east to west) of the cold and hot water
currents.  These characteristics result in high temperatures and low rainfall, except for short periods of sporadic income of warm water current (El Niño) in the
southern hemisphere or other extraordinary events, as occurred in 1982-1983 and 1997-1998. The meeting of the cold water Humboldt Current (14 °C - 19
°C)  with  the  warm  El  Niño  current  (22  °C  -  27  °C)  at  Sechura  Bay,  in  the  south  of  Piura,  causes  some  variety  and  climate  mergers  that  give  unique
characteristics to this region. Factors influencing the climate are the Andes Mountains that cross the western zone of the South American continent, and act
as a natural barrier preventing the passage of the humid air masses from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the South Pacific Anticyclone and the Inter-tropical
Convergence  Zone  which  condition  the  Alisios  winds  blowing  from  the  southeast  and  northeast  sectors.  According  to  SENAMHI  (2008)  the  climate
classification of the study area, based on the Thornthwaite method (1931), is arid, semi warm, with deficient rains in all seasons (normal years) and relatively
high humidity.  Key characteristics of the study area climate are:
·
Temperature: The annual air temperature in the study area is characterized by maximum values presented between January and March, with the highest
average maximum temperature recorded in February (33.1 °C); and  minimum  air  temperature  values  recorded  from  July  to  September,  with  the  lowest
average minimum temperature recorded in August (16.6 °C).
·
Humidity: During an annual cycle, the highest average relative humidity values were recorded between June and August.  The average monthly relative
humidity fluctuates between 67.5% in January to 76.0% in June at San Miguel station; and from 70.0% in February to 77.2% in August at Chusis station.
·
Wind:  The annual course of wind speed in the area of study is not only due to the direct influence of solar radiation but also to the exchange of large-scale
global atmospheric circulation.  The average wind speed in the area is 4.4 m/s; this velocity is considered as weak breezes according to the Beaufort scale
(OOM 2008).  The predominant wind direction is from the south (65.3%) at San Miguel station and from the southeast (48.8%) at Chusis station.
·
Solar Radiation: According the Atlas of Solar Radiation (SENAMHI, 2003), the northern coast of Peru (between 3° S and 6° S latitude), presents high values
of solar energy during the austral summer; however, the maximum values are recorded in spring, from October to November.  At a regional level, the average
daily values of solar radiation oscillate in the range from 5,000 W/m2 to 6,500 W/m2.
·
Precipitation: The rains usually occur in the summer months, from January to April; the rest of the year is commonly dry.  The average annual precipitation at
Chusis was 77.7 mm and 58.6 mm at Bernal.14
Hydrography
The  Project  area  is  located  on  the  interbasin  between  the  Piura  River  and  the  Cascajal  River.  The  hydrographic  basin  has  an  area  of  approximately
12,216 km2.
14 This average is strongly influenced by extraordinary precipitation that occurred in 1983 and 1998; reaching values of 1,036.1 mm at Chusis and 1,200.5
mm at Bernal.
M3-PN140103

The Piura River is formed from a diverse system of headwaters derived from the Andes Mountains that converge in the Las Lomas and Chulucanas districts
to the east, limiting possibilities to install reservoirs or other facilities for regulation and use of water. Ramón, Ñapique and Mala Vida are ephemeral lagoons,
located close to the southeast extreme of the Lower Piura Valley, approximately 30km south of Piura city.  Once the flow provided by the Piura River fills the
Ramón Lagoon during extreme El Nino events, this lagoon starts its overflow towards Ñapique Lagoon, and then drains towards the town of Sechura. The
defenses built to prevent this from happening, including a dam at Ñapique Lagoon, force the water out through Ramón Lagoon to the Pampas Las Salinas by
an extension called Bravo Ramon River, forming the La Niña Lake some 12km further south.  In extreme cases, La Niña Lake connects with the Virrilá
Estuary to reach the sea.
The Cascajal River Basin has 5,350 km2 of area and is 154 km long; this river is considered a weak river because it does not reach the sea, except during
years with substantial rain when the Cascajal River reaches the sea through the Virrilá Estuary. The endorheic Cascajal River Basin contributes with the
Piura River forming La Niña Lake, and eventually contributes to the aquifer recharge.  The records of gauging water flow on the Cascajal River show that this
river  normally  does  not  have  exceedances  into  its  agricultural  area,  but  in  extreme  years  of  El  Nino  events,  its  flow  increases  to  seven  or  eight  times
compared to normal flow.  The annual volume of the Cascajal River in a normal year reaches 79 Mm3.
Geology, Geomorphology and Geodynamic
Regional Geology
Peru is located on the edge of two tectonic plates, Sudamericana and Nazca.  Regionally, the study area is located in the Sechura basin; the western limit of
this basin is delineated by Cerro Illescas, which comprises Precambrian and lower Paleozoic basement rocks, and the Andes mountains are at the eastern
limit.
The  regional  lithostratigraphy  includes  metamorphic  and  igneous  rocks  that  outcrop  in  Cerro  Illescas.  The  metamorphic  rocks  consist  of  gneisses  and
tonalite from the Precambrian period and migmatites, granites, schists, phyllites and shales from the Lower Paleozoic period.  The Quaternary deposits are
represented by the Hornillos Formation, Talara and Lobitos shoals, whose main outcrops are located near Cerro Illescas and the Virrilá Estuary.
Local Geology
The following soil units are present in the area of assessment:
·
Aeolian deposits, such as barchan dunes, around some vegetation named Algarrobal-Sapotal; comprising fine sand with loose, rounded grains; these are
mainly located in the Duna Gigante.
·
Lake and estuary deposits, with laminated beige fine sand and clay interbedded with coquina beds; these are located in Salina Grande depression.
·
Alluvial deposits that contain sub angular unconsolidated conglomerates in a beige colored quartz and feldspar matrix, located next to Cerro Illescas.
·
Lobitos and Talara terraces, consists of poorly lithified sub angular fossil conglomerate in a sandy or bioclastic matrix (Lobitos); and medium to coarse poorly
consolidated arkose lenses, and medium conglomerate interbedded with coquina sequences (Talara).
Likewise, the rock units present in the assessment area are the following:
·
Paleozoic Socle, sedimentary sequence of 2 m to 5 m thick light grey quartzite, interbedded with siltstone schist and phyllite.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
·
260
Verdún Formation, that consists of a terrace formation series;  its  base  is  composed  of  cemented  reddish  conglomerate,  which  contains  rounded  clasts.
Facies higher in the formation are beige in color and are predominantly bioclastic dolomitic-calcareous sandstone.
·
Chira  Formation,  that  has  a  thin  beige  colored  fossil-bearing  sandstone  at  the  base,  interbedded  with  siltstone  and  tuffaceous  sandstone.  The  middle
member of the formation comprises fine grey fissile shale.
·
Montera Formation, thick yellowish grey feldspathic sandstone beds, interbedded with silty sandstone and conglomerate lenses, transitioning gradationally
in the upper members to conglomerate interbedded with sandstone and mudstone at the top of the sequence.
·
Zapallal  Formation,  of  the  Lower-Middle  Miocene,  deposited  as  a  result  of  a  sedimentation  process  of  deep  subsidence,  and  has  the  following  three
members: (i) lower member with three levels; (ii) middle member (Clambore Sandstone); and (iii) upper member that includes five levels.
·
Miramar Formation, that contains alluvial conglomerate, poorly consolidated in a sandy matrix interbedded with sandstone lenses.
Structural Geology
Structurally there are two distinct sectors:
·
Cerro Illescas Sector represents a regional metamorphism deformation event, with faulting and intense folding and foliation.  There are two fault populations:
(i) longitudinal faults: the main regional scale structural feature are NW-SE oriented faults with dextral movement; (ii) transverse faults: Less frequent sinistral
NE-SW and E-W faults, activated during Cenozoic during extensional tectonics.
·
Sechura Basin Sector, that includes three deformation stages: (i) after base Zapallal diatomites sedimentation, with direction between 340° and 350°, 1.0%
to 1.4% gradient, and folds and microfaults; (ii) happened after the last sedimentation of Zapallal Formation diatomites, with 10°- 20° direction; 0.6% to 0.8%
gradient and its beds are poorly folded and have faults; (iii) occurred after the Pliocene and shows faults that cut Peistoncene and Holocene beds.
Geomorphology
The main geomorphological regional features in the Bayovar deposit are the Cerro Illescas and the Sechura Desert (Sechura Basin). They are located
between the Pacific Ocean and west of the Andes Mountains. The landforms are the result of Cenozoic tectonism, sedimentary processes and erosion
(aeolian,  pluvial  eustatic  changes  or  El  Niño  phenomenon).  The  uprising  occurred  during  the  Pleistocene  and  Holocene,  and  the  tilting  of  the  plain
generated other landforms such as Virrilá Estuary, Salina Grande Depression and the Duna Gigante.
The main characteristics of the geomorphological units are presented in Table 20-3.

anomalous tsunamis and tides. The resulting landforms are
cliffs, bays and minor structures
Ongoing process in steep slopes; its intensity increases
when natural conditions vary, like the lack of vegetation or
the concentration of surface runoff channels that intersect
(fractures and faults)
It occurs on slopes and hill steep slopes, where rock
outcrops show moderate to intense fracturing.  Landslides
caused by weathering and the opening of fractures allow the
rock falls
Transport and accumulation of fine material, mainly silt and

Soils
The soils in the area of assessment are undeveloped mineral soils because this area normally presents low rainfall and shallow vegetation, which causes
low incorporation of organic material in the soil.
Parental  materials  are  residual  (rock  weathering)  and  transported  material  (deposited  material  by  water  action,  colluvial,  wind  and  ocean).  The  soil
temperature regimen is isohyperthermic; average annual soil temperature is equal to or greater than 22 °C and the difference between summer temperatures
and winter temperatures is approximately 6 °C y.  The soil moisture regimen is arid, dry in all parts for more than half of the accumulative days per year, and
wet in some or in all its parts for less than 90 consecutive days.
Taxonomic Classification of Soils
Soils in the Project area are classified into two distinct landscape types; hilly landscape and plain landscape.  According to an ACOMISA study performed in
the assessment area in 2014, there are seven soils units identified with a common name for easy classification, and have been grouped into two subgroups
corresponding to the Order Aridisols. The order includes arid and ochric soils. Table 20-5 shows Classification of the seven study area soils according to the
taxonomic classification of soil (USDA 2006).

Current Land Use
Classification of current land use within the Project area according to the International Geographical Union (UGI) identifies two distinct land use categories:
·
1st category: Urban area, government and private facilities. This category includes Puerto Rico urban area.
·
7th category: Forest Land. This category includes Algarrobal-Sapotal vegetation, represented by trees named Algarrobo (Prosoposis pallida); woody species
as Sapote (Colicodendron scabridum), Faique (Acacia macracantha) and Vichayo (Capparis avicennifolia) are present too. There are shrubby strata as
Encelia canescens and Galvezia fructicosa and herbaceous strata as Tiquilia dichotoma, Tiquilia paronychioides and Alternanthera peruviana.
Soil Quality
The soil quality assessment was carried out using information from 14 monitoring stations. Results were compared with Environmental Quality Standards
(ECA) for soils, approved in D.S. N° 002-2013-MINAM, and with Guide Values of Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME 2007). The most
relevant results are the following:
·
Arsenic (As): None of the results exceeded the ECA for agricultural or industrial soil use.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
·
264
Cadmium (Cd): All the results for this parameter were below the industrial ECA for soils or industrial CCME standard (22.0 mg/kg). At six stations (S-3, S-16,
S-18, S-22, ECA-08 and ECA-09), the content of cadmium were above the ECA and CCME standards for agricultural soils (22 mg/kg), may be because
cadmium compounds are part of the parent material (rock) or are effects of operating phosphate activities around.
·
Selenium (Se): Content of selenium exceeded agricultural CCME standard (1.0 mg/kg) at one station; it could be related to the presence of others metals
which it is linked to.  Selenium does not have ECA for agricultural or industrial soil use.
Furthermore,  the  content  of  radioactive  elements  was  analyzed  using  information  from  eight  stations  established  in  the  EIAsd  Bayovar  N°  12
(ACOMISA 2014). Radioactive elements were compared with Reference Values of Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) in units Becquerels per gram
(Bq/g). None of the results of uranium or thorium exceeded the RSA 93 and the concentrations of these parameters were far below reference values.
Water and Sediment Quality
The characterization of surface water quality (marine and continental) and marine sediments was developed considering information from 27 monitoring
stations distributed in three sectors: Bayovar Port (11), South of Sechura Bay (8) and Virrilá Estuary (8); as well as 23 sediments stations, located in Bayovar
Port Sector (11), south of Sechura Bay (8) and Virrilá Estuary (3).
The results of water monitoring were compared with ECA for surface water, Category 2 (Coastal Marine Activities) and Category 4 (Conservation of Aquatic
Environment) parameters, stablished through D.S. N° 002-2008-MINAM. The results of sediments quality were compared with international standards, the
Canadian  Sediment  Quality  Guidelines  for  the  Protection  of  Aquatic  Life,  established  by  the  Canadian  Council  of  Ministers  of  the  Environment  for  the
protection of aquatic life (CCME, 2002).
Marine and Continental Water Quality
In general, most of evaluated parameters were within the range of values reported in previous periods, without exceeding the standards of environmental
quality for water.
·
pH reported ranged from 6.0 to 9.0 units; being generally within the range of the ECA.
·
Phosphates  ranged  between  0.006  mg/L  to  0.49  mg/L,  exceeding  the  ECA  Cat.  2-C2  (0.03  mg/L  –  0.09  mg/L),  Cat.  2-C3  (0.1  mg/L)  and  Cat.  4-AM
(0.031 mg/L – 0.093 mg/L) in all stations evaluated. Phosphates are naturally present in the Peruvian north coast given the high productivity of the waters.
These high concentrations could be linked to the areas of upwelling, where the cold waters of seabed and rich in nutrients, reach the surface generating
higher productivity.
·
Microbiological parameters presented a maximum concentration of 790 NMP/100 mL for fecal coliform, and 2,200 MPN/100 mL for total coliform exceeding
the ECA for water. These results may be related to human activities near the area of assessment, as sewers, shell fish farming, among others.  The values for
total coliform that exceeded standards were also present in the EIA (Golder 2007), although less frequently.
·
Phenols, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and oils and fats, were reported below the limit of detection.
·
Metals were reported, in general, within the standards or below the detection limit of the laboratory test method, except the values for nickel (0.00007 mg/L to
0.029 mg/L), copper (average concentration of 0.0067 mg/L and maximum value of 0.082 mg/L); mercury (average value of 0.00044 mg/L and maximum
value of 0.055 mg/L); lead (0.0017 mg/L to 0.0350 mg/L) and zinc (0.0228 mg/L to 0.0865 mg/L), that exceeded standard values.

Marine Sediments
·
pH values ranged from 7.7 to 8.7, similar to those reported for seawater.
·
265
TPH (C10 - C28) reported values below the detection limit of laboratory except at the Port Bayovar sector where reached values up to 22 mg/kg.
·
Total organic carbon (TOC) ranged from 2.4 mg/kg to 26.9 mg/kg.  On the other hand, the average concentration of nitrate was 1.1 mg/kg at the Port Bayovar
sector and 0.6 mg/kg at Sechura Bay. The values of phosphates ranged from 2.2 mg/kg to 110.0 mg/kg.
·
Arsenic and cadmium were recorded above the CCME guide values. Likewise, mercury, lead, copper and zinc values were reported below environmental
standards for marine sediments.
Hydrogeology
The following three important aquifers are present within the Project area:
·
Alluvial aquifer of the Piura River Valley, located in the Piura river bed and extending regionally throughout the valley to the river mouth on the sea.  This
aquifer is characterized as clastic (fluvial and alluvial) and is typically a few meters deep.
·
Overburden aquifer that extends from the foot of the Andes to the east, to the eastern base of the slopes of Cerro Illescas to the west.  It is delimited by two
regional faults, and made up of layers of calcareous sandstone of the Montera Formation.  The metamorphic rocks of Cerro Illescas constitute the local
basement. The aquifer deepens eastward, becoming a confined aquifer because the Zapallal Formation overlying and layers of sandstones intercalated with
clay.
·
Zapallal aquifer, that extends from north of the Piura Valley to Minchales Cascajal area to the south; consists of Tertiary sandstone of Zapallal Formation,
which overlies Montera Formation, and is covered by fine sediments of wind and alluvial origin recently.  This aquifer is confined by an impermeable clay
horizon brackish preventing downward leakage and lower clay strata that make up most of the column of Zapallal Formation.
According to chemical analyses of existing groundwater, pH fluctuated between 6.8 and 7.8, and electrical conductivity, between 1.41 dS/m and 3.65 dS/m,
representing a slight decrease of high mineralization. The salinity of the groundwater estimated from the conductivity is linked to the accumulation of salts in
the first horizons of the soil and its subsequent washing during periods of significant rainfall in which there is infiltration.  The evaporation and the small rains
carry salts due to proximity to the sea.
The EIA of Phosphates Project (BISA 2013) indicates that groundwater levels ranged from 0.26 m to 0.56 m, from September 2004 to October 2006; and it
went down to an average of 0.91 m, from October 2006 to October 2011.  In the Hydrogeological Model (KCB 2013), historical records of water levels show a
decrease of approximately 5 m water level, from June 2012 to September 2012. As of this date, levels remain constant, but without a recovery.  In this way, it
is possible to infer that groundwater levels present a consistent trend slightly downward and the flow direction is south-southwest to north-northeast, showing
that the groundwater flow direction is towards the ocean.
The main mechanism that contributes to the recharge of aquifers is precipitation.  The precipitation of the annual regime, discharged mainly in the Andean
foothills (Alto Piura, Olmos, others), discharging in the river and the alluvial aquifer of the Piura River, which in turn, discharges in the Zapallal aquifer in their
headwater.  Rains associated with El Niño phenomena at the Tablazo, discharged underground of the Sechura desert, including the pampa Minchales-
Cascajal and some areas of Ramon, Bayovar and Illescas.  It is worth mentioning that, in normal years and typical
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
266
rainfall events, the average evaporation rate is much greater than medium precipitation; therefore a significant overflow due to precipitation is not expected to
occur.
On the other hand, the sources of underground water discharge from the entire aquifer system are formed by the few springs of the lower Piura Valley, wells
for groundwater extraction and evaporation; the surpluses go to the Pacific Ocean according to the groundwater flow modeling.
Oceanography
This assessment summarizes the oceanographic conditions nearby the Sechura Bay where the Project will develop the shipment of phosphate concentrates
at the existing JPQ Port facilities.  The oceanographic study was conducted in April and June 2013, and consisted in the measurement of oceanographic
parameters,  tides  and  marine  currents.    16  sampling  stations  were  established  in  order  to  measure  temperature  and  salinity  in  the  water  column.
 Additionally, an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was installed to measure tides, waves and current marines.
·
Temperature  registered  an  average  of  15.89  °C,  in  a  range  from  15.43  °C  to  17.11  °C.  The  average  temperature  decreased  based  on  the  depth;  the
thermocline was identified between 5 m and 12 m of depth, which it is typical in areas of coastal upwelling along the Peruvian coast (IMARPE 2007).
·
Salinity had an average value of 35.13 UPS, with a range from 35.09 UPS to 35.20 UPS. The analysis of the results indicates conditions of Cold Coastal
Waters and Subtropical Surface Waters mix.
·
Wind had a southwest predominant direction, with an average speed of 4.7 m/s.
·
Tides, in the north location of the ADCP, the sea surface had 2.10 m of amplitude, while in the south location this amplitude was 0.88 m.
·
Wave height oscillates between 0.19 m and 0.41 m (average height of 0.29 m) in the north, and from 0.18 m to 0.35 m in the south (average height of 0.26 m).
The standard deviation was 0.05 m and 0.04 m, respectively. This variation could be explained by the influence of intermittent waves caused by atmospheric
disturbances that take place in the Southern Hemisphere. The predominant wave propagation direction was northwest, north-northwest and north.
·
Marine currents at the sea surface north of assessment area, had maximum speed of 33 cm/s, while bottom/depth reached maximum values of 18 cm/s.  In
the south, these values were 27 cm/s y 11 cm/s, respectively.  The surface currents flowed mainly to the northwest and presented a synchrony between the
decreased flow velocity and the change in its predominant direction. The bottom currents exhibit greater dispersion, with a southwest direction trend.
Air Quality
The characterization of air quality and noise in the assessment area was carried out using information from eight stations for air quality and five stations for
noise. The results of air quality monitoring were compared with the ECA for air, established through D.S. Nº 074-2001-PCM, D.S. Nº 003-2008-MINAM and
R.M. Nº 315-96-EM/VMM, or with Ontario’s Ambient Air Quality Criteria (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Canada) in absence of the first.
·
Particulate matter: none of the results exceeded the Air ECA for PM10 and maximum values were recorded in CA-3 station in November 2011 (40.0 µg/m3)
and April 2012 (41.0 µg/m3), probably because of removal of soil particles by wind erosion. Air ECA for PM2.5 was exceeded in AI-BY-01 station for two of
the seven days of monitoring period, mainly by emissions from ships in Petroperu Port, concentrated phosphate shipment and sea salt (aerosols) from the
ocean by action of northwest local winds.
M3-PN140103

·
267
Gases: none of the results exceeded the Air ECA for H2S, N2O, CO and O3; most results of SO2 were below the limit of quantification and only a value of this
parameter, registered in AI-BY-01 (41.4 µg/m3), exceeded the Air ECA, probably for the traffic exhaust in Petroperú Port.
·
Metals monitored were lead, arsenic, cadmium and copper, using a filter of PM10, none of the values exceeded Air ECA, respectively.
·
Organic compounds: none of the results exceeded the Air ECA for total hydrocarbons expressed as hexane; and the maximum value was recorded in AI-BY-
01 (70.8 µg/m3) station; benzene results were below limit of quantification.
Noise
The information of environmental noise available for the assessment area was compared with ECA for noise  regarding industrial areas (D.S. Nº 085-2003-
PCM); these standards establishes a set of maximum noise levels in the environment, which must not be exceeded in order to protect human health. These
values correspond to the values of weighted equivalent continuous A pressure (LAeqT), in decibels units (dBA).
Data of noise stations is from the monitoring performed in November 2011, April 2012, July 2012 and June 2013, during day and night time.  All noise levels
did not exceed the ECA both in day and night times. Maximum values expressed in LAeqT were related to traffic sounds or ocean waves, according the
location of monitoring stations.
Biological Components
This section contains information regarding the biological components of the area in which the Project is located.  This information is based on studies
performed in the area, therefore considering the data available representative for the Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project.
The  Project  is  located  in  the  ecoregion  Coastal  Desert  (Brack  1986),  an  environment  characterized  by  a  dry  semiarid  weather  with  scarce  annual
precipitation and relatively high temperatures.  The area in which the Project is situated comprises two life zones defined by the Peruvian Ecological Map
(INRENA 1995):
·
Tropical Premontane – Super arid Desert, located in the warm temperate latitudinal strip along the southern coastal desert of Peru.  The mean annual
temperatures range from a maximum of 24 °C to a minimum of 19.7 °C.  Annual precipitation oscillates between 5.4 mm and 59.6 mm.  The landscape
varies from flat to slightly curved, typical of elevated plains of the southern coastal region; to rough or abrupt, in the steep slopes of the occidental Andes
basin.    Vegetation  is  very  scarce  and  characterized  by  xerophytes,  primarily Prosopis  pallida  (algarrobo), Capparis  angulata  (sapote)  and Gynerium
sagitatum (caña brava).  The use of this life zone is limited to agriculture along irrigated alluvial valleys, as well as livestock activities.
·
Tropical – Super Arid Desert, located in the warm temperate latitudinal strip along the southern coastal desert of Peru.  The mean annual temperature is 24
°C, with an annual precipitation oscillating between 62.5 mm and 125 mm.  The landscape varies from flat to slightly curved and is subject to intense eolic
erosion.  Vegetation is scarce and limited to disperse xerophyte type of shrubs and grasses used for occasional pasture; the predominant species include
Prosopis sp. (algarrobo) y Capparis sp. (sapote).

Virrilá Estuary: located approximately 30 km from the Project and constituted by an area rich in aquatic resources and hosts a high diversity of migratory and
resident birds (CDC-UNALM 1992). In 1998, Wetlands International included Virrilá as a wetland of high biological value with significant benefits for human
population with low impacts and threats. Furthermore, this area was declared as an Important Bird Area for Conservation (Birdlife 2012), as well as meets the
requirements to become a Ramsar site and also form part of the Hemispheric Network of Shorebird Reserves.
·
Reserved Zone Illescas: created in 2010 through the R.M. N° 251-2010-MINAM and located approximately 50 km from the Project. It is characterized by
several vegetation formations that provide special habitats adapted to the extreme conditions of aridity and humidity, characteristics of the coastal desert of
Peru.  It is an important refuge for threatened endemic wildlife, especially bird life, as well as resting and feeding place for migratory birds from Nearctic and
Austral.
·
San Pedro Mangroves: included on June 2008 in the International Wetlands List from the Ramsar Convention, issued for the protection of wetlands. This
fragile ecosystem is located approximately 60 km from the Project and is home for a great number of migratory shorebirds, especially the species Calidris
alba (Sanderling); additionally, 23 species of shorebirds were registered here. This area was also defined as an area of regional importance of the Shorebird
Reserve Hemispheric Network.
·
Regional  Community  Conservation  Area:  in  2010,  under  the  Participatory  Biodiversity  Conservation  Dry  Forest  in  the  north  Coast  of  Peru  Project,
SWISSCONTACT prepared the “Diagnosis and Elaboration of Technical Records in the Priority Areas for Conservation in the Dry Forests in Tumbes, Piura
and Lambayeque”. In this technical record, the proposal was to create the Regional Community Conservation Area of Virrila – Ramon and Ñapique was
included. The Regional Government of Piura, through the Regional Council Agreement N° 672-2010/GRP-CR, December 23rd, declared it as regional
interest, ratifying its ecological importance to create such regional community conservation area.

20.2.2.1
Flora and Vegetation Types
The assessment area has a total of 54 species of flora was registered, distributed among 27 families. The vegetation has a low population rate, due to the
extreme conditions of aridity. However, the species registered in the area adapted to such conditions and developed seasonal growth.
Although the Bayovar 12 concession is located primarily in a desert (Figure 20-3), the following vegetation types are identified regionally within the Project
Area:
·
Coastal  Desert:  Occupies  sandy  soils  along  the  coast  and  on  occasions  forming  small  dunes.  Characterized  by  severe  drought  with  non-dominant
vegetation; however in some cases some types of individuals near and adjacent to vegetation species such as halophytes and xerophytes can be observed.
·
Halophytic Vegetation: Restricted to areas near beach banks and some sectors of the Virrilá Estuary. It is situated along the coast, where the occasional
influx of seawater allows the development of plants adapted to high salt quality soils, forming discontinuous vegetation with small patches of both halophytes
and coastal grasses. In the assessment area, this type of vegetation is distributed as a discontinuous coastal fringe in front of the Cerro Illescas, as well as
the banks of the Virrilá Estuary. The main species identified are succulent plants such as Sesuvium portulacastrum, Batis maritime and in some areas there
is presence of Distichlis spicata and Sporobolus virginicus.

20.2.4
Habitat and Marine Biology
The assessment area for marine biology covers the intertidal and subtidal zones of the southern coast of the Sechura Bay in Piura.  In regard to the habitat,
the intertidal zona presents 3 types of habitats: sandy beaches, mixtes beaches (composed of sedimentary rocks and sand) and rocky shores. The subtidal
zone presented five types of substrate: sand, fine mix, silt, coarse mix with sand, and silt with organic remains. The sea water column was well mixed and did
not present marked variations between surface and bottom; however, the average values of temperature and dissolved oxygen decreased slightly with depth,
while values indicated the predominance salinity water mixture formed by the Peruvian Coastal Current and the warm Equatorial Surface Waters.
A total of 45 phytoplankton taxa were identified.  In relation to zooplankton >150 µm, a total of 54 taxa were identified.  As well as to zooplankton >3,000 µm,
a total of 51 taxa was identified, where the dominant phylum was Arthropod, the predominant taxa was Calanus sp. (Calanoid), Acartia tonsa (Calanoid) and
Pinnotheridae (Decapod).
Seaweed was distributed in two zones: subtidal and intertidal zones. The seaweed identified in the intertidal belongs to two divisions, Chlorophyta division
(4 taxa) and Rhodophyta (5 taxa). In the subtidal zone, the 2 divisions identified were also Chlorophyta division (4 taxa) and Rhodophyta (5 taxa), with the
highest biomass belonging to Caulerpa filiformis, Rhodymenia flabellifolia and Ulva lactuca. The high biomass of Caluerpa filiformis is a consequence of the
favorable conditions for its development and serves as an adequate substrate for the settlement of Argopecten

purpuratus (Peruvian scallop locally named “concha de abanico”). Peru has become the third largest exporter of “concha de abanico” and Piura region
contributed with 78.6% of national production in 2012; currently, there are 181 active aquaculture concessions and authorizations in Sechura Bay (National
Aquaculture Cadastre, Produce that are shown in Figure 20-4. These species could be affected by organisms producing algal blooms, as it happened in
2007, when red tide caused by the non-toxic dinoflagellate Akashiwo blood for one month occurred and caused the death of “conchas de abanico”.
The macrobentos community identified in the intertidal zone can be divided into 3 substrates: sandy intertidal, mixed intertidal and rocky intertidal.  In the
sandy  intertidal  zone,  the  macrobentos  community  identified  was  composed  of  7  taxa  belonging  to  3  phyla:  Annelid  (2  taxa),  Arthropod  (4  taxa)  and
Nemertea (1 taxon).  In the mixed intertidal zone the macrobenthos community was composed of 22 taxa belonging to 5 phyla: Annelid (8 taxa), Arthropod (6
taxa), Cnidaria (1 taxon), Mollusc (6 taxa) y Nemertea (1 taxon). In the rocky intertidal zone, a total of 17 taxa were identified, belonging to 4 phyla: Annelid
(1 taxon), Arthropod (4 taxa), Cnidaria (2 taxa) and Mollusc (10 taxa).  The macrobenthos identified in the subtidal zone was a total of 106 taxa, belonging to
7 phyla, with the most important in relation to the total abundance were Arthropod, Annelid and Mollusc.
The fish community was composed of a total of 10 taxa, with an abundance of 235 individuals and a biomass of 17.63 kg. The species most frequently
caught were Paralabrax humeralis (“cabrilla”), Auchenionchus sp. (“trambollo”) and Mugil cephalus (“lisa”).
An important resource in the Sechura Bay, Argopecten  purpuratus, (Peruvian scallop), was evaluated at adult and larval population level.  The greatest
adults  and  larvae  density  was  observed  within  the  natural  bank  in  the  Sechura  Bay,  while  near  the  port  facilities  this  species  was  observed  in  lower
numbers. As bycatch species the most frequent species were the Mollusc Crucibulum spinosum and Nassarius dentifer.
In regard to bioaccumulation organisms, 6 species of invertebrates and 5 fish were selected to analyze the concentration of 32 metals. The Mollusc collected,
except Thais  chocolate (black  snail)  and Crossata  ventricosa (pink  snail),  presented  cadmium  concentrations  slightly  exceeding  FAO  (1983)  values.
Likewise, Loligo gahi (Squid) and Solenosteira cf. fusiformis (Snail), presented copper concentrations slightly exceeding FAO (1983) values.  In regard to the
Arthropod, Hepatus chilensis (cangrejo puñete) collected near the Port of Miski Mayo, presented higher copper and cadmium concentrations in relation to
FAO (1983) values.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
·
Location and Territorial Division: The Province of Sechura is located in the Piura Region, approximately 55 km southwest of the city of Piura, in the area
called Bajo Piura. It extends over 6,369.9 km2 and it is politically divided into six districts: Bellavista de La Unión, Bernal, Cristo Nos Valga, Rinconada
Llicuar, Sechura and Vice. The Sechura Desert is located in the province (considered the largest in the country) where Bayóvar Depression is extended, an
area rich in brine, phosphates and other non-metallic mineral deposits. Sechura province hosts the Farmers’ Community San Martín de Sechura (CSMS, by
Spanish acronym) established on 1544, that comprises an approximate extension of 796,000 ha, from which only around 300,000 ha have been recorded.
CSMS, surface title holder of more than 226,000 ha of the community, was created in 2004 under the Cooperation Master Agreement for the Bayóvar Project
Sustainable Development. The contribution received by the community from the extraction companies for surface, beneficial use and easement rights are
administered by the Community Foundation.
·
Demography: According to the population forecasts from the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI, by its Spanish acronym) the Province of
Sechura has 75,652 inhabitants/year as at 2015, representing 4.1% of the regional population. The province has experienced, between 1981 and 2015, a
significant population growth, getting to 4% per year. This growth was fostered, among other factors, by immigration in the District of Sechura (mainly in
Sechura  village)  since  the  80’s  due  to  the  expectation  of  job  opportunities  created  by  fisheries  and  the  development  of  non-metallic  mineral  resources
activity. One third of the population is under 15 years old and 62% between 15 and 64 years old. The latest age group corresponds to the economically-
active population, supporting the economic burden expressed in the dependence ratio of
M3-PN140103

274
61.2 for every 100 individuals. The masculinity index in the province is 99.6 male/100 female while in Sechura, this index is 93.8 male/100 female.
·
Education: In the Province of Sechura, the reading and writing skilled population over 15 years old represents around 93%, and respect to the educational
level attained, the elementary-school level population (42% average) is dominant, and the further studies population (technical and university) percentage is
under 10% average.
·
Health: The main health services in the province are supplied by the Ministry of Health (MINSA) recording a total of 18 facilities, from which 4 are health
centers and 14 are health posts.  Density of medical doctors per every thousand inhabitants is 0.3 reflecting a deficit in health-care coverage in the province.
The most frequent reasons for consultation in the region were acute respiratory infections, illnesses in the buccal cavity and intestine illnesses15. On the
other  hand,  chronic  malnutrition  affects  29.2%  of  children  under  5  years  old  in  the  province,  being  considered  a  health  problem  of  medium  prevalence
according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Most population in the province (70.4%) is affiliated to the Health Integral System (SIS, by Spanish
acronym), a system of public insurance which gives priority to health-care for populations in poverty and extreme poverty.
·
Housing and utilities: Most dwellings in the province are independent houses; more than 90% are owned. The dominant material of external house walls is
brick or cement block but it is also used the plywood. The floor is earth or cement; while the roof material is mainly calamine sheets. Coverage of public
network water utilities inside the house is 73.5% average, but more than 95% of houses do not have this service 24 hours daily nor the 7 weekdays.  To
compensate  the  lack  or  deficiency  of  this  utility,  the  population  resort  to  other  water  supply  systems,  such  as  community  supply  tanks,  tank  trucks  and
informal connections from the neighborhood.  More than 90% of houses have power supply service and 60% use gas as fuel for cooking.
·
Transportation  and  communications:  The  main  transportation  means  in  the  province  is  land  transportation.    Road  infrastructure  comprises  215.7  km  of
national roads and 294.6 km of neighboring roads. The surface of the national network is in good working conditions being dominant the types of asphalt and
semi-paved surfaces. Port infrastructure comprises the Port of Bayóvar and the artisanal fishing docks of Las Delicias, Parachique-La Bocana and Puerto
Rico coves grouped under the Association Front of Artisanal Aquiculture Fishermen of Puerto Rico Bayóvar (AFREPAAC) located in the Sechura Bay.
Regarding the information technologies and communication (ITC), mobile phone and TV sets are the ITC with the largest number of users in the Province
(87% average); the radio is also a communication means with a significant representation, mainly in Sechura town.
·
Land  resource:  The  Province  of  Sechura  lies  in  the  coastal  littoral  subspace  having  an  extensive  marine-coastal  area  with  important  hydrobiological
diversity, where fisheries and mariculture are developed. Also, Sechura Desert is located in the Province comprising one third of the land where the largest
Peruvian phosphates reservoir is located, currently developed by mining companies. There are also salt flats in Sechura Desert used by CSMS16.  The
agricultural area comprising only 5% of the land.
·
Water resources: The Río Chira-Piura basin supplies water for population, agricultural, industrial and mining use.  The water for agricultural use is under the
irrigation system of Medio and Bajo Piura, which integrates to the irrigation sector of Sechura. This sector has four irrigation users committees comprising
more than 11,000 users in a total area of 13,067.25 ha, from which 98% approximately are under irrigation.17 Currently,

the water service for population consumption is handled by the Consortium Pro-Gestión and the source of water supply is the well Altos Negros, located
11 km from CP Sechura. Drinking water service in CP Puerto Rico, Playa Blanca cove and Illescas hamlet is in charge of Bayóvar Water Supply Center
owned by the Piura Regional Government, which has the Bayóvar Well as the water supply source located at Illescas hamlet.
·
Economic  Profile:  Is  basically  primary  with  dominance  of  fisheries  (artisanal  and  industrial)  and  agriculture  (small  agricultural  producers),  occupying
approximately 53% of the economically-active population (PEA, by Spanish acronym). The commercial and services activities concentrate in the District of
Sechura, as it is the capital of the Province and headquarters of most non-metallic mining companies extracting phosphates, salt and aggregate material.
Entrepreneurial mining employs less than 1% of PEA in the Province. 79% of households have an income over the minimum salary, indicating that families
can cover the household expenditures and satisfy their needs in terms of money.
·
Agriculture: This activity is developed in north of the Province of Sechura; production concentrates in crops oriented to the internal market, being the main
ones cotton, paddy rice and hard yellow maize. In general, Sechura producers sell their products to the collection centers located in the District of La Unión
and the city of Piura with the expectation of receiving better prices.
·
Cattle raising: Extensive-type cattle raising is mainly developed in two areas, southwest the Province of Sechura, from the Virrilá Estuary up to Cerro Illescas
foothills, and in the District of Cristo Nos Valga, northwest the Province of Sechura. Goat cattle raising is the most important, but also beef cattle and sheep
cattle are raised in a lower rate, as well as work animals, such as horses, mules and donkeys. CC San Martín de Sechura has granted land to Empresa
Comunal de Servicios Agropecuarios San Cayetano S.R.L. (Ecomusa) for cattle rising, that is the beneficial user of 30,000 ha in the area of Illescas grouping
80 families working in extensive raising of beef, sheep, goats and pork cattle. These families do not live permanently in the area and, generally, combine this
activity with agriculture or fisheries.  Water supply for cattle is from the Bayóvar Water Supply Center.
·
Fisheries: Fishing is one of the main production activities developed in the Province, mainly in the District of Sechura. Approximately 29% of the population
employed work in fisheries and mariculture, developed in the Sechura Bay. In CP Sechura this percentage represents 39% of the population. Most fishermen
choose  fishing  mackerel  and  kelp  bass,  due  to  their  large  demand  in  the  national  market  and  the  canning  industry.    Another  important  hydrobiological
resource is scallops rising, due to the important economic returns.  More than 50% of hydrobiological resources obtained are for sale and most of them traded
in the District of Sechura. A large number of farmers from CSMS work in artisanal fisheries in the Virrilá Estuary and the lakes Ñapique, Ramón Grande,
Ramón Chiquito, Peñal, Sánchez, La Mariposa, El Tisal, La Niña and others, where they catch a variety of fish, as well as white crayfish, crabs and shrimps.
·
Mining, Oil and Manufacture: The Province of Sechura is an area rich in non-metallic minerals with a very special value for agriculture and modern industry,
such as phosphates, brine, dolomite, gypsum, sulfur, clay and others. Likewise, sulfur deposits are located south of Cerro Illescas, 4 km from the shoreline of
the area Reventazón in Sechura Desert; also, brine deposits are located in Zapayal, Namuc and Ramón Grande basins, with estimated reserves of over
1,400 million tons. The most important activities are the following:
o
Bayóvar Phosphates Mine of Compañia Minera Miski Mayo, owned by Vale S.A., Mosaic and Mitsui & Co Ltd., this non-metallic mine is located 60 km
southwest the town of Sechura and started operations in 2010, with a total estimated reserves of 597 million tons.
o
Fosfatos del Pacífico S.A. (Fospac) company with a non-metalic phosphate mining project located close to kilometer 30 of the Bayóvar-Chiclayo highway.
This company is owned by Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. (70%) and Mitsubishi Corporation (30%). Fospac has also a modern brick plant in the Sechura
Desert that produces 50 000 tons/year of diatomite bricks.

276
Juan Paulo Quay S.A.C. (JPQ), owner of the Bayovar 12 concession, undertakes exploitation of gypsum within the claim. Shareholders of JPQ own port
facilities for the exportation of mining products, located 40 km from the Bayovar N° 12 Project.
o
Americas Potash (Growmax) is a non-metallic mining company with surface rights of 82,000 ha located in the Sechura Desert. The company acquired the
concession for brine development and entered into an agreement with CSMS for surface access right during 33 years with the possibility for an agreement
extension of up to 100 years.
o
UEA Fosyeiki holds a group of non-metallic mining concessions totaling 1 600 000 ha. At present the mining authority has only approved exploration of
phosphates on an area of 907 ha. This group on concessions are overlapping the concessions Bayóvar 13 and Bayóvar 16.
o
The final section of North Peruvian Oilpipeline crosses the Sechura Desert; it supplies oil to the Bayóvar Terminal located in Sechura Bay, from Loreto, in the
Peruvian jungle.
·
Social development: The level of social development attained in the Province of Sechura is measured using the Human Development Index (HDI) prepared
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Unsatisfied Basic Needs (UBN) approach developed by the Economic Commission for Latin
America and The Caribbean (ECLAC).  HDI in the Province of Sechura has positively evolved between 2007 and 2012, going up 15 positions in the national
ranking for above period (from position 53 to 68 at the Peruvian provinces level).  Regarding UBN, allowing determining non-monetary poverty based on the
basic needs covered by the population, it can be noticed that incidence of total poverty (households with at least one UBN) and extreme poverty (households
with two or more UBN) is 32.2% and 22.2% respectively).  The most compelling UBN in the Province of Sechura are the unsuitable physical characteristics
of housing (32.2%) and the lack of excreta disposal system (23.9%).
·
Social and political organization: Currently, the Province of Sechura is mainly driven by three institutions representing the interests of most of the provincial
population,  namely  the  Sechura  Provincial  Municipality,  CCSMS  and  the  fishermen  and  mariculture  farmers’  unions  working  in  Sechura  Bay.  The
organizations representing minor groups with specific interests are also present such as the Association of Artisanal Fishermen of the Ñapique and La Niña
Lakes, located 40-km from the project.
·
Cultural heritage: The Province of Sechura has a varied cultural and tourist heritage which combines architectonic, historic, religious and natural elements,
resulting in a Mestizo profile inherent to the province.  Pre-Hispanic archaeological and colonial infrastructure (churches) remains have been recorded. With
regards to natural richness, the province has beautiful beaches, lakes, mangrove areas and dunes which are tourist attractions.
·
Perceptions:  Regarding the mining activity, the population in the Province of Sechura perceives it as an activity creating positive and negative impacts. The
mining activity is considered positive because it offers job opportunities and contributes to streamlining the local economy through the intensification of the
commercial activity and the proliferation of different business lines. On the other hand, mining is perceived as an activity likely to affect the environment and
could entail certain damages to other pre-existing activities in the province, mainly those referred to local production activities such as agriculture, cattle
raising and fishing.
20.4
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The main Project facilities will include: pit area, tailing disposal, waste storage, process plant and auxiliary facilities (port facilities, seawater intake, and
camps). The environmental components related with these facilities are: air, noise and marine water.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
277
The most important environmental aspects in the mine area are related to the generation of particulate matter (dust) and noise generation. Main activities of
the Project include material transport and water management.  In port area, project facilities will be related with marine environmental components (aquatic
biology, oceanography).
The following potential social and environmental impacts related to the Project were identified:
·
Noise generation and air quality change: Expected due to the increased traffic, land movement and personnel. As mitigation measures, the Project shall
maintain an adequate vehicle fleet, access roads from and to the Project to avoid the generation of particulate material and gases. During operation of the
Project, atmospheric emissions will be generated from the plant facilities, access road, these sources include sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen
(NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2,5 µm (PM2,5), particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 µm
(PM10) and greenhouse gases (GHGs).  Emissions from other sources are expected to be minimal, such as material transport and ship loading, which will
be minimized by best management practices.
·
The  project  involves  a  series  of  activities  that  generate  noise.  The  main  ones  are  the  construction  of  some  infrastructure  metalworking,  transport  and
quarrying, and vehicle back-up sirens.
·
Loss  of  Soil:  Expected  due  basically  to  the  construction  of  tailing  pond;  however,  the  Project  foresees  soil  separation  into  piles  to  avoid  soil  lost  or
degradation
·
Loss of Habitat: decreased diversity and affected protected species and/or migratory birds due to the Project facilities and activities in the area. This shall be
minimized by the Project when considering the location options for their facilities, in places presenting less biodiversity.
·
Sensitive areas (national or international conservation status areas) do not exist in the Project area.  However, in the study area the existence of the Laguna
La Niña has been recorded, a body of water whose characteristics vary during the El Niño event, occupying areas with different extent. This lake is used as a
rest area for some species of migratory birds, and where the amount of water increases considerably, can become temporary source of aquatic resources for
the residents of the area.
·
Although flora and fauna are scarce and the project will have less interaction with these environmental components; two species of flora are important
“algarrobo”  Prosopis  pallida  y  “sapote”  Colicodendron  scabridum.  These  species  are  included  in  National  Category  List  (D.S  N°  043-AG  2006)  as
Vulnerable (“algarrobo”) and Critically Endangered (“sapote”).
·
Demographic effects of worker migration; to be mitigated by contracting personnel from within the area of influence of the project.
·
Traffic change in the main access roads: due to the increased road infrastructure and increased number of trucks and vehicles which shall occur mainly
during the construction phase, but during the operation phase it shall be minimized.
·
Perceptions on disturbed water quality and quantity that might arise in the minds of the local population in the province of Sechura, which shall be mitigated
by providing suitable explanation to the local people of the influenced area, regarding the activities of the Project.
·
Change in job opportunities and community infrastructure: due to the increased demand of workers and services in Project stages.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
278
·
Increased budget of the district, province and regional governments: due to increased incomes related to tax collection to be paid by the Project.
·
The  port  activities  could  impact  traditional  fishing  activities  and  mariculture.  This  activity  is  one  of  the  main  economic  activities  in  the  Bay  of  Sechura,
specifically in Puerto Rico. This activity is performed on the seabed by use of cages. Currently, in Puerto Rico marine farmers associations and population
exploit natural resources located in the bay.
20.5
REQUIREMENTS AND MANAGEMENT PLANS
Focus will implement prevention, mitigation and rehabilitation measures, related with the features and activities of the project and potential impacts. All these
measures  will  be  included  in  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP).  The  EMP  comprises  individual  plans  that  outline  the  scope  of  environmental
management in order to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and Focus policies.
For the design, construction, operation and closure of Project, it will be applied the following criteria:
·
Archaeological  Sites:  Where  feasible,  avoidance  of  terrestrial  and  marine  archaeological  monuments.  If  monuments  cannot  be  avoided,  adherence  to
regulatory protocols for protection and/or rescue.
·
Protected Areas: Avoidance of direct Project footprint effects to nearby protected areas and avoidance or minimization of indirect effects (e.g. marine water
quality, air quality).
·
Wildlife  Species  of  Conservation  Status:  Avoidance  of  direct  mortality,  destruction  of  habitats  and  indirect  effects  to  species  with  conservation  status,
including Peruvian and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) designated species.
·
Key Wildlife Habitats: Avoidance or minimization of direct and indirect impacts to key wildlife habitats (e.g., reproductive and migratory habitats).
·
Visual Aesthetics: Avoidance or minimization of visual aesthetic impacts to sensitive viewing receptors, including nearby protected areas and populated
areas.
·
Natural and Industrial Risks: to establish Project design parameters, to minimize impacts on environmental, public health and safety, associated with natural
and industrial hazards.
·
Oceanography and Coastal Morphology: to the extent practical, the seawater intake will be buried to minimize effects to coastal morphology.
·
Freshwater: Water is recycled into the process where practical and appropriate. The discharge of untreated wastewater, industrial water, spill, drainage,
residual industrial liquids and solids into the marine environment, is prohibited unless it meets applicable water quality standards for discharge. The RO
brine is recycled into the Seawater Supply Ponds and is not discharged to the surface.
An environmental quality standard (EQS) is defined in Peru as the measure that sets the concentration or degree of elements, substances or physical,
chemical and biological parameters present in the air, water or soil, when acting as a receptor body, which does not represent a significant risk for the health
of persons or the environment.  Depending on the particular parameter being referred to, the concentration or degree can be expressed as maximums,
minimums or ranges.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
279
According to Peruvian law, EQSs are mandatory for use in the design of legal standards and public policies.  In addition, EQSs are for mandatory reference
in the design and application of all environmental management instruments (such as environmental impact assessments).
Likewise, Peruvian law provides that environmental certification cannot be granted through the National Environmental Impact Assessment System, in any
case in which the related environmental impact assessment concludes that the implementation of the activity involved will lead to non-compliance with an
EQS.
Environmental Management Measures
·
It’s estimated to be used 23 trucks making 4 loads per day in a 12-hour shift.  Thus, a particulate matter emission control will be performed, through irrigation
in  areas  with  potential  dust  emission.    Also  it  will  be  implemented  humid  management  and  coverage  systems  for  concentrate  and  quarries  materials
transportation, and for concentrate shipment.
·
Noise damping systems will be implemented for power equipment.
·
Dewatering volumes will be maintained within design forecasts, so as not affect groundwater levels in the surrounding area.
·
Residual waters from pit dewatering will be discharged in tailing facilities.  Rain water collected in the open pit will be collected in one or several in-pit
pump(s), until there is enough quantity to pump it out to the surface where it will be piped into the tailings line and out to the tailings pond.
·
Runoff management for the Project will consider enabling protection dam (to protect the pit area) and derivation channels.
·
In order to avoid impacts on groundwater quality, it should consider factors of soil permeability for liquid effluents disposal in the facilities like tailings deposit.
·
To control, collect, and treat water that comes into contact with project industrial activity.
·
Water  intake  facilities  will  include  electric  vertical  turbine  pumps  that  are  mounted  on  JPQ’s  port  ship  loading  conveyor,  and  process  waste  (“brine”  o
salmuera”) will be disposal inside tailing pond.
·
Waste generated from mining will be stored in both external pit (ex-pit) and internal (in-pit) waste storage facility (WSF). An ex-pit waste storage facility WSF
adjacent to the mine pit has been designed to store mine waste as the mine pit is developed.
·
The  in-pit  backfilling  process  will  be  implemented  when  the  WSF  reaches  maximum  capacity  and  or  when  sufficient  space  within  the  mined  out  pit  is
created.
Monitoring Plan
Focus will develop a monitoring plan in order to monitor and control environmental performance of the Project on compliance with Peruvian environmental
standards. In order to control emissions and effluents related with air, noise and water, it must comply with the maximum permissible limits (MPL) for Mining-
Metallurgical activities.
The monitoring plan will include:
·
Air and Noise: environmental quality standards in main receptors.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
·
Marine Water Quality: environmental quality standards in port area.
·
Flora and Fauna:  abundance, richness and diversity for key species.
·
Marine Biology: abundance, richness and diversity for key species.

20.6
SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS, PLANS AND AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES
According  the  “Guide  of  Community  Relations”  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining  (MINEM,  by  Spanish  acronym),  it  is  necessary  design  a
Community Relations Plan (CRP), that contents all the measures required for the social management in a project. The main objective of this plan is to
regulate and fortify the relations between communities and enterprises, and to manage potential social issues.
The measures of social management should consider the development of communities, beyond the useful life of mine, and the principles of participation,
sustainability and synergy. The programs proposed will be developed, if possible, through agreements with local communities and authorities, in order to
guarantee their sustainability. On the other hand, the participation of population is also a requirement for CRP to improve the local capabilities.
20.6.1
Social Programs
Focus will implement a set a social programs that includes communication, training, education and health as main action lines, during the construction and
operation phases of the Project.
The preliminaries social programs are the following:
·
Program of communication and information.
·
Program of environmental training.
·
Program of fishermen training.
·
Program of support sporting activities.
·
Program of education support.
·
Program of health support.
The estimated amount of inversion for those programs is US$ 3,150,000, which will be distributed over 20 years.
20.6.2
Agreements with Local Communities
The  Comunidad  Campesino  San  Martín  de  Sechura  (CCSMS)  owns  the  surface  rights  of  Bayovar  N°  12  Concession.  An  agreement  signed  in  2009
between  Juan  Paulo  Quay  S.A.C.  (JPQ)  and  this  community  grants  surface  land  use  and  access  rights  to  JPQ,  in  order  to  develop  the  Project.  The
agreement includes the respective payment and other duties from JPQ, and the commitment of CCSMS to provide and maintain an adequate social context
to Project development, as well as to work together with the Company promoting a sustainable development for both community and Project.
20.7
CONCEPTUAL CLOSURE PLAN
The conceptual closure plan will be prepared according the requirements of the Law N° 28090, Law that regulate the mining closure and its regulation (D.S.
N° 033-2005-EM).
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
281
The closure plan considers decommissioning and demolition of facilities that can be removed completely from the site (buildings, tubes, etc.), and not going
to play any role in the post-closure. For those permanent facilities that will be on the site but without any further use, the plan includes the closing and
conditioning in order to minimize the risks to public health and safety and to the environment.
20.7.1
Objectives
The main objectives of the closure plan, according the Peruvian regulation, are the following:
·
Safeguarding of the health and safety of individuals;
·
physical, chemical and biological stability of the areas disturbed by mining operations;
·
future land use;
·
protection of courses and bodies of surface and groundwater;
·
minimizing landscape and visual impacts;  and
·
Minimizing socioeconomic impacts of mine closure.
20.7.2
Closure Criteria
The conceptual closure considers the following general criteria:
·
To comply with current legal requirements and best international practices.
·
Remnant process solutions post-closure will be left in a state that requires minimal maintenance and passive care.
·
Where possible, it will be prioritized the transfer of usable facilities to communities or to the Government, at time of final closure.
·
Where possible, a progressive closure of facilities will be undertaken, during the operation phase of the Project.
Additionally, it is necessary to includes some specifically closure criteria regarding safety, geotechnical stability in the long-term (security factors), design of
hydraulic infrastructure, chemical stability, quality water and soil, biological stability, future land use, among others aspects.

Activities of Closure
Activities of Open Pit Closure
·
282
Demolition and dismantling: All the infrastructure presents in the pit will be removed or demolished.  The waste disposal will be according a plan of waste
management.
·
Physical stability: The pit will be largely infilled with the waste material extracted during its exploitation, to reflect where possible, the initial topography of the
area.
·
Hydrological stability:  The drainage channels will not be dismantled at the closure; during the post-closure phase the hydrological assessment of these
channels will continue in order to determine the possibility of remediation.
·
Land use: The land use will be similar to the extent practical to pre-mining conditions, as will the final topography will be also like before mining.
·
Revegetation: It is not planned any measure of revegetation, due to the scarcity of vegetation in the area.
Activities of Tailings Storage Facility Closure
·
Demolition  and  dismantling:    Pipelines  and  other  installations  will  be  removed  or  demolished.  The  waste  will  disposal  according  a  plan  of  waste
management.
·
Physical stability:  Rehabilitation measures include the drainage and filling of this facility with selected surface material on level surfaces and shaped.  The
purpose of placing the cover material is selected to minimize the potential for surface water infiltration. Additional or alternative rehabilitation measures could
also be implemented in the detailed closure plan.
·
Hydrological stability: The drains or sewers in the area of TSF will be dismantled during the closure, in order to restore the natural flow of rain water.
·
Chemical stability: The materials stored in the pit are not potentially acid-rock generating, so they will not need a waterproof cover.
·
Land use: The land use will be similar to the initial condition, because the topography will be also like before mining to the extent practical.
·
Reclamation: It is not planned any measure of revegetation, due to the vegetation is scarce in the area.
Activities of Waste Storage Facility Closure
·
Demolition and dismantling: Not applicable.

·
Physical stability:  Contouring the surface of the dump, with an adequate slope and considering the security factors of design.
·
Chemical stability: The waste is not Potential Acid Generator (No PAG), therefore the chemical stability will be guaranteed only with the corresponding
physical stability.
·
Land use: The land use will be similar to the initial condition.
·
Reclamation: It is not planned any measure of revegetation, due to the vegetation is scarce in the area.
Activities of Processing Plant and Water Treatment Plant Closure
·
Demolition and dismantling: The plants will be dismantled; this shall include the removal of equipment and material from the main and auxiliary facilities in
order to fulfill the closure objectives. In general, the dismantling of facilities will consist of activities that are described below:
o
Removal, transfer or sale of equipment and concentrator plant materials. The necessary equipment will be left to implement the post-closure activities.
o
Removal of buildings or structures.  The necessary buildings and structures will be left to implement the post-closure activities.
o
Purging, cleaning and removal of tanks, pipelines and process systems.
o
De-energized and removal of power lines that are not necessary for the post-closure.
o
All water management facilities such as pumping systems, piping, tanks, etc., will be dismantled.
o
Bypass channels will be not dismantled at the end: during the post-closure phase a hydrological assessment thereof will determine its dismantling.
o
Withdrawal, transfer or sale of all reactive chemicals or substances that are in laboratories or respective warehouses.
·
Physical stability: demolition and dismantling activities will leave a stable ground physically. Only is considered a leveling off the ground areas.
·
Chemical stability: as part of the decommissioning, there will be potentially areas that could have been impregnated with oil.  These areas will be recovered.
To do this, once removed the structures, sampling and testing shall be carried out to determine the condition of the soils. Impregnated soils will be excavated
and disposed in places authorized through EPS-RS. The excavated areas will be filled with clean natural soils.
·
Land use: at the end of the closing activities, the area where the plant was will have similar conditions to the environment and the use of the land would be
similar to the environment condition.
Activities of Water Intake Facilities Closure
·
Demolition and dismantling: Pipelines, pumps and installations that are part of the seawater intake system will be purged and then dismantled.
·
Physical  and  chemical  stability:  These  conditions  will  be  feasible  after  the  dismantling  and  demolition  of  the  bases,  the  terrain  will  be  physically  and
chemically stable.
M3-PN140103

·
Land use: The area of these facilities will recover the similar condition of the environment.
Activities of Electricity Facilities Closure
·
284
The transmission line will be not dismantled at the closure; during the post closure an evaluation will determine if is required its dismantling.
Social Programs
Social  programs  will  be  developed  as  part  of  the  closure  plan,  and  shall  be  framed  within  community  relations  projects.  These  programs  could  be  the
following:
·
Temporary work program, to promote and generate job opportunities with the aim of improving the income of the local families located within the area of
direct influence of the closure plan, and contributing to improve their living conditions.  The population also notes that the hiring of unskilled labor must be
maximized locally and through communal policy for more transparent information on available jobs and its corresponding duration.
·
Training program for environmental monitoring, this program seeks to create local community awareness in about the importance and need to manage and
conserve natural resources. If communities are aware of environmental issues from its scope it can motivate them to implement policies and actions to
preserve the environment during operations of project closure and rehabilitation of areas disturbed by mining activities.
20.7.5
Maintenance and Monitoring Post-Closure
In the phase of post-closure it is necessary to assure that, where possible, the closure measures recover the initial conditions of the Project area; therefore,
the maintenance and monitoring programs will permit to assess the effectivity of closure activities and to identify potential issues in order to apply  corrective
actions if will be required.
Maintenance Post-Closure
In the post-closure the facilities are subject to conditions of technical abandonment, passive or active care.
·
The activities of passive and active care that are considered in the post-closure are as follows:
·
Inspections of stability waste dump and tailings storage facility, according to a timetable and procedures defined;
·
inspections of the physical stability of the pit;
·
inspections of buildings and infrastructure remaining in the post-closure;
·
inspections water supply systems;
·
access control to areas to prevent disruption of operations and post-closure to protect the public;  and
·
Schedule and procedures of inspection and control will be defined during the final rehabilitation.
Additionally, specific contingency plans will be developed, as following:
·
instability detection for waste dump and tailings storage facility;
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
·
fault detection channels or water pipe systems;
285
·
detection of changes in the quality of surface and groundwater; and
·
Leak detection
Monitoring Post-Closure
For those components that are not an anticipated risk, it will be defined a preliminary post-closure monitoring, estimated by five years, according to the
minimum period stablished by Peruvian legislation.
This program could include the following aspects:
·
Monitoring of physical stability, for example in order to verify periodically, the possible differential settlements on the slopes of the waste rock dump.
·
Biological monitoring, to look after the integrity of the vegetation and soil.
·
Social  monitoring,  to  evaluate  the  results  concerning  the  activities  implemented  as  part  of  social  programs,  according  to  the  indicators  in  each  of  the
programs and mainly based on an assessment of conditions in the post-closure.

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
286
The estimated capital expenditure or capital costs (CAPEX) for the Bayovar 12 Project consists of two components:
(1) The initial CAPEX to design, permit, pre-strip, construct, and commission the mine, plant facilities, ancillary facilities, and utilities. The initial CAPEX also
includes indirect costs for engineering, construction management, and Owner’s costs.
(2)  The  sustaining  CAPEX  for  facilities  expansions,  mining  equipment  replacements,  expected  replacements  of  process  equipment  and  ongoing
environmental mitigation activities;
The capital cost estimates reported in this section address the construction of a phosphate beneficiation plant capable of producing one million tonnes of
RPR concentrate (dry basis) from two process lines at full production.

MINE CAPEX AND OPEX
IMC estimated the mine operating and capital costs of phosphorite ore production, overburden and interburden waste mining to produce 1.0 mtpy of DAPR
products on an annual basis. The mine cost model assumes the pre-production to be at Year -1 and that all pre-mining overburden stripping, interburden
waste mining and phosphorite ore mining (stockpiled and processed during Year 1) are capitalized. All mining activities will be performed by Focus using
company-owned  equipment  and  company  employees.  The  IMC  estimates  encompassed  all  costs  associated  with  mining  activities,  phosphorite  and
overburden handling, phosphorite stockpile processing, and other mine support services required for the delivery of phosphorite ore to the beneficiation
plant. Capital expenditures incorporate all
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
287
mobile mining equipment costs, but exclude costs associated with infrastructure development such as ROM stockpile, maintenance facilities, offices, wash
house, worker camps, warehouse and storage, fuel storage and islands, and so forth. These infrastructure capital expenditures are provided by M3. The cost
estimates associated with processing and other activities after the phosphorite is delivered to the hopper are provided by other parties (M3/Focus) as well as
overhead, or indirect, processing operating costs. The cost model included costs for ongoing back-filling and reclamation of the open pit during the 20 years
of operation, but did not take into account the expenses after closure (e.g. final reclamation and re-vegetation, building and infrastructure demolition, and haul
road re-grade).
The  project  economic  analysis  was  conducted  by  M3  with  inputs  from  Focus  and  other  experts  and  consultants  identified  earlier,  including  Gruber  for
beneficiation  yield  and  M3  for  estimates  of  infrastructure  design  and  OPEX/CAPEX  costs  of  all  activities  past  the  plant  feed  hopper.  IMC  did  not
independently verify the accuracy of these third party estimates and costs.
The  cost  model  reflects  zero-based  principles  for  each  year  of  production.  The  annual  mine  operating  costs  are  estimated  by  combining  the  annual
production statistics from the mine plan with the estimated equipment productivities, utilizations, and mine operating schedules. All operating and capital cost
estimates assume Focus owning 100 percent equity of the Project. The estimate therefore represents the costs that Focus would incur in purchasing the
required equipment and staffing the mining operation to meet the mine plan and production schedule.
For the purposes of this Study, the following costs to supply as input into the financial model:
·
Direct mine operating costs: Labor, materials, and supplies
·
Indirect mine costs (overhead): To support mining only
·
Capital expenditures: All capital costs required to purchase the equipment necessary to operate the mine.
·
Non-cash costs: Non-cash costs were not provided and will be developed by M3
Specific equipment suppliers are referenced within the capital cost estimates. The use of these equipment suppliers in the model does not represent a
recommendation from IMC that Focus use these suppliers. Equipment suppliers’ names represent only the equipment sizes and capacities typically used
within the mining industry, simplifying cost estimation and documentation.
All costs and dollar amount referenced in this Study are expressed in terms of First Quarter 2016 US dollars (USD).
LOM unit costs for each of the for each of the three mined volumes and the LOM mining cost per tonne ore are summarized in Table 21-3.

Direct Mining Costs
21.1.1.1
Direct Mine Operating Costs – Overview
288
Direct mine-operating costs include the required labor, and supply, and materials costs based on the mine plan schedule. Labor costs include wages for
annual production, maintenance and support employees, and salaries for mine administration and supervisory staffs.
IMC used the Golder developed wage information (from the December 18, 2015 Pre-Feasibility Study) for labor calculations, including payroll burdens (e.g.
payroll taxes and fringe benefits) that are typical for this region in Peru. Supply and materials costs include expenditures necessary for operating equipment
and  infrastructure,  including  costs  for  consumables,  tires,  repair  parts,  and  other  miscellaneous  operating  supplies.  A  zero-based  budgeting  approach
estimated labor and materials costs in developing the cost model. The estimates of the quantity of labor and materials necessary to fulfill the requirements of
the mine plan became the basis of all cost estimates.
For this Study, operating costs associated with initial overburden pre-stripping and ore mined during Year -1, and costs associated with material placement
for the pit protection berm and TSF embankments are capitalized.
The direct operating costs are developed for the following unit operations of the mining activities:
·
Loading: operating, maintenance and labor to load overburden and  interburden with front end loaders, and interburden and phosphorite ore with surface
miners
·
Hauling:  operating,  maintenance  and  labor  to  haul  ore  to  the  plant;  overburden  and  interburden  to  the  ex-pit  and  in-pit  WSFs;  overburden  to  TSF
embankment construction
·
Auxiliary: operating, maintenance and labor to operate support equipment in the pit, WSFs and road construction and maintenance
·
General Mine: includes truck dispatch and general labor personnel, cost for pit dewatering, road base materials, software licences, minor equipment (eg
pickup trucks, light plants, etc.) operating costs and departmental costs,
·
General Maintenance: includes warehouse, fuel and lube, tire and general maintenance personnel, small equipment repair and general departmental costs,
·
Mine G&A: includes supervision, engineering and geology staff costs and allocation for VS&A.
Drilling and blasting costs are not included as the adjacent operating mines in the same rock formations have demonstrated that the material is free digging
and  blasting  is  not  required.    Pit  dewatering,  surface  water  controls,  and  pumping  activities  are  included  under  general  mine  operating  expenses  even
though their occurrence is intermittent as a response to major events such as El Niño; these costs are not incurred as daily operational expenses.
Phosphorite ore processing encompasses the costs to handle ore between the point haul trucks deliver plant feed to the plant feed hopper and/or the ROM
stockpile and are the responsibility of M3. The costs associated with all activities downstream of the plant feed hopper (i.e., beneficiation process, water and
power supply costs, transporting the product from the plant, load-out to an offsite location, port costs, and so forth) are the responsibility of M3 and Focus.
21.1.1.2
Direct Mine Operating Costs – Labor
IMC estimated mine operating labor requirements based on the level of equipment usage dictated by the mine plan. IMC allotted maintenance labor, support
labor,  mine  administration,  and  supervisory  staff  to  adequately  support  production  activities  and  to  facilitate  effective  mine  operations.  Manpower
requirements necessary for the operation of primary production equipment (such as surface miners, front end loaders, haul trucks, bulldozers, and graders)
were based on the respective equipment operating shifts derived using established equipment scheduling parameters.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
289
Maintenance and support labor and mine supervisory and administrative personnel were assigned as deemed necessary to adequately support production.
The mine operations are scheduled on a seven-day per week, two twelve (12) hour shifts per day basis using four crews. IMC incorporated non-working day
assumptions for paid holiday and vacation and shutdown due to bad weather. The mine is assumed to operate 360 days per year (365 total days per year
less an assumed 5 days of mine shutdown due to the rain events).
Total labor cost comprises wages for mine operation employees and salaries for supervisory and administrative personnel. Annual wage rates and salaries
were based on typical labor rates in Peru’s mining industry (collected by Golder for the previous Pre-Feasibility Study). Higher pay-grade categories were
assigned  to  maintenance  personnel  and  equipment  operators  having  greater  skill  level  or  work  responsibility.  General  laborers  or  lower  responsibility
personnel filled lower pay grade categories. Total costs including burden and benefits formed the yearly equivalent of the base rate charges. Staff salaries
were estimated using base salaries deemed competitive within the region.  Both hourly labor and salaried staff have a 35% burden applied to the base rate
in order to develop the total labor cost to the project.  Table 21-3 lists the annual wage rates for salaried mine administration and supervisory staff for Peru.
 Table 21-4 lists the annual salaries for mine operators and maintenance staff.

Direct Mine Operating Costs – Material & Supply
The material and supply component of the direct mine operating cost represent the expenses incurred for equipment such as fuel, lubricants, rubber tires,
repair/replacement parts and non-equipment operating supplies including maintenance supplies plus other miscellaneous general mine items.
Annual equipment operating supply requirements were estimated on a cost per machine’s engine-hour basis. Note that an engine-hour is herein defined as
a scheduled hour adjusted for non-consuming mechanical and scheduled non-working time to reflect the portion of total scheduled time that a piece of
equipment is consuming operating supplies. The unit cost for diesel fuel (US$0.75/litre) was supplied by Focus.  The cost for tires, lubricants, wear parts and
repair parts are based on the costs of running the same or similar machines from the IMC data base.
21.1.1.4
Direct Mine Operating Costs – Equipment Hourly Rates
Equipment hourly operating costs are a function of the estimated hourly consumption or usage of fuel, lubricants, rubber tires, filters, and repair/replacement
parts.  Estimated  consumption  rates  of  fuel  and  lubricants  for  individual  pieces  of  equipment  were  based  on  manufacturer/dealer  specifications  and
guidelines, engineering estimates, and actual operating data on file at IMC. Where applicable, the total hourly cost of operating various types of equipment
was determined by applying unit consumable costs to equipment usage estimates. Other elements included in determining
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
291
the hourly operating cost estimate for each equipment type were hourly tire costs, undercarriage costs, and rebuild and replacement costs. Hourly tire costs
for  rubber-tired  equipment  are  based  on  the  estimated  tire  lives.  Equipment  hourly  repair/replacement  and  filter  costs  reflect  manufacturer/dealer  cost
information and engineering estimates based on IMC’s experience.
The annual operating costs for major mining equipment was estimated by multiplying the operating shifts derived for a particular piece of equipment (see
Section 16.8) in a given year by the respective machine operating cost per shift. Operating hours for major production equipment (e.g. front end loaders,
surface  miners,  haul  trucks,  dozers,  and  graders)  are  a  function  of  the  scheduled  material  volumes  or  tonnages  to  be  moved  and  estimated  equipment
production rates. Support equipment was assigned as deemed necessary to facilitate an effective mining operation.
Table 21-6 summaries the estimate of the operating cost per shift for the major mining equipment.  Table 21-7 shows the development of these costs for the
front-end loader, surface miner and haul trucks as these are the majority of the mine mobile equipment fleet.

Direct Mine Operating Costs – Summary
292
The LOM mine operating costs are summarized in Table 21-8 by the major areas of parts and consumables and labor. Table 21-8 shows the costs by the
cost categories described in section 21.1.1. The costs for loading, hauling and auxiliary include the cost of the machines assigned to the category for fuel,
tires, repair parts, wear items, the maintenance labor to maintain the machine and the operator.  Table 21-8 shows the total cost for each year.  The Year -1
(pre-production) is included in both tables but the costs will be capitalized.  The direct mine operating costs do not include the contractor’s cost for the
compaction of the TSF embankments, but does include the haulage of the overburden waste from the pit to the embankment.  The cost of final reclamation,
other than the on-going dump management during the delivery of the waste to the storage locations is not included in the direct mine operating costs.

21.1.2
Indirect Mining Costs
294
Indirect mine operating costs are those costs incurred by the mining operation and not directly attributable to the production of phosphorite. Indirect costs
usually include the following: property and liability insurance, permitting fees, bonding, engineering consulting fees, exploration drilling, legal and auditing
fees,  freight  and  postage  fees,  communications  fees,  government  and  environmental  relations  fees,  lab  sampling  and  quality  control,  employee-related
training, industry dues, royalty costs, and other miscellaneous expenses. These costs are not included in the mine operational estimates.
21.1.3
Mine Capital Expenditure
IMC estimated the mine capital expenditures for mobile mine equipment required to achieve the mine production schedule. Table 21-9 is a summary of the
mine capital and operating costs by year. The initial capital for Year -1 includes $91.06 million of equipment purchases and $41.18 million for the pre-
production mining.
The unit cost for the equipment was provided by EMG Mining Consultants from its global pricing database as of 2016 quarter 1.  EMG is a major equipment
procurement company and has global pricing agreements with most mining equipment manufacturers. Table 21-10 shows the unit prices for the equipment
included in the mine capital cost estimate. The costs include freight, assembly, training and tires for the mobile equipment.
The detail for the capital expenditures for the major and support equipment by year is shown on Table 21-11. The total capital by year includes 3% of the
major equipment purchases allocation for shop tools, a 5% allocation for initial spare parts and a 5% contingency of the prices for all mining equipment.
Equipment was scheduled to be replaced or rebuilt when the estimated operating hours for that particular piece of equipment approached or exceeded the
designated machine service life. This is necessary when equipment eventually becomes unserviceable and/or non-functional during the normal course of
operations. Where possible, IMC used major equipment rebuilds to extend the effective lives of the loaders, haul trucks and, water truck. The front-end
loaders were replaced at the end of the first round of useful life (Year 8), but re-built at the second round in Year 16. The dozers and graders were always
replaced. Table 21-12 shows the major mining equipment units being purchased, replaced or re-built (rebuild cost assumed to be half of the purchase price).
The upper table is the purchased or replaced equipment.  After Year 4, the purchases are replacements with the exception of the two haul trucks in Year 16
which are additions to the fleet. In Year 18, there are 21 haul trucks being re-built, this will be spread over several years in the Feasibility Study. The dozer
replacement schedule continues to Year 19 at the request of FOCUS in order to have sufficient dozer capacity to complete the reclamation at closure.

Non-Cash Costs – Depreciation and Final Reclamation Accrual
299
Non-cash costs include the depreciation charges expensed, in accordance with cost accounting practices, to compensate for the decline in value of capital
items over time and these will be developed by M3 and Focus.
For  final  reclamation,  the  costs  are  cover  the  re-grading  of  the  areas  affected  by  the  mining  operation  to  a  stable  configuration.  These  costs  were  not
developed by IMC and are the responsibility of M3.
21.2
PLANT CAPEX AND OPEX
21.2.1
PLANT CAPEX
The initial capital cost includes the development of the mine, the engineering and construction of the process plant, the ancillary facilities, a 138 kV power
transmission line from La Niña substation, the 45-km seawater supply line for process water, ponds, a small desalination facility, and the first phase of the
Tailings Storage Facility (TSF).
The process plant has been designed to produce 1,000,000 tonnes per annum of combined 24% P2O5 DAPR and 28% P2O5 DAPRstarting in Year 1. The
initial  plant  capital  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $95.6  million  which  includes  20%  contingency  but  does  not  include  mining  capital,  pre-stripping  costs,  TSF
embankment costs, Owner’s cost or IGV.
Initial CAPEX includes an estimate of contingency based on the accuracy and level of detail of the cost estimate.  The purpose of the contingency provision
is to make allowance for uncertain cost elements which are predicted to occur, but are not included in the cost estimate.  These cost elements include
uncertainties concerning completeness and accuracy of material takeoffs, accuracy of labor and material rates, accuracy of labor productivity expectations,
and accuracy of equipment pricing.
Battery limits for the process plant starts at the ROM stockpile to TSF pipeline discharge, including power transmission to the site and power distribution at
the site, the seawater supply pipeline, and pumping costs. M3’s scope also includes ancillary buildings such as the security building, administration building,
cafeteria, change house, truck shop, truck wash, plant maintenance building, warehouse, laboratory, medical building and fuel stations.
The primary assumptions used to develop the CAPEX are provided below:
·
All cost estimates were developed and are reported in United States of America (US) dollars.
·
Qualified and experienced construction contractors will be available at the time of project execution.
·
Borrow sources are available within the Project boundary.
·
Weather related delays in construction are not accounted for in the estimate.
21.2.1.1
Currency
The  estimate  is  expressed  in  1st  quarter  2016  United  States  dollars.  No  provision  has  been  included  to  offset  future  escalation.  No  funds  have  been
allocated in the estimate to offset potential currency fluctuations. No provision has been made for currency fluctuations.
21.2.1.2
Estimate Exclusions
Items not included in the M3 capital estimate are as follows:
·
Sunk costs;
·
Allowance for special incentives (schedule, safety, etc.);
·
Reclamation costs (included in financial analysis);
·
Escalation beyond 1st Quarter 2016;
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
·
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
·
Interest and financing cost.
300
Risk due to political upheaval, government policy changes, labor disputes, permitting delays, weather delays or any other force majeure occurrences are
also excluded.
21.2.1.3
Accuracy
The estimate has been developed to a level sufficient to assess/evaluate the project concept, various development options and the overall project viability.
After inclusion of the recommended contingency, the capital cost estimate is considered to have a level of accuracy in the range of -20%/+20%.
21.2.1.4
Plant Equipment
All  major  plant  equipment  was  investigated  for  this  prefeasibility  study.    Flowsheets  and  Metsim  mass  balance  reports  in  conjunction  with  a  variety  of
testwork results, led to a process design criteria (PDC) for the Bayovar 12 Project.  Pricing was solicited from qualified vendors for the following equipment:
·
ROM feed bin and reclaim feeder
·
Plant conveyors
·
Drum washer
·
Attrition cells
·
Hydrocyclones and hydrosizer
·
Vibrating screens
·
Concentrate belt vacuum filter
·
Concentrate rotary dryer, off-gas handling, and dust collection
·
Bucket elevators for concentrate handling
·
Slurry and seawater pumps
·
Desalination reverse osmosis plant
·
Pump barge
·
Water intake system
·
Main substation transformer and switchgear
·
Field erected and shop fabricated tankage and silos
·
Fuel storage for diesel and LNG
Other ancillary pieces of equipment at the site have been costed using historical equipment pricing of similar size and duty from recent M3 studies and
EPCM projects.
·
Dust collectors
·
Air compressors, receivers, and air dryers
·
Slurry samplers
Commodity pricing was solicited from several suppliers for the following:
·
Structural steel
·
Mechanical steel and platework
·
Concrete
M3-PN140103

·
HDPE pipe materials
21.2.1.5
Material Quantities
301
Discipline engineers developed material take-off quantities (MTO’s) for earthworks, concrete, steel, architectural, long piping runs, and electrical based on
general arrangement drawings, civil site plans and single line drawings developed for the Project. In-plant piping and instrumentation and controls were
factored for the estimate according to historical factors.
21.2.1.6
Pricing Methodology
The capital estimate is built up by cost centers as defined by the project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and by prime commodity accounts, which include
earthwork, concentrate, structural steel, mechanical equipment (including plate work), piping, electrical and instrumentation.
The estimate is based on the assumption that equipment and materials will be purchased on a competitive basis and installation contracts will be awarded in
defined packages on either a time and materials basis or as lump sum contracts.
Below is a discussion of how the estimating methodologies have been applied within the commodity groups.
21.2.1.7
Labor Productivity
Installation hours are based on United States standard rates for the lower 48 states and have been adjusted with productivity factors for working in the
Peruvian  Coastal  region  at  low  altitude.  The  productivity  factors  were  developed  using  historical  data  from  similar  projects  in  the  region,  as  well  as
comparing man-hours provided by local contractors with the U.S. standards.
Overall, the labor man-hours reflect a 2.0 times decrease in productivity from U.S. standards to account for longer workday/workweek, general workforce skill
level, the extent of manual production and the climate at the site.
21.2.1.8
Labor Rates
Labor rates were provided for various trades and skill levels using information from recent historical projects in Peru. Construction rates were examined by
Humberto Montes, an in-country project consultant to FCV and then modified to include overtime, supervision, and other overhead considerations.
The wage rates used reflect a 50-hour work week with construction 7 days off. Labor rates do not cover contractor field indirect costs including: mobilization
and demobilization, temporary facilities, temporary utilities, testing services, and construction equipment. These items are included with the construction
indirect cost.
Average construction crew rates have been developed for each commodity type from the labor information by blending appropriate labor and skill levels to
derive reasonable crew mixes.
21.2.1.9
Buildings
The structural components (civil, concrete & steel) for the process ancillary buildings have been based on material take-offs (MTOs).  Architectural finishes,
plumbing, and electrical additions were factored on a square meter basis.
Process plant building costs are included in the overall cost of the plant area in which they fall. Table 21-14 lists the capital costs of onsite ancillary facilities.

Tailings Storage Facility Capex
The TSF embankment will be constructed with ROM waste material from the open pit excavation and overburden waste will be hauled and dumped at the
TSF as part of the mine operating costs. Thus the only costs attributed to the tailings TSF will be the spreading, moisture conditioning and compaction of the
fill. Other costs for the TSF construction will be the protection of the downstream slope of the TSF to prevent erosion during flood events and the cost of
constructing spillways.
The capital cost of the 20-year mine life TSF layout as shown on Figure 16-1 are provided in Section 16.  To reduce the initial capital cost, the TSF will be
constructed in two stages. Stage 1 has a surface area of 4.4 Mm2 and accommodates the tailings deposition rate during Years 1 through 5.  Stage 2 has a
surface area of 4.4 Mm2 providing a total surface area of 8.8 Mm2 and accommodate tailings deposition, storm water and pit seepage through Year 20. The
existing topographic base survey has a contour interval of 5 meters and a more detailed topographic survey will be required when the earthwork quantity
estimates are updated at feasibility level.
Earthwork costs were developed based on a budget cost estimate provided by Stracom GyM (a Peruvian contractor) dated October 2015. The unit rates of
$0.27/m2 for foundation preparation and $2.77/m3 for the embankment construction were applied to the two stages of the embankment construction. The
total  cost  included  a  contractor  indirect  cost  of  18.70%  and  allocations  have  been  added  for  camp  costs  plus  mobilization  and  de-mobilization  of  the
contractor’s equipment.  An erosion control geotextile will be placed on the downstream out slope of the tailings TSF.  Costs for the erosion control, spillways
and monitor wells have not been included in the updated PFS but will be addressed in the Feasibility Study.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
22.1
INTRODUCTION
The financial evaluation presents the determination of the Net Present Value (NPV), payback period (time in years to recapture the initial capital investment),
and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the project. Annual cash flow projections were estimated over the life of the mine (LOM) based on the estimates of
capital  expenditures  and  production  cost  and  sales  revenue.  The  sales  revenue  is  based  on  the  production  of  phosphate  ore.  The  estimates  of  capital
expenditures and site production costs have been developed specifically for this project and have been presented in earlier sections of this report.
22.1.1
Mine Production Statistics
Mine production is reported as ore and overburden from both the mining operation. The annual production figures were obtained from the mine plan as
reported earlier in this report.

Capital Expenditure
22.1.3.1
Initial Capital
The financial indicators have been determined with equity financing for the initial capital. Any acquisition cost or expenditures prior to start of the full project
period have been treated as “sunk” cost and have not been included in the analysis.
The total initial capital carried in the financial model for new construction and pre-production mine development is expended over a 2-year period. The initial
capital includes Owner’s costs and contingency. The cash flow will be expended in the years before production.
The initial capital is presented in Table 22-3.

22.1.3.4
Salvage Value
An allowance for salvage value has been included in the cash flow analysis of approximately $10.0 million. Most of the salvage value is tied to salvaging the
seawater and tailings pipelines for re-use of HDPE, for resale of ancillary buildings, and for steel salvage. The process equipment itself will have limited
value after 20 years of continuous usage.
22.1.3.5
Revenue
Annual revenue is determined by applying phosphate prices to the annual product by grade for each operating year. Sales prices have been applied to all
life of mine production without escalation or hedging.  Prices used in the evaluation are as follows:
·
Phosphate Ore  - 24% DAPR
$145.00/tonne
·
Phosphate Ore – 28% RPF
$185.00/tonne
22.1.4
Total Production Cost
The life of mine Production Cost is estimated to be $69.83 per tonne of product being sold, excluding the cost of the capitalized pre-stripping. The Production
Cost  includes  mine  operations,  process  plant  operations,  general  administrative  cost,  corporate  overhead,  shipping  charges,  royalties,  and
closure/reclamation and salvage value. Table 22-5 shows the estimated production cost by area per metric ton of product sold.

Figure 4-2 in the report outlines concession boundaries.
The two most significant operations or projects in the area are Vale's Bayovar Mine and the FOSPAC Bayovar 9 Concession Project (completed Feasibility
Study in 2014).
Vale’s currently producing Bayovar Mine located on the Bayovar 2 concession, 15 km west of the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession, is one of the largest
phosphate deposits in South America. Vale sold minority stakes in the project to Mosaic (35%) and Mitsui (25%) for $660,000,000 in 2010 (Vale 2010 Annual
Report).
FOSPAC (Cementos Pacasmayo / Mitsubishi / Zuari) is developing a phosphate deposit on the Bayovar 9 concession, located immediately west of the
Focus Bayovar 12 Concession and north of the Vale Bayovar Mine. FOSPAC completed a Feasibility Study on the project in early 2014.  The project
contemplates a mine life of 20 years based on 130 Mt (dry-density) of measured and indicated resources grading 17.5 wt. % P2O5 (FOSPAC Environmental
Impact Assessment Report, October 2013).
Fosyeiki operates a small open pit phosphate mining operation on a narrow Concession between the Vale and FOSPAC concessions (approximately 200 m
wide by 2,000 m long) located to the southwest of the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession.  The operation includes stripping of overburden and mining of the
PH01 PH02 and PH03 phosphorite beds by dozer and excavator.  Basic processing is performed on site using a coal fired dryer that removes the moisture
and some of the fines, resulting in a slight P2O5 product grade increase, prior to being bagged and sold as a direct application fertilizer in the domestic
Peruvian market as well as abroad.
The GrowMax/ Americas Potash Peru project includes three concessions (Bayovar 6, Bayovar 7 and Bayovar 8) situated to the north of the Focus Bayovar
12 Concession.  GrowMax released an initial NI 43-101 phosphate Mineral Resource technical report on the project in April 2015.  GrowMax is currently
conducting additional phosphate and potash exploration and evaluation activity on their three Bayovar concessions.

·
Develop  a  Health  and  Safety  Plan  that  is  comprehensive  yet  concise  so  that  contractors,  construction  managers,  and  members  of  Focus  Venture’s
development team are safe during the field construction phase of the project;
319
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
·
Develop and execute project control procedures and processes;
·
Perform constructability reviews;
·
Implement project accounting and cost control best practices;
·
Issue a cost control plan and a control budget; and
·
Oversee project accounting.
Focus Ventures intends to utilize an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) approach utilizing multiple hard money and low unit
cost  prime  contracts  for  CM,  as  the  recommended  method  for  executing  the  project.  The  capital  cost  estimate  is  based  on  this  methodology.    Mine
development pre-production work activities as well as the water diversion tunnel, the site access road construction and power transmission line will be
performed  by  contractors  selected  through  a  pre-qualification  and  pre-tending  process.  Because  the  project  is  located  approximately  one  hour  from  the
population centers of Sechura and Piura, FCV plans to hire construction workers from these areas, wherever possible.
Some sections affecting the project are:
·
Ability to start work that does not require engineering;
·
Availability of construction and engineering resources;
·
Experience of the qualified firms considered and their typical and proposed approach; and
·
An approach that utilizes the best resources available (matching contractors to the size of each contract).
As previously mentioned, M3 utilized an EPCM approach as the basis for the capital cost estimate. This approach provides for contracts that would include
civil, concrete, structural steel, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation.
The majority of mechanical and electrical equipment required for the project will be procured within the western hemisphere and fabricated items will be
sourced in Peru. Concrete and building construction materials will be sourced locally, wherever possible. Structural and miscellaneous steel, piping, tanks,
electrical and miscellaneous process equipment will be sourced within Peru, and to the extent practical, within the region.
24.1.3.2
Engineering
The PFS level EPCM schedule is based on financing and the Notice to Proceed by Peru permitting agencies to be granted in Year -3. Engineering will be
done to match the plant protocol for drawing titles, equipment numbers and area numbers. Design will produce drawings in the Imperial System of Units
(English) format. Drawings will be prepared in Spanish while specifications will be written in English.
A site conditions specification has been prepared and will be updated to ensure that vendors are aware of the site conditions and project specifications.
Individual equipment specifications will be prepared for all procurement packages that are not off-the-shelf items.
Engineering controls will be maintained through drawing lists, specification lists, equipment lists, pipeline lists, cable schedule, and instrument lists. Control
of Engineering Requisitions for Quote (ERFQ) will be performed through an anticipated purchase orders list. Progress will be tracked through the use of the
lists mentioned.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
320
Concrete reinforcing steel drawings will be done using customary bar available in Peru. Reinforcing bar will be fully detailed to allow either site or shop
fabrication.
Structural steel will be detailed using TEKLA software. Mechanical steel will be dictated utilizing either Inventor or TEKLA. This will allow fabrication of steel
prior to the award of steel installation contracts.
Owner review of engineering progress and design philosophy will be an ongoing process.
24.1.3.3
Procurement
Procurement of long delivery equipment is the main driver for the project schedule. Most major equipment for the Bayovar 12 project has lead times in the 20
to 36 weeks ARO timeframe not including overseas shipment to the site, with a few items in the 40 week delivery schedule. M3 has added 8 weeks for
overseas shipping, customs clearance, and delivery to the site in the EPCM schedule. Submittal drawing review has been included in the overall delivery
schedule.
Procurement of major process equipment will be conducted by the EPCM contractor, acting as Agent for FCV through the use of owner-approved purchase
order forms. This will include all of the equipment in the equipment list as well as all of the instruments in the instrument list. Some instruments will be part of
vendor equipment packages.  In addition, structural steel, electrical panels, electrical lighting, major cable quantities, specialty valves and special pipe will
be purchased. Contractors will be responsible for the purchase of common materials only.
Equipment and bulk material Suppliers will be selected via a competitive bidding process. Similarly, construction contractors will be selected through a pre-
qualification  process  followed  by  a  competitive  bidding  process.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  project  will  employ  a  combination  of  lump  sum  and  unit  price
contracts as appropriate for the level of engineering and scope definition available at the time contract(s) are awarded.
It is intended that equipment will be sourced on a world-wide basis, assessed on the best delivered price and delivery schedule, fit-for-purpose basis.
Equipment will be purchased FOB at the point of manufacture or nearest shipping port for international shipments.  A logistics contractor will be selected to
coordinate all shipments of equipment and materials for the project and arrange for ocean and overland freight to the job site.
The EPCM contractor will be responsible for the receipt of the major equipment and materials at site. The equipment and materials will be turned over to the
installation contractor for storage and safe keeping until installed. Bulk piping and electrical materials and some minor equipment will be made part of the
construction contracts, and as such will be supplied by the various construction contractors. It is expected that each construction contractor provide for the
receipt, storage, and distribution of materials and minor equipment they purchased.
The  EPCM  contractor  will  establish  a  list  of  recommended  pre-qualified  vendors  for  each  major  item  of  equipment  for  approval  by  FCV.  The  EPCM
contractor will prepare the tender documents, issue the equipment packages for the bid, prepare a technical and commercial evaluation, and issue a letter of
recommendation for purchase for approval by FCV.  FCV through the assistance of the EPCM contractor will conduct the commercial negotiations with the
recommended vendor and advise the EPCM contractor of the negotiated terms for preparation of the purchase documents.  When approved, the EPCM
contractor will issue the purchase order, track the order, and expedite the engineering information and delivery of the equipment to the site.
24.1.3.4
Inspection
The  EPCM  contractor  will  be  responsible  to  conduct  QA/QC  inspections  for  major  equipment  during  the  fabrication  process  to  ensure  the  quality  of
manufacture and adherence to specifications. Levels of inspection for major equipment
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
321
will be identified during the bidding stage, which may range from receipt and review of the manufacturer’s quality control procedures to visits to the vendor’s
shops for inspection and witnessing of shop tests prior to shipment of the equipment. Where possible, inspectors close to the point of fabrication will be
contracted to perform this service in order to minimize the travel cost for the project. Some assistance may also be provided by the EPCM engineering design
team.
24.1.3.5
Expediting
The EPCM contractor will also be responsible to expedite the receipt of vendor drawings to support the engineering effort as well as the fabrication and
delivery of major equipment to the site. An expediting report will be issued at regular intervals outlining the status of each purchase order in order to alert the
project of any delays in the expected shipping date or issue of critical vendor drawings. Corrective action can then be taken to mitigate any delay.
The logistics contractor will be responsible to coordinate and expedite the equipment and material shipments from point of manufacture to site, including
international shipments through customs.
24.1.3.6
Project Services
The EPCM contractor will be responsible for management and control of the various project activities and ensure that the team has appropriate resources to
accomplish FCV’s objectives.
24.1.4
Construction
24.1.4.1
Construction Methodology
The  construction  program  is  scheduled  to  start  in  Year  -2.  The  work  includes  civil  site  preparation  of  the  plant  site,  the  seawater  pipeline  construction,
construction of the first seawater pond to provide water for construction, and the power line. Concrete foundations for the process buildings and other support
structures will be constructed beginning in Year -2. The grinding-flotation building and autoclave buildings are planned to be a bridge-frame metal, moment
frame structures. The truck shop, plant maintenance shop, and warehouse buildings are currently planned as pre-engineered metal buildings. Most of the
ancillary  buildings  on  the  Bayovar  12  site  are  planned  to  be  modular  buildings  including  the  Admin  office,  cafeteria,  lab,  security  building  and
Medical/Emergency building.
Construction work is scheduled for approximately 18 months from mobilization to the commencement of commissioning. Earthworks associated with the well
field and related facilities will commence after the permits have been released as soon as the contractor can be mobilized to the field. This work will include
completion of the surface diversions, process building foundations and process ponds.

and
structural/mechanical/electrical/piping/instrumentation.    The  contracting  plan  is  based  on  utilizing  local  contractors  to  execute  the  construction  work
packages to minimize mobilization and travel costs. The EPCM contractor will pre-qualify local contractors and prepare tender documents to bid and select
the most qualified contractor for the various work packages. Some work packages will include the design, supply, and erection for specific facilities which are
specialized in nature. The EPCM team will be comprised of  individuals capable of coordinating the construction effort, supervising and inspecting the work,
performing field engineering functions, administering contracts, supervising warehouse and material management functions, and performing cost control and
schedule  control  functions.    These  activities  will  be  under  the  direction  of  a  resident  construction  manager  and  a  team  of  engineers,  and  locally  hired
supervisors, and technicians. There would also be a commissioning team to do final checkout of the project.

Construction progress will be measured by using quantity ledgers for construction quantities to develop percent completion and earned hours by contractors.
Quantity surveyors will measure the amount of civil quantities, yards of concrete placed, tons of steel erected, and similar measures for architectural, piping
and electrical quantities.  Mechanical installations will be measured based on the estimated installation hours from the control estimate developed during
detailed engineering.
Some  site  services  will  be  contracted  to  third  party  specialists,  working  under  the  direction  of  the  resident  construction  manager.  Construction  service
contracts identified at this time include field survey and QA/QC testing services.
24.1.5
Contracting Plan
Contracting is an integral function in the project’s overall execution. Contracting for the Bayovar 12 Project will be done in full accord with the provisions of
the FCV/EPCM contract.
A combination of vertical, horizontal, and design-construct contracts may be employed as best suits the work to be performed, degree of engineering and
scope definition available at the time of award. A concrete batch plant will be located on site that will use screened colluvial and alluvial materials native to
Meadow Creek.  There will not be a dedicated construction camp at the Bayovar 12 site.
The civil contract will cover all clearing, grubbing, bulk excavation, engineered fill, grading, and construction of TSF berms, ponds and pipe trenches.
The concrete contract will include all concrete forming, rebar, placement and stripping. If possible, the batch plant will be tied to the concrete placement
contract to leverage the economy of having one management for both functions.
As part of the contracting strategy, a list of proposed contract work packages has been developed to identify items of work anticipated to be assembled into a
contract bid package. Depending upon how the project is ultimately executed and the timing, several work packages may be combined to form one contract
bid package. Table 24-1 represents the Proposed Contract Work Package list:

Quality Plan
A project specific, Quality Plan will be developed and implemented on the site. The Quality Plan is a management tool for the EPCM contractor, through the
construction contractors, to maintain the quality of construction and installation on every aspect of a project. The plan, which consists of many different
manuals and subcategories, will be developed during the engineering phase and available prior to the start of construction.
24.1.8
Commissioning Plan
The Commissioning Plan will also be project specific and is characterized as the transition of the constructed facilities from a status of “mechanically” or
“substantially” complete to operational as defined by the subsystem list that will be developed for the project. The commissioning group will systemically
verify the functionality of plant equipment, piping, electrical power and controls. This test and check phase will be conducted by discrete facility subsystems.
The tested subsystems will be combined until the plant is fully functional. Start-up, also a commissioning group responsibility, will progressively move the
functional facilities to operational status and performance.
In addition to these activities, the commissioning portion of the work will also include coordination of facilities operations training, maintenance training and
turnover of all compiled commissioning documentation in an agreed form.
24.1.9
Health and Safety Plan
The Health and Safety Plan (HASP) will be established for the construction of the Bayovar 12 Project and any other authorized work at the project site. The
HASP covers all contractor personnel working on the project and any other authorized work for the project.
The  HASP  specifies  regulatory  compliance  requirements,  training,  certifications  and  medical  requirements  necessary  to  complete  the  project  for  all
personnel and contractors involved in the project. Along with the Operations Procedures, the HASP is to be followed by all Contractor personnel working at
the site.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
25.1
327
328
INTRODUCTION
According to CIM definition standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and
adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014, a Preliminary Feasibility Study is a comprehensive study of a range of options for the technical and economic
viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method, in the case of underground mining, or the pit configuration, in the
case  of  an  open  pit,  is  established  and  an  effective  method  of  mineral  processing  is  determined.  It  includes  a  financial  analysis  based  on  reasonable
assumptions  on  the  “Modifying  Factors”  and  the  evaluation  of  any  other  relevant  factors  that  are  sufficient  for  a  Qualified  Person,  acting  reasonably,  to
determine if all or part of the Mineral Resource may be converted to a Mineral Reserve at the time of reporting.  A Preliminary Feasibility Study is at a lower
confidence level than a Feasibility Study. Modifying Factors are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves; these include, but
are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
25.2
INTERPRETATION
The QPs of this Report have reviewed the data for the Project and are of the opinion that the Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project meets the requirements for a
Preliminary Feasibility Study.  Opinions from individual QPs on the sections of the PFS that they are responsible for (see Section 2 for responsibilities) are
set out in the following subsections.
25.2.1
Surface Rights, Royalties, and Mineral Tenure
Focus Ventures possesses a 70% ownership of the Bayovar 12 concession on which the Project is located as described in Section 4 of this Report, subject
to the royalties, agreements, limitations and encumbrances described in Section 4.
25.2.2
Geology and Mineralization
The understanding of the regional and local geology with regards to the lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization for each of the mineralized zones
and deposit types discussed in Sections 7 and 8 of this Report is sufficient to estimate the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves contained herein.
25.2.3
Exploration
The  previous  drilling  exploration  programs,  along  with  the  subsurface  geologic  interpretation,  and  mineralogy  research  carried  out  to  date,  reasonably
supports the potential for expansion of defined phosphate deposits, and the potential for discovery of new open pit mineable prospects as discussed in
Section 9 of this Report.
25.2.4
Drilling and Sampling
The drilling methods, recovery, collar survey, downhole survey, and material handling for the samples used in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve
estimates for this Report are sufficient to support the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates contained in this Report, subject to the assumptions
and qualifications contained in Sections 10 and 11 of this Report.
25.2.5
Data Verification
The data used for estimating the Mineral Resources for the Bayovar 12 Project is adequate for the purposes of this Report and may be relied upon to report
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves based on the conditions and limitations set out in Section 12 of this Report.
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
25.2.6
Metallurgy
329
The metallurgical testing conducted on samples from exploration cores included extensive mineralogical studies and developmental metallurgical testing on
each of the phosphorite beds (capas). The developmental metallurgical testing and analysis detailed in Section 13 of this Report supports the selection of
the process flow sheet, making it possible to design a plant containing two process lines that can process all phosphate ores from the Project as they are
mined subject to the conditions and limitations set out in Section 13 of this Report.
25.2.7
Mineral Resources
The Mineral Resource estimates in Section 14 of this Report are accurate to within the level of estimate required for categorization as Measured, Indicated
and Inferred mineral resources suitable for use in a Preliminary Feasibility Study, subject to the conditions and limitations set out in Section 14 of this Report,
and these estimates were performed consistent with industry best practices and demonstrate reasonable prospects for economic extraction, as required by
NI43-101.
25.2.8
Mineral Reserves
A review of the designs, schedules, risks, and constraints of the Project detailed within this Report and given that there is, in the opinion of the QP, a basis for
an economically viable Project after taking into account mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social,
governmental factors and other such modifying factors, thereby supporting the declaration of Mineral Reserves.  Subject to the conditions and limitations in
this Report, this PFS demonstrates that, as of the date of this Report, extraction can reasonably be justified.  The term ‘Mineral Reserve’ does not necessarily
signify that all governmental approvals have been received; it does signify that there are reasonable expectations that such approvals will be granted.
25.2.9
Mine Plan and Schedule
The mine plan and schedule detailed in Section 16 of this Report have been developed to maximize mining efficiencies, while utilizing the current level of
geotechnical, hydrological, mining and processing information available and are, subject to the conditions and limitations set out in Section 16, sufficient to
support the declaration of Mineral Reserves.
25.2.10
Metallurgical Recovery
The recovery methods including the major unit operations detailed in Section 17 of this Report comprising, drum washing, attrition scrubbing, desliming with
hydrocyclone, and further classification with a hydrosizer.  Downstream processing of concentrate includes dewatering using vacuum belt filters followed by
concentrate drying using a rotary dryer. Process slimes are sent directly to the TSF, from where no process water is planned to be reclaimed.  These unit
processes are sufficient to demonstrate recoveries to support the mine planning and economics detailed herein, and the declaration of Mineral Reserves.
25.2.11
Infrastructure
The on-site and off-site infrastructure detailed in Section 18 of this Report are designed and cost estimated to a level of detail that supports Project viability
and the economics detailed herein.
25.2.12
Market Studies and Contracts
Market Studies for DAPR in Section 19 of this Report are consistent with industry standards and market patterns, and are similar to other industrial minerals
studies for developing product markets found throughout the world.  The prices selected for 24% P2O5 DAPR and 28% P2O5 DAPR in this Report represent
a probable range of scenarios that support a prefeasibility economic analysis.
M3-PN140103

25.2.13
Environment, Permits, and Social and Community Impacts
330
Section  20  of  this  Report  summarizes  the  reasonable  available  information  on:  environmental  studies  conducted  to  date  and  the  related  known
environmental  issues  associated  with  the  Project,  the  Project  related  social  and  community  impacts,  the  Project  permitting  requirements,  and  the
requirements and plans for waste rock and tailings storage.
Additionally, mine closure, reclamation and mitigation are discussed and cost estimated to a level of detail that supports Project economic and technical
viability to the level of a Prefeasibility Study and the economics detailed herein.
25.2.14
Capital and Operating Costs
The capital and operating costs detailed in Section 21 of this Report, which were derived from several previous Sections, are designed and cost-estimated to
a level of detail that supports Project economic and technical viability to the level of a Prefeasibility Study and the economics detailed herein.
25.2.15
Financial Analysis
The financial analysis presented in Section 22 of this Report illustrates that the Project economics, subject to the conditions and limitations in this Report, are
positive and can support estimation of Mineral Reserves and the demonstration of technical and economic viability to the level of a Prefeasibility Study.
25.3
CONCLUSIONS
The financial analysis presented in Section 22 demonstrates that the Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project is technically and economically viable and has the
potential to generate satisfactory economic returns based on the assumptions and conditions set out in this Report. This conclusion warrants continued work
to advance the Project to the next level of study, which is a Feasibility Study.
25.4
RISKS
The QPs of this Report are not aware of any unusual, significant risks or uncertainties that could be expected to affect the reliability or confidence in the
Project based on the data and information available to date.
As with most projects at the preliminary feasibility level, there continues to be risks that could affect the economic potential of the Project.  Many of the risks
relate to the need for additional field information, laboratory testing, or engineering to confirm the assumptions and parameters used in this Report.  External
risks are, to a certain extent, beyond the control of the Project proponents and are much more difficult to anticipate and mitigate, although, in many instances,
some risk reduction can be achieved. Table 25-1 identifies what are currently deemed to be the most significant internal Project risks, potential impacts, and
possible mitigation approaches. In summary, the Project-specific risks identified following the PFS include:

OPPORTUNITIES
There are many significant opportunities that could improve the economics, and/or permitting schedule of the Project.  The major opportunities that have
been identified at this time are summarized in Table 25-1. Further information and assessments are needed before these opportunities could be included in
the Project economics.
The  opportunities  are  separated  into  general  opportunities  common  to  the  mining  industry,  and  Project-specific  opportunities  unique  to  the  Bayovar  12
Phosphate Project. The Project-specific opportunities are further categorized into three broad categories of potential to improve the Project Net Present
Value (NPV); the categories, and a brief listing the opportunities, are provided below:
·
Potential Benefit Opportunities include:
o
Out of pit conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves adjacent to the current Mineral Reserves;
o
Metallurgical recovery improvements that improve the Project economics;
o
An increase in DAPR prices as demand for organic fertilizers increases;
o
Government funding towards off-site infrastructure.

RECOMMENDATIONS
26.1
MINERAL RESOURCES
Golder recommends the following actions:
Perform  a  targeted  geostatistical  drilling  and  analytical  program  designed  to  evaluate  short  range  variability  in  grade  and  thickness  and  to  improve  the
database for statistical and geostatistical analyses.  Golder recommends that one 800 m by 800 m block be drilled off in a cross pattern of 50 m to 100 m
spaced holes.  Golder recommends that the geostatistics be evaluated further once additional drilling and analytical data are available to determine if the
results support a less conservative area of influence based classification for the Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral Resources.
Infill drilling within Phase 1 and Phase 2 exploration drilling areas once the geostatistical drilling and modeling are completed and Measured classification
distances are confirmed for the purpose of upgrading Mineral Resources from Indicated and Inferred categories into Measured Mineral Resouces.
Perform trial down-hole geophysical surveys for evaluation of potential quantitative identification of phosphorite beds for sampling;
Continue to collect additional relative density and moisture analytical  data  for  all  phosphorite  and  diatomite  beds  to  improve  calculated  relative  density
values used in converting volume into tonnes;
Proceed with additional exploration drilling on 800 & 400-meter centers to extend coverage of Measured & Indicated Resources within the current pit limits
and beyond, especially to the north and north east of the Bayovar-Chiclayo road
Update the geological model and Mineral Resource Estimates based on data and observations from any additional drilling and analytical work;
Update the NI 43-101 Technical Report for additional Mineral Resources with the results of any additional exploration program results.
26.2
MINERAL RESERVES
Infill drilling is recommended to bring the reserves in Updated Pre-Feasibility Study for mining Phases 1 through 4, which covers the phosphorite production
during Years 1 through 5, into the proven category
The Mineral Reserves Estimate is based solely on the 20-year mine plan open-pit design with high wall laybacks and a maximum production rate of 1.0 M
tonnes (dry) of phosphate concentrate per year. Although mineral resources exist outside the 20-year mine plan pit, the mine schedule was limited to the 20-
year mine life and were not considered in the Mineral Reserves Estimation.
26.3
METALLURGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
The individual layer test work used composite samples prepared from the cores from nine drill holes. Subsequent resource drilling and chemical analyses of
the drill cores indicate that the average grade of the phosphorite layers has increased from 12.7 to 13.7% P2O5. It is therefore recommended that additional
testing be performed with core samples of phosphorite layers from different locations within the proposed mine pit to determine if the recovery assumptions
and predicted concentrate grades are applicable over the entire mine pit. The proposed number of drill holes to be included in this variability testing is five for
the first 5-year mining block (one for each year), and two each for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 5-year mining blocks, for a total of 11 holes. If the proposed test work
results  demonstrate  that  the  recovery  assumptions  and  predicted  concentrate  grades  are  valid  over  the  entire  mine  pit,  the  variability  testing  may  be
terminated. However, if the recovery assumptions and predicted concentrate grades are not applicable over the entire
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
337
mine pit, more variability testing within the problematic mining blocks would be recommended.  There is lower grade P2O5 in several of the interbeds which
may be of high enough grade to be blended with adjacent capas for plant feed and still make saleable product grade.  This would simplify the phosphorite
mining and lower mining costs.
Additional settling tests and filtration tests are recommended to establish unit area requirements for high rate thickeners and filtration rates for concentrates
prepared according to the proposed flowsheet. This work could be performed in conjunction with the variability testing program.
Future bench-scale metallurgical testing, if practical, should be performed with samples that have not been dried. If dried samples are available for use, they
should be rehydrated to approximate the in situ moisture content prior to testing.
Pilot scale testing is recommended to support future feasibility study work. If the variability testing shows uniformity it may be possible to obtain the bulk
samples of phosphorite layers from 150 mm diameter core samples. If the variability testing shows a variable response to beneficiation it will be necessary to
obtain the bulk samples of phosphorite layers from different locations within the proposed mine pit. Drilling large diameter core will allow for distributed
sampling.
26.4
MINERAL RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS
Test work should continue to develop improved P2O5 recovery in the plant and develop grade recovery curves by capa as noted in 26.3 of the previous Pre-
Feasibility Report.  The Bayovar 12 plant is sized based on the current level of metallurgical testwork. The drum scrubber, attrition cells, and hydrosizer for
each  process  line  are  well  matched  to  the  throughput  requirements.  A  great  deal  of  power  and  energy  costs  are  tied  up  in  concentrate  filtration  and
concentrate drying.  M3 recommends investigating the following plant improvements:
·
Optimize belt filtration to determine the best size and vacuum pressure to remove the maximum amount of moisture from the filter.  Based on additional
testwork outlined in Section 26.3, Focus should reinvestigate the best filtration technology and filter size to handle 1 million MTPA per annum.
·
Optimize concentrate drying to determine the appropriate technology to dry the concentrates.  The cost of drying concentrate to 4% moisture accounts for
approximately one third of the processing cost.    A rotary dryer is more forgiving for a wide range of particle sizes but is 20% less efficient for drying. The cost
of a rotary dryer is higher than using fluid bed dryers that handle the same capacity.  However, fluid bed dryers are limited to a narrow range of particle sizes
and do not handle fines well.  Drying testwork should be considered to solve the question.
·
Investigate the methodology for onsite blending of DAPR concentrates with additives to make custom DAPR fertilizers.  M3 investigated the mixing and
storage equipment for DAPR fertilizer amendments and product storage as part of this study.  However, this section of the plant is currently not included or
costed into the plant design.  In conjunction with more advanced market studies, Focus should investigate the requirement for onsite where rehandling will
be less expensive versus constructing a mixing plant offsite near the place of final product delivery.
26.5
MINING EQUIPMENT AND APPROACH
Mining represents the largest component of cost to produce the product in the Updated Pre-Feasibility Study.  Hauling and loading represents 56% and 21%
of the mining cost, respectively. Approaches to lower these costs should be evaluated.
Overburden – The overburden represents 44% of the total waste by volume and in the Updated Pre-Feasibility study it is removed by front end loader – truck
mining system.  Alternative systems should be evaluated to potentially lower operating costs, such as;
M3-PN140103
28 June 2016
- Bucket Wheel Excavator (BWE) and conveyor-stacker system
- Rotary cutter head and conveyor-stacker system
- Dozing to a trap (pocket) and conveyor-stacker system
- Load and truck haul to pit rim and convey to dumps
338
Interburden – The interburden represents the balance of the waste and is in thinner geometries than the overburden.  The BWE and rotary cutter have better
application to thicker mining geometries such as the overburden, but dozing the interburden to a dozer trip or to piles for loading may reduce cost and
maintain the selectivity of interburden versus phosphorite.
26.6
INFRASTRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommended additional work related to the geotechnical design of the TSF includes:
·
Development of detailed surface topography at an accuracy of at least 0.6 m is needed to improve volumetric estimates for the impounded tailings and
tailings dam.
·
Install  a  weather  station,  including  a  Pan  Evaporation  Class  A,  on  the  Project  site  to  start  collecting  local  data  in  order  to  refine  the  evaporation  and
precipitation estimates made in the present evaluation.
·
Perform field investigation and laboratory testing program in footprint of TSF embankment and WSF.
·
Develop detailed water balance model that accounts for monthly variations in evaporation and simulates a range of annual climate patterns.
Perform laboratory slurry consolidation testing of samples of the tailings to determine achievable tailings placed density and volume of retained solution.
Next to the TSF, the seawater supply pipeline is the largest cost driver for the process plant.  M3 developed a PFS-level design for the seawater delivery
system.  However, because of cost implications, it will be important to develop a detailed design for the pipeline that includes:
·
Anchoring details for seawater intake structure;
·
Pipeline trench dimensions and depth;
·
Develop detailed line pressure ratings for the pipeline route to confidently determine the length of SDR 11 pipe  vs SDR 13.5  pipe vs  SDR 17 pipe;
·
Design and cost the pipeline to handle HDPE expansion and contraction with varying temperature and design and cost a pipeline anchoring strategy;
·
Determine that an easement for the proposed pipeline route is available and the distance that will be required from the Bayovar-Chiclayo Highway to run the
pipeline.
The power transmission line is a relatively short distance from the La Niña substation to the plant.  Focus will have to investigate the easement of the power
line route to the site that does not interfere with Vale’s power line.
Geotechnical conditions for the foundations for power line towers along the power line route will need to be investigated further.
The daily number of concentrate trucks will test the integrity of the Bayovar-Chiclayo Highway.  Focus needs to obtain permits and approvals to use the
Bayovar-Chiclayo Highway for the long-term delivery of concentrates to the Port of Bayovar.

339
In order to expand the mineral resource and tailings impoundment to the north, the Bayovar-Chiclayo Highway will need to be relocated on the Bayovar 12
concession.  Focus will need to commence a study to move and rebuild the highway to the north of its current location.
26.7
OPA RECOMMENDATIONS
·
Additional geotechnical investigation and laboratory testing is needed to develop reliable material parameters for use in the stability analyses for the open pit
involving approximately 5 to 10 geotechnical drill holes.  Geotechnical drill holes should be extended approximately 20 m into Underburden to adequately
characterize those materials that may influence global stability.
·
Additional hydraulic packer testing should be carried out to verify lateral continuity of the hydraulic properties of Overburden and Interburden and to collect
data on the Underburden materials.
·
More robust numerical seepage models should be carried out to improve estimates of seepage inflow rates.
·
Water  balance  models  should  be  refined  to  evaluate  monthly  evaporation  and  statistically  developed  rainfall  patterns  to  evaluate  the  ability  to  manage
process, seepage, and storm water for a range of climatic and operating conditions.
·
Additional CBR testing should be completed
