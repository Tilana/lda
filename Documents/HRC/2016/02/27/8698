</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.10-11837 
</p>
<p>1. The present document contains a revised list of right to development criteria, 
together with corresponding operational sub-criteria, as requested by the Working Group on 
the Right to Development and endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 
12/23. The criteria and sub-criteria attempt to address the essential features of the right to 
development, as defined in the Declaration on the Right to Development, in a 
comprehensive and coherent way, including priority concerns of the international 
community beyond those enumerated in Millennium Development Goal 8, and to serve the 
purposes set out in all relevant provisions of Council resolution 9/3. 
</p>
<p>2. For that purpose, the task force has prepared a table (see annex) that begins with a 
general statement on what the basic expectation of the right to development is (its &#8220;core 
norm&#8221;), then clarifies the core norm by enumerating three attributes of the right, the 
realization of each of which can be assessed with reference to several criteria, which, in 
turn, can be made more precise through sub-criteria. The sub-criteria may then be assessed 
by drawing upon reliable measurement tools in the form of one or several indicators. 
</p>
<p>3. In order to place this exercise in the context of the work of the task force spanning 
five years, the main phases of the task force&#8217;s work on these measurement tools are 
highlighted and several of their main features are explained in the section below. 
</p>
<p><b>  Phase I: pilot testing preliminary criteria with development 
partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>4. At its first session in 2004, the task force expressed the view that, in order to 
implement the policy frameworks supporting the Millennium Development Goals and 
further the implementation of the right to development, it was necessary to develop 
practical tools, including guidelines and objective indicators, which help in translating the 
human rights norms and principles into parameters accessible to policymakers and 
development practitioners (E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/2, para. 46). 
</p><p>5. In accordance with the request made by the Working Group that the task force 
examine Millennium Development Goal 8, on global partnership for development, and 
suggest criteria for its periodic evaluation (E/CN.4/2005/25, para. 54 (i)), the task force 
considered at its second session, in 2005, a study1 commissioned by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and adopted a 
preliminary set of 13 criteria (E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/TF/3, para. 82). 
6. In recommending the above-mentioned criteria to the Working Group, the task force 
stressed that all existing accountability mechanisms relating to aid, trade, debt, technology 
transfer, the private sector and global governance, within the context of their specific 
mandates, could improve overall accountability in the implementation of goal 8, as they are 
the principal source of relevant information for the periodic evaluation of goal 8 with a 
view to implementing the right to development. In the task force&#8217;s view, however, the 
existing monitoring tends to neglect critical human rights aspects, such as those reflected in 
its criteria, and would need to be carefully and critically scrutinized in order to be useful for 
the purposes of the right to development. As a prerequisite for the effective monitoring of 
the above criteria, the task force urged these monitoring mechanisms to integrate relevant 
and measurable human rights indicators based on solid research and data, including those 
that demonstrate links between the promotion and protection of human rights and positive

<p>development outcomes. Furthermore, the task force considered that it would be valuable to 
monitoring progress in realizing the right to development if the Working Group were to 
receive periodically the elements of existing monitoring mechanisms most relevant to the 
criteria proposed by the task force, and thus facilitate its task in undertaking a periodic 
review of the global partnerships for the realization of the right to development. Its main 
recommendation was that the Working Group undertake such a periodic evaluation. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the task force applied the criteria to various global 
partnerships and refined them in the light of that experience. The Working Group requested 
the task force to review the structure of the criteria, their coverage of aspects of 
international cooperation and the methodology for their application with a view to 
enhancing their effectiveness as a practical tool for evaluating global partnerships, and 
specifically providing a consistent mapping of the criteria and relevant checklists, viewing 
the latter as operational sub-criteria. The Working Group saw this process eventually 
leading to the elaboration and implementation of a comprehensive and coherent set of 
standards. The task force was therefore particularly attentive to the request of the Working 
Group that it progressively develop and further refine the criteria, based on actual practice 
(A/HRC/4/47, paras. 51, 52 and 55). 
</p><p>8. The constant concern of the task force for the quality of the criteria was echoed by 
its institutional members and Member States, as well as the agencies responsible for the 
partnerships reviewed. It therefore drafted a revised set as a progressive development of the 
criteria, which maintained essentially the same content, while reordering, clarifying and 
developing them on the basis of lessons learned from applying the criteria to date, and 
submitted that list as an intermediary stage for use in phase II of its work, in 2008.2 
Significantly, the task force drew the attention of the Working Group to its commitment to 
achieve the desired level of quality of the criteria by ensuring that they (a) are analytically 
and methodologically rigorous; (b) provide empirically-oriented tools to those involved in 
implementing development partnerships that can improve the outcome of their work in the 
light of their respective mandates; (c) integrate analytical work done by expert groups at the 
World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United 
Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs, OHCHR and others, as well as academic research centres; and (d) provide 
guidance so that global partnerships for development are able to respond better to the 
broader objectives of the right to development, proposing for that purpose an expert 
consultation.3 
</p>
<p><b>  Phase II: finalizing the methodology and structure of the criteria 
</b></p>
<p>9. In 2009, the task force embarked upon a more systematic process of structuring 
criteria around attributes and attaching illustrative indicators. The first step was to 
commission a substantive paper,4 and other background materials,5 and to convene an 
international meeting of experts.6 Based on this work, the task force developed preliminary

</p>
<p>attributes and criteria. A progress report was shared with the Working Group at its tenth 
session, in 2009, in order to benefit from the considered views of Member States before 
continuing its work and in anticipation of submitting revised proposals in 2010 
(A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, annex IV). In the report, the task force drew attention to the 
imperative of placing the identified criteria on a rigorous analytical foundation, both 
conceptually and methodologically. This foundation must exclude any arbitrariness or 
political bias in the selection of criteria. In addition, the criteria must be sufficiently 
operational so that they can be meaningful to the various stakeholders, and in particular to 
the development community, to apply in their respective domains of work. The report also 
highlighted the fact that the criteria, sub-criteria and indicators are based on an exhaustive 
reading of the human rights instruments from which the core components can be identified; 
and that attributes (components) must be mutually exclusive to the extent possible. On this 
basis, the task force proposed three components for review by the Working Group before 
proceeding with the identification of criteria and sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p>10. The Working Group, despite the differences in emphasis of various delegations, 
expressed general support for the approach of the task force reflecting both the national and 
international dimensions of the right to development in the elaboration of criteria, and 
applying a holistic approach to human rights in their refinement (A/HRC/12/28, para. 34). 
There was also general support for the three components of the right to development 
(comprehensive human-centred development, enabling environment, social justice and 
equity) reflected in the criteria, with particularly strong support for the attribute relating to 
social justice and equity. Some delegates attached more importance to the comprehensive 
approach to development component, others to the enabling environment element. With 
regards to the coherence and pertinence of criteria, several delegates expressed their views 
and offered suggestions on specific criteria. Some concern was expressed about the very 
ambitious nature of some criteria, and whether corresponding sub-criteria could be 
designed for them. Some suggested that the criteria should be streamlined and that 
duplication be avoided, while others considered that one of the components should contain 
more criteria than the current preliminary draft. Numerous suggestions were made 
regarding specific criteria, which were noted and used by the task force in the final phase of 
its work (ibid., para. 35). 
</p><p>11. Following the feedback from the Working Group, the task force continued in 2009 
and 2010 to develop a full set of attributes, criteria, sub-criteria and indicators. In 
conformity with the Working Group&#8217;s recommendation that it draw on specialized 
expertise, including from academic and research institutions and relevant United Nations 
agencies and other relevant global organizations (A/HRC/12/28, para. 46 (a)), OHCHR 
commissioned a study7 from two consultants, one with expertise in international human 
rights law, the other in development economics. The purpose of the study was to research 
comprehensively (a) the normative content of the right to development in the context of 
international human rights law and practice in order to define its core attributes and criteria 
for assessing progress towards its realization; (b) the most relevant development challenges 
that needed to receive priority attention in order to identify the criteria and sub-criteria; and 
(c) the availability of methodologically robust measures and reliable data sets that would be 
appropriate for indicators. A further purpose of the study was to propose refinements in the 
list of attributes with corresponding criteria as elaborated by the task force, and 
complement them with operational sub-criteria and indicators.

</b></p>
<p>12. To draw on specialized expertise further, the study was reviewed in an expert 
consultation convened by OHCHR in December 2009. Finally, at its sixth session, in 
January 2010, the task force considered the consultants&#8217; study and the report of the expert 
consultation (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/CRP.4), together with preliminary observations made by 
Member States and observers from concerned institutions and non-governmental 
organizations (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, paras. 67&#8211;69). 
</p>
<p><b>  General considerations underlying the framework of attributes, criteria, sub-criteria 
and indicators 
</b></p>
<p>13. The core norm, attributes, criteria, sub-criteria and indicators (see table, annex) were 
chosen out of concern for conformity with agreed principles and their potential for 
operationalizing the right to development, taking into account also the need to differentiate 
standards that are general and lasting from those that are context-specific and subject to 
change. With respect to conformity to agreed principles, care was taken to ensure that all 
standards (attributes, criteria and sub-criteria) were firmly anchored in (a) the Declaration 
on the Right to Development; (b) criteria already examined and found useful by the 
Working Group; (c) an analysis of United Nations bodies or agencies, leading scholars and 
practitioners; (d) other international human rights laws, standards, theories and practices; 
and (e) prevailing international development standards, theories and practices. With regard 
to operationalizing the right to development, the standards are intended to provide clear, 
action-oriented guidance as to the responsibilities of decision makers in States, international 
institutions and civil society as they plan, implement, monitor and assess development-
related policies, projects and processes. The criteria and sub-criteria should be relatively 
long-lasting and suitable for inclusion in a set of guidelines or a legally-binding instrument 
that development actors may use over the long term when assessing whether their own 
responsibilities or those of others are being met. The indicators, on the other hand, are 
intended to help in assessing compliance with the criteria and sub-criteria, and are therefore 
context-specific and subject to change over time. 
</p><p>14. The United Nations and academic and research centres have made considerable 
advances in recent years in developing indicators to measure human rights. In particular, 
the task force considered the work for treaty bodies on indicators, which proceeds from 
distilling core attributes of the right and identifying indicators in three dimensions: 
structural, process and outcome (HRI/MC/2008/3). The task force decided to apply these 
concepts in its work on the right to development, as reflected in the principles of selection 
described below. The indicators selected for inclusion reflect pressing contemporary 
concerns and established tools of measurement and data collection, as identified by 
international institutions, used to measure progress in meeting commitments arising from 
international agreements and conferences dealing with human rights and such matters as 
debt, trade, poverty reduction, financing of development and climate change. They also 
reflect general consensus among development scholars and practitioners, as well as 
prevailing theories about the most effective means of addressing issues of 
underdevelopment or disparity at subnational and national levels. An effort was made to 
take into account the current capacities of Governments and international institutions to 
gather additional data. 
</p>
<p>15. The indicators included in the table are selected from among a much larger set of 
relevant structural, process and outcome indicators (HRI/MC/2008/3). The principal 
concern in selecting the illustrative quantitative indicators provided in the table was their 
validity, reliability and inter-temporal and international comparability. Preference was 
given to indicators that were likely to show variations among countries and over time, and 
thus illustrate changes in human well-being. There is a mix of indicators primarily useful 
for describing development outcomes and indicators (structural and process) in providing 
guidance for future action (outcome). On most issues, where multiple indicators were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-11837 
</p>
<p>available to address a specific issue, only the one closest to the essence of that issue was 
included. Others could have been chosen from the thousands of potentially relevant 
indicators, and new ones will emerge. For this reason, the indicators listed (see annex, 
endnotes) in most cases with references to where they can be consulted, should be updated, 
and revisions and new ones added as they become available. 
</p>
<p>16. One may legitimately ask to whom the standards are addressed. The answer is found 
in article 3 of the Declaration on the Right to Development: &#8220;States have the primary 
responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the 
realization of the right to development.&#8221; When considering what is required to create such 
an enabling environment, many would have in mind international regimes and institutions 
that make the rules and allocate the resources. They are the products of States acting 
collectively, as are their policies and programmes. In this sense, the right to development is 
the responsibility of States acting collectively in global and regional partnerships. Some 
might prefer to address this responsibility as belonging to the legal entity of an international 
institution. While international institutions, as legal persons, have rights and duties, the task 
force preferred to draw from the above-mentioned article 3 the concept of responsibility of 
States acting collectively. The second level of responsibility is that of States acting 
individually as they adopt and implement policies that affect persons not strictly within 
their jurisdiction, such as the beneficiaries of aid programmes, persons gaining access to 
medicines made available through the use of flexibilities in trade agreements or through 
internationally agreed programmes. These collective and international actions are reflected 
in article 4 of the Declaration: &#8220;States have the duty to take steps, individually and 
collectively, to formulate international development policies with a view to facilitating the 
full realization of the right to development.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>17. Finally, article 2 of the Declaration makes it clear that &#8220;States have the right and the 
duty to formulate appropriate national development policies that aim at the constant 
improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis 
of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution 
of the benefits resulting therefrom.&#8221; Thus the creation of national conditions relates to 
policies and programmes at the national level affecting persons within a State&#8217;s jurisdiction. 
</p><p>18. The standards presented in the table could be structured according to the 
responsibilities of States acting internally, externally and collectively, or indicate for each 
sub-criterion the appropriate level of State responsibility. The task force found that such an 
arrangement would create too much duplication since most of the policies relevant to the 
right to development involve responsibilities at all three, or at least two, of these levels, and 
responsibilities at one level only are self-evident in most cases. Therefore, the table begins 
with the core norm and is structured around the three attributes of comprehensive and 
human-centred development policy, participatory human rights processes, and social 
justice. While structure, process and outcome indicators are relevant to all three, the 
principal distinguishing feature is that the first relates to commitment (to a particular 
concept of development), the second to rules and principles (human rights, participation, 
accountability and transparency) and the third to distributional outcomes (fair distribution 
of the benefits and burdens of development). They are mutually exclusive to the extent 
possible, but necessarily overlap, for example, with regard to non-discrimination and 
continuous improvement of well-being. Overlapping criteria are considered matters of 
policy in the first, matters of respect for rules and principles in the second and of 
achievement of social justice in the third. 
19. The sub-criteria in the second column indicate the major areas in which progress can 
be measured and, in the third column, are summary descriptions of relevant indicators, 
which are then defined with references in the endnotes. The purpose of this presentation is 
to allow those responsible for national and international policy to have access to reliable </p>

<p>tools for gauging achievements in the right to development. The Working Group may wish 
to consider developing more context-specific mechanisms, such as reporting templates, to 
enable more practical application of the criteria. As they stand, they seek to be as 
comprehensive and coherent as possible in accordance with the request of the Working 
Group.

<p> The right to development is the right of peoples and individuals to the constant 
improvement of their well-being and to a national and global enabling environment 
conducive to just, equitable, participatory and human-centred development respectful of all 
human rights. The attributes, criteria, sub-criteria and indicators listed in the table below are 
designed to assess the extent to which States are individually and collectively taking steps 
to establish, promote and sustain national and international arrangements that create an 
enabling environment for the realization of the right to development. The responsibility for 
the creation of this enabling environment encompasses three main levels: (a) States acting 
collectively in global and regional partnerships;a (b) States acting individually as they adopt 
and implement policies that affect persons not strictly within their jurisdiction;b and (c) 
States acting individually as they formulate national development policies and programmes 
affecting persons within their jurisdiction.c In order to assess progress in meeting these 
responsibilities, a selection of indicators is also listed (for their technical definition and 
sources, see endnotes).
