REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Potash – Republic of Congo, West Africa 
During the year ending 30th June 2011 the company completed its Phase 1 drilling programme and all associated exploration 
activities. The technical information and data collected was used by the company and its consultants to complete a Mineral 
Resource estimate as well as an initial economic and scoping report, and commenced its Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) on the 
Sintoukola Potash project in the Republic of Congo (ROC), see Figures 1 and 2.  
 
Activities comprised:
•  Completion of the exploration base camp for accommodating in excess of ninety personnel.  
•  Completion of the Phase 1 exploration programme comprising:
o 
o 
o 
o
16 drill holes for 6577m;  
core logging, sampling and analysis; 
down-hole geophysical logging of all exploration holes; and 
a 35 line km 2D seismic survey and the processing of the data.
•  Data compilation, validation and assessment. 
•  Geological and resource modelling. 
•  Reporting of a maiden Mineral Resource estimate, which included 362Mt Indicated Mineral Resources and 442Mt 
Inferred  Mineral  Resources,  with  an  average  grade  of  19.5%  K2O  (30.8%  KCl)  and  19.6%  K2O  (31.0%  KCl) 
respectively, at a 15.0% K2O cut-off grade.
•  Planning of the Phase 2 exploration programme.  
•  Commencement of the Phase 2 field programme comprising:
o 
o
some  47  drill  holes  (13,295m)  for  resource  infill,  resource  expansion,  geotechnical  and  hydro-geological 
purposes; and 
a 2D 160km seismic survey.
•  Completion of a scoping report and an initial economic report. 
•  Planned  and  initiated  a  comprehensive  2  year  feasibility  study  programme  and  commenced  with  the  trade-off
studies and pre-feasibility study on Sintoukola.
Exploration Drilling 
The Phase 1 drilling programme at Sintoukola was designed to meet several strategic objectives which included:
(i)  To verify the historical intersections (see Figure 2) of potash mineralisation from drilling by Syndicat de Recherches
de Potasse au Congo (SDRDPC) in the 1960s; and
(ii)  To  test  the  continuity  of  mineralisation  interpreted  and  “exploration  target”  based  on  potash  mineralisation
intersected in the historic drilling over the high-priority Kola target (an area of approximately 7km x 3km).
The aim of the drilling was to delineate mineralisation on both the sylvinite and carnallite horizons in the Kola prospect area 
and collect sufficient information to allow the estimation of initial maiden Mineral Resource estimate reported in accordance 
with with the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Guidelines for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources 
and  Ore  Reserves,  2004  (the  “JORC  Code”),  which  is  consistent  with  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and 
Petroleum’s definition standards.  
 
This phase of exploration consisted of a 16 bore hole programme for a total of 6577m (see Figure 2). Collar details for all of 
the holes are provided in Table 1.   
 
All exploration holes in the Phase 1 programme were completed using two methods of drilling: an open hole section from 
surface to the base of a dolomitic sequence (Figure 3) which is cased off to 5.5” and thereafter a diamond tail through the 
evaporitic sequence which is host to the sylvinite and carnallite zones. 
 
The Phase 1 program was mainly focused on sylvinite mineralisation however four of the exploration holes (EK_01, EK_06, 
EK_13 and EK_16) were extended to the base of the evaporitic sequence to test the state of development and thickness of 
the carnallitite horizons.  An additional exploration hole (EK_04) was planned to test the carnallite mineralisation however, 
after successfully intersecting the sylvinite target horizons between 274m to 299m, circulation was lost and the hole was 
abandoned.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (CONT)
The final hole of the Phase 1 programme (EK_16) penetrated the footwall of the evaporitic sequence at 573.43m below 
surface.  The hole intersected a mixed hydrocarbon/water gas pocket causing minor gas emissions to occur through the well 
string. The footwall rock is a calcareous medium to coarse sandstone which has good hydrocarbon reservoir properties. The 
hole was capped and sealed.

Assay Results 
Sylvinite Mineralisation  
A  total  of  1,178  half  core  samples  ranging  in  length  from  about  0.4m  to  1.5m  were  submitted  to  the  laboratories  for 
geochemical analysis. Selected intersections are provided in Table 2. 
 
Drill holes EK_01 and EK-04 were positioned to twin K_18 and K_6 respectively (see Figures 4 and 5). These are two of the 
26 historical holes drilled within Elemental’s Sintoukola Licence area by SDRDPC in the 1960s and 1970s.   
 
The geological and mineralogical logs for EK_01 and EK_04, supported by down-hole wireline logging, correlate well with drill 
logs and assay results from historical drill hole K_18 and K_6 respectively, thus demonstrating the integrity of historic data 
and results.
5
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (CONT)
The reduced intervals or lack of potash mineralisation in drill holes EK_02 and in EK_16 is interpreted to be a result of 
localised faulting. EK_03 experienced drilling problems and failed to reach the target depth before the hole was abandoned 
(Figure 2).

Carnallite Mineralisation 
Some carnallite mineralisation occurs in narrow seams above and immediately adjacent to the main sylvinite mineralisation, 
however the bulk of the carnallite mineralisation is hosted by thick layer of carnallitite well below the sylvinite mineralisation 
(Figures 4 and 5).  
 
As discussed above, four drill holes (EK_01, 06, 13, and 16) were successfully drilled through to the base of the evaporitic 
sequence.  The collar information for these holes is shown in Table 1 and selected intersections are provided in Table 3.

Sampling & Analytical Details 
Drill  core  samples  (PQ  core  diameter  sizes)  were  split  in  half  by  dry  diamond  sawing  at  the  project  site.  The  half  split 
samples, each weighing about 3kg to 7kg, were collected at an average interval of 0.3m to 1.5m.  
 
The samples were processed and analysed by Ku-Tek (Kali Technology, Sondershausen, Germany and Genalysis, Perth, 
Australia.  Potassium (K), sodium, calcium, magnesium, chlorine, and sulphur were analysed by ICP-ES. The detection limit 
for K using this technique is 0.001%. Routine international-standard QA/QC procedures were used by Ku-Tek and Genalysis. 
One of the six elements analysed are reported here: potassium (K) and its molecular equivalent of potassium oxide (K2O, by 
multiplication with a factor of 1.204).  
 
Vibroseismic Survey 
A 34.5 line kilometre 2D seismic survey was completed during the year over the Kola target (see Figure 2). Data processing 
was completed and the final interpreted dataset was delivered to the company.  
 
Geological and Resource Modelling 
Following the completion of Elemental’s Phase 1 exploration and evaluation programme at the Kola target in February 2011, 
geological  and  resource  modelling  was  completed.  Geological  modelling  considered  lithological  data  from  drill  core, 
geophysical data from down-hole logging, assay results from core samples and interpretation of two dimensional seismic 
data. Several lithological contacts and two sylvinite mineralisation horizons were modelled for the Kola target namely the 
Upper Seam (sylvinite zone) and the Lower Seam (mixed sylvinite and carnallite zone).   
 
On the 4th April 2011 the company announced its maiden Mineral Resource estimate comprising 362Mt Indicated Mineral 
Resources and 442Mt Inferred Mineral Resources, with an average grade of 19.5% K2O (30.8% KCl) and 19.6% K2O (31.0% 
KCl) respectively, at a 15.0% K2O cut-off grade.  
 
The upper seam of the Kola deposit contains 229Mt Indicated Mineral Resources and 289Mt Inferred Mineral Resources, 
grading at 21.3% K2O (33.8% KCl) and 21.4% K2O (33.9% KCl), respectively (at a 15.0% K2O cut-off grade). The upper seam 
has a high-grade domain containing 151Mt Indicated Mineral Resources and 186Mt Inferred Mineral Resource, grading at 
25.1% K2O (39.7% KCl) and 25.2% K2O (40.0% KCl) when reported at a 20.0% K2O cut-off grade.  
 
These Mineral Resources were prepared by independent resource industry consultants, CSA Global Pty Ltd (“CSA”).  As 
stated previously, the Mineral Resources were reported in accordance with the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee 
Guidelines for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2004 (the “JORC Code”), which is 
consistent with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum’s definition standards. 
 
This Mineral Resource estimate is disclosed in a National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects 
(“NI 43-101”) technical report entitled ‘‘NI 43-101 Technical Report Sintoukola Potash Project Republic of Congo’’ prepared 
by Messrs. Simon Dorling, Jeff Elliott, Andrew Scogings and Peter Davies of CSA and Neal Rigby from SRK, dated August 1, 
2011 that has been filed on SEDAR (the “Technical Report”). 
 
Phase 2 Exploration Programme 
The  company  commenced  the  Phase  2  field  programme  including  preparation  for  exploration  and  other  drilling  work  in 
support of the DFS. This programme is expected to deliver a code compliant Mineral Resource estimate in the appropriate 
resource category for conversion into Mineral Reserves and also to provide hydro-geological, metallurgical and geotechnical 
data in support of the mine design. 
 
The drilling component of the Phase 2 programme (see Figure 6) consists of a total of 47 drill holes for 13,295m, of which 6 
drill  holes  are  designed  for  the  gathering  of  structural  geotechnical  and  hydro-geological  information,  13  drill  holes  for 
resource extension drilling, 10 drill holes for resource conversion and 18 hydro-geological drill holes (8 hydro-geological drill 
are holes not depicted on the map). The drilling programme may evolve as results are forthcoming.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (CONT)
In parallel to the Phase 2 drill programme, approximately 160 line kilometres of close-spaced (150 to 200m) 2D seismic data 
will be collected over the Kola deposit to provide high resolution of subsurface deformation patterns and allow detailed ore 
body modelling, which is expected to provide the required level of confidence in the mine planning phase of the DFS. 
 
A new Exploration Target1
 of between 0.32Bt and 1.08Bt of potash mineralisation grading between 19% K2O (30.15% KCl) to 
21% K2O (33.33% KCl) at a 15% K2O cut-off grade, has been modelled in the area to be tested by the resource expansion 
programme (Fig. 6). The Exploration Target surrounds and is in addition to the maiden Mineral Resource estimate contained 
in the Technical Report. 
 
Feasibility study programme 
Following  a  comprehensive  bid  process,  a  multi-disciplinary  engineering  team  has  been  appointed  for  the  full  Definitive 
Feasibility study (DFS). The team, which is led by SRK Consulting (US) Inc. (“SRK”), includes CSA, AMEC Americas Limited, 
EGIS International and Ercosplan. The pre-feasibility (PFS) phase has commenced, starting with the primary trade of studies 
which includes plant location, rail, road and conveyor transport options, power supply, brine water transfer and disposal, 
hydropower potential, port facility, mining method, mine sizing and product specification.  
 
Metallurgical test work was started at the Saskatchewan Research Council and is scheduled for completion during the next 
quarter. The PFS and DFS reports are expected to be delivered in Q1 2012 and Q1 2013 respectively. 
 
Independent Technical and Economic Evaluation 
The company appointed CSA to manage a multi-disciplinary engineering team that completed a scoping report during the 
second quarter of the year which focussed on the identification of key concepts, fatal flaws and capital and operating cost 
estimates. The team, consisting of SRK, CSA, AMEC Americas Limited, EGIS International and CRU Strategies concluded 
that at this level of study, both solution mining and conventional mining can be considered economically feasible and should 
be investigated further. 
 
Robust economic estimates are contained in the Technical Report that has been filed on SEDAR. 
 
The  economic  estimates contained  in  the  report  are based  on  certain costs  and assumptions  including  a 1.8  million  tpa 
production rate using a conventional underground mining method. The estimates indicate a project IRR of 27% and NPV12% of 
US$0.99bn, based on a 2015 start-up and a mine life of 20 years. Site operating cost is estimated at US$81 per tonne and 
US$99  per  tonne  FOB  Pointe  Noire  (excluding  royalties  and  export  duties).  Total  capital  expenditure  is  estimated  at 
US$1.67bn (including pre-commitment capital, owners cost and contingency, but excluding life of mine sustaining capital and 
off-site road and power reticulation upgrades). The initial economic report confirms the company’s confidence in its DFS 
programme scheduled for completion early 2013.  
 
The estimates contained in the initial economic report are preliminary in nature, include Inferred Mineral Resources that are 
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 
categorized as Mineral Reserves and there is no certainty that the estimates contained in the initial economic report will be 
realized. 
 
Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) 
The  Company  announced  that  it  had  filed  a  preliminary  prospectus  dated  22  June  2011  with  the  securities  regulatory 
authorities in each of the provinces and territories of Canada except Québec in connection with the IPO on the TSX. BMO 
Capital Markets and Renaissance Capital have been appointed as Joint Book runners on the IPO. 
 
The company has subsequently filed on SEDAR an amended and restated preliminary prospectus dated July 2011. The 
Company subsequently listed on the TSX on 17 August 2011.

Project Background 
On  the  24th  of  August  2009  the  company  was  awarded  an  exclusive  exploration  license  covering  the  Sintoukola  Potash 
project situated in the Republic of Congo (see Figure 1). This license is valid for three years and extendable twice for periods 
of two years. On the 27th of August an Exploration Convention was agreed between the company and representatives of the 
Ministry of Mines in the ROC. This convention details the schedule and proposed work program required to be completed by 
the company over the next three years and allows for exploration activities to commence. 
 
The Sintoukola Potash Research Permit covers an area of 1,436.5 km2 and is located over the Congolese Coastal Basin 
which extends for over 200 kilometres from Gabon to Angola. The basin varies in width up to 50 kilometres and contains 
evaporite sequences ranging from 300-900 metres in thickness (see Figure 1). The license lies approximately 50 kilometres 
to the north of the Holle Mine, a historic potash producer, which produced 7.4 million tonnes of sylvinite grading 27.7% K2O, 
and the Kouilou potash deposit currently being developed by Mag Industries Corporation (TSX). 
 
Prior to the awarding of the Research Permit, the company reviewed historic data on the Sintoukola Potash project under a 
non-exclusive prospecting license issued by the ROC Department of Mines. This review was undertaken by CSA Global Pty 
Ltd (CSA); an international geological, mining and management consulting company with offices in Perth, Darwin, Brisbane, 
Jakarta and the United Kingdom.  
 
CSA concluded that Sintoukola is prospective for both sylvinite and carnallite mineralisation and considers the Kola prospect, 
situated in the north-east of the exploration license, to contain an Exploration Target* of between 170 and 300 million tonnes 
of sylvinite grading between 23.1% K2O and 23.5% K2O.  CSA have also indicated (based on historic logs) that two to three 
layers of carnallite mineralization exists below the sylvinite mineralization, at an approximate depth of greater than 350m. The 
grade is however, unknown. A schematic cross-section of the Kola Prospect is illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
*The potential quantity and grade of the Exploration Target is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to 
define a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource.

Iron – Western Australia 
Exploration of the company’s Forrestania Project in Western Australia (see Figure 7) was continued.  Activities focused on 
the assessment of the iron, gold and nickel potential and comprised:
•  Regional interpretation of geophysical data.  
•  Geological mapping, rock-chip and soil sampling.
Figure 7: Regional map of southwest Western Australia showing location of the Forrestania Project
The geophysical study involved reprocessing of the company’s ground magnetic data and publicly available aeromagnetic 
data to allow integration of the datasets and geological interpretation. The results suggest that the main magnetic features 
(see  Figure  8:  i,  ii)  are  shallower  (20m  vs.  50m),  significantly  longer  (6km  vs.  2km)  and  thicker  (240m  vs.  135m)  than 
previously thought.   
 
A brief field visit was completed to “ground check” the magnetic anomalies and conduct general reconnaissance exploration. 
Geological mapping confirmed the presence of banded iron formation (BIF) coincident with some magnetic features.  Rock-
chip samples of the BIF were collected and sent for analysis at Genalysis Laboratories in Perth, Western Australia for iron 
and  associated  elements  via  XRF.  The  results  of  eight  samples  indicate  the  unit  has  a  moderate  iron  content  (43%), 
moderate to high phosphorous (0.07%), moderate to low alumina (0.62%) and average LOI of 2.82%.  The next stage of work 
will require drilling to assess the geometry and composition of the magnetic body and to collect sample for metallurgical 
testing.  
 
Soil sampling was completed over an area in the northern part of the licence that was previously identified by an MMI soil 
survey  as  being  weakly  anomalous  in  gold  (2ppb  Au).  Some  57  minus  80  mesh  soil  samples  were  collected  across  an 
interpreted NNE trending structure and were submitted to Genalysis Laboratories, Perth for aqua digest with an AAS finish.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (CONT)
Results confirmed the presence of the MMI anomaly with a peak value of 4.9ppb Au.  Gold in soil mineralisation was also 
found to have a strong NNE trend parallel to the interpreted structure which offsets a strong magnetic feature (see Figure 8: 
iv). An additional 32 minus 80 mesh samples were collected across the magnetic body and assayed using a field portable 
Innov-X  XRF  analyser  for  nickel,  copper,  iron  and  cobalt.  The  data  indicated  weak,  coincident  nickel-copper-cobalt 
mineralization  over  the  target,  however  the  values  were  significantly  less  than  those  obtained  from  the  previous  MMI 
sampling. Additional soil sampling will be required to better define areas of gold and nickel anomalism followed by RAB 
drilling to assess the geology, structure and test for mineralisation.

Remuneration Report - Audited 
This report details the nature and amount of remuneration for each director of Elemental Minerals Limited and for 
the executives receiving the highest remuneration. 
 
Remuneration policy 
The  remuneration  policy  of  Elemental  Minerals  Limited  has  been  designed  to  align  director  and  executive 
objectives with shareholder and business objectives by providing a fixed remuneration component and offering 
specific long-term incentives based on key performance areas affecting the Group’s financial results. The board of 
Elemental Minerals Limited believes the remuneration policy to be appropriate and effective in its ability to attract 
and retain high calibre executives and directors to run and manage the Group. 
 
The remuneration policy, setting the terms and conditions for the executive directors and other senior executives, 
was developed by the board. All executives receive a base salary (which is based on factors such as length of 
service and experience) and superannuation. The board reviews executive packages annually by reference to the 
Group’s performance, executive performance and comparable information from industry sectors and other listed 
companies in similar industries.
26
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONT)
The board may exercise discretion in relation to approving incentives, bonuses and options. The policy is designed 
to attract and retain the highest calibre of executives and reward them for performance that results in long-term 
growth  in  shareholder  wealth.  Executives  are  also  entitled  to  participate  in  the  employee  share  and  option 
arrangements. 
 
Executive  directors  and  senior  management  receive  a  superannuation  guarantee  contribution  required  by  the 
government, which is currently 9%, and do not receive any other retirement benefits. Some individuals, however, 
may choose to sacrifice part of their salary to increase payments towards superannuation. 
 
The board policy is to remunerate non-executive directors at market rates for comparable companies for time, 
commitment and responsibilities. The board determines payments to the non-executive directors and reviews their 
remuneration annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought 
when required. The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.  Fees for non-executive directors are not linked to the 
performance  of  the  Group.  However,  to  align  directors’  interests  with  shareholder  interests,  the  directors  are 
encouraged to hold shares in the company and are able to participate in employee option plans.

Non-audit Services 
The board of directors is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year is compatible with the 
general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. The directors are satisfied 
that non-audit services below did not compromise the external auditor’s independence for the following reasons: 
 
−
all non-audit services are reviewed and approved by the board prior to commencement to ensure they do 
not adversely affect the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and 
the  nature  of  the  services  provided  do  not  compromise  the  general  principles  relating  to  auditor 
independence  in  accordance  with  APES:110  Code  of  Ethics  for  Professional  Accountants  set  by  the 
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board.
Indemnifying Officers and Auditor 
The Company has agreed to indemnify the directors of the Company, against all liabilities to another person that 
may arise from their position as directors of the Company and its controlled entities, except where the liability 
arises out of conduct involving a lack of good faith. 
During  the  financial  year  the  Company  agreed  to  pay  an  annual  insurance  premium  of  $16,070  in  respect  of 
directors’ and officers’ liability and legal expenses’ insurance contracts, for directors, officers and employees of the 
Company.  The insurance premium relates to:
•  costs and expenses incurred by the relevant officers in defending proceedings, whether civil or criminal and

•  other liabilities that may arise from their position, with the exception of conduct involving a wilful breach of

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Elemental Minerals Ltd (the company) is a public company incorporated and domiciled in Australia and dual listed on 
the  Australian  Securities  Exchange  and  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange.  The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the 
company as at and for the year ended 30 June 2011 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 
the “Group”). The Group is involved in mining and exploration activity in Australia and Central Africa. 
 
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 26 September 2011. 
 
Basis of preparation 
(a)  Statement of compliance 
The  financial  report  is  a  general  purpose  financial  report  that  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian 
Accounting Standards(AASBs) (including Australian Interpretations) adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards 
Board  (AASB)  and  the  Corporations  Act  2001.  Compliance  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  ensures  that  the 
financial statements and notes comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards. 
  
(b)  Basis of measurement 
The financial report has also been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and 
available-for-sale investments, which have been measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and 
liabilities that are hedged items in fair value hedges, and are otherwise carried at cost, are adjusted to record changes 
in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.  Cost is based on the fair values of the considerations 
given in exchange for assets.  
 
(c)  Functional and presentation currency 
These financial statements are presented in Australian Dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency and the 
functional currency of the majority of the Group. 
 
(d)  Basis of Consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same 
reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Control exists where the company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into accounts. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred out of the Group.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses 
and profit and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions have been eliminated in full.
The acquisition of subsidiaries has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method 
of accounting involves allocating the cost of the business combination to the fair value of the assets acquired and the 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements 
include the results of subsidiaries for the period from their acquisition.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries not held by the Group and are 
presented separately in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and within equity in the consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position. 
 
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost.  
 
A list of controlled entities is contained in Note 7 to the financial statements.
44
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011
Income tax
(e) 
The charge for current income tax expenses is based on the profit for the year adjusted for any non-assessable or 
disallowed items.  It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or are substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. 
 
Deferred  tax  is  accounted  for  using  the  balance  sheet  liability  method  in  respect  of  temporary  differences  arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.  No deferred 
income  tax  will  be  recognised  from  the  initial  recognition  of  an  asset or  liability,  excluding  a business  combination, 
where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or liability is 
settled.  Deferred tax is credited in the income statement except where it relates to items that may be credited directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is adjusted directly against equity.   
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future tax profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
 
The amount of benefits brought to account or which may be realised in the future is based on the assumption that no 
adverse  change  will  occur in  income  taxation  legislation  and  the  anticipation  that  the  company  will  derive  sufficient 
future assessable income to enable the benefit to be realised and comply with the conditions of deductibility imposed by 
the law. 
 
 
(f)  Property, Plant and Equipment 
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value less, where applicable, any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. 
 
The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors to ensure it is not in excess of 
the recoverable amount from those assets.  The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash 
flows which will be received from the assets employment and subsequent disposal.  The expected net cash flows have 
not been discounted to present values in determining recoverable amounts. 
 
Depreciation  
The depreciable amount of all fixed assets including buildings, but excluding freehold land, is depreciated on a straight 
line basis over their estimated useful lives to the Company commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use. 
 
The depreciation rates used for the plant and equipment is in the range of 20% - 40%. 
 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.  These gains or losses 
are  included  in the Statement  of  Comprehensive Income.  When  revalued  assets  are  sold, amounts  included  in  the 
revaluation reserve relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings.

Impairment of Assets
(g) 
(i)  Financial Assets 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is 
impaired.  A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.  An 
impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value.  Individually 
Group financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.  The remaining financial assets are assessed 
collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.  All impairment losses are recognised either in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income or revaluation reserves in the period in which the impairment arises. 
 
(i)  Exploration and Evaluation Assets 
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount at the reporting date.
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment in respect of cash generating units, which are no larger 
than the area of interest to which the assets relate.
(ii)  Non-financial Assets Other Than Exploration and Evaluation Assets 
The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Consolidated  Entity’s  non-financial  assets,  are  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date  to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated.  For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, 
the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. 
 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount.  Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Impairment losses recognised 
in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
units, then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. 
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in 
prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exits.  An 
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.  An 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss has been recognised. 
 
(h)  Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity and the revenue 
can be reliably measured. 
 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011
(i)  Trade and other Receivables 
All trade receivables are recognised when invoiced as they are due for settlement in the short term. 
 
Collectibility of trade and other receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Debts which are known to be uncollectible 
are written off.  A provision for doubtful debts is raised when some doubt as to collection exits. 
 
(j)  Trade and other payables 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the entity prior to the end of the financial year 
and which are unpaid.  The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
(k)  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash includes deposits at call with financial institutions and other highly 
liquid investments with short periods to maturity which is readily convertible to cash on hand and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial Instruments
(l) 
The Company classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets.  The classification depends on the purpose for  
which the investments were acquired.  Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition 
and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
This category has two sub-categories; financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value 
through  profit  or  loss  on  initial  recognition.    A  financial  asset  is  classified  in  this  category  if  acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by management.  The policy of 
management is to designate a financial asset if there exists the possibility it will be sold in the short term 
and the asset is subject to frequent changes in fair value.  Assets in this category are classified as current 
assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market.  They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a 
debtor with no intention of selling the receivable.  They are included in current assets, except for those with 
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.  
Loans and receivables are included in receivables in the balance sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives 
that  are  either  designated  in  this  category  or  not  classified  in  any  of  the  other  categories.    They  are 
included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months 
of the balance sheet date.

(l)
Financial Instruments (cont)
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date being the date on which the company 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.  Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction 
costs  for  all  financial  assets  not  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.    Financial  assets  are 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been 
transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
 
Available-for-sale  financial  assets  and  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  and  loss  are 
subsequently carried at fair value.  Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.  Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the 
‘financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss’  category  are  included  in  the  Statement  of 
Comprehensive  Income  in  the  period  in  which  they  arise.    Unrealised  gains  and  losses  arising  from 
changes in the fair value of non monetary securities classified as available-for-sale investments revaluation 
reserve are recognised in equity in the “available for sale revaluation reserve”. When securities classified 
as  available-for-sale  are  sold  or  impaired,  the  accumulated  fair  value  adjustments  are  included  in  the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as gains and losses from investment securities. 
 
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices.  If the market for a financial asset is 
not active (and for unlisted securities), the Company establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.  
These  include  reference  to  the  fair  values  of  recent  arm’s  length  transactions,  involving  the  same 
instruments or other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option 
pricing methods refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances. 
 
The Company assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or 
group of financial assets is impaired.  In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a 
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security below its cost is considered in determining 
whether the security is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference  between  the  acquisition  cost  and  the  current  fair  value,  less  any  impairment  loss  on  that 
financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  profit  and  loss,  is  removed  from  equity  and  recognised  in  the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Impairment losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on equity instruments are not reversed through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011
(m)  Fair Value Estimation 
The  fair  value  of  financial assets and  financial  liabilities  must be estimated  for  recognition and  measurement  or for 
disclosure purposes. 
 
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and 
available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  The quoted market price used 
for financial assets held by the entity is the current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is 
the current ask price. 
 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) 
is determined using valuation techniques.  The company uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are 
based  on  market  conditions  existing  at  each  balance  date.    Quoted  market  prices  or  dealer  quotes  for  similar 
instruments are used for long-term debt instruments held.  Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, 
are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.  
 
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate 
their fair values.  The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future 
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the entity for similar financial instruments.
(n)  Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is 
not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office.  In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense.  Receivables and payables in the balance sheet are shown 
inclusive of GST. 
 
Cash flows are presented in the Statement of Cash Flow on a gross basis, except for the GST component of investing 
and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011
(o)  Capitalisation of exploration and evaluation expenditure 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest are recognised as an exploration 
and evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) 
(ii)
the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and 
at least one of the following conditions is also met:
a)  the  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through  successful
development and exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or
b)  exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a 
stage  which  permits  a  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically 
recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest 
are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost and include acquisition of rights to explore, studies, 
exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities and an allocation of depreciation and amortised of 
assets  used  in  exploration  and  evaluation  activities.  General  and  administrative  costs  are  only  included  in  the 
measurement of exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to operational activities in a particular 
area of interest. 
 
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the 
exploration and evaluation asset (for the cash generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated being no larger than the 
relevant area of interest) is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where an impairment loss 
subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. 
 
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit in the year in which the decision 
to abandon the area is made.  
 
When production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortised over the life of the 
area according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves. 
 
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward 
costs in relation to that area of interest. 
 
Costs of site restoration are provided over the life of the facility from when exploration commences and are included in 
the  costs  of  that  stage.  Site  restoration  costs  include  the  dismantling  and  removal  of  mining  plant,  equipment  and 
building structures, waste removal, and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with clauses of the mining or petroleum 
permits. Such costs have been determined using estimates of future costs, current legal requirements and technology 
on an undiscounted basis. 
 
Any  changes  in  the  estimates  for  the  costs  are accounted  on  a  prospective basis.  In  determining  the  costs  of  site 
restoration, there is uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of the restoration due to community expectations and 
future legislation. Accordingly the costs have been determined on the basis that the restoration will be completed within 
one year of abandoning the site.

(p)  Acquisition of Assets 
The purchase method of accounting is used for all acquisitions of assets regardless of whether equity instruments or 
other assets  are  acquired.    Cost  is  determined  as the  fair  value  of the  assets given up,  shares issued or  liabilities 
undertaken at the date of acquisition plus incidental costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
(q)  Share Based Payments 
The fair value of options and shares of the Company issued to directors and other parties is recognised as an expense 
in the financial statements in relation to the granting of those options and shares. 
 
(r)
Employee Benefits 
(i)
Wages, salaries and annual leave 
Liabilities for wages, salaries and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting 
date are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the reporting date and are measured at the 
amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
 
Superannuation 
Contributions  are  made  by  the  company  to  superannuation  funds  as  stipulated  by  statutory 
requirements and are charged as expenses when incurred.
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
Employee benefit on costs 
Employee benefit  on  costs,  including payroll  tax,  are  recognised  and  included  in  employee  benefits 
liabilities and costs when the employee benefits to which they relate are recognised as liabilities.
Options 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity.  The fair value is measured at grant date. 
 
The fair value at grant rate is independently determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model 
that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the vesting and performance criteria, 
the impact of dilution, the tradeable nature of the option, the share price at grant date and expected 
price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the 
term of the option. 
 
Upon the exercise of options, the balance of the share based payments relating to those options is 
transferred to share capital.
(s)
Earnings Per Share 
(i)
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the net profit after income tax attributable to members 
of  the  company,  excluding  any  costs  of  servicing  equity  other  than  ordinary  shares,  by  the  weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in 
ordinary shares issued during the year.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take 
into  account  the  after  income  tax  effect  of  interest  and  other  financing  costs  associated  with  dilutive 
potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no 
consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(ii)  Diluted earnings per share

Issued Capital
(t) 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax,  from  the  proceeds.    Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  issue  of  new  shares  or  options,  or  for  the 
acquisition of a business, are included in the cost of the acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
(u)  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Significant accounting judgements include:
Significant accounting estimates and assumptions include:
(i)  
 
Exploration and evaluation costs 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area of interest.  
These costs are carried forward in respect of an area that has not at balance sheet date reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active 
Group operations in, or relating to, the area of interest are continuing. 
 
(ii)  
 
Share based payment transactions 
The  Group  measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  with  management  personnel  and  consultants  by 
reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  instruments  at  the  date  at  which  they  are  granted.  The  fair  value  is 
determined using the Black Scholes model, with the assumptions detailed in note 22. The accounting estimates 
and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact expenses and equity. 
 
The Group measures the cost of cash settled share-based payments at fair value at the grant date using the 
black Scholes formula taking into account the terms and conditions under which the instruments were granted. 
 
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets and investments in and loans to subsidiaries 
The  ultimate  recoupment  of  the  value  of  exploration  and  evaluation  assets,  the  company’s  investment  in 
subsidiaries, and loans to subsidiaries is dependent on the successful development and commercial exploitation, 
or alternatively, sale, of the exploration and evaluation assets. 
 
Impairment tests are carried out on a regular basis to identify whether the asset carrying values exceed their 
recoverable amounts.  There is Group estimation and judgement in determining the inputs and assumptions used 
in determining the recoverable amounts. 
 
The key areas of judgement and estimation include: 
− Recent exploration and evaluation results and resource estimates; 
− Environmental issues that may impact on the underlying tenements; 
− Fundamental  economic  factors  that  have  an  impact  on  the  operations  and  carrying  values  of  assets  and 
liabilities. 
 
Classification of investments 
The Company has decided to classify investments in listed securities as available for sale.  These securities are 
accounted for at fair value.  Any increments or decrements in their value at year end are charged or credited to 
the asset revaluation reserve.
52
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011
Income tax expenses 
Judgement  is  required  in  assessing  whether  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognised  on  the  Statement  of 
Financial Position.  Deferred tax assets, including those arising from temporary differences, are recognised only when it 
is  considered  more  likely  than  not  that  they  will  be  recovered,  which  is  dependent  on  the  generation  of  future 
assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefits to be utilised. 
 
Estimation of useful lives of assets 
The  estimation  of  the  useful  lives  of  assets  has  been  based  on  historical  experience  as  well  as  manufacturers’ 
warranties (for plant and equipment) and turnover policies (for motor vehicles). In addition, the condition of assets is 
assessed at least once per year and considered against the remaining useful life. Adjustments to useful life are made 
when considered necessary. Depreciation policy is included in note 1(g).
Foreign currency transactions and balances
(v) 
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Australian dollars. 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the 
date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
 
All  differences  in  the  consolidated  financial  report  are  taken  to  the  Statement  of  Comprehensive  Income  with  the 
exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign 
entity.  These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of a net investment, at which time they are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
 
Non-monetary  items  that  are  measured  in  terms  of  historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the 
exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction.   
 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date the 
fair value was determined. 
 
The functional currency of the overseas subsidiary is CFA Franc BEAC (XAF). 
 
As  at  the  reporting  date,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  these  overseas  subsidiaries  are  translated  into  the  reporting 
currency of the Company at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. 
 
The exchange differences on the retranslation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. 
 
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
 
(w)  
Operating  segments  are  reported  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  internal  reporting  provided  to  the  chief 
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of directors, which is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

NOTE 15: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Overview 
The Company and Group have exposure to the following risks from their use of financial instruments:
•  market risk,  
•  credit risk, and  
liquidity risks.  
•
The  Group’s  overall  risk  management  program  focuses  on  the  unpredictability  of  financial  markets  and  seeks  to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the business. The Group will use different methods to 
measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest 
rate, foreign exchange and other price risks and ageing analysis for credit risk.  
 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, their objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital. 
 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. 
Management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through regular reviews 
of the risks. 
 
(a) 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management 
is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
Market Risk
(i)  Foreign exchange risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other 
than the respective functional currencies of the Group, primarily the CFA Franc BEAC (XAF) and the Australian 
Dollar (AUD). The Group holds most of its cash in Australian Dollars.  The parent entity has exposure to the 
CFA Franc BEAC currency by virtue of its loans to overseas subsidiaries.

A change of 100 basis point in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) equity or profit or

Financial assets 
Trade receivables from other entities are carried at cost less any allowance for doubtful debts. Other receivables 
are carried at cost. Interest is recorded as income on an accruals basis. 
 
Financial liabilities 
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received, whether or not billed 
to the group. 
 
Net fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 2011 is equivalent to the fair value.
(iii) Commodity price risk 
As the Group is exploring for a variety of minerals including gold, potash and other base metals in Africa, it will 
be exposed to the risks of fluctuation in prices for those minerals. The market for all of these items has a history 
of volatility, moving not only with the standard forces of supply and demand, but also in the case of gold and 
diamonds to investment and disinvestment. Prices fluctuate widely in response to changing levels of supply and 
demand but, in the long run, prices are related to the marginal cost of supply.
Credit risk
(b) 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash and investment 
deposits. The Group has adopted the policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient 
collateral or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties 
having similar characteristics.  The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any 
provisions for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Liquidity and capital risk
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011 
NOTE 15: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT) 
The  Company  and  Group  have  established  an  allowance  for  impairment  that  represents  their  estimate  of  incurred 
losses in respect of other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss 
component that relates to individually significant exposures. The management does not expect any counterparty to fail 
to meet its obligations.  
 
(c) 
The Group’s total capital is defined as the shareholders’ net equity plus any net debt. The objectives when managing 
the Company’s capital is to safeguard the business as a going concern, to maximise returns to shareholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the cost of capital. 
 
The Group does not have a target debt / equity ratio, but has a policy of maintaining a flexible financing structure so as 
to be able to take advantage of investment opportunities when they arise. There are no externally imposed capital 
requirements. 
 
There have been no changes in the strategy adopted by management to control the capital of the Group since the prior 
year.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring  unacceptable  losses  or  risking 
damage to the Group’s reputation. 
 
The  Group  manages  liquidity  risk  by  maintaining  adequate  reserves  by  continuously  monitoring  forecast  and  actual 
cash flows.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011 
NOTE 15: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT) 
If  the  Company  anticipates  a need  to  raise  additional  capital  in  the  next  12  months to  meet forecasted  operational 
activities, then the decision on how the Company will raise future capital will depend on market conditions existing at 
that time. 
 
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period 
of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances 
that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
NOTE 16: SEGMENT INFORMATION 
Management has determined based on reports reviewed by the board of directors, that are used to make strategic

NOTE 18: COMMITMENTS FOR EXPENDITURE (CONT)

Professional Services Contracts 
The Corporation has entered into contracts for various engineering and consulting services. These contracts relate to 
preparation of technical reports and assisting with marketing. 
 
On April 5, 2011, the Corporation entered into a contract with SRK Consulting (‘‘SRK’’) as lead consultant in respect to 
its DFS, which is currently underway. The total value of this contract is based on SRK’s best estimate of the work 
required against hourly rates for 2011, which is US$1,277,120; therefore, the contract amount is not considered a lump 
sum or capped about. The work is expected to be performed over the period of two years and the hourly rates are 
expected to increase by 5% in 2012. The contract provides for regular invoicing and US$35,000 has been paid for 
services rendered to date. 
 
On March 18, 2011, the Corporation entered into a contract with Meridian Drilling Ltd, a UK drilling contractor, for the 
provision of drilling services to advance the Phase 2 exploration programme. The total value of this contract is expected 
to be in the region of US$8,000,000, depending on the amount of drilling conducted and the cost per drill hole. The 
contract is based on a guaranteed minimum of 9,500 m of drilling. A deposit of US$700,000 has been paid to date, 
which will be returned to the Corporation at a rate of US$100,000 per hole for the last seven diamond drill holes, until 
the entire deposit has been returned. Invoices to the Corporation will be issued monthly and will be based the daily 
drilling  report  presented  to  the  Corporation’s  representative  for  approval.  Payment  on  the  invoices  is  due  within  15 
calendar days of receipt by the Corporation. In the event the Corporation terminates the contract prior to the completion 
of 9,500 m of drilling, the Corporation must pay any fees due to that date and a cancellation fee equivalent to the fees 
chargeable for the undrilled meterage up to 9,500 m.

NOTE 23: LOSS PER SHARE 
Classification of securities as ordinary shares 
The Company has only one category of ordinary shares included in basic earnings per share. 
 
Classification of securities as potential ordinary shares – share options outstanding 
The Company has granted share options in respect of a total of 33,262,002 ordinary shares at 30 June 2011. Options 
are considered to be potential ordinary shares.  However, as the Company is in a loss position they are anti-dilutive in 
nature,  as  their  exercise  will  not  result  in  a  diluted  earnings  per  share  that  shows  an  inferior  view  of  earnings 
performance of the Company than is shown by basic earnings per share.  The options have not been included in the 
determination of basic earnings per share.

NOTE 26: RECLASSIFICATION OF EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE WRITTEN OFF 
For the year ended 30 June 2010, the company and consolidated entity received a qualified audit report in relation to 
unsubstantiated exploration expenditure. Subsequently to this qualified audit report, the Directors engaged the auditor, 
in July 2011 (under ASA 805 Special Considerations – Audits of Single Financial Statements and Specific Elements, 
Accounts or Items of a Financial Statement) to undertake an audit of the exploration expenditure that was the subject of 
this qualification. This resulted in the auditor confirming that exploration expenditure capitalised into the statement of 
financial position of $11,299,210 and exploration expenditure written off in the statement of comprehensive income of 
$2,427,915 presented fairly in all material respects. 
 
It has been  assessed that out of the $2,427,915 expensed, there were amounts totalling $1,401,292 which represented 
cash calls made by the parent entity to the subsidiary. These cash calls were made to enable the subsidiary to meet 
various local expenditure in relation to the exploration and drilling program. This amount of $1,401,292 therefore has 
been reversed from the expenditure and capitalised at 30 June 2010.  
 
This treatment has resulted in reducing the loss for the year ended 30 June 2010 to from $9,133,387 to $7,732,095. The 
basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2010 has also reduced from 9.45 cents per share to 8.13 
cents  per  share.  The  capitalised  exploration,  evaluation  and  development  expenditure  as  at  30  June  2010  has 
increased  to  $12,700,502  from  $11,299,210  and  the  group  net  assets  as  at  30  June  2010  have  increased  to 
$19,224,171 from $17,822,879.
