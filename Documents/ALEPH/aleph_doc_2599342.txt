1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX.
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a 
corporate governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a 
statement is located. The corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the 
recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a 
recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate governance statement must separately identify that 
recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not following the recommendation and 
what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its 
annual report, it must lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. The corporate governance statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the 
purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 
which discloses the extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council 
during a particular reporting period.
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, 
where the entity’s corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable.
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not 
applicable and just retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and 
you delete the other options, you can also, if you wish, delete the “OR” at the end of the selection.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2016
INTRODUCTION 
 
Apollo Minerals Limited (Apollo Minerals or Company) and the entities it controls believe corporate governance 
is a critical pillar on which business objectives and, in turn, shareholder value must be built.  
 
The  Board  has  adopted  a  suite  of  charters  and  key  corporate  governance  documents  which  articulate  the 
policies and procedures followed by Apollo Minerals.  
 
These  documents  are  available 
the  Company’s  website, 
www.apollominerals.com.au/corporate-governance. These documents are reviewed at least annually to address 
any changes in governance practices and the law.  
 
This Corporate Governance Statement (Statement), which is current as at 30 June 2016 and has been approved 
by the Company’s Board, explains how Apollo Minerals complies with the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s 
‘Corporate  Governance  Principles  and  Recommendations  –  3rd  Edition’  published  on  27  March  2014  (ASX 
Principles and Recommendations), in relation to the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
In  addition  to  the  ASX  Principles  and  Recommendations,  the  Board  has  taken  into  account  a  number  of 
important factors in determining its corporate governance policies and procedures, including the:
the  Corporate  Governance  section  of

candidates
Apollo  Minerals  carefully  considers  the  character,  experience, 
education and skillset of potential candidates for appointment to 
the Board and conducts appropriate background checks to verify 
the sustainability of the candidate, prior to their election.
Based  on  the  Company’s  level  of  knowledge  of  the  potential 
candidate,  these  may  include  checks  as  to  the  person’s 
character,  experience,  education,  and  bankruptcy  history,  but 
may  not  include  criminal  record  checks  for  potential  candidates 
that are well known to the Board.
The  Company  has  appropriate  procedures  in  place  to  ensure 
that material information relevant to a decision to elect or re-elect 
a director, is disclosed in the relevant notice of meeting provided 
to  shareholders.  Director  profiles  are  also  included  in  the

Company is not currently of a size to  warrant the time and cost 
of adopting a Diversity Policy and setting measurable objectives 
for achieving gender diversity. The Board will review its position 
and  may  adopt  a  Diversity  Policy  and  develop  measurable 
objectives when the Company’s operations increase.
At  the  date  of  this  Statement,  the  Company  has  no  female 
directors, senior executives or employees.
The  Board has  not  conducted  a  formal  performance  evaluation. 
The  Company  is  a  junior  resources  company  and  the  Board 
believes that a formal performance evaluation is not required at 
this  point  in  time  and  that  that  no  efficiencies  or  other  benefits 
would be gained from a formal performance evaluation.
The  Chairman  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  Board  and 
informal  discussions  are  undertaken  during  the  course  of  the 
year.  As  the  Company  grows  and  develops,  it  will  continue  to

Corporate  Governance  Council’s  factors  relevant  to  assessing 
the  independence  of  a  director,  is  not  considered  to  be

Mr Mark Pearce was appointed a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company on 8 July 2016 and is considered to be independent. 
With effect from 1 July 2016, Apollo Group Pty Ltd, a company 
associated  with  Mr  Pearce,  is  paid  a  monthly  retainer  to 
provide  administrative  services,  company  secretarial  services, 
accounting  services  and  a  serviced  office  to  the  Company, 
which  is  able  to  be  terminated  with  one  months’  notice.    The 
Board  considers  that  this  relationship  is  not  material  or 
significant  enough  to  impact  the  independent  judgment  of  Mr 
Pearce.

The  Board  believes  that  the  individuals  on  the  Board  can 
make, and do make, quality and independent judgments in the 
best interests of the Company on all relevant issues.
Directors  having  a conflict  of interest  in  relation to  a particular 
item  of  business  must  absent  themselves  from  the  Board 
meeting before commencement of discussion on the topic.
2.5  Chair independent  Mr  Richard  Shemesian  was  Chairman  of  the  Company  until  8 
July  2016  when  he  was  replaced  by  Mr  Ian  Middlemas.  Mr 
Shemesian is not considered to be independent.

The current Chairman, Mr Ian Middlemas, is not considered to 
be an independent non-executive Director. The Board believes 
that  the  Chairman  can  make,  and  does  make,  quality  and 
independent  judgments  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Company

The  role  of  the  Managing  Director  and  CEO  is  performed  by 
another Director. Further details regarding the Directors are set

2.6  Induction and
professional 
development
The  Board  does  not  have  a  formal  program  for  inducting  new 
Directors  and  providing  appropriate  professional  development 
opportunities.
No
The  Board  has  been  structured  such  that  its  composition  and 
size will enable it to effectively discharge its responsibilities and 
duties.  Each  Director  has  been  appointed  because  they 
already  possess  the  relevant  industry  experience  and  specific 
expertise  relevant  to  the  Company’s  business  and  level  of 
operations  and  given  the  activities  of  the  Company  and  their 
own experience do not require the Company, given its size, to 
provide professional development opportunities.
However,  each  new  Director  receives  and  commits  to  a  letter 
of  appointment  which  includes  details  of  the  Company’s  key 
policies  and  processes  and 
continuing  professional 
development is expected of all Directors.
Directors  are  also  entitled  to  seek  independent  professional 
advice at the expense of the Company (subject to approval) as 
may  be  reasonably  required  to  assist  them  to  carry  out  their 
duties as a Director.
