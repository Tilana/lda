<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolution 12/27 of 2 October 2009 and relevant 
Commission on Human Rights resolutions, the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the 
Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (hereinafter referred 
to as &#8220;the Guidelines&#8221;), annexed to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/33, 
which provide guidance to ensuring the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights 
in the context of HIV, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the significance of the comprehensive review in 2011, as requested by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 65/180 of 20 December 2010, which will mark three 
decades of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the ten-year review of the Declaration of Commitment 
on HIV/AIDS and its time-bound measurable goals and targets, and the five-year review of 
the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS with the goal of achieving universal access to 
comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolution 15/22 of 30 September 2010, on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> that almost ten million HIV-positive people in low- and 
middle-income countries lack access to antiretroviral therapy, particularly in sub-Saharan 
Africa, that an estimated one million end-stage AIDS patients have no access to treatment 
for moderate to severe pain, and that many people in need fail to receive treatment for 
tuberculosis and other HIV-related opportunistic infections, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that it is the responsibility of States 
to ensure access for all, without discrimination, to medicines, in particular essential 
medicines that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the right to use, to the fullest extent, the provisions contained in the 
World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPS Agreement), the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public 
Health, the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 30 August 
2003 on the implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration and, when formal 
acceptance procedures are completed, the amendments to article 31 of the TRIPS 
Agreement, as proposed by the World Trade Organization&#8217;s General Council in its decision 
of 6 December 2005,which provide flexibilities for the protection of public health, and, in 
particular, to promote access to medicines for all, encouraging the provision of assistance to 
developing countries in this regard and calling for a broad and timely acceptance of the 
amendments to article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and 
Intellectual Property, adopted by the World Health Assembly on 24 May 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the urgent need to scale up efforts significantly towards the goal of 
universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> World Health Assembly resolutions 62.12, on primary health care, 
including health system strengthening, and 62.14, on reducing health inequities through 
action on the social determinants of health, of 22 May 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing deep concern</i> that HIV infection significantly increases the risk of 
maternal mortality and morbidity and that, in countries with high HIV prevalence, AIDS-
related complications are one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> <i>with concern</i> that more than sixteen million children under the age of 18 
have been orphaned by AIDS, and that about fourteen million eight hundred thousand of 
these children live in sub-Saharan Africa, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned </i>at the continuing high prevalence of HIV among key populations at 
higher risk, as defined in the 2011-2015 Strategy of the Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS, endnote 41 (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;key populations&#8221;), and the need to 
ensure their unimpeded access to HIV-related prevention, treatment, care and support; 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned also </i>at the instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, 
stigma, violence and abuses, which affect the enjoyment of human rights and can lead to 
particular targeting of people living with, presumed to be living with or affected by 
HIV/AIDS and members of key populations, as well as to increased vulnerability to HIV, 
and also recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen programmes or measures 
to eradicate multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, in particular by adopting or 
improving penal or civil legislation to address these phenomena, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of achieving Millennium Development Goal 6 (combat 
HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases), and noting that poverty, inequality and food 
insecurity increase people&#8217;s vulnerability to HIV, posing increased risks of infection to </p>


<p>populations in every region, while at the same time undermining the socio-economic 
conditions of people living with HIV or those affected by the epidemic, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are major obstacles to an 
effective HIV response, that discrimination on the basis of HIV status, actual or presumed, 
is prohibited by existing international human rights standards and that the term &#8220;or other 
status&#8221; in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts should be 
interpreted as covering health status, including HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing, </i>in view of the increasing challenges presented by HIV/AIDS, 
including apparent trends to enact criminal and other laws that are counterproductive to 
HIV prevention, treatment, care and support efforts, and the ongoing application of HIV-
specific restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of HIV-positive people, the need for 
intensified efforts to ensure universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all in order to reduce vulnerability to HIV, prevent HIV/AIDS-
related discrimination and stigma and reduce the impact of AIDS, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>resolutions 53/2 of 13 March 2009 and 54/2 of 12 March 2010 of the 
Commission on the Status of Women, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the vision of zero new infections, zero AIDS-related deaths and zero 
discrimination, enshrined in the 2011-2015 Strategy of the Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolutions 53/9 on achieving universal 
access to prevention, treatment, care and support for drug users and people living with or 
affected by HIV, and 53/4 on promoting adequate availability of internationally controlled 
licit drugs for medical and scientific purposes while preventing their diversion and abuse, 
of 12 March 2010, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with appreciation</i> the adoption of the International Labour Organization 
Recommendation concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work, 2010 (No. 200) at the 
ninety-ninth International Labour Conference, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with appreciation</i> <i>also</i> resolution 63.19 of 21 May 2010, entitled &#8220;WHO 
HIV/AIDS strategy for 2011-2015&#8221;, of the World Health Assembly, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the 
General Assembly, entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals&#8221;, contained in General Assembly resolution 65/1, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 63/33 of 26 November 2008, 64/108 of 10 
December and 65/95 of 9 December 2010, on global health and foreign policy, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting </i>the establishment, in June 2010, of the Global Commission on HIV and the 
Law, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Affirms</i> that the protection of human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS,

</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure full and unimpeded access for all, particularly key

</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reiterates </i>the commitment to significantly intensify prevention efforts and

increase their capacity to protect themselves from the risk of HIV infection, and through the 
promotion and protection of all human rights; 
</p>
