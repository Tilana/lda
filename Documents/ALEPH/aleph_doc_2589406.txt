The quarterly report provides a basis for informing the market how the entity’s 
activities have been financed for the past quarter and the effect on its cash 
position.  An entity wanting to disclose additional information is encouraged to 
do so, in a note or notes attached to this report.
The “Nature of interest” (items 6.1 and 6.2) includes options in respect of 
interests in mining tenements and petroleum tenements acquired, exercised or 
lapsed during the reporting period.  If the entity is involved in a joint venture 
agreement and there are conditions precedent which will change its percentage 
interest in a mining tenement or petroleum tenement, it should disclose the 
change of percentage interest and conditions precedent in the list required for 
items 6.1 and 6.2.
Issued and quoted securities The issue price and amount paid up is not 
required in items 7.1 and 7.3 for fully paid securities.
The definitions in, and provisions of, AASB 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of 
Mineral Resources and AASB 107: Statement of Cash Flows apply to this report.
Accounting Standards ASX will accept, for example, the use of International 
Financial Reporting Standards for foreign entities.  If the standards used do not 
address a topic, the Australian standard on that topic (if any) must be complied 
with.
