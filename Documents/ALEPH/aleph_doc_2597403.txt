operating expenses. Financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet remain important differentiators
for our business. The two vessel sales during the quarter enabled us to pay down $5 million of debt
and is expected to help eliminate approximately $6.4 million in operating costs on an annual basis.
We have and intend to continue to actively manage our business while de-levering and
strengthening our balance sheet to drive results for all Aegean shareholders."

EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA
does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from
operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S.
GAAP, and our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that recorded by other
companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, vessel and investment impairments, gains/losses on vessel disposals and other non-
recurring exceptional items. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are included herein because they are
a basis upon which the Company assesses its operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA per metric ton of marine fuel sold represents the net income before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, vessel and investment impairments, gains/losses on vessel
disposals and other non-recurring exceptional items the Company generates per metric ton of
marine fuel sold. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA per metric ton of marine fuel sold by
dividing the EBITDA by the sales volume of marine fuel. Marine fuel sales do not include sales of
lubricants.
 
The following table reconciles net income attributable to AMPNI to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and

Gross spread on marine petroleum products represents the margin the Company generates on
sales of marine fuel and lubricants. Gross spread on marine fuel represents the margin that the
Company generates on sales of various classifications of marine fuel oil ("MFO") or marine gas oil
("MGO"). Gross spread on lubricants represents the margin that the Company generates on sales
of lubricants. Gross spread on marine petroleum products, gross spread of MFO and gross spread
on lubricants are not items recognized by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to gross profit or any other indicator of a Company's operating performance required by
U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of gross spread may not be the same as that used by other
companies in the same or other industries. The Company calculates the above-mentioned gross
spreads by subtracting from the sales of the respective marine petroleum product the cost of the
respective marine petroleum product sold and cargo transportation costs. For arrangements in
which the Company physically supplies the respective marine petroleum product using its
bunkering tankers, costs of the respective marine petroleum products sold represents amounts
paid by the Company for the respective marine petroleum product sold in the relevant reporting
period. For arrangements in which the respective marine petroleum product is purchased from the
Company's related company, Aegean Oil S.A., or Aegean Oil, cost of the respective marine
petroleum products sold represents the total amount paid by the Company to the physical supplier
for the respective marine petroleum product and its delivery to the custom arrangements, in which
the Company purchases cargos of marine fuel for its floating storage facilities. Transportation
costs may be included in the purchase price of marine fuels from the supplier or may be incurred
separately from a transportation provider. Gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold
represents the margin the Company generates per metric ton of marine fuel sold. The Company
calculates gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold by dividing the gross spread on marine
fuel by the sales volume of marine fuel. Marine fuel sales do not include sales of lubricants. The
following table reflects the calculation of gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold for the
periods presented:

The Company owns two barges, the Mediterranean and Umnenga, as floating storage facilities in
Greece and South Africa. The Company also operates on-land storage facilities in Las Palmas,
Fujairah, Tangiers, Panama, the U.S.A., Hamburg and Barcelona.
The ownership of storage facilities allows the Company to mitigate its risk of supply shortages.
Generally, storage costs are included in the price of refined marine fuel quoted by local suppliers.
The Company expects that the ownership of storage facilities will allow it to convert the variable
costs of this storage fee mark-up per metric ton quoted by suppliers into fixed costs of operating its
owned storage facilities, thus enabling the Company to spread larger sales volumes over a fixed
cost base and to decrease its refined fuel costs.

Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Working capital excluding
cash and debt is defined as current assets minus cash and cash equivalents minus restricted cash
minus current liabilities plus short-term borrowings plus current portion of long-term debt.
9.
Net income as adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation, provision for doubtful accounts,
restricted stock, amortization, deferred income taxes, gain/loss on sale of vessels, impairment
losses, unrealized loss/(gain) on derivatives and unrealized foreign exchange loss/(gain), net, is
used to assist in evaluating our ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Net income as
adjusted for non-cash items is not recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator
of the Company's performance required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The following table reflects the calculation of net income as adjusted for non-cash items for
the periods presented:

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking
statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their
business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals,
strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which
are other than statements of historical facts.
The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe
harbor legislation. The words "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "forecast," "plan,"
"potential," "may," "should," "expect" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of
which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, our management's
examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available
from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made,
because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies
which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we
will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.
In addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual
results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include our ability
to manage growth, our ability to maintain our business in light of our proposed business and location
expansion, our ability to obtain double hull secondhand bunkering tankers, the outcome of legal, tax
or regulatory proceedings to which we may become a party, adverse conditions in the shipping or
the marine fuel supply industries, our ability to retain our key suppliers and key customers, material
disruptions in the availability or supply of crude oil or refined petroleum products, changes in the
market price of petroleum, including the volatility of spot pricing, increased levels of competition,
compliance or lack of compliance with various environmental and other applicable laws and
regulations, our ability to collect accounts receivable, changes in the political, economic or
regulatory conditions in the markets in which we operate, and the world in general, our failure to
hedge certain financial risks associated with our business, our ability to maintain our current tax
treatments and our failure to comply with restrictions in our credit agreements and other factors.
Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete
discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties.

AEGEAN MARINE PETROLEUM NETWORK INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED) (Continued)
(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars –
except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)
1.Basis of presentation and general information:
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc. ("Aegean" or "AMPNI") and its subsidiaries (Aegean and its
subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company") and have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP") for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by US GAAP for
complete financial statements.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments,
which include only normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of33 the
Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that might be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in this report should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and trade accounts
payable reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets approximate their respective fair
values because of the short term nature of these accounts. The fair value of revolving credit facilities
is estimated based on current rates offered to the Company for similar debt of the same remaining
maturities. The carrying value approximates the fair market value for the floating rate loans due to
their variable interest rate, being EURIBOR, LIBOR or EIBOR. LIBOR, EURIBOR and EIBOR rates
are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full terms of the loans and hence floating rate
loans are considered Level 2 items in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair
value of the Convertible Senior Notes at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is $108,145 and
$116,218, respectively, compared to a carrying value net of finance charges of $120,644 and
$118,031, respectively.
2.Significant accounting policies:
A discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies can be found in the Company's
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended
December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to these policies in the six-month period
ended June 30, 2016.
Debt issuance costs. In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,"
("ASU 2015-03"), which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability,
consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The amortization of such costs will continue to
be reported as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company has adopted this accounting standard
and reclassified the prior-period amounts to conform to the current-period presentation.
The retrospective effect of our adoption of ASU 2015-03, which affected only the presentation of
deferred debt issuance costs in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015, is as
follows:

8.Goodwill and intangible assets:
Goodwill: Goodwill identified represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the
identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. The Company tested its
goodwill at December 31, 2015. The Company calculated the fair value of the reporting unit using
the discounted cash flow method, and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded
its book value including the goodwill. The discounted cash flows calculation is subject to
management judgment related to revenue growth, capacity utilization, the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), of approximately 6%, and the future price of marine fuel products. No impairment
loss was recorded at June 30, 2016.
Intangible assets: The Company has identified finite-lived intangible assets associated with
concession agreements acquired with the purchase of the Las Palmas and Panama subsidiaries, a
non-compete covenant acquired with the Aegean NWE. The values recorded have been recognized
at the date of the acquisition and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful life.

10.Derivatives and fair value measurements:
The Company uses derivatives in accordance with its overall risk management strategy.  The
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately through earnings.
The following describes the Company's derivative classifications:
The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to economically hedge its exposure to
variability in its floating rate long-term debt.  Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the Company
and the bank agreed to exchange at specified intervals the difference between paying fixed rate and
floating rate interest amount calculated by reference to the agreed principal amount and maturity.
Interest rate swaps allow the Company to convert long-term borrowings issued at floating rates to
equivalent fixed rates.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was committed to the following interest
rate swap arrangements:

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the
interest rate swap agreements. In order to minimize counterparty risk, the Company enters into
derivative transactions with counterparties that are rated AAA or at least A at the time of the
transactions.

The Company enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to variability in foreign
currency related to the repayment of its long-term debt in foreign currency.  Under the terms of the
foreign currency contracts, the Company agreed with the bank to exchange currencies at specified
exchange rates for the scheduled outflows from the loan repayment. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company was committed to 5 year currency arrangements to exchange currencies at agreed rates
and for amounts related to the repayment of its foreign currency long-term loan.
The Company uses fuel pricing contracts to hedge exposure to changes in the net cost of marine
fuel purchases. The Company has the right of offset with the counterparty of the fuel pricing
contracts, and settles outstanding balances on a monthly basis.  Therefore, these amounts are
presented on a net basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets (on a gross basis: an asset
of $27,362 and a liability of $35,050, as of June 30, 2016 and an asset of $46,949 and a liability of
$24,533 as of December 31, 2015).

The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using the discounted cash flow method based
on market-based EURIBOR or LIBOR rates swap yield curves, taking into account current interest
rates. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield
curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs.

The fair value of the foreign currency contracts is determined based on the agreed fixed and the
current exchange currency for the amount agreed to be exchanged on each contract.
The Company uses observable inputs to calculate the mark-to-market valuation of the fuel pricing
derivatives. Fuel pricing contracts are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying
commodity. During the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company entered into fuel
pricing contracts for 14,763,764 metric tons and 8,720,373 metric tons, respectively.
The Company's derivatives trade in over the counter markets, and as such, model inputs are
generally observable and do not require significant management judgment. Such instruments are
classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Legal Matters:
 
In November 2005, an unrelated party filed a declaratory action against one of the Company's
subsidiaries before the First Instance Court of Piraeus, Greece. The plaintiff asserted that he was
instrumental in the negotiation of the Company's eight-year Fuel Purchase Agreement with a
government refinery in Jamaica and sought a judicial affirmation of his alleged contractual right to
receive a commission of $0.01 per metric ton of marine fuel over the term of the contract. In
December 2008, the First Instance Court of Piraeus dismissed the plaintiff's action as vague and
inadmissible, however the Company appealed that decision on the grounds that there was no
contract between the Company and the plaintiff and that the court lacked jurisdiction. While the
action was pending in Greece, the plaintiff commenced a new action involving the same cause of
action before the Commercial Court of Paris, France, which dismissed that action in June 2009. The
plaintiff's appeal of the dismissal was denied by the Paris Court of Appeal in February 2010. In
January 2012, the plaintiff commenced a new action relating to the same allegations before the
Commercial Court of Paris, which was dismissed on June 27, 2012 in favor of the competence and
jurisdiction of the Greek courts. In July 2012, the plaintiff filed a "contredit," an appeal procedure
under French law. In November 2013, the Court held that there is no matter pending in Greece that
would allow the French courts to decline jurisdiction to the benefit of the Greek proceedings. As a
result, the case is to return to the Commercial Court of Paris which should have to examine the
admissibility of Mr. Varouxis' claim in France. The relevant pleadings were issued on December 18,
2015. According to its decision the French Court held that Varouxis is entitled to a part
compensation based on a half of its claim fee of $0.01 per metric ton sold but limited to the amount
of $670 with respect to the years 2005 to 2008. The Judgement is enforceable subject to the
submission by Mr Varouxis to AMP of a bank guarantee as counter-security covering the
reimbursement to AMP of the said sum plus interest. Until now Mr. Varouxis has been unable to
submit a properly worded bank guarantee. In the meantime, both AMP and Mr. Varouxis have filed
contrary appeals versus the decision issued. In any event our position continues to be that this claim
is unwarranted and lacking in merit.
 
On December 18, 2014, the Company and Aegean Bunkering (USA) LLC, or the Aegean Parties,
filed a one-count complaint for breach of contract against Hess Corporation, or Hess, in New York
Supreme Court, New York County (653887/2014). In the complaint, the Aegean Parties allege that
Hess breached certain express representations and warranties in representing its financial condition
in an agreement pursuant to which Hess sold its bunker oil business to Aegean Bunkering (USA)
LLC. The Aegean Parties claim approximately $28,000 in compensatory damages, exclusive of
interest and costs. On February 9, 2015, Hess filed an answer to the complaint. During the course of
discovery, through co-counsel Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, the Aegean Parties filed a motion for
leave to amend the complaint on December 15, 2015. The proposed amended complaint added a
claim for fraud and fraudulent inducement in connection with the Agreement, seeking approximately
$127 million in compensatory damages, exclusive of interest and costs, and punitive damages in an
amount to be determined at trial. On Hess's consent, the Aegean Parties' motion to amend the
complaint was granted on January 15, 2016. On February 3, 2016, Hess filed a motion to dismiss
the amended complaint in part, specifically, the fraud and fraudulent inducement claim and portions
of the contract claim. The Aegean Parties' responded to the motion to dismiss on March 4, 2016, and
Hess submitted its reply on March 18, 2016. The parties are now awaiting a decision from the Court.
 
The Company has supplied bunkers through agreements with various entities of the O.W. Bunker
Group, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2014. The Company issued notice to members of the
O.W. Bunker Group for the request of payment for the value of the bunkers supplied. The Company's
exposure for these supplies amounts to $4,951, of which $2,922 is recorded as a provision for
doubtful accounts in our consolidated balance sheets.  The Company believes that the respective
members of the O.W. Bunker Group were never the rightful owners of the bunkers and is currently
trying to work out escrow or other practical solutions with the end users. The Company expects to
recover the amount of at least $2,029.
 
A Company's subsidiary, Aegean Oil Terminal Corporation, has provided storage facilities through
agreements to Alco Shipping Services LLC and Alco Fuel Trading LLC. In breach of their
obligations under their agreements the debtors failed to deliver any products to the terminal and to
pay the invoices in the principal sum of $450. Following various demands for payment and in the
absence of payment, the Company's subsidiary has terminated their agreement and commenced
legal proceedings against the debtors in the High Court of London. After lodging with the court the
relevant application, claim for and witness statements the Company's subsidiary received a sealed
order from the High Court in London giving permission to service the Claim Form and Particulars of
Claim out of the jurisdiction upon the debtors in UAE. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office
have now returned the service process request with the documents unserved due to the fact that the
debtors have moved offices. The debtors do not have a valid defense and once the claim form is
served upon them the Company expects to proceed to obtain a summary judgment from the High
Court in London. As soon as a judgment is obtained the Company expects to proceed to execute the
same by way of arrest and sale of any of the nine ships the debtors own.
Aegean Oil Terminal Corporation has also provided storage facilities through agreements to House
of Gas Trading DMCC. In breach of their obligations under their agreements the debtors failed to
deliver any products to the terminal and to pay the invoices in the principal sum of $882. Following
various demands for payment and in the absence of payment, the Company has terminated their
agreement and commenced legal proceedings against the debtors in the High Court of London.
After lodging with the court the relevant application, claim for and witness statements the Company's
subsidiary received a sealed order from the High Court in London giving permission to service the
Claim Form and Particulars of Claim out of the jurisdiction upon the debtors in UAE. The UK
Foreign and Commonwealth Office have not yet returned the service process request. The debtors
do not have a valid defense and once the claim form is served upon them the Company expects to
proceed to obtain a summary judgment from the High Court in London. As soon as a judgment is
obtained the Company expects to proceed to execute the same by way of arrest and sale of their
assets.
Various claims, suits, and complains, including those involving government regulations and product
liability, arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, losses may arise from disputes with
charterers and agents and insurance and other claims with suppliers relating to the operations of the
Company's vessels. Currently, management is not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities
for which a provision should be established in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Environmental and other liabilities: The Company accrues for the cost of environmental liabilities
when management becomes aware that a liability is probable and is able to reasonably estimate the
Company's exposure. Currently, management is not aware of any such claims or contingent
liabilities for which a provision should be established in these condensed consolidated financial
statements. The Company's Protection and Indemnity ("P&I") insurance policies cover third-party
liability and other expenses related to injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties,
loss or damage of cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-
party property, and pollution arising from oil or other substances.  The Company's coverage under
the P&I insurance policies, except for pollution, are unlimited. Coverage for pollution is $1,000,000
per vessel per incident.

15.Equity incentive plan:
The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at grant date, based on the estimated fair
value of the award which is determined by the closing price of the Company's common stock traded
on the NYSE on the grant date, and recognizes the cost as expense on a straight-line basis (net of
estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period. The expense is recorded in the general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income.
Aegean is incorporated in a non-taxable jurisdiction and accordingly, no deferred tax assets are
recognized for these stock-based incentive awards.
 
All grants of nonvested stock issued under the 2015 Plan are subject to accelerated vesting upon
certain circumstances set forth in the 2015 Plan.
 
The following table summarizes the status of the Company's non-vested shares outstanding for the
six months ended June 30, 2016:

As of June 30, 2016, there was $14,640 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested share-based compensation awards. This unrecognized compensation at June 30, 2016,
is expected to be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted average period of 1.8
years as follows:

2017

 $14,640
The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period using the two class method. The computation of diluted earnings per share
assumes the granting of non-vested share-based compensation awards (refer to Note 15), for which
the assumed proceeds upon grant are deemed to be the amount of compensation cost attributable to
future services and not yet recognized using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive.
As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company excluded 2,396,410 and 1,768,983 non-vested shares,
respectively, as anti-dilutive. Non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive
non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) and participate equally in
undistributed earnings are participating securities, and thus, are included in the two-class method of
computing earnings per share.
The treasury stock method is used in calculating diluted earnings per share for the Notes as the
Company expects to settle the principal in cash.
The components of the calculation of basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per
common share are as follows:
Net income attributable to AMPNI shareholders
 
Less: Dividends declared and undistributed earnings allocated to
unvested shares
Income available to AMPNI common stockholders, basic and diluted
 
Basic weighted average number
of common shares outstanding
 
Diluted weighted average number

18.Business segments and geographical information:
The Company is primarily a physical supplier in the downstream marine petroleum products
industry. Marine petroleum products mainly consist of different classifications of marine fuel oil,
marine gas oil and lubricants.
The Company cannot and does not identify expenses, profitability or other financial performance
measures by type of marine petroleum product supplied, geographical area served, nature of
services performed or on anything other than on a consolidated basis (although the Company is
able to segregate revenues on these various bases). As a result, management, including the chief
operating decision maker, reviews operating results on a consolidated basis only. Therefore, the
Company has determined that it has only one operating segment.
The Company is domiciled in the Marshall Islands but provides no services in that location. It is
impracticable to disclose revenues from external customers attributable to individual foreign
countries because where the customer is invoiced is not necessarily the country of domicile. In
addition, due to the nature of the shipping industry, where services are provided on a worldwide
basis, the country of domicile of the customer does not provide useful information regarding the risk
that this disclosure is intended to address.
The Company's long-lived assets mainly consist of bunkering tankers which are positioned across
the Company's existing territories and which management, including the chief operating decision
maker, reviews on a periodic basis and reposition among the Company's existing or new territories
to optimize the vessel per geographical territory ratio.
The Company's vessels operate within or outside the territorial waters of each geographical location
and, under international law, shipping vessels usually fall under the jurisdiction of the country of the
flag they sail. The Company's vessels are not permanently located within particular territorial waters
and the Company is free to mobilize all its vessels worldwide at its own discretion.
19.Subsequent events:
Delivery of vessel: On July 18, 2016, the Company completed the sale and delivered the non-self-
propelled bunkering barge, PT25, to an unaffiliated third-party, for a price of $169 (CAD 220,000),
resulting in a total gain of approximately $47.
