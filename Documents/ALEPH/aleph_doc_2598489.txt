Preliminary final Report
Management Discussion and Analysis 
 
The shares of Company were suspended on 30 November 2012.
On 20 November 2015 the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 
100%  of  Assemble  Holdings  Pty  Ltd,  an  emerging  business  at  the  forefront  of  the  growing  Home 
Services  industry  focusing  on  the  assembly  of  furniture  and  equipment  through  its  web-based 
platform “AssembleBay”. 
AssembleBay is a web platform focused on matching people who want items assembled with people 
who provide assembly services in a convenient online competitive bid environment.   
The agreement was subject to a number of conditions including a capital raising and the Company 
re-listing on ASX. 
On 14 December 2015 the Company lodged a prospectus for the offer of 162,500,000 Shares to the 
public at an issue price of $0.02 each to raise $3,250,000 (before costs of the Offer).   
The  purposes  of the  Offer  were  to meet  the requirement  that  the Company  re-complies  with  the 
ASX’s  admission  requirements  in  accordance  with  Chapters  1  and  2  of  the  Listing  Rules  and  to 
provide  funding  for  the  continued  development  commercialisation  of  AssembleBay  in  accordance 
with the Assemble Holdings’ business model and strategy as set out in the prospectus. 
Approval was given by shareholders at a meeting to change the Company name from Sirocco Energy 
Limited to Assemblebay Limited. This was effected on 2 February 2016.
The  Company  completed  the  capital  raising  and  re-compliance  requirements  resulting  in  the 
Company being re-instated to quotation on ASX with effect from 10 March 2016. 
Following  re-listing  the  Company  concentrated  on  activities  associated  with  implementing  the 
business  model  of  Assemble  Holdings  Pty  Ltd.  The  go-to  market  strategy  is  to  focus  on  market 
assembly  services,  initially  utilising  a  “freemium”  business  model  until  critical  mass  is  achieved, 
being a pricing strategy by which a good or service is provided free  but  a premium is charged for 
proprietary features, functionality, or virtual goods.  
 
On 7 April 2016 the Company announced the launch of its national marketing campaign, driven to 
increase awareness and dramatically escalate use of its website. Initial marketing strategies included 
using traditional marketing initiatives to connect with shoppers and hand out  flyers in Perth, WA, 
supported by digital media initiatives including online Google Adwords and social media campaigns 
and posting strategically on popular community service websites to re-direct traffic and encourage 
use of AssembleBay on both the assembler and client sides. 
 
Following  the  initial  campaigns  the  Company  has  continued  its  marketing  activities  to  increase 
awareness  and  use  of  its  web  based  platform  focused  on  matching  people  who  want  items 
assembled  with  people  who  provide  assembly  services  in  a  convenient  online  competitive  bid 
environment and have concentrated on digital marketing campaigns. 
 
Digital  marketing  strategies,  which  are  proving  more  effective  than  traditional  advertising 
approaches,  are  currently  targeting  assemblers  and  clients  looking  to  have  items  assembled  via 
digital Adwords and social media advertising. The Digital Adwords Campaign is proving successful 
in increasing traffic flow to the platform and has been expanded to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide 
and Brisbane.

Preliminary final Report
A Facebook Ad Campaign has been launched in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth. 
Data from this campaign will be analysed later this year to determine its value as a marketing tool. 
The  digital  marketing  campaigns  are  also  providing  valuable  data  and  statistics  which  are  being 
analysed continually with the campaigns being adjusted to ensure that the marketing efforts are 
focused and delivering cost effect results. 
The Company has also made substantial improvements to the AssembleBay platform designed to 
increase usage and enhance user experience. 
 
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Company are as an emerging business at the forefront of the growing 
online Home Services Industry focussing on the assembly of furniture and equipment.
