V207/97 Africa Legal Aid (on behalf of Isaac and Robert\u000aBanda) / Gambia (The)\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. This communication is submitted by Africa Legal Aid (AFLA), an NGO, on behalf of a minor, Isaac\u000aBanda, and his brother, Robert Banda.\u000a2. The Complainant alleges that the above-mentioned minor is reported to have been fraudulently taken out\u000aof his country of origin, Malawi, and subjected to working conditions close to slavery in The Gambia by\u000asomeone called Collyer, a British national.\u000a3. According to the Complainant, Mr Collyer proposed to employ the minor, Isaac Banda, as a domestic\u000aservant while he was residing with his parents in Malawi and undertook to finance his studies in lieu of\u000asalary.\u000a4. Following such an arrangement and with the help of one Nyilenda, Mr Collyer is reported to have\u000apersuaded the minor, Isaac Banda, together with his parents to agree that the latter follow him to The\u000aGambia and continue to serve him under the same terms of the above-mentioned arrangement concerning\u000ahis education.\u000a5. On their arrival in The Gambia, it is reported that the minor, Isaac Banda, was not allowed access to\u000aeducation. Occasionally, he was reportedly denied food. Furthermore, his employer, in 1995, is reported to\u000ahave ordered him to immediately leave his house. Thanks to the intervention of the African Centre for\u000aDemocracy and Human Rights Studies and the Centre for Youths and Children, the minor, Isaac Banda,\u000awas repatriated to his country of origin.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a6. The Complainant claims a violation of Articles 5 and 18(3) of the African Charter on Human and\u000aPeoples??? Rights, Article 24(1)\u000a× Every child shall have, without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or\u000asocial origin, property or birth, the right to such measures of protection as are required by his status as a\u000aminor, on the part of his family, society and the State.\u000aof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and Articles 11\u000a× 1. States Parties shall take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad.\u000a2. To this end, States Parties shall promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or\u000aaccession to existing agreements.\u000aand 32(1)\u000a× 1. States Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from\u000aperforming any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful\u000ato the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.\u000aand (2)\u000a× 2. States Parties shall take legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to ensure the\u000aimplementation of the present article. To this end, and having regard to the relevant provisions of other\u000ainternational instruments, States Parties shall in particular:\u000a(a) Provide for a minimum age or minimum ages for admission to employment;\u000a(b) Provide for appropriate regulation of the hours and conditions of employment;\u000a(c) Provide for appropriate penalties or other sanctions to ensure the effective enforcement of the present\u000aarticle.\u000aof the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a7. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the Commission on 23rd October 1997 by fax. The\u000aoriginal copy arrived later by post.\u000a8. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the communication on 27th October 1997 and requested the\u000aComplainant to furnish it with further information.\u000a9. The communication was ready but could not be considered by the Commission at its 22nd Ordinary\u000aSession from 2nd to 11th November 1997.\u000a10. Africa Legal Aid reacted to the request for further information on 30th January 1998 thus:\u000a\u2022\u000a\u2022 That the minor, Isaac Banda, lived in the house of a man called Collyer in The Gambia at the same\u000atime as his brother, Robert Banda, who referred the case to Africa Legal Aid.\u000a\u2022 According to the Complainant, the two brothers who are reported to have returned to their country of\u000aorigin did not have the means to take court action in The Gambia. The Complainant further states\u000athat the authorities of that country, having allowed such injustice to take place on their territory\u000awithout intervening, allows one to wonder if the local remedies available are efficient and effective.\u000a11. At its 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 20th to 29th April 1998, the Commission\u000adecided to be seized of the communication, and requested more information on the circumstances\u000asurrounding the child's entry into The Gambia and of his treatment while in the country.\u000a12. On 26th May 1998, the Secretariat sent letters to the Complainant and the State Party concerned\u000ainforming them of the Commission's decision.\u000a13. At its 24th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 22nd to 31st October, the Commission\u000apostponed consideration of the communication to the 25th Ordinary Session.\u000a14. On 20th January 1999, the Secretariat dispatched letters to the parties notifying them of the decision.\u000a15. At its 25th Ordinary Session held in Bujumbura, Burundi, the Commission postponed consideration of\u000athe communication to the 26th Ordinary Session due to lack of time.\u000a16. On 13th May 1999, the Secretariat of the Commission notified the parties of this decision.\u000a17. At its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali, Rwanda, the Commission declared the communication\u000aadmissible and requested for arguments on the merits of the case.\u000a18. On 21st January 2000, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the parties of the decision.\u000a19. The matter was also taken up on 10th March 2000, by the Legal Officer at the Secretariat in a meeting\u000awith Mrs Tomasi and Mr Almami Taal, State Counsel in the Department of State for Justice, The Gambia,\u000aconcerning communication 219/98. The State Counsel promised to meet the State Party's obligation as\u000arequested.\u000a20. The Complainant responded to the Commission's request for arguments on the merits of the case on\u000a12th April 2000.\u000a21. On 17th April 2000, the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the State Party for its information and\u000anecessary action.\u000a22. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the Commission deferred consideration of the case to the\u000anext session and requested the respondent state to furnish the Secretariat with its submission on the merits\u000aof the case.\u000a23. The above decision was communicated to parties on 10th July 2000. The Secretariat is yet to receive\u000athe Respondent State's response.\u000a24. At its 28th Ordinary Session in Benin, the African Commission reviewed the case and decided to\u000are-examine its admissibility at the 29th Ordinary Session. The Commission also decided to examine the\u000amerits of the case at the said session.\u000a25. On 14th November 2000, the Secretariat wrote to the Respondent State informing it the decision taken\u000aat the 28th Ordinary Session and reminded it to furnish the Commission with arguments on both\u000aadmissibility and merits of the case and, in particular, on the facts implicating state obligation under the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a26. On 14th November 2000, the Secretariat also wrote to the complainant informing it of the decision taken\u000aat the 28th Ordinary Session and requested it to furnish the Commission with more arguments on the merits\u000aof the case and, in particular, on the facts implicating state obligation under the African Charter.\u000a27. On 21st March 2001, the Secretariat of the African Commission received submissions from the\u000aComplainant as earlier requested.\u000a28. On 3rd April 2001, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainant acknowledging receipt of the said\u000asubmissions.\u000a29. On 17th April 2001, the Secretariat received submissions on admissibility from the Respondent State.\u000a30. At its 29th Ordinary Session, the Commission heard submissions from the representatives of the\u000aComplainant and the Respondent State.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a31. In its brief, AFLA claims: "(The) State authorities were made aware of the Complainant's situation". The\u000afollowing statements apparently support this: "In doing so they communicated the situation of the\u000aComplainant to the authorities in The Gambia and in Malawi. The African Centre for Democracy and\u000aHuman Rights Studies intervened to draw the attention of the Gambian authorities to the circumstances of\u000aMr Banda, to no avail". Who these authorities are is not indicated. When the communication was made is\u000aalso not stated. Those bare assertions of the Complainant that a communication was made to the\u000aauthorities in The Gambia is insufficient to saddle it with responsibility for the actions of an individual, Mr\u000aRobert Collyer, mindful of a State's responsibility for non-state actors as was held by the Commission in\u000acommunication 74/92 Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme des Libertes/Chad.\u000a32. In their reply, the respondent State denies that they were informed of the human rights abuses suffered\u000aby Isaac Banda at the hands of Robert Collyer. In their submission, the Respondent State stresses that\u000athere are legal avenues provided for within The Gambia that the Complainant should have utilised to obtain\u000aa remedy and that such avenues are not unduly prolonged. The Respondent State argues that failure of the\u000aComplainant to access these legal avenues render the communication inadmissible for non-exhaustion of\u000alocal remedies as required under Article 56(5) of the African Charter.\u000a33. The case for non-exhaustion of local remedies:\u000a\u2022 The Complainant was a minor\u000aThe statement of facts in the brief shows how NGOs helped him (see paragraph 5). If he could be\u000ahelped to return home, he could have been assisted to pursue a remedy in the courts of The\u000aGambia. The likes of Mr Robert Collyer (as portrayed in the statement of facts), should be made to\u000aface the full rigours of the law.\u000a\u2022 The Complainant was indigent/was unable to pay legal fees\u000aThe response to (a) above applies mutatis mutandi\u000a\u2022 The State did not offer any legal assistance to the Complainant\u000aThere is no convincing evidence that the attention of the State was drawn to the plight of the victim\u000aof the alleged violation.\u000a\u2022 The Complainant's parents were in another country and were indigent\u000aThe NGOs could have helped him (as indicated above).\u000a\u2022 The Complainant is now residing in another State\u000aInstead of using the Commission as a court of first instance, Africa Legal Aid is advised to see what\u000aremedies are available in The Gambia and to exhaust them before coming to the Commission.\u000a34. Since Mr Robert Collyer is presumably still in The Gambia, greater help in the protection of human\u000arights will be given by ensuring that he does not continue the alleged ill treatment of minors he brings into\u000athe country. If he persists, the attention of the Government of The Gambia should be drawn to his conduct,\u000aand the appropriate steps taken to address the issue\u000a35. It is not in all cases that residence outside the jurisdiction will not require exhaustion of local remedies,\u000aas was held in 103/93 Alhassan Abubakar/Ghana. In that case, the Complainant had been detained without\u000atrial for years, and he escaped from detention. He also feared that he would lose his liberty if he were to\u000a3\u000a\u000areturn to Ghana.\u000a36. Reliance is also placed on the Commission's decision in 215/98 Rights International/Nigeria. But that\u000acase is also distinguishable from the instant case. In that case, the Complainant alleged that Mr Charles\u000aBandiorn Wiwa, a Nigerian student, was arrested and tortured at a Nigerian military detention camp. He\u000awas horsewhipped and placed in a cell with 40 other detainees. The Complainant claimed that the victim's\u000atorture resulted from his identification as a relative of Ken Saro-Wiwa, who had been executed in defiance\u000aof the Commission's request for a stay of execution under its provisional measures procedure in Rule 111\u000aof the Rules of Procedure.\u000a37. Having fled Nigeria in fear for his life and on the advice of human rights lawyers, and having obtained\u000aasylum from the government of the United States of America, the Commission did not consider the\u000aexhaustion of local remedies arose in the circumstances. The Commission in that case stated: "In this\u000aparticular case, the Commission found that Mr Wiwa was unable to pursue any domestic remedy following\u000ahis flight for fear of his life to the Republic of Benin and the subsequent granting of refugee status to him by\u000athe United States of America." Significantly, the Commission also stated categorically in paragraph 23 of\u000acommunication 215/98, Rights International/Nigeria as follows:\u000a"The Commission declared the communication admissible on grounds that there was lack of available and\u000aeffective remedies for human rights violations in Nigeria under the military regimes".\u000aThe same could not be said of a minor needing the protection of the State, as was the situation in the\u000ainstant case.\u000a38. The Commission should not, therefore, be taken to have laid down a hard and fast rule that whenever a\u000aComplainant finds himself outside the jurisdiction, the inescapable conclusion should be that the\u000arequirement of exhaustion of local remedies mandated under Article 56(5) does not apply.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the Commission\u000aAfter reconsidering its decision on admissibility as taken at its 26th Ordinary Session in Kigali, Rwanda,\u000a\u000aDeclares the communication inadmissible for non-exhaustion of local remedies, having ascertained that\u000athe Complainant neither resorted to local remedies, nor did he bring the alleged violations to the attention of\u000athe Respondent State.\u000a\u000aTripoli, Libya, 23rd April to 7th May 2001.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000a

aV003/12 - Centre for Human Rights and Rencontre\u000aAfricaine pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme v\u000aSenegal\u000aThe Centre for Human Rights (University of Pretoria) and la Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense\u000ades Droits de l'Homme (Senegal) Versus Government of Senegal\u000aDecision: N° 003/Com/001/2012\u000a\u000aSummary of Alleged Facts\u000a\u000a1. On 27 July 2012 the Secretariat of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the\u000aChild (henceforth, the Committee ) received a communication, pursuant to Article 44(1) of the African\u000aCharter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (herein after, the Charter ), submitted by the Centre for\u000aHuman Rights, University of Pretoria (South Africa) and La Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits\u000ade lHomme (RADDHO) of Senegal (all of which shall be referred later as the Complainants ).\u000a2. The Complainants are alleging that children as many as 100,000 (known as talibés ), aged between 4\u000aand 12 years, are sent away by their parents to live in Quranic schools known as daaras in the urban\u000acentres of the Republic of Senegal (henceforth, referred to as the Respondent State ) allegedly to receive\u000areligious education. The Complainants allege that the situation depicts the difficulties that such children are\u000afacing in attaining government schooling.\u000a3. The Complainants, moreover, allege that the talibés are forced by their instructors 1 known as marabouts\u000a) to work on the streets as beggars. According to the Complainants, such forced child begging has been an\u000aon-going practice in the Respondent State since the 1980s, despite the existence of provisions in the Penal\u000aCode 2 outlawing the practice of forcing a child to beg. 3 These penal provisions have been reinforced by\u000athe Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices 4 and to Protect Victims adopted by the\u000aRespondent State in 2005, which prescribes 5-10 years imprisonment and a fine of five to twenty million\u000aCFA francs for a person found guilty of forcing a child to beg.\u000a4. According to the Complaints, despite the existence of these legislations, the Respondent State has made\u000alittle efforts to enforce these provisions with a view to penalizing the marabouts who force talibés to beg,\u000aconsequent to which as of 2011 only 10 cases were brought to court resulting in nine convictions of\u000amarabouts. The Complaints submit that the highest actual duration of imprisonment for all convictions\u000aunder the foregoing laws was one month imprisonment; which, according to them, represents a decrease in\u000athe severity of penalties imposed on the marabouts as compared to past years.\u000a5. The Complainants also allege that the Respondent State's Constitution (2001) 5 allows only specific\u000aindividuals under specific mandates to bring cases and only to challenge the constitutionality of certain\u000aprovisions of any law. And, as such, there is no actio popularis in the Respondent State's legal system.\u000aCases for vindication of human rights violations may only be brought to court by individuals who have been\u000adirectly affected by a violation and any decision will provide remedy only for those litigants, or for those who\u000aare directly connected to the case or have un interest et qualite pour agir .\u000a6. According to the Complainants, where a non-state agency wants to represent victims of violations of\u000ahuman rights, like the talibés in this matter, the consent of parents must first be obtained. The only other\u000aavenue to bring such a claim to court is to petition the Chief Prosecutor, whose decision is made\u000adiscretionary and in consultation with the Minister responsible for justice.\u000a7. In addition, the Complainants allege that the Respondent State has not provided minimum standards to\u000a1\u000a\u000aregulate non-state schools and that it does not conduct inspections of the daaras to check if there are\u000aviolations of the rights of the talibés attending schooling and living therein.\u000a8. The Complainant allege further that the conditions in many daaras are deplorable; usually housed in\u000aunsafe and unhygienic structures where children sleep in over-crowded rooms or outside, with little or no\u000aaccess to clean water or sanitation. Talibés living in daaras rarely obtain enough food resulting in chronic\u000amalnourishment and frequently contract diseases where the marabouts do not provide the talibés with\u000amedical care or assistance. In some instances, according to the Complainants, the talibés are injured by\u000aspeeding motor vehicles in the course of begging on the streets\u000a9. The Complainants also allege that the talibés are required to bring a daily quota (in the form of rice,\u000asugar or money) that they collected from begging in the streets to the daaras , failure to attain which results\u000ain beatings and punishments to defaulting talibés . On average, talibés spend between six and eight hours\u000abegging, which leaves them with less than five hours to spend on Qur'anic education per day. As result of\u000atheir concentration on attaining their daily quotas, many talibés do not learn the Qur'an as it is\u000acontemplated.\u000a10. Furthermore, the Complainants allege that the talibés are normally separated from living with their\u000aparents and are deprived of any contact with their families. The talibés are also physically assaulted and\u000aharshly punished when they attempt to leave the daaras .\u000a\u000aThe Complaints\u000aAdmissibility\u000aComplainants' submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a11. The Complainants allege that, as a result of the foregoing situation and due to the failure by the\u000aRespondent State to protect the talibés , there are continuous violations of numerous rights and freedoms\u000aof such children, to which they are entitled under the Charter. It is the Complainants' allegation that the\u000aRespondent State has violated, and continues to violate, the provisions of Article 4 (best interests of the\u000achild); Article 5 (the right to survival and development); Article 11 (the right to education); Article 12 (the\u000aright to leisure, recreation and cultural activities); Article 14 (the right to health and health services); Article\u000a15 (prohibition of child labour); Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture); Article 21 (protection\u000aagainst harmful social and cultural practices); and Article 29 (prohibition of sale, trafficking and abduction of\u000achildren) of the Charter.\u000a12. The Complainants have indicated that they have submitted the present Communication on behalf of the\u000atalibes in the Respondent State, whose rights under the Charter have been violated by the Respondent\u000aState. And, as such, they have the competence to do so under Chapter 2 Article 1(I)(2)\u000a× The Author of the communication shall specify either to have been a victim of violations of the rights spelt\u000aout in the Charter, or to act on behalf of a victim or of other eligible parties.\u000aof the Committee's Communication Guidelines. The Complainants are of the view that they can submit the\u000aCommunication even if the consent of the victims was not obtained since they are acting in the overall best\u000ainterest of the child . The Complainants further argue that the consent of the victims is not a requirement\u000awhen there is evidence of serious, massive and systematic violations of the rights of talibes as it was\u000aindicated in Commission's decision in Amnesty International v Sudan6 .\u000a13. Concerning the form of the Communication, the Complainant submit that the present communication\u000asatisfies the requirement as to form as set out in Chapter 2 Article 1(II)(1)\u000a× No communication shall be considered by the Committee if:\u000a\u2022 it is anonymous;\u000a2\u000a\u000a\u2022 it is not written;\u000a\u2022 it concerns a State non-signatory to the Charter.\u000aof the Communication Guidelines, which requires that a communication should not be anonymous; should\u000abe written; and should concern a State signatory to the Charter.\u000a14. In relation to the content of the Communication, the Complainants submit that the communication has\u000asatisfied the requirements as to content as per Chapter 2 Article 1 (III) (1) (a) (b) &(c) of the Communication\u000aGuidelines since the communication concerns violations of the provisions of the African Children's Charter;\u000ait is not solely based on information circulated by the media; it has not been considered according to\u000aanother investigation, procedure or international regulation.\u000a15. The Complainants submit that exhaustion of local remedy in this matter is unnecessary considering the\u000abest interests of the number of children whose rights are being violated relying on a decision of the African\u000aCommission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR/the Commission) in African Institute for Human\u000aRights and Development (sic!) v Guinea . 7 . In the cited Decision, the Commission held that a local remedy\u000acould not be exhausted given the number of potential victims who were in the region since it would be\u000aimpractical for them to approach the courts. The Complainants are of the view that international law\u000arequires that the exhaustion of domestic remedies should only be in respect of those that are available,\u000aeffective and adequate. And the Complainants argue that there is no effective judicial remedy for the talibes\u000ainsofar as actio popularis in the Respondent State's courts is not in favour of the talibes as they do not have\u000astanding to do so. In addition, the Complainants have invoked the jurisprudence of the Commission which\u000areveals that in cases of serious and massive violations , local remedies need not be exhausted. 8 In this\u000acase, it is the Complainants' submission that the failure by the Respondent State to protect so many\u000achildren on the streets in the State's major cities where they suffer egregious violations of their rights\u000aenshrined in the Charter for so many years amount to serious and massive violations.\u000aACERWC's analysis and decision on admissibility\u000a\u000a16. The Committee notes that the Complainants are non-governmental organizations recognized by the\u000aAfrican Union through the Commission; and are doing so on behalf of victim talibes in the Respondent\u000aState and therefore can be the authors of the Communication.\u000a17. The Committee also notes that the Complainants have satisfied the conditions and requirement as to\u000aform as laid down in Chapter 2 Article 1(I)\u000a× No communication shall be considered by the Committee if:\u000a\u2022 it is anonymous;\u000a\u2022 it is not written;\u000a\u2022 it concerns a State non-signatory to the Charter.\u000aof the Committee's Communication Guidelines, i.e. the communication explicitly states the name of the\u000aauthors, is well written and concerns a State Party to the Charter.\u000a18. In the matter of content of the Communication, the Committee agrees that the communication is\u000acompatible with the Constitutive Act of the AU and the Charter as it concerns violations of the provisions of\u000athe Charter. The Committee notes the Commission's Decision in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v\u000aZimbabwe9 to the effect that to be compatible with the Charter, the communication has only got to invoke\u000aprovisions of the law which are presumed to have been violated. 10 The Committee in this matter also\u000aagrees with the Complainant that the Communication is not solely based on information circulated by\u000amedia; rather it is based on information provided, inter alia, by the alleged victims primarily through\u000apersonal interviews of the talibes made by the complaining NGOs and information obtained from reports\u000amade by credible organisations. In addition, the Committee has undertaken investigation and confirmed\u000a3\u000a\u000athat the issue at hand has not been considered in another international procedure.\u000a19. In considering whether or not the Complainants have exhausted local remedies available in the\u000aRespondent State, the Committee would like to reiterate its position that is stated in Children of Nubian\u000aDescents Case . 11 In that communication, the Committee held that Article 46 of the Charter mandates it to\u000adraw inspiration from International Law on Human Rights. Basing this explicit legislative mandate, the\u000aCommittee made reference to laws, and jurisprudence from other countries or treaty bodies in Africa and\u000aelsewhere. 12\u000a20. The Committee would also like to draw inspiration from the ACHPR in considering the requirement to\u000aexhaust local remedy. In Sir Dawda Jawara v The Gambia13 , the Commission held that a remedy is\u000aconsidered available if the complainant can pursue it without impediment 14 ; it is deemed effective if it\u000aoffers a prospect of success; and it is found sufficient if it is capable of redressing the complaint. 15\u000aTherefore, it is a well-established jurisprudence of the Commission that only domestic remedies that are\u000aavailable, effective, and adequate (sufficient) that need to be exhausted . 16 As such, the Commission has\u000arecognized that the exhaustion of prior domestic remedies implies and assumes the availability,\u000aeffectiveness and sufficiency of domestic adjudication procedures. If local remedies are unduly prolonged,\u000aunavailable, ineffective or insufficient, the exhaustion rule will not bar consideration of the case by the\u000aCommission. 17\u000a21. From this analysis of the jurisprudence of the Commission, the following exceptions to the rule of prior\u000aexhaustion of local remedy are remarkable. First, domestic remedies must be of judicial nature ; second,\u000adomestic remedies must not be unduly prolonged ; third, where there are ouster clauses domestic\u000aremedies are rendered unavailable; and, fourth, local remedies cannot be exhausted where there are a\u000alarge number of potential victims of violations of human rights.\u000a22. The Complainants have amply demonstrated that the Respondent State's penal laws (Penal Code) 18\u000aand Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices and to Protect Victims adopted by the\u000aRespondent State in 2005 19 proscribe forcing a child to beg. 20 However, the Respondent State has made\u000alittle efforts to enforce these provisions with a view to penalizing the marabouts who force talibes to beg. It\u000ais in record that, as of 2011 only 10 cases were brought to court resulting in nine convictions on marabouts\u000a. The Complaints have submitted that the highest actual duration of imprisonment for all conventions under\u000athe foregoing laws was one month imprisonment and the Committee is of the view that this avenue\u000ainefficient.\u000a23. The Committee also finds the avenue to petition the Chief Prosecutor to bring a claim to court on behalf\u000aof the talibes victims of violations of their rights by marabouts in the daaras to be ineffective because the\u000aChief Prosecutor's decision is made discretionary and in consultation with the Minister responsible for\u000ajustice, which does not amount to a remedy that is judicial in nature. Another avenue that the Complainants\u000aalso have indicated to be in place in the Respondent State is the requirement that only the victim talibes or\u000asomeone directly affected by the alleged violations can bring cases in domestic courts. In practice, this\u000awould entail each of the estimated 100,000 talibes would bring their own claim in courts. The Committee\u000aconcurs with Complainants' submission that this avenue is so impractical as to be virtually impossible .\u000aTherefore, the Committee is of the view that the Complainants should avail from the exceptions of the\u000arequirement of exhaustion of local remedies as there is no effective and sufficient remedy for the talibes .\u000a24. In view of the forgoing reasons, during its 21 st Ordinary Session, which was held 15 to 19 April 2013,\u000athe Committee found the Communication to have fulfilled all the admissibility conditions as laid down in the\u000aCommittee's Guidelines on the Consideration of Communications and as such, the Committee declared the\u000aComplaint admissible.\u000aProcedure\u000a\u000a25. After the decision on admissibility, the Committee transmitted the complaint to the Respondent State,\u000a4\u000a\u000awhich duly filed its written reply, after which the matter was scheduled for a public hearing. During its 23 rd\u000aOrdinary Session, from 9 - 16 April 2014 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a public hearing was held where\u000arepresentatives of the Complainants and the Respondent State made their oral submissions.\u000aThe Respondent State's Arguments\u000a\u000a26. Both in its written reply to the Complaints and oral submissions, the Respondent State has not\u000aspecifically rejected the allegations. It has actually admitted that the alleged violations of the various\u000aCharter provisions exist, and continue to take place.\u000a27. In recognition of the existence of the alleged violations, the Respondent State submitted that it has\u000aadopted various constitutional, policy, legislative and administrative measures aimed at, inter alia ,\u000aprotecting all children, particularly those forced to beg. In particular, the Respondent State contended that\u000aas a result of a workshop that was held early 2013 to formulate strategic plans of action for the eradication\u000aof child begging, an inter-ministerial council on the managing of child begging was convened on Friday, 8\u000aFebruary 2013, under the auspices of the Honourable Prime Minister. Consequent to this event, an ad-hoc\u000aCommittee was set up and it has adopted a number of recommendations which revolve around three\u000astrategic options:\u000a\u000a1. The withdrawal of all child beggars from the street and their temporary placement in public\u000ainstitutions, community centres and voluntary families, as well their integration with their family or\u000acountry of origin. This would also involve the implementation of measures relative to the educational\u000aaspects and to economic support for the family;\u000a2. Social Policy Communication for a positive and lasting behavioural change that occurs through\u000aeffective application of the law and with the strong will of political, religious, social, and cultural\u000aactors aimed at eradicating child begging; and\u000a3. The prevention aspect; that is, while particularly emphasising policy and law enforcement, there is a\u000aneed for utilising existing initiatives by the communities to assist children in their villages of origin\u000aand the strengthening of public and community social services.\u000a\u000a28. In respect of eliminating worst forms of child labour, the Respondent State submitted that it has\u000aundertaken various measures; including establishing the Project for the Fight against the Worst Forms of\u000aChild Labour within the Ministry of Labour. Regarding the improvement of the quality of education in the\u000adaaras , the Respondent State contended that it has set up the Trilingual Project of the Direction of\u000aAlphabetisation and of National Languages within the Ministry of National Education (i.e. Le Projet\u000aTrilinguisme de la Direction de l'Alphabétisation et des Langues Nationales ). This project strives to\u000aintervene in the daaras in order to offer the opportunity to the talibés of learning and mastering three (3)\u000alanguages (i.e. French, Arabic and a national language translated in Arabic characters), in addition to\u000avocational skills training.\u000a29. With reference to the protection of talibés and other children on the street from physical abuses, the\u000aRespondent State submitted that its Ministry of Interior has a specialised police force, the Minors Brigade ,\u000awhose mission is to protect morally threatened children, to identify them and to ensure their reintegration, in\u000acollaboration with the other structures. In addition, the Ministry of Health is developing numerous initiatives\u000afor the development of the welfare of children, including l'Ecole Nationale des Travailleurs Sociaux\u000aSpécialisés (ENTSS), which has, since 2005, introduced a training module on the rights of the child. There\u000ais also the Support Cell to the Protection of the Child, which is located at the Presidency to support different\u000ainitiatives from state and civil society structures.\u000a30. The Respondent State also submitted that it has been striving to involve non-state actors, particularly\u000alocal and international NGOs (including Community-based organisations) to provide assistance, advocacy\u000a5\u000a\u000aand prevention interventions. Moreover, communities and families play a primary role in the protection of\u000achildren, in order to develop a common understanding of the existing structures, to create a public\u000aconsensus and to guide the taking of decisions at the national level.\u000a31. Furthermore, the Respondent State pointed out that it has ratified various international human rights\u000atreaties, particularly the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and ILO Conventions on the\u000aElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour and the Minimum Age Convention, namely the Conventions\u000a138\u000a× [ http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C138\u000aand 182\u000a× http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C182\u000a. These international treaties have been domesticated in the State Party's legislation in the context of the\u000a2001 Constitution, particularly through the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedures, which\u000aentrenches the best interests of the child. Other pieces of legislations include the Penal Code 21 ; the\u000a79-1165 Decree of 20 December 1975, which prohibit punishment and physical abuse in schools and\u000aeducation centres which are not conventional; the 2004-38 law of 28 December 2004, which has abolished\u000adeath penalty and applies to all children without exception, even to foreign and migrant children; and the\u000a2005-06 law of 10 May 2005, which criminalizes trafficking in persons, including children, and similar\u000apractices, as well as prohibiting forced begging.\u000a32. The Respondent concluded its submission by indicating that the eradication of child begging has\u000aalways been a source of constant problem for the Senegalese authorities, despite the enactment of several\u000aprovisions of the law, decrees, policies, and various administrative measures.\u000aConsideration on Merits\u000aA. Alleged Violation of Article 4 (best interest of the child)\u000a\u000a33. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Article 4 of the African Children's\u000aCharter, which provides for the best interest of the child, as the State has failed to protect talibés from\u000aviolations in the daaras . They also allege that the Respondent State is duty bound to assert the best\u000ainterest of children by regulating the conduct of non-state actors and ensuring that they do not violate\u000achildren's rights.\u000a34. The Committee notes that Article 4 of the African Children Charter requires the best interest of the child,\u000aone of the four general principles, to be the primary consideration in all actions to be taken by any person\u000aor authority. The principle of the best interest of the child aims at safeguarding the realization of children's\u000arights effectively and contributing to their holistic development. 22\u000a35. In guaranteeing the best interest of the child, a State Party has the obligation to ensure the\u000aconsideration of the best interest of the child in all actions taken by any person or authority affecting the life\u000aof the child. In this context, any person is broadly interpreted and entails that entails that the principle of the\u000abest interest of the child must be applied in all actions concerning children, regardless whether those\u000aactions are undertaken by private or public entities. The Committee also notes that action includes\u000aomissions and commissions that are manifested in decisions, proposals, services, procedures and other\u000ameasures. 23\u000a36. Applying the principle of the best interest of the child to the vase at hand, the Committee notes that\u000aapart from the interest of parents to send their children to receive religious education, Talibés children in\u000athe Respondent State go to the daaras mainly because of the difficulties of attaining government schooling\u000ain their precincts. In the daaras , the children are forced to beg by their teachers ( marabouts ), where on\u000aaverage, they spend six to eight hours begging with five hours or less left to spend on Qur'anic studies per\u000aday.\u000a6\u000a\u000a37. The Respondent State, being a State Party to the Charter, accepts the explicit prohibition of child\u000abegging under Article 29(b) and it has complied with this obligation through its prohibition of child begging\u000aas provided for under Article 245 to 247(b) of its Penal Code. However, the Respondent State has failed to\u000adischarge its obligation to enforce these provisions by not taking the necessary administrative measures,\u000aincluding supervision of the daaras and bringing to justice the marabouts who force talibés into begging.\u000aThe State Party has the obligation to protect the rights enshrined in the Charter, which requires measures\u000aby the State to ensure that third parties (individuals, institutions, etc.) do not deprive of children's rights. In\u000athis regard the Committee refers to the jurisprudence as established by the African commission on Humans\u000aand Peoples' Rights. In Mouvement Burkinabe des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples v Burkina Faso , the\u000aAfrican Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (henceforth, the Commission ) has set the\u000ajurisprudence to the effect that a State Party is responsible for violation of human rights committed by\u000anon-state actors as its obligation to ensure the respect for human rights demands it to take all the\u000anecessary measures to ensure that non-state actors also respect the rights of children. 24 The Commission\u000ahas also stipulated that failure to prevent violation against children's rights by non-state actors makes the\u000aState internationally responsible. 25 An obligation of this type is called an obligation to protect the human\u000arights standard, or, in short, the obligation to protect . Building on the Commission's jurisprudence, the\u000aCommittee states that the individual responsibility of non-State actors to respect the rights of children does\u000anot relieve the concerned State of its obligations under human rights law to respect, protect and fulfill\u000ahuman rights.\u000a38. In the case at hand, despite the obligation set under the principle of the best Interests of the child, the\u000aCommittee notes that the Government of Senegal has failed to enforce current national, regional, and\u000ainternational laws and agreements already in place by taking measures, including prosecuting, against\u000aperpetrators and abusive religious leaders; and hence the Respondent State has failed its responsibility to\u000aprotect.\u000a39. Therefore, the Respondent State is responsible under Article 4 of the Charter for not taking necessary\u000aadministrative and other measures against the daaras , marabouts as well as parents who send their\u000achildren to the daaras .\u000aB. Alleged violation of Article 5 (survival and development)\u000a\u000a40. The Complainants in this communication allege that the Respondent State has violated the right to\u000asurvival and development of the talibés as enshrined in the Charter by not taking any action against the\u000aforced begging. The Complainants further state that the forced begging of the talibés causes the disregard\u000aof their rights to health care, education, clean and safe environment, and clean water, which in effect are\u000afundamental components of the right to survival and development. Furthermore, the fixed quota imposed\u000aon talibés for begging subjects them to an extensive, institutionalized child labour.\u000a41. Considering the allegation made by the Complainants, the Committee carefully analysed the situation of\u000athe children in light of the elements of the right to survival and development. Article 5(1) of the African\u000aChildren's Charter provides that every child has an inherent right to life and this right must be protected by\u000alaw. Article 5(2) complements the recognition of this right by obliging states to ensure to the maximum\u000aextent possible the survival, protection and development of the child. The Committee notes the\u000acomplementary nature of the right to survival and development as essential preconditions to the enjoyment\u000aof the rights protected in the African Children's Charter. In other words, the Committee supports the\u000aconceptualization of the right to life survival and development as a general principle that serves to reinforce\u000athe raison d'?tre of each of the rights enshrined in the Charter. 26\u000a42. Survival and development encapsulates the right to life and imposes an obligation on states to ensure\u000aan adequate standard of living for children including the right to life and their physical, mental, spiritual,\u000amoral, psychological and social development. The obligations of the State Party under this principle also\u000aencompass protection of children's rights to access healthcare and education services, access to clean\u000a7\u000a\u000awater, the right to live in safe and clean environment, and protection from any form of abuse and degrading\u000atreatment, including child labour.\u000a43. In the case at hand, the Committee notes that most talibés are suffering from extreme hunger on a daily\u000abasis, often eating at best one or two small meals a day, usually consisting of bread and rice. Reports and\u000astudies reveal that the majority of begging children in Dakar, including talibés , were observed to be\u000amalnourished, often severely. The Committee also note that deprived of food by their guardians, many\u000atalibés are forced to beg in markets or door-to-door in neighborhoods to try to fulfill their daily nutritional\u000aneeds. As a result of the long hours talibés spend on the street, the malnutrition they suffer from\u000ainadequate food, and the deplorable conditions in many daaras, resulted in suffering of the children from\u000afrequent illnesses.\u000a44. The Committee also notes that there is a reported case where nine Talibés in the dense Medina\u000aneighborhood died after a daara burned down on 03 March 2013. Cases of talibés being crushed in traffic\u000awhile begging are also frequently reported.\u000a45. Despite the gravity of the problem, the Respondent State has not taken adequate measures to curb the\u000asituation. The Committee strongly believe that in the face of this tragedy, the Senegalese Government must\u000afinally tackle the country's widespread abuse and exploitation of young boys through forced begging. Tens\u000aof thousands of boys continue to live and beg in extremely precarious conditions, enriching teachers who\u000ahave twisted the country's tradition of religious education. The Committee, therefore, found the situation\u000aunacceptable and it contradicts the principles enshrined in the African Children's Charter and other\u000ainternational child rights instruments. Hence, the Government of Senegal has failed to ensure to the\u000amaximum extent possible, the survival, protection, and development of the talibés children, As such, the\u000aRespondent State is in violation of Article 5 of the African Children's Charter.\u000aC. Alleged violation of Article 11 (education)\u000a\u000a46. Article 11 of the Charter posits that States Parties have the obligation to provide free and compulsory\u000abasic education without any discrimination. 27 In realizing the right to education, the State must ensure,\u000ainter alia , the availability, accessibility and acceptability of the education provided to children. Availability is\u000aassessed in terms of quality; accessibility is determined in terms of equal opportunity, economic and\u000aphysical accessibility and acceptability is inferred from the quality of education provided. 28 A State Party is\u000anot only obliged to provide education but also to ensure that the education so provided is of acceptable\u000aquality. In the context of Article 11(2)(a) of the Charter, education should be directed towards the\u000adevelopment of child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential. The\u000aCommittee has noted the importance of education in relation to the responsibility of the child in its decision\u000aof the Children of Nubian Descents Case . 29 Children have responsibility to their family, society and\u000acountry under Article 31 of the Charter; and, as such, they can discharge these obligations only when they\u000aget the necessary education. Furthermore, education is a tool to enhance the protection of children from\u000adangerous and hazardous labour. 30 As the Commission has accentuated that the failure to provide access\u000ato institutions of learning would amount to a violation of the right to education under the African Charter on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights. 31\u000a47. The responsibility of a State in realizing the right to education includes the obligation to protect, fulfill,\u000arespect and promote. The protection mandate entails a responsibility up on the State to protect children's\u000aright to education from being violated by third parties. To this end the State Party should set minimum\u000astandards for all educational institutions 32 including the daaras . Article 11(5) of the Charter moreover\u000astates that: States Parties to the present Charter shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child\u000awho is subjected to schools or parental discipline shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the\u000ainherent dignity of the child and in conformity with the present Charter.\u000a48. The Respondent State, however, has failed to provide free and compulsory education to all children in\u000aaccordance with the Charter. Consequently, the talibés are forced to attend in the daaras where they are\u000a8\u000a\u000anot subjected to school fees except for the daily quota they should bring by begging. Nevertheless, the\u000achildren do not get the necessary education they are entitled to in the daaras. The talibés do not get\u000aeducation in daaras as they spend more time in begging to fulfill their daily quota. In addition, the\u000agovernment failed to provide the necessary curriculum and facilities in which the daaras function in\u000adelivering education.\u000a49. The Committee refers to the General Comment of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on the\u000aaims of education, which states that education should be designed to empower the child by developing his\u000aor her skills, learning and other capacities, human dignity, self-esteem and self-confidence. 33 Moreover,\u000athe Committee also refers to Article 9(b) of the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam which states\u000athat every human being has a right to receive both religious and worldly education . Therefore, the\u000aCommittee holds a view that while many marabouts in Senegal continue the traditional practice of teaching\u000atheir students the Quran, others have twisted the practice into a form of economic exploitation, as a result a\u000asignificant number of talibés in Senegal are failing to receive either a religious education or an education in\u000aother basic skills. It is in consideration of this fact that the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s\u000aCommittee of Experts criticized Senegal on March 2, 2012, for its failure to protect talibés from abusive\u000aconditions and demanded that Senegal do more to prosecute those responsible for forced begging and to\u000acarry out " daara modernization " - ensuring that the schools meet basic international standards of\u000aeducation and child protection.\u000a50. The government must enforce its own laws to protect talibés from this abuse and ensure that the\u000aeducation received in daaras equips these children with a rounded education, and does not allow forced\u000abegging. The Senegalese government enacted legislation in 2005 that criminalized forcing others into\u000abegging for personal financial gain. But the authorities have largely failed to take concrete steps to enforce\u000athe law and end the exploitation and abuse of the talibés . Therefore, the Government of Senegal has\u000aviolated the right to education of the talibés by failing to ensure the availability, accessibility and\u000aacceptability of the education and supervising the daaras .\u000aD. Alleged violation of Article 14 (health and health services)\u000a\u000a51. The Charter under Article 14 provides that State Parties should take measures to ensure the provision\u000aof necessary medical assistance and health care to all children with emphasis on the development of\u000aprimary health care; and to ensure the provision of adequate nutrition and safe drinking water . In Purohit\u000a&Moore V The Gambia the Commission stated that:\u000aEnjoyment of human right to health as it is widely known is vital to all aspects of a person's life and\u000awellbeing and is crucial to the realization of all the other fundamental human rights and freedoms. This right\u000aincludes the right to health facilities, access to goods and services to be guaranteed to all without\u000adiscrimination of any kind. 34\u000a52. The efforts undertaken by the State Party in realizing this right should be directed towards the\u000aprevention of diseases and health problems, and the provision of the necessary health care services. In\u000aensuring adequate nutrition and safe drinking water to all children, the CRC committee emphasized that\u000aschool feeding programmes, and the provision of safe and clean drinking water are essential to combat\u000adisease and malnutrition. 35 Failure to provide safe drinking water amounts to a violation of the right to the\u000abest attainable health under the Charter. 36\u000a53. Looking at the case under consideration, the poor conditions in the daara , combined with a lack of\u000aclothes and shoes for the long days on the street, increase the vulnerability of the talibés to different forms\u000aof health challenges. Forced to beg for food, many are also extremely malnourished. The Committee notes\u000athat when the talibés get sick their marabout rarely provides medicines, in some instances requiring them to\u000abeg even greater hours in order to pay for their own treatment. More often, despite their ill health the talibés\u000acontinue begging to satisfy the quota.\u000a\u000a9\u000a\u000a54. The Respondent State has the obligation to assure that children are not deprived of access to health\u000acare services. It should further take all the necessary steps to avert any kind of institutional, cultural and\u000afinancial obstacle to accessing health care services. 37 The State should not tolerate any practice which\u000aviolates the right to health of children. 38 It must assert that third parties do not deprive children of their right\u000ato access medical service.\u000a55. As submitted by the complainants, the talibés are not practically entitled to adequate sanitation and\u000anutrition which in effect endangers their health. The Committee notes that the marabouts as caregivers\u000ahave failed to ensure that the talibés get medical service.\u000a56. Hence the Committee concluded that the Respondent State has failed to provide the necessary\u000asanitation and nutrition to the talibés and it has also failed to take measures against the marabouts , who\u000aaccommodate talibés in squalid health conditions. The Respondent State has not taken appropriate steps\u000awithin its available resource to prevent disease and malnutrition, as well as to avoid barriers to access the\u000ahealth services of those children in need of medical care. Therefore, the Committee finds the Respondent\u000aState in violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\u000aE. Alleged violation of Article 15 (child labour)\u000a\u000a57. The Complainants allege that the urban talibés are an identifiable group of children vulnerable to be\u000aexploited for the worst forms of child labour. Accordingly they submit that the number of hours the children\u000aspent per day begging, the beatings for not bringing a sufficient quota of goods per day and the health and\u000asafety risks caused by standing in busy streets is contrary to international laws which categorize child\u000abegging as a practice of exploitive labour. 39\u000a58. Art 15 of the African Children's Charter obliges State Parties to take legislative and administrative\u000ameasures for the formal and informal employment sector to protect children from all types of economic\u000aexploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with their physical,\u000amental, spiritual, moral or social development. Further the International Labour Organization's (ILO)\u000aConvention 182 under Art 1\u000a× Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall take immediate and effective measures to secure the\u000aprohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency.\u000aand 9\u000a× The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the\u000aInternational Labour Office for registration.\u000arequires States to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and implementation of the Convention.\u000a59. In the case at hand, contrary what is prescribed under the regional and international instruments, the\u000aCommittee notes that many marabous force the talibés to beg on the streets for long hours-a practice that\u000ameets the ILO definition of a worst form of child labor. The Committee is of the view that the forced\u000abegging, physical abuse, and dangerous daily living conditions endured by these talibés violate domestic\u000aand international law. Despite being party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter\u000aon the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and all major international and regional treaties on child labor and\u000atrafficking, which provide clear prohibitions against the worst forms of child labor, physical violence, and\u000atrafficking, Senegal has scantily enforced the laws.\u000a60. The Committee notes that in the last decade, the government has notably defined forced begging as a\u000aworst form of child labor and criminalized forcing another into begging for economic gain, but this adequate\u000alegislation has so far led to little concrete action. No marabout was held accountable for forced begging,\u000agross neglect, and severe physical abuse against the talibés .\u000a61. In view of this, the Committee believes that forced begging places children in a harmful situation on the\u000astreet and therefore meets the ILO's definition of a worst form of child labor. Moreover, the Committee\u000a10\u000a\u000anotes that the forced begging and gross neglect is done with a view toward exploitation, with the marabout\u000areceiving the child from his/her parents and profiting from the child's labor, which resulted in continuous\u000asuffering oftens of thousands of talibés in Senegal. Though the Respondent State has ratified international\u000alaws and prohibits the act of child begging under its national law, it has failed to take any effective\u000aadministrative measures against the marabouts and to protect the talibés from exploitation. Therefore, the\u000aGovernment of Senegal has violated Article 15(2) of the African Children's Charter which requires the State\u000aParty to take appropriate administrative measures to ensure the full protection of children from child labor\u000ahaving regard to the relevant provisions of the ILO's instruments.\u000aF. Alleged violation of Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture)\u000a\u000a62. In this communication the Complainants submit that the fact that the talibés are regularly subjected to\u000abeatings and fear in cases where they do not reach the minimum daily begging quota, leads to high levels\u000aof stress and anxiety which amounts to violation of their right to be protected from abuse and torture under\u000aArt 16 of the African Children's Charter.\u000a63. Considering the complaint, the Committee notes that as prescribed under the African Children's\u000aCharter, protecting children from abuse and torture requires States to adopt legislative, administrative,\u000asocial and educational measures through effective establishment of special monitoring units to provide\u000anecessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as other forms of\u000aprevention and identification, reporting referral investigation, treatment, and follow-up of instances of child\u000aabuse and neglect.\u000a64. Taking into consideration the elements of the provision of the law and the acts as alleged by the\u000aComplainants, the Committee discusses whether the beatings committed by marabouts amounts to child\u000aabuse and torture. In this regard the Committee refers to the jurisprudences of the ACHPR. In Curtis\u000aFrancis Doebbler v Sudan the African Commission found the act of lashing as it constitutes a cruel\u000atreatment. 40 Moreover, in International Pen and Others v Nigeria , the ACHPR defines inhumane and\u000adegrading treatment to include not only actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but\u000awhich humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his will or conscience . 41\u000a65. In the case at hand, the Committee notes that the beating of the talibés qualifies as a physical\u000apunishment since physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort for not\u000abringing the required quota. There are also reported cases where talibés typically described being taken to\u000aa room, stripped of their shirt, and beaten with an electric cable or a club. 42 In some instances the beatings\u000aand physical abuse may rise to the level of torture under the Convention against Torture. According to the\u000aConvention torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\u000aintentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a\u000aconfession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having\u000acommitted, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of\u000aany kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\u000aacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity 43 .\u000a66. With regard to the accountability of State actors for acts committed by non-state actors, the Committee\u000arefers to the explanation given by the Committee on the Convention against Torture. The Committee on the\u000aConvention against Torture states that where state authorities or others acting in official capacity or under\u000acolour of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being\u000acommitted by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due diligence to prevent,\u000ainvestigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials or private actors consistently with the\u000aConvention, the State bears responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or\u000aotherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible act . 44\u000a67. Legislative, administrative, social and educational measures are the means through which States can\u000afulfill their obligation to protect children from any form of violence. 45 Although there are legislative and\u000a11\u000a\u000asocial initiatives in Senegal to protect the rights of children in general, the government failed to take specific\u000aadministrative and judicial measures against the marabouts . The Respondent State did not deny the fact\u000athat since 2010 only 10 cases have been brought against marabouts who exploits children resulting in only\u000anine convictions. Apart from the social term orientation for children in the street and destitute families and\u000a24 Department Committees for the Protection of the Child (CDPE), 46 the Committee notes that there are\u000ano educational and sufficient social measures that aim at changing the situation of the talibés .\u000a68. As the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that the prohibition against physical and\u000amental violence also applies to corporal punishment in schools. 47 The physical abuse likewise places the\u000amarabout in conflict with Senegal's penal code, which provides particular care to children. 48 The severe\u000aphysical abuse that many marabouts inflict on the talibés , as well as the looming threat of violence,\u000atherefore violates the children's right to freedom from physical and mental violence and abuse and torture.\u000aThe Government of Senegal therefore is in clear violation of Article 16 of the African Children's Charter\u000awhich requires the State Party to protect children from physical, mental, injury, abuse, neglect,\u000amaltreatment and torture.\u000aG. Alleged violation of Article 21 (protection against harmful social and cultural practices)\u000a\u000a69. According to Article 21(1)(a) of the African Children's Charter, States Parties are under obligation to\u000atake measures towards the elimination of harmful social and cultural practices which endanger the health or\u000alife of the child. Furthermore, Article 1(3) of the Charter provides that:\u000aAny custom, tradition, culture or religious practice that is inconsistent with the rights, duties and obligations\u000acontained in the present Charter shall to the extent of such inconsistency be discouraged.\u000a70. A harmful practice, according to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the\u000aConvention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), should meet the\u000afollowing criteria;\u000a\u000a1. They constitute a denial of the dignity and/or integrity of the individual and a violation of human\u000arights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the two Conventions;\u000a2. They constitute discrimination against women or children and are harmful insofar as they result in\u000anegative consequences for them as individuals or groups, including physical, psychological,\u000aeconomic and social harm and/or violence and limitations on their capacity to participate fully in\u000asociety or develop and reach their full potential;\u000a3. They are traditional, re-emerging or emerging practices that are prescribed and/or kept in place by\u000asocial norms that perpetuate male dominance and inequality of women and children, based on sex,\u000agender, age and other intersecting factors;\u000a4. They are imposed on women and children by family, community members, or society at large,\u000aregardless of whether the victim provides, or is able to provide, full, free and informed consent.\u000a49\u000a\u000a71. Therefore, States Parties must take legislative, administrative and other appropriate measures to\u000aabolish any practice inconsistent with the Charter. Using children in any form of begging is one form of\u000aharmful practice which is clearly prohibited under Article 29 of the African Children's Charter; and the State\u000amust take all the necessary steps to restrict such practice.\u000a72. Even though the Respondent State has outlawed the practice of forced begging under Article 3 of Law\u000aNo. 2005-06, the talibés are still being forced to beg and bring back to the daaras a daily quota the failure\u000aof which incurs punishment. The State has not taken any measures against these schools. The talibés are\u000arequired to bring a daily quota, in order to fulfill their quota they have to beg on the street where they will be\u000aexposed to exploitation. The forced begging has compromised their right to life and development as they\u000a12\u000a\u000aare often injured from traffic accidents. Moreover, this cultural practice by the marabouts causes the\u000aviolation of other provisions of the Charter. The talibés are not enjoying their legal right to play, leisure and\u000acultural activities which can advance their mental and psychological developments. This activity of begging\u000ais deep rooted in the Qur'anic schools and the Committee is of the view that it is a harmful practice.\u000a73. The government of Senegal has failed to take measures against the marabouts , to monitor the\u000asituation of children in the Qur'anic schools, and to ensure that the talibés are getting the necessary\u000aeducation to which they are entitled. Even though the marabouts are non-state actors, the State of Senegal\u000ais responsible for the violation caused by such actors due to its obligation to protect the rights of children.\u000aThe Committee thus finds a violation of Article 21(1) of the African Children's Charter by the Respondent\u000aState.\u000aH. Alleged violation of Article 29 (sale, trafficking and abduction, and using children in the form of begging)\u000a\u000a74. Citing Article 29 of the African Children's Charter, the complainants argued that the State Party has\u000aviolated the Charter which expressly forbids forced begging and States Parties to take appropriate\u000ameasures to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form, by any\u000aperson including parents or legal guardians of the child; and the use of children in all forms of begging. The\u000acomplainants also made reference to the ILO Conventions which make it clear that states are responsible\u000afor the prevention of child labour through effective enforcement. Further, they expressly state that work akin\u000ato slavery (which includes trafficking of children and compulsory labour) and work that harms the health,\u000asafety or morals of children comprises the worst forms of child labour. 50\u000a75. Considering the alleged fact, the Committee finds it important to expound on what amounts to child\u000asale, trafficking and abduction. The Committee notes that children are one of the most vulnerable groups\u000atargeted for the trafficking in human beings. Children are trafficked as they can be easily recruited and\u000aquickly replaced. The exploitation of children violates the human rights of children to have a safe childhood\u000ain their family setting, to receive education, to have time to play and to be protected from exploitation. Child\u000atrafficking involves the recruitment of victims, their transportation, transfer and harbouring of children for the\u000apurpose of exploitation. Coercion, violence or threats are not necessary elements in cases of child\u000atrafficking as children cannot consent. 51 Children are trafficked for the same purposes as adults: for sexual\u000aexploitation, for labour exploitation but also for exploitation in a range of criminal activities, including\u000abegging.\u000a76. The use of children in all forms of begging is strictly forbidden under Article 29(b) of the Africa\u000aChildren's Charter. Article 29(a) in addition prohibits trafficking of children for any purpose in any form. In\u000athis regard, the Committee refers to the definition provided by the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and\u000aPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations\u000aConvention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC). Under Article 3 the Protocol defines trafficking\u000aas;\u000a[T]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use\u000aof force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a\u000aposition of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a\u000aperson having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a\u000aminimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or\u000aservices, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\u000a77. The Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and\u000aChildren as adopted by the African Union Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, Tripoli,\u000a22-23 November 2006, also conceptualizes trafficking in persons as it happens within and between states,\u000aurges States to take measures to eliminate harmful customs and traditional practices, including forced child\u000abegging, which can lead to trafficking in human beings, including children.\u000a\u000a13\u000a\u000a78. Looking at the case at hand, the Committee realized that the talibés are forcibly subjected to economic\u000aexploitation through forced labour; and they are used for begging by the marabouts . Given the ILO's views\u000aon forced begging, the Committee concludes that marabouts , when transporting talibés with the primary\u000aintention of obtaining labour from them, are engaging in child trafficking. Article 3(c) of the Trafficking in\u000aPersons Protocol includes in the definition of trafficking in persons the recruitment, transportation, transfer,\u000aharbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation.\u000a79. Moreover, the Committee learns from reports that only about half the talibés in Senegal are\u000aSenegalese. The rest are trafficked from neighboring countries, including Guinea Bissau and Mali, where\u000apoor families are promised their sons will be remunerated as they will receive a proper Islamic education\u000aunder the care of a marabout at the daaras . The boys often have no contact with their families once they\u000aleave home, and because most do not know anyone in Senegal, they become entirely reliant on marabout\u000afor food, health care and shelter.\u000a80. These acts, according to the Committee violate the children's rights to be protected from sale, trafficking\u000aand abduction. The Respondent State has not contested this allegation of the Complainants. The\u000aCommittee has observed that the Respondent State has taken legislative measures against begging and\u000atrafficking. However, the Committee is of the view that legislative measures alone cannot sufficiently protect\u000athe rights of children; and the State Party should also take administrative and other appropriate measures\u000ato ensure that children are not subjected to begging or trafficking as stipulated under Article 1 of the\u000aCharter. Reaffirming this position in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v Zimbabwe , 52 the ACHPR\u000astates that an act by a private individual or (non-state actor) and therefore not directly imputable to a state,\u000acan generate responsibility of the State, not because of the act itself, but because of the lack of due\u000adiligence on the part of the state to prevent the violation or for not taking the necessary steps to provide the\u000avictims with reparation. 53\u000a81. The Committee, therefore, has found the Respondent State in violation of Article 29 of the African\u000aChildren's' Charter which with no exception prohibits forced begging and requires States Parties to take\u000aappropriate measures to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or trafficking of children.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Committee\u000a\u000a82. Because of the foregoing reasons, the Committee finds multiple violations of the African Children's\u000aCharter as follows: Article 4 (best interest of the child); Article 5 (survival and development); Article 11 (the\u000aright to education); Article 14 (health and health services); Article 15 (child labour); Article 29 (sale,\u000atrafficking and abduction); Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture); and {[21,Article 21}}\u000a(protection against harmful social and cultural practices). Therefore, the Committee recommends that the\u000aRespondent State should, in accordance with its obligations under the African Children's Charter,\u000aundertake the necessary measures:\u000a\u000a1. To ensure that all talibés are immediately taken back from the streets to their families;\u000a2. Through cooperation with the neighboring countries (from where some of the children are coming),\u000ainternational and national organisations, facilitate the reunion of the talibés with their families; [[/li]]\u000a3. To establish functioning and effective institutions and mechanisms to provide the talibés with shortand long-term, appropriate psychological, medical and social assistance in order to promote their\u000afull recovery;\u000a4. To establish minimum norms and standards for all daaras relating to health, safety, hygiene,\u000aeducation content and quality, and accommodation;\u000a5. To integrate the daaras into the formal education system;\u000a6. To inspect the daaras regularly to ensure that standards set out in the Charter and local legislation\u000aare complied with and close all the daaras which are not in compliance with the required standards;\u000a7. With a view of fighting impunity and preventing forced begging, sale, abduction and trafficking of\u000achildren, ensure that all the perpetrators are brought to justice and held accountable for their actions\u000a14\u000a\u000awith penalties commensurate with the severity of their crimes;\u000a8. On the talibés right to education: [list=i]\u000a9. Make sure that education contributes in promoting and developing their personality, talents and their\u000aphysical and mental abilities to their fullest potential,\u000a10. The Government's education policy should be reviewed in light of fostering respect for human rights\u000aand fundamental freedoms, and\u000a11. Ensure the provision of free and compulsory basic education.\u000a[*] To train law enforcement and judicial personnel, social workers, traditional and religious leaders, parents\u000aand the community at large on children's rights in general and prohibitions of child begging in particular; [*]\u000aTo conduct joint studies with the concerned neighboring State Parties on the situation of talibés' children in\u000aSenegal and countries of origin; [*] To fully recognize and implement the rights included in the African\u000aChildren's Charter and in other international instruments; [*] While complying with its reporting obligation in\u000aaccordance with article 43 of the African Children's Charter, the State Party should provide the Committee\u000awith sufficient information on the progress of implementation of the current decision [*] To cooperate with\u000athe African Union, International and National Organisations, the UN Agencies, particularly UNICEF, ILO,\u000aWorld Health organisation (WHO), with a view to fully implement these recommendations and alleviate the\u000achallenges of talibés in Senegal; and [*] As per Section XXI (1) of the Revised Communication Guidelines\u000aof the Committee, the Government shall report to the Committee on all measures taken to implement the\u000adecision of the Committee within 180 days from the date of receipt of the Committee's decision.

The Applicant filed the Application on the basis of Criminal Cases Nos. 915/2007, 931/2007, 933/2007,\u000a1027/2007, 1029/2007,883/2008, 712/2009 and 716/2009 that were on\u2212 going against him in the District\u000aCourt of Arusha ("hereinafter referred to as the Criminal Cases") alleging that he was unlawfully arrested,\u000ainterrogated, detained, charged and imprisoned contrary to Sections 13(1)(a) and (b), 3(a), (b) and (c),\u000a32(1), (2) and (3), 33, 38 (1), (2) and (3), 50 (1) and 52(1), (2) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act,\u000aChapter 20 of the Laws of Tanzania, Revised Edition 2002 ("hereinafter referred to as the Criminal\u000aProcedure Act''). The Applicant alleges that his arrest, detention, charging and imprisonment in connection\u000awith the Criminal Cases were unlawful and therefore violated his right under Article 15(1) and (2) (a) of the\u000aConstitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, to freedom, as well as the guarantee that such freedom\u000ashall only be deprived under circumstances, and in accordance, with procedures prescribed by law. The\u000aApplicant also alleges that the seizure of his property, allegedly in connection with the Criminal Cases, is in\u000acontravention of his right to property as set out in Article 24(1) and (2) of the Constitution of the United\u000aRepublic of Tanzania, and therefore unlawful.\u000a4. The Applicant also alleges that the Police of the United Republic of Tanzania contravened the procedure\u000afor the search and seizure of property as set out in the Criminal Procedure Act in relation to his property.\u000aThe Applicant alleges the violation of his right to own property, of the protection of his property held in\u000aaccordance with the law, and the right not to be unlawfully deprived of his property, as provided for in\u000aArticles 24(1) and (2) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.\u000aProcedure\u000a5.

By a letter dated 20 February 2012, the Applicant responded to the Registrar's letter of 13 February\u000a2012, alleging that despite his efforts, through correspondence to various Ministries and the Commission\u000aon Human Rights and Good Governance, to have his complaints addressed, nothing has happened,\u000aresulting in an inordinate delay in accessing local remedies to resolve the matters that are the basis of his\u000aapplication. He stated that he has also brought an action, Criminal Application Number 16 of 2011 filed at\u000athe High Court of Tanzania at Arusha on 19 May 2011 under certificate of urgency alleging violation of his\u000aconstitutional rights. He stated that the case has not been heard due to the lack of coram of three Judges\u000aas required by the Basic Rights and Duties Enforcement Act. He stated that such a delay in determining\u000athis petition is unduly prolonged and is contrary to Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\u000a2\u000a\u000aRights ("hereinafter referred to as the Charter").\u000a8. By a letter dated 27 February 2012 the Registrar acknowledged receipt of the Applicant's letter dated 20\u000aFebruary 2012 and advised him that his Application has been registered as Application Number 00312012\u000aPeter Joseph Chacha v The United Republic of Tanzania.\u000a9.

The Applicant was charged with several counts of conspiracy, robbery, murder, armed robbery, rape\u000aand kidnapping as follows :\u000a1. Criminal Case No. 915/2007 dated 8 November 2007 wherein the Applicant was jointly charged with\u000aAkida Mohamed, with conspiracy to commit an offence and stealing. This case eventually became\u000aCriminal Case No. 712/2\u000a2. Criminal Case No. 931/2007 dated 30 November 2007 wherein the Applicant was charged jointly\u000awith Hamisi Jumanne and Rajabu Hamisi, with armed robbery.

Criminal Case No.1027/2007 dated 16 April 2008 and the charge was armed robbery. This case\u000awas withdrawn and eventually the case became Criminal Case No.883/2008 dated 2 December\u000a7\u000a\u000a2008 wherein the Applicant was charged with armed robbery and rape.\u000a5. Criminal Case No. 1029/2007 which eventually became Criminal Case No. 712/2009 dated 21\u000aDecember 2009 wherein the Applicant was charged with armed robbery. The original charge sheet\u000aindicated that the alleged incident of armed robbery occurred on 12 September 2009 yet the\u000aApplicant was already in custody at the time the alleged offence occurred. In the course of the\u000ahearing of this easel the Applicant alerted the Magistrate's Court to the Prosecution's substitution of\u000athe charge on 13 November 2012, to reflect the alleged incident of armed robbery.\u000a6. Criminal Case No. 716/2009 dated 23 December 2009 wherein the Applicant was charged with\u000aarmed robbery, kidnapping with intent to do harm and rape, though he was not present in Court.\u000a54. The Applicant's wife was charged with robbery and possession of stolen items under Criminal Case No.\u000a799 of 2007. She was in remand from 12 September 2007 until her release on 25 October 2007.\u000a55. There being no progress in the prosecutions against him, the Applicant corresponded severally with the\u000aMinistry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, the Attorney General's\u000aChambers', Public Prosecution Division and the Commission on Human Rights and Good Governance.\u000aseeking their intervention in ensuring the prosecutions against him either proceeded or were withdrawn for\u000alack of evidence and that his seized property be restored to him\u000a56. Having received no resolution of the issues he raised with the said authorities and institutions, the\u000aApplicant informed the Director of the Attorney General's Chambers' Public Prosecution Division and the\u000aMinister of Home Affairs that he would move to the High Court to have these issues resolved.\u000a57. In 2007, the Applicant filed Miscellaneous Criminal Application No. 7 of 2007, Originating from Criminal\u000aCase No. 933 of 2007, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, under Section 357(a) of the Criminal\u000aProcedure Act, against the Attorney General of the Respondent. He sought orders for restitution of his\u000aproperty seized on 12 September 2007 while he was in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and for any order the\u000aCourt deemed fit to grant. At the hearing of the Applicant's application, the Respondent therein contended\u000athat the High Court lacked jurisdiction to order the restitution of the Applicant's property as the right Court to\u000aissue such an order was the District Court where the Applicant was facing prosecution on a murder charge.\u000aThe Applicant argued that there was no connection between the murder charge he was facing and the\u000aproperty that the Police had seized. The High Court stated that as the High Court had jurisdiction over\u000amurder cases, it followed that the High Court had jurisdiction to order restitution of property in murder\u000acases. However, in the instant case, because there was no connection between the property seized by the\u000aPolice and the murder charge which the Applicant was facing, the High Court's jurisdi ction to order the\u000arestitution of the property was ousted and the only avenue open to him was to approach the District Court\u000awhere he was charged, to seek orders for restitution of his property. The Court also stated that though the\u000aApplicant could have applied for prerogative orders from the High Court, being the only court vested with\u000ajurisdiction to issue such orders, such orders could only be granted if they would in no way prejudice the\u000ainterests of justice in respect of the murder charge the Applicant faced. In this regard therefore, the High\u000aCourt stated that since the murder charge the Applicant was facing in Criminal Case No. 933 of 2007 was\u000apending, the Applicant's application to the High Court was premature and that it had to be stayed until final\u000adetermination of the pending murder charge unless the seized properties had no connection with the\u000acharge he facect\u000a58 In addition. by the time the High Court heard the Application, the charges in the rest of the Criminal\u000aCases had been filed against the Applicant and the fact that there were additional criminal charges filed\u000aagainst him was a reason for the High Court to decline jurisdiction, and to refer the Applicant back to the\u000aDistrict Court as the proper forum for adjudicating whether the property in dispute had a connection with the\u000aCriminal Cases the Applicant was facing. The High Court stated that, indeed, the Applicant's property had\u000abeen seized and that the authorities were required to keep it in safe custody pending determination of the\u000aCriminal Cases the Applicant was facing. For these reasons, on 14 December 2010, the High Court of\u000aTanzania at Arusha dismissed the application for the release of property, as being premature.\u000a59 In the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, in 2009. the Applicant filed Miscellaneous Criminal Application\u000aNo. 54 of 2009 originating from Criminal Case No. 933 of 2007 under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure\u000aAct for the charges preferred against him to be discharged. On 11 August 2010, The application was struck\u000a8\u000a\u000aout as it did not specify the subsection of Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act under which it was\u000amade and that the Applicant's prayers were stated in the affidavit in support of the application rather than in\u000athe Chamber Summons.\u000a60. Again, in 2010, the Applicant filed, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Miscellaneous Criminal\u000aApplication No. 6 of 2010 in accordance with Section 90 (1) (c) (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act requesting\u000aa discontinuance of the Criminal Cases under Section 90(1)(c ) of the Criminal Procedure Act as the\u000aactions that the Police had taken were contrary to Sections 32, 33, 50(1), 51(1) and 52(1), (2) and (3)\u000athereof. The application was against the Attorney General of the Respondent. On 16 November 2010, the\u000aapplication was struck out for being incompetent as it was filed under a repealed section of the law, that is\u000aSection 90 (1) (c) (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which was repealed by Section 31 of the National\u000aProsecution Act No.27 of 2008 which had come into effect on 9 June 2008.\u000a61. The Applicant also filed. in 2010, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Miscellaneous Civil\u000aApplication No. 47 of 2010, originating from the Criminal Cases, against the Respondent. The application\u000awas on the basis of Articles 13(1), 15(1), (2) (a) and 30 (3) of the Constitution of the United Republic of\u000aTanzania guaranteeing equality before the law and the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one's freedom.\u000aOn 14 December 2010, the High Court struck out the application as it was not properly made since it had\u000abeen filed by way of Chamber Summons and supporting affidavit. According to the High Court, the matter\u000ashould have been brought in accordance with Section 5 of the Basic Rights and Duties Enforcement Act,\u000awhich sets out the appropriate procedure, namely, that the case be filed by way of a Petition and\u000aOriginating Summons. In addition. such an application must be determined by a three-Judge Bench and not\u000aa single Judge, as was in the instant case.\u000a62 On 8 December 2010, the Applicant filed, in the High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Miscellaneous\u000aCriminal Application No. 78 of 2010, originating from the Criminal Cases, against the Attorney General of\u000athe Respondent, as First Respondent, and the Police Officer in Charge of Arusha, as Second Respondent,\u000aon the basis of Articles 13(1), 15(1), (2) (a) and 30 (3) of the Constitution of the United Republic of\u000aTanzania. These provisions guarantee equality before the law and the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of\u000aone's freedom. In the application, the Applicant alleged violation of his right to freedom and to live as a free\u000aperson. The Applicant alleged that the Second Respondent had arrested, detained and interrogated him in\u000arespect of what would be the Criminal Cases, contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act and\u000athat therefore the actions of the Second Respondent in that regard were vitiated by these irregularities. The\u000aApplicant sought a decree under Part 111 of Chapter One of the Constitution of the United Republic of\u000aTanzania to this effect. On 18 May 2011, the High Court issued an order that the application was withdrawn\u000aat the Applicant's instance.\u000a\u000a9\u000a\u000a

The communications 139/94 and\u000a154/96 also complain of similar human rights violations suffered by Mr Saro-Wiwa's co-defendants, also\u000aOgoni leaders.\u000a2. The communications 137/94 and 139/94 were submitted in 1994 before any trial began. After the murder\u000aof four Ogoni leaders on 21st May 1994, following riot during a public meeting organised by Movement for\u000athe Survival of the Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP) representing the rights of those who lived in oil producing\u000aareas of Ogoni land, Saro-Wiwa and many hundreds of others were arrested, Saro-Wiwa himself on 22nd\u000aMay 1994 and the vice-president of MOSOP, Ledum Mitee, shortly thereafter. Both communications allege\u000athat Mr Saro-Wiwa was severely beaten during the first days of his detention and was held for several days\u000ain leg irons and handcuffs. He was also denied access to his lawyer and the medicine he needed to control\u000ahis blood pressure, at times prevented from seeing his family, and held in very poor conditions.\u000a3. In its communication, submitted on 9th September 1994, the Constitutional Rights Project included a list\u000aof 16 other Ogonis who had been held without charge or bail for what was at that time over three months.\u000aBoth communications alleged that Mr Saro-Wiwa had been detained because of his political work in relation\u000ato MOSOP. He had been detained five times for brief periods since the beginning of 1993, and released\u000aeach time without charge, except on one occasion in mid-1993 where he was held for several weeks and\u000acharged with unlawful assembly.\u000a4. The State Military Administrator declared that Mr Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants had incited members\u000aof MOSOP to murder four rival Ogoni leaders, but no charges were brought until 28th January 1995. In the\u000amonths between arrest and the beginning of the trial, the defendants were not allowed to meet with their\u000alawyers, and no information on the charges was provided to the defence.\u000a5. In February 1995 the trial of the defendants began before a tribunal established under the Civil\u000aDisturbances Act. The three members of this tribunal were appointed directly by General Abacha in\u000aNovember 1994, although counsel for the Rivers State Administrator argued in August that the cases were\u000awithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Rivers State High Court, since Rivers State is where the offences\u000aoccurred.\u000a6. In June 1995 the Constitutional Rights Project submitted a supplement to its communication, alleging\u000airregularities in the conduct of the trial itself: harassment of defence counsel, a military officer's presence at\u000awhat should have been confidential meetings between defendants and their counsel, bribery of witnesses,\u000aand evidence of bias on the part of the tribunal members themselves. In October 1995 PEN also copied to\u000athe Commission a letter it sent to General Abacha protesting the lack of concrete evidence and the unfair\u000aconduct of the trial.\u000a7. On 30th and 31st October 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of the co-defendants (Saturday Dobee, Felix\u000aNuate, Nordu Eawo, Paul Levura, Daniel Gbokoo, Barinem Kiobel, John Kpunien and Baribor Bera) were\u000asentenced to death, while six others including Mr Mitee were acquitted. The CRP submitted an emergency\u000asupplement to its communication on 2nd November 1995, asking the Commission to adopt provisional\u000ameasures to prevent the executions.\u000a8. The Secretariat of the Commission faxed a Note Verbale invoking interim measures under revised Rule\u000a111 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, the Secretary\u000aGeneral of the OAU, the Special Advisor (Legal) to the Head of State, the Ministry of Justice of Nigeria, and\u000athe Nigerian High Commission in The Gambia. The Note Verbale pointed out that as the case of Mr\u000aSaro-Wiwa and the others was already before the Commission, and the government of Nigeria had invited\u000athe Commission to undertake a mission to that country, during which mission the communications would be\u000a1\u000a\u000adiscussed, the executions should be delayed until the Commission had discussed the case with the\u000aNigerian authorities.\u000a9. No response to this appeal was received before the executions were carried out.\u000a10. On 7th November 1995 the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) confirmed the sentences of death and on\u000a10th November 1995 all the accused persons were executed in secret at the Port Harcourt Prison. By\u000asection 7 of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunals) Decree No. 2 of 1987, under which the executed\u000apersons were tried, the PRC are required to receive the records of the trial Tribunal before confirmation of\u000athe decision is possible. These records were not prepared by the Tribunal and so were not available for the\u000aPRC.\u000a11. In 1996 the Secretariat received a communication from INTERIGHTS representing Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr.\u000aIt alleged that the condemned persons had been detained arbitrarily prior to and during the trial and that\u000athey had been subjected to torture in the Army camp. Furthermore it alleged serious irregularities\u000aconcerning the conduct of the trial: that the tribunals that convicted the accused persons were not\u000aindependent; that there was no presumption of innocence; that the accused persons had not been given\u000atime or facilities in which to prepare their defence; that they had been denied legal representation by a\u000acounsel of their choice; that there was no right of appeal and that following the sentencing the persons\u000awere held incommunicado. INTERIGHTS asserted that they were tried, convicted and sentenced to death\u000afor the peaceful expression of their views and opinions on the violations of the rights of the Ogoni people.\u000a12. In December 1996 the Secretariat received a communication from the Civil Liberties Organisation,\u000aalleging that the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree is invalid because it was made without\u000aparticipation of the people; that its composition with military officers and members of the Provisional Ruling\u000aCouncil meant that it could not be impartial; and that the lack of judicial review of the decisions of this\u000atribunal amount to a violation of the right to appeal and fair trial. The communication alleges that the trial,\u000aconviction and sentencing of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others violated Articles 7(1) (b), 7(1) (c) and 7(1)(d) of\u000athe African Charter, and that the execution of these persons violates Article 4. The communication alleges\u000athat the arraignment of 19 more alleged suspects constitutes another potential violation of the Charter.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a13. The communications allege violation of Articles 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 26 of the African Charter.\u000aThe State response and observations\u000a\u000a14. The government argues that its actions were necessary to protect the rights of the citizens who had\u000abeen murdered; that the tribunal which tried Saro-Wiwa was competent because two of its three members\u000awere lawyers; that the process of confirmation by a state government was an adequate appeal; that the\u000aCivil Disturbances Decree had not been protested upon its enactment in 1987 and that it had been set up\u000ato deal with a crisis situation.\u000a\u000aProcedure before the Commission\u000a15. Communication 137/94 is dated 28th September 1994 and was submitted by International Pen.\u000a16. Communication 139/94 is submitted by Constitutional Rights Project and dated 9th September 1994.\u000a17. The Commission was seized of the communications at its 16th Session in October 1994, but deferred its\u000adecision on admissibility pending notification and receipt of additional information from the Nigerian\u000aGovernment.\u000a18. At the 16th session the Commission decided to merge the communications.\u000a19. On 9th November 1994, a notification of the two communications was sent to the Nigerian Government\u000aand Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure was invoked, requesting the Nigerian Government not to cause\u000airreparable prejudice to Mr. Saro-Wiwa.\u000a20. On 6th February 1995 a letter was received from International Pen stating that Mr Saro-Wiwa was being\u000aill-treated and that he was facing the death penalty.\u000a21. On 13th February a letter was sent to the Nigerian Government re-emphasising the need for Rule 109 to\u000abe applied.\u000a22. On 22nd February 1995, a letter was received from Complainants stating that Ken Saro-Wiwa had been\u000acharged and was scheduled to appear before a three person tribunal from which there was no right of\u000a2\u000a\u000aappeal. The tribunal members are chosen by General Abacha in violation of international fair trial\u000astandards. The complainant recognised that local remedies had yet to be exhausted and announced its\u000aintention to present an update of the case to the Commission once the trial was completed.\u000a23. At the 17th Session the Commission declared the communications admissible. They were to be heard\u000aon their merits at the 18th Session.\u000a24. On 20th April 1995, letters were sent to the Government of Nigeria and the complainants informing them\u000aof this.\u000a25. On 28th June 1995 a letter was received from the Constitutional Rights Project describing developments\u000ain the case.\u000a26. On 1st September 1995, a letter was sent to the government of Nigeria stating that the communication\u000awould be heard on the merits at the 18th Session of the Commission and inviting the government to send a\u000arepresentative.\u000a27. At the 18th Session the Commission decided that the communications should be taken up by the\u000amission planned for Nigeria.\u000a28. On 9th October 1995 a letter was received from PEN American Centre expressing concern for the state\u000aof health of Mr Saro-Wiwa.\u000a29. On 1st November 1995, upon hearing that a death sentence had been passed on Mr Saro-Wiwa and\u000aeight of his co-defendants, the Secretariat faxed a Note Verbale to the government of Nigeria, invoking the\u000arevised Rule 111 of Procedure (formerly 109) asking that the executions should be delayed until the\u000aCommission had taken its mission and spoken with the competent authorities. This Note Verbale was also\u000afaxed to the Secretary General of the OAU, the Nigerian High Commission in Banjul, and the Special\u000aAdviser (Legal) to the Head of State of Nigeria.\u000a30. On 2nd November 1995 a letter was received from the Constitutional Rights Project notifying the\u000aSecretariat of the death sentences and requesting that provisional measures be invoked.\u000a31. On 9th November 1995 Commissioner Dankwa, hearing that the death sentence had been confirmed,\u000awrote to the Secretariat requesting such action. He was faxed a copy of the Note Verbale.\u000a32. On 20th November 1995 the Secretariat received a Note Verbale from the Nigerian High Commissioner\u000ain Banjul, attempting to justify the executions.\u000a33. On 21st November 1995 the Secretariat wrote a Note Verbale to the Nigerian High Commission in\u000aBanjul, requesting the official judgement in the Saro-Wiwa case, which had been mentioned in the Note\u000aVerbale.\u000a34. On 30th November 1995 a letter was sent to the Complainants stating that the communications would\u000abe taken up by the Commission's mission to Nigeria.\u000a35. On 13th December 1995, the Secretariat received a letter dated 13th November 1995 from the office of\u000athe Special Adviser to the Head of State, attempting to justify the executions.\u000a36. On 18th and 19th December 1995, the Commission held an extraordinary session on Nigeria in\u000aKampala.\u000a37. On 26th January 1996 a letter was sent to the Constitutional Rights Project informing it of the interim\u000ameasures taken with regard to Ken Saro-Wiwa.\u000a38. At the 19th Session, held in March/April 1996 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the Commission heard\u000astatements from the government of Nigeria and the Complainants. Mr Chidi Anselm Odinkalu was duly\u000aauthorised to appear for the Complainants, and Mr Osah and Mr Bello appeared for the Nigerian\u000aGovernment. At the end of the hearing the Commission took a general view on the cases and deferred\u000ataking final decision in each case pending the accomplishment of its proposed mission to Nigeria. The\u000aCommission proposed May 1996 as the dates for the visit. The Nigerian delegation said they will\u000acommunicate these dates to the Government of Nigeria for confirmation.\u000a39. On 8th May 1996 the Commission wrote to the Nigerian Government, Constitutional Rights Project and\u000aInternational PEN informing them that a decision had been taken at the 19th Session to send a mission to\u000athe country where the cases would be taken up.\u000a40. At the 20th Session held in Grand Bay, Mauritius, October 1996, the Commission decided to postpone\u000athe final decision on the merits of the communications to the next session, awaiting the result of the\u000aplanned mission to Nigeria. The Commission also decided to join communication 154/96 with these\u000acommunications.\u000a41. On 10th December 1996 the Secretariat sent letters to the Complainants informing them of the\u000adecisions of the Commission.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a42. On 10th December 1996 the Secretariat sent a Note Verbale to the government informing it of the\u000adecisions of the Commission.\u000a43. On 29th April, the Secretariat received a letter from Mr Olisa Agbakoba entitled 'Preliminary objections\u000aand observations to the Mission of the Commission which visited Nigeria from March 7th-14th 1997. The\u000adocument was submitted on behalf of INTERIGTS with regard to 14 communications, including this one.\u000a44. Among the objections raised and or observations made were: a) "the neutrality, credibility and\u000arelevance; and composition of the mission".\u000a45. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the Merits to the\u000anext session, pending the submission of scholarly article and court decisions by the complainants to assist\u000ait in its decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria. It must\u000abe stated that Mr Chidi Odinkalu did send the article mentioned above.\u000a46. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\u000ainformed on May 28th.\u000a47. Communication 154/96 is dated 6th November 1995 and received at the Secretariat on 4th March 1996.\u000a48. The communication requested the Commission to take interim measures to prevent the executions. A\u000asupplementary submission was sent with the communication informing the Commission that the executions\u000ahad taken place on 10th November but that the communication was reaffirmed.\u000a49. On 13th November 1995 the Nigerian Government wrote to the Commission informing it of the\u000aGovernment's view of the situation.\u000a50. On 20th November 1995 the High Commission of Nigeria in The Gambia giving its opinion on the\u000amatter.\u000a51. On 21st November 1995 the Commission wrote to the High Commission of Nigeria in The Gambia\u000arequesting a copy of the Justice's judgement in the case.\u000a52. On 12th March 1996 a confirmation was sent to this effect by the Complainant.\u000a53. At the 19th Session in March 1996 the communication was not considered, but the Commission took a\u000ageneral view of all the communications against Nigeria and deferred any decision on cases pending the\u000aaccomplishment of its proposed mission to Nigeria.\u000a54. On 13th August 1996 a complete copy of the communication was sent to the government of Nigeria.\u000a55. On 13th August 1996 a letter was sent to the Complainant informing him of the status of the case.\u000a56. On 4th February 1997, the Secretariat received a letter entitled supplementary submissions with respect\u000ato communication No. 154/96.\u000a57. On 4th April, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the letter.\u000a58. On 29th April, the Secretariat received a letter from Mr Olisa Agbakoba entitled 'Preliminary objections\u000aand observations' to the Mission of the Commission which visited Nigeria from March 7th-14th 1997. The\u000adocument was submitted on behalf of INTERIGHTS with regard to 14 communications, including this one.\u000a59. Among the objections raised and or observations made were: a) the neutrality, credibility and\u000arelevance; and composition of the mission".\u000a60. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the merits to the\u000anext session, pending the submission of scholarly articles and court case by the Complainants to assist it in\u000aits decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria.\u000a61. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\u000ainformed on May 28th.\u000a62. On May 27th, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant entitled 'Additional Information on\u000aOuster Clauses in Nigerian Law' in which he promised to furnish the Secretariat with the information\u000arequested by the Commission at its 21st Session "within the next three weeks".\u000a63. From this day on the procedure is identical to communications 137/94 and 139/94.\u000a64. Communication 161/97 was received on 10th January 1997.\u000a65. On 14th January 1997 a Note Verbale with a copy of the communication was sent to the Ministry of\u000aExternal Affairs, copy to the Special Legal Adviser to the Head of State, the Nigerian High Commission,\u000aand the Embassy of Nigeria in Addis Ababa.\u000a66. On 23rd January 1997 an acknowledgement of receipt was sent to the Complainant.\u000a67. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the merits to the\u000anext session, pending the submission of scholarly articles and court case by the Complainants to assist it in\u000aits decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria.\u000a68. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\u000ainformed on May 28th.\u000a4\u000a\u000a69. At the 22nd Ordinary Session, the Commission postponed taking a decision on the cases pending the\u000adiscussion of the Nigerian Mission report.\u000a70. At the 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul The Gambia, from 20th-29th April 1998, the Commission was\u000aunable to consider the communication due to lack of time.\u000a71. On 25th June 1998, letters were sent from the Secretariat of the Commission to all parties concerned\u000aregarding the status of the communications.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a72. Article 56 of the African Charter reads:\u000aCommunications...shall be considered if they: ...5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it\u000ais obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\u000a73. This is just one of the 7 conditions specified by Article 56, but it is that which usually requires the most\u000aattention. Because Article 56 is necessarily the first considered by the Commission, before any substantive\u000aconsideration of communications, it has already been the subject of substantial interpretation; in the\u000ajurisprudence of the African Commission, there are several important precedents.\u000a74. Specifically, in the four decisions the Commission has already taken concerning Nigeria, Article 56(5) is\u000aanalysed in terms of the Nigerian context. Communication 60/91 (Decision ACHPR/60/91) concerned the\u000aRobbery and Firearms Tribunal; Communication 87/93 (Decision ACHPR/87/93) concerned the Civil\u000aDisturbances Tribunal; Communication 101/93 (Decision ACHPR/101/93) concerned the Legal\u000aPractitioners Decree; and Communication 129/94 (ACHPR/129/94) concerned the Constitution\u000a(Modification and Suspension) Decree and the Political Parties (Dissolution) Decree.\u000a75. All of the Decrees in question in the above communications contain "ouster" clauses. In the case of the\u000aspecial tribunals, these clauses prevent the ordinary courts from taking up cases placed before the special\u000atribunals or from entertaining any appeals from the decisions of the special tribunals. ( ACHPR/60/91:13\u000aand ACHPR/87/93:13). The Legal Practitioners Decree specifies that it cannot not be challenged in the\u000acourts and that anyone attempting to do so commits a crime ( ACHPR/129/94:14 and ACHPR/129/94:15 ).\u000aThe Constitution Suspension and Modification legally prohibited their challenge in the Nigerian Courts (\u000aACHPR/129/94:14 and ACHPR/129/94:15).\u000a76. In all of the cases cited above, the Commission found that the ouster clauses render local remedies\u000anon-existent, ineffective or illusory. They create a legal situation in which the judiciary can provide no check\u000aon the executive branch of government. A few courts in the Lagos district have occasionally found that they\u000ahave jurisdiction; in 1995 the Court of Appeal in Lagos, relying on common law, found that courts should\u000aexamine some decrees notwithstanding ouster clauses, where the decree is "offensive and utterly hostile to\u000arationality" (Reprinted in the Constitutional Rights Journal). It remains to be seen whether any Nigerian\u000acourts will be courageous enough to follow this holding, and whether the government will abide by their\u000arulings should they do so.\u000a77. In the present case, while the above reasoning was used in the initial decisions on admissibility, it is at\u000athe present time unnecessary. In light of the fact that the subjects of the communications are now\u000adeceased, it is evident that no domestic remedy can now give the complainants the satisfaction they seek.\u000aThe communications are thus admissible.\u000aMerits\u000a78. Article 5 of the Charter reads:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the\u000arecognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man particularly slavery, slave\u000atrade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment shall be prohibited.\u000a79. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not\u000aonly actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or\u000aforce him or her to act against his will or conscience.\u000a5\u000a\u000a80. International PEN alleges that Ken Saro-Wiwa was kept in leg irons and handcuffs and subjected to\u000aill-treatment including beatings and being held in cells which were airless and dirty, then denied medical\u000aattention, during the first days of his arrest. There was no evidence of any violent action on his part or\u000aescape attempts that would justify holding him in irons. Communication 154/96 alleges that all the victims\u000awere manacled in their cells, beaten and chained to the walls in their cells.\u000a81. The government has made no written submission in these cases, and has not refuted these allegations\u000ain its oral presentation. It is well-established jurisprudence of the Commission that where allegations go\u000aentirely unchallenged, it will proceed to decide on the facts presented (See, e.g., the Commission's\u000adecisions in communications 59/91, 60/91, 64/92, 68/92, 78/92, 87/93 and 101/93). Thus, the\u000aCommission holds a violation of Article 5 of the Charter.\u000a82. Article 6 of the African Charter reads:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to liberty and to the security of his person. No one may be deprived of\u000ahis freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by law. In particular, no one may be\u000aarbitrarily arrested or detained.\u000a83. All the victims were arrested and kept in detention for a lengthy period under the State Security\u000a(Detention of Persons) Act of 1984 and State Security (Detention of Persons ) Amended Decree No. 14\u000a(1994), that stipulates that the government can detain people without charge for as long as three months in\u000athe first instance. The decree also states that the courts cannot question any such detention or in any other\u000away intervene on behalf of the detainees. This decree allows the government to arbitrarily hold people\u000acritical of the government for up to 3 months without having to explain themselves and without any\u000aopportunity for the complainant to challenge the arrest and detention before a court of law. The decree\u000atherefore prima facie violates the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained protected in Article 6.\u000a84. The government has made no defence of this decree, either for its general validity or its justice as\u000aapplied in this case. Thus, the Commission holds a violation of Article 6.\u000a85. Article 7 of the African Charter reads:\u000a1. Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\u000athe right to appeal to competent national organs against acts of violating his fundamental rights;\u000athe right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\u000athe right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\u000athe right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\u000a86. As regards the conduct of the trial itself, it is unnecessary for the Commission to delve into the specific\u000acircumstances, because by the Commission's own precedent the tribunal was defective. As will be recalled,\u000ain its decision on Communication 87/93, the Commission considered that special tribunals established\u000aunder the Civil Disturbances Act violate Article 7(1)(d) of the African Charter, because their composition is\u000aat the discretion of the executive branch. Removing cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and\u000aplacing them before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality, which\u000ais required by the African Charter. This violation of the impartiality of tribunals occurs in principle,\u000aregardless of the qualifications of the individuals chosen for a particular tribunal.\u000a87. The Note Verbale of the Nigerian High Commissioner in The Gambia points out that the tribunal was\u000anot a military one, but was presided over by a judge of the Nigerian Court of Appeal, and that tribunals are\u000aproperly constituted in the Nigerian judicial system to deal with specific issues and for speedier\u000adispensation of justice. The Note Verbale makes other specific points on the conduct of the trial, arguing for\u000aits fairness: the placement of evidence, its conduct in public, and the fact that some of the defendants were\u000aultimately acquitted.\u000a88. In its oral presentation at the 19th Session, the government argued that the confirmation of sentence\u000agiven by the state governors is an adequate appeal.\u000a89. The Commission might cite opposing facts, casting doubt upon the fairness of the tribunal. For\u000aexample, The Head of State personally chose its members consisting of three instead of the five persons\u000arequired by the Civil Disturbances Act. When defence counsel wrote to the Chief Judge of the Federal High\u000aCourt on 27th November 1994 for information on when the trial would begin, the judge responded, "This\u000aCourt has nothing to do about the Tribunal. It is the responsibility of the Presidency".\u000a90. There is a great deal of information available from Nigerian and international sources on the day-to-day\u000aconduct of the tribunal and the significance of its legal rulings. Yet in reaching its decision, the Commission\u000aneed only rely upon its earlier holding, made in less politically charged circumstances, that the special\u000a6\u000a\u000atribunals established under the Civil Disturbances Act are in violation of the African Charter. As a result, it\u000afinds that Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants were denied the right to a fair trial, in violation of Article\u000a7(1)(d).\u000a91. Section 7 of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunals) Decree No. 2 of 1987 decides that the confirming\u000aauthority of judgments given under the act is the PRC, that is the ruling council of the Federal Military\u000agovernment, the members of which are exclusively members of the armed forces.\u000a92. Section 8(1) of the same Decree stipulates:\u000aThe validity of any decision, sentence, judgement, confirmation, direction, notice or order given or made, as\u000athe case may be, or any other thing whatsoever done under this Act shall not be inquired into by any court\u000aof law.\u000a93. In this case, it is not safe to view the Provisional Ruling Council as impartial or independent. Section\u000a8(1) effectively ousts all possibility of appeal to the ordinary courts. Thus, the accused persons had no\u000apossibility of appeal to a competent national organ, and the Commission finds a violation of Article 7(1)(a).\u000a94. Article 26 of the African Charter reads:\u000aStates parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts... .\u000a95. As stated above, the Special Tribunal and the Provisional Ruling Council are not independent. The\u000aCommission also finds that there is a violation of Article 26 of the African Charter.\u000a96. The government has not contradicted the allegations contained in communication 154/96 that at the\u000aconviction in October 1995 the Tribunal itself admitted that there was no direct evidence linking the\u000aaccused to the act of the murders, but held that they had each failed to establish that they did not commit\u000athe crime alleged. Communication 154/96 has also affirmed that prior to and during the trial, leading\u000arepresentatives of the government pronounced MOSOP and the accused guilty of the crimes at various\u000apress conferences and before the United Nations. As the allegations have not been contradicted, the\u000aCommission find a violation of the right to be presumed innocent, Article 7(1)(b)\u000a97. Initially, the accused were defended by a team of lawyers of their own choice. According to\u000aCommunication 154/96 and Communication 139/94, this team withdrew from the case because of\u000aharassment, both in the conduct of the trial and in their professional and private lives outside.\u000aCommunication 154/96 alleges that two of the lawyers were seriously assaulted by soldiers claiming to be\u000aacting on the instruction of the military officer responsible for the trial. On three occasions defence lawyers\u000awere arrested and detained and two of the lawyers had their offices searched. When these lawyers\u000awithdrew from the case, the harassment subsided.\u000a98. After the withdrawal of their chosen counsel, the accused were defended by a team assigned by the\u000aTribunal. However, this team also resigned, complaining of harassment. After that, the accused declined to\u000aaccept a new team appointed by the Tribunal, and the court proceedings were closed without the accused\u000ahaving legal representation for the duration.\u000a99. Communication 154/96 also claims that the defence was denied access to the evidence on which the\u000aprosecution was based and that files and documents which were required by the accused for their defence\u000awere removed from their residences and offices when they were searched by security forces on different\u000aoccasions during the trial.\u000a100. The government claims that: "Their [the accused] defence team which comprised sly human rights\u000aactivists such as Femi Falana and Gani Fawehinmi, known to be more disposed towards melodrama than\u000athe actual defence of their clients, inexplicably withdrew from the Special Tribunal at a crucial stage of the\u000atrial in order to either play to the gallery or delay and frustrate the process".\u000a101. This statement does not contradict the allegations of Communication 154/96, that two different\u000adefence teams were harassed into quitting the defence of the accused persons; it merely attributed\u000amalicious motives to the defence. The government has not responded to the allegations of withholding\u000aevidence from the defence. The Commission therefore finds itself with no alternative but to conclude that a\u000aviolation of Article 7(1)(c) has occurred.\u000a102. Article 4 of the African Charter reads:\u000aHuman beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the integrity of\u000ahis person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right.\u000a103. Given that the trial which ordered the executions itself violates Article 7, any subsequent\u000aimplementation of sentences renders the resulting deprivation of life arbitrary and in violation of Article 4.\u000a7\u000a\u000aThe violation is compounded by the fact that there were pending communications before the African\u000aCommission at the time of the executions, and the Commission had requested the government to avoid\u000acausing any "irreparable prejudice" to the subjects of the communications before the Commission had\u000aconcluded it consideration. Executions had been stayed in Nigeria in the past on the invocation by the\u000aCommission of its rule on provisional measures (Rule 109 now Rule 111) and the Commission had hoped\u000athat a similar situation will obtain in the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others. It is a matter of deep regret that\u000athis did not happen.\u000a104. The protection of the right to life in Article 4 also includes a duty for the state not to purposefully let a\u000aperson die while in its custody. Here at least one of the victims' lives was seriously endangered by the\u000adenial of medication during detention. Thus, there are multiple violations of Article 4.\u000a105. Article 11 of the African Charter provides:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others...\u000a106. Communication 154/96 alleges that Article 11 was violated because the murder trial directly followed\u000apublic meetings of MOSOP. In its judgement, the Tribunal held that the condemned persons "created the\u000afire that consumed the four Ogoni chiefs" by wrongfully organising election campaign rallies and permitting\u000aa large crowd of fanatical MOSOP and NYCOP youths to congregate. It appears that the Tribunal holds the\u000aaccused responsible for the murders because they organised the rally after which the murders took place,\u000aalthough Ken Saro-Wiwa for one was prevented by government officials from attending the rally. The\u000aCommission has considerable difficulty with this position as it can adversely affect the right to assembly.\u000a107. Article 10(1) of the African Charter reads:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to free association provided that he abides by the law.\u000a108. Communication 154/96 alleges that Article 10(1) was violated because the victims were tried and\u000aconvicted for their opinions, as expressed through their work in MOSOP. In its judgement, the Tribunal held\u000athat by their membership in MOSOP, the condemned persons were responsible for the murders, guilt by\u000aassociation, it would seem furthermore that, government officials at different times during the trial declared\u000aMOSOP and the accused guilty of the charges, without waiting for the official judgement. This\u000ademonstrates a clear prejudice against the organisation MOSOP, which the government has done nothing\u000ato defend or justify. Therefore the Commission finds a violation of Article 10(1).\u000a109. Article 9(2) of the African Charter reads:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law.\u000a110. There is a close relationship between the rights expressed in the Articles 9(2), 10(1) and 11.\u000aCommunication 154 alleges that the actual reason for the trial and the ultimate death sentences was the\u000apeaceful expression of views by the accused persons. The victims were disseminating information and\u000aopinions on the rights of the people who live in the oil producing area of Ogoniland, through MOSOP and\u000aspecifically a rally. These allegations have not been contradicted by the government, which has already\u000abeen shown to be highly prejudiced against MOSOP, without giving concrete justifications. MOSOP was\u000afounded specifically for the expression of views of the people who live in the oil producing areas, and the\u000arally was organised with this in view. The Government's actions is inconsistent with Article 9(2) implicit\u000awhen it violated Articles 10(1) and 11.\u000a111. Article 16 of the Charter reads:\u000a1. Every individual shall have the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health.\u000a2. States parties to the present Charter shall take the necessary measures to protect the health of their\u000apeople and to ensure that they receive medical attention when they are sick.\u000a112. The responsibility of the government is heightened in cases where an individual is in its custody and\u000atherefore someone whose integrity and well-being is completely dependent on the actions of the\u000aauthorities. The State has a direct responsibility in this case. Despite requests for hospital treatment made\u000aby a qualified prison doctor, these were denied to Ken Saro-Wiwa, causing his health to suffer to the point\u000awhere his life was endangered. The government has not denied this allegation in any way. This is a\u000aviolation of Article16.\u000a113. Nigeria has been a State Party to the African Charter for over a decade, and is thus bound by Article 1\u000aof the African Charter.\u000a8\u000a\u000a114. The Commission assists States parties to implement their obligations under the Charter. Rule 111 of\u000athe Commission's Rules of Procedure (revised) aims at preventing irreparable damage being caused to a\u000acomplainant before the Commission. Execution in the face of the invocation of Rule 111 defeats the\u000apurpose of this important rule. The Commission had hoped that the Government of Nigeria would respond\u000apositively to its request for a stay of execution pending the former's determination of the communication\u000abefore it.\u000a115. This is a blot on the legal system of Nigeria that will not be easy to erase. To have carried out the\u000aexecution in the face of pleas to the contrary by the Commission and world opinion is something that we\u000apray will never happen again. That it is a violation of the Charter is an understatement.\u000a116. The Nigerian Government itself recognises that human rights are no longer solely a matter of domestic\u000aconcern. The African Charter was drafted and acceded to voluntarily by African States wishing to ensure\u000athe respect of human rights on this continent. Once ratified, States Parties to the Charter are legally bound\u000ato its provisions. A state not wishing to abide by the African Charter might have refrained from ratification.\u000aOnce legally bound, however, a state must abide by the law in the same way an individual must.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor the above reasons, the Commission\u000a\u000aDecides that there has been a violation of Articles 5 and 16 in relation to Ken Saro-Wiwa's detention in\u000a1993 and his treatment in detention in 1994 and 1995;\u000aDecides that there has been a violation of Article 6 in relation to the detention of all the victims under the\u000aState Security (Detention of Persons) Act of 1984 and State Security (Detention of Persons) Amended\u000aDecree No. 14 (1994). The government therefore has the obligation to annul these Decrees;\u000aReiterates its decision on communication 87/93 that there has been a violation of Article 7(1)(d) and with\u000aregard to the establishment of the Civil Disturbances Tribunal. In ignoring this decision, Nigeria has\u000aviolation Article 1 of the Charter;\u000aDecides that there has been a violation of Article 4 and 7 (1) (a), (b)(c) and (d) in relation to the conduct of\u000athe trial and the execution of the victims;\u000aHolds that there has been a violation of Articles 9(2), 10(1) and 11, 26, 16;\u000a\u000aHolds that in ignoring its obligations to institute provisional measures, Nigeria has violated Article 1.\u000aBanjul, 31st October 1998.\u000a\u000a9\u000a\u000a

aV147/95-149/96 Sir Dawda K. Jawara / Gambia (The)\u000aSummary of Facts\u000aCommunication 147/95\u000a1. The Complainant is the former Head of State of the Republic of The Gambia. He alleges that after the\u000aMilitary coup of July 1994, that overthrew his government, there has been "blatant abuse of power by ... the\u000amilitary junta". The military government is alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation and\u000aarbitrary detention.\u000a2. The Complainant further alleges the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970 Gambian\u000aConstitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or question the\u000avalidity of any such decree.\u000a3. The communication alleges the banning of political parties and of ministers of the former civilian\u000agovernment from taking part in any political activity. The communication alleges restrictions on freedom of\u000aexpression, movement and religion. These restrictions were manifested, according to the complainant, by\u000athe arrest and detention of people without charge, kidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.\u000a4. He further alleges that two former Ministers of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC)\u000awere killed by the regime, asserting that the restoration of the death penalty through Decree No. 52 means,\u000a"the arsenal of the AFPRC is now complete".\u000a5. He also alleges that not less than fifty soldiers were killed in cold blood and buried in mass graves by the\u000amilitary government during what the Complainant terms "a staged-managed attempted coup". Several\u000amembers of the armed forces were allegedly detained (some for up to six months), without trial, following\u000athe introduction of Decree No. 3 of July 1994. This Decree gives the Minister of Interior the power to detain\u000aand to extend the period of detention ad infinitum. The Decree further prohibits the proceedings of habeas\u000acorpus on any detention issued under it.\u000a6. The Complainant alleges further that Decree No. 45 of June 1995, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA)\u000aDecree empowers the Minister of Interior or his designate to issue search warrants, authorise interference\u000awith correspondence, be it wireless or electronic.\u000a7. Finally, the communication alleges disregard for the judiciary and contempt of court following the\u000aregime's disregard of a court order; the imposition of retroactive legislation following the Economic Crimes\u000a(Specified Offences) Decree of 25th November 1994, thus infringing on the rule and the due process of law.\u000aCommunication 149/96\u000a8. Communication 149/96 alleges violation of the right to life, freedom from torture and the right to a fair\u000atrial. The Complainant alleges that not less than fifty soldiers have been summarily executed by the\u000aGambian military government and buried in mass graves following an alleged attempted coup on 11th\u000aNovember 1994.\u000a9. The Complainant attaches the names of thirteen of the fifty soldiers alleged to have been killed and\u000afurther alleges that a former Finance Minister, Mr Koro Ceesay was killed by the government. He attaches\u000aa document from a former member of the AFPRC, Captain Sadibu Hydara, to support this allegation.\u000a10. He went further to state that a former AFPRC member and former Interior Minister did not die from high\u000ablood pressure as claimed by the government but was tortured to death.\u000aThe Government's Response\u000a11. In its submission on the question of admissibility, the government raised the following objections:\u000a12. The first point raised is what the government called lack of 'proofs in support', claiming that a\u000acommunication should only be received by the Commission if the individual alleges, 'with proofs in support'\u000aa serious or massive case of violations of human and peoples' rights.\u000a13. The government asserts that the decrees complained of may on their face value be seen to be contrary\u000ato the provisions in the Charter, but claims that they must be "studied and placed in the context of the\u000achanged circumstances in The Gambia". Commenting on the freedom of liberty, the government claimed it\u000awas acting in conformity with laws previously laid down by domestic legislation. The government claims that\u000a1\u000a\u000athe decrees do not prohibit the enjoyment of freedoms; they are merely there to secure peace and stability,\u000aand only those who want to disrupt the peace will be arrested and detained.\u000a14. The submission further claims that since the take-over, not a single individual has been deliberately\u000akilled; and that during the counter - coup of 11th November 1994, soldiers of both sides lost their lives due\u000amainly to the fact that the rebels were fighting back with soldiers loyal to the government.\u000a15. The government also claims that Mr Koro Ceesay and Mr Sadibu Hydara alleged to have been killed by\u000athe government died from an accident and natural causes, respectively. Post-mortem reports on the two\u000adeaths are attached.\u000a16. The government further pointed out that the communication does not fulfil some of the conditions laid\u000adown in Article 56 of the Charter. Specifically, that the communications fails to meet the conditions set\u000adown in sub-article 4 and Article 56(5), which state that communications:\u000aArticle 56(4)...are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media;\u000aArticle 56(5)...are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is\u000aunduly prolonged.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a17. The Complainant alleges violation of the following Articles of the Charter: Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7(1)(d),\u000a7(2), 9(1), 9(2), 10(1), 11, 12(1), 12(2), 20(1) and 26.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a18. Communication 147/95 is dated 6th September 1995 and was received on 30th November 1995 at the\u000aSecretariat of the Commission.\u000a19. Communication 149/96 was received on 12th January 1996 at the Secretariat of the Commission.\u000a20. At the 19th Session in March 1996, the Commission decided to be seized of the communication and to\u000anotify the government accordingly, and stated that a decision on admissibility would be taken at the 20th\u000aSession in October 1996.\u000a21. At its 21st Session in April 1997, the Commission decided to renumber the communication as 147/95 to\u000areflect the length of time it has been with the Commission, it also decided to join the communication with\u000a149/96 and declare both of them admissible. The Commission also requested further information from both\u000asides and stated that a decision on the merits would be taken at its 22nd Session.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a22. Article 56 of the African Charter governs the admissibility of communications by the Commission. This\u000aarticle lays down seven conditions that, under normal circumstances must be fulfilled for a communication\u000ato be admissible. Have the seven, the government claims that two conditions have not been fulfilled;\u000anamely; Article 56(4) and 56(5).\u000a23. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that communications '... are not based exclusively on news\u000adisseminated through the mass media'.\u000a24. The government claims that the communication should be declared inadmissible because it is based\u000aexclusively on news disseminated through the mass media, and specifically made reference to the attached\u000aletter of Captain Ebou Jallow. While it would be dangerous to rely exclusively on news disseminated from\u000athe mass media, it would be equally damaging if the Commission were to reject a communication because\u000asome aspects of it are based on news disseminated through the mass media. This is borne out of the fact\u000athat the Charter makes use of the word "exclusively".\u000a25. There is no doubt that the media remains the most important, if not the only source of information. It is\u000acommon knowledge that information on human rights violations is always gotten from the media. The\u000agenocide in Rwanda, the human rights abuses in Burundi, Zaire, Congo, to name but a few, were revealed\u000aby the media.\u000a2\u000a\u000a26. The issue therefore should not be whether the information was gotten from the media, but whether the\u000ainformation is correct. Did the Complainant try to verify the truth about these allegations? Did he have the\u000ameans or was it possible for him to do so, given the circumstances of his case?\u000a27. The communication under consideration cannot be said to be based exclusively on news disseminated\u000athrough the mass media because the communication is not exclusively based on Captain Jallow's letter.\u000aThe Complainant alleges extra-judicial execution and has attached the names of some of those he alleges\u000ahave been killed. Captain Jallow's letter made no mention of this fact.\u000a28. Article 56(5) of the Charter states that communications '... are sent after exhausting local remedies, if\u000aany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged'.\u000a29. The government also claims that the author has not attempted to exhaust local remedies. The\u000agovernment claims that the author should have sent his complaint to the police who would in turn have\u000ainvestigated the allegations and prosecuted the offenders 'in a court of law'.\u000a30. This rule is one of the most important conditions for admissibility of communications, there is no doubt\u000atherefore, that in almost all the cases, the first requirement looked at by both the Commission and the state\u000aconcerned is the exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a31. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to\u000aensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the State concerned must have\u000ahad the opportunity to remedy the matter through its own local system. This prevents the Commission from\u000aacting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort.1 Three major criteria could be deduced\u000afrom the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must be available,\u000aeffective and sufficient.\u000a32. A remedy is considered available if the petitioner can pursue it without impediment, it is deemed\u000aeffective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found sufficient if it is capable of redressing the\u000acomplaint.\u000a33. The government's assertion of non-exhaustion of local remedies will therefore be looked at in this light.\u000aAs aforementioned, a remedy is considered available only if the applicant can make use of it in the\u000acircumstance of his case. The applicants in cases Nos. ACHPR/60/91, ACHPR/87/93, ACHPR/101/93\u000aand ACHPR/129/94 had their communications declared admissible by the Commission because the\u000acompetence of the ordinary courts had been ousted either by decrees or the establishment of special\u000atribunals.\u000a34. The Commission has stressed that, remedies, the availability of which is not evident, cannot be invoked\u000aby the State to the detriment of the complainant. Therefore, in a situation where the jurisdiction of the courts\u000ahave been ousted by decrees whose validity cannot be challenged or questioned, as is the position with the\u000acase under consideration, local remedies are deemed not only to be unavailable but also non- existent.\u000a35. The existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing\u000awhich, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the applicant cannot turn to the\u000ajudiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local\u000aremedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.\u000a36. The Complainant in this case had been overthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia, former\u000aMinisters and Members of Parliament of his government have been detained and there was terror and fear\u000afor lives in the country. It would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the Complainant to\u000areturn to his country to exhaust local remedies.\u000a37. There is no doubt that there was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the\u000aComplainant. This created an atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right\u000athinking people that returning to his country at that material moment, for whatever reason, would be risky to\u000ahis life. Under such circumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the\u000acomplainant.\u000a38. According to the established case law of the Commission, a remedy that has no prospect of success\u000adoes not constitute an effective remedy. The prospect of seizing the national courts, whose jurisdiction\u000ahave been ousted by decrees, in order to seek redress is nil. This fact is reinforced by the government's\u000aresponse of 8th March 1996, Note Verbale No. PA 203/232/01/(97-ADJ), in which it stated that 'The\u000aGambian Government...does not intend to spend valuable time responding to baseless and frivolous\u000aallegations by a deposed despot...'\u000a39. As to whether there were sufficient remedies, one can deduce from the above analysis that there were\u000ano remedies capable of redressing the complaints of the authors.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a40. Considering the fact that the regime at that material time controlled all the arms of government and had\u000alittle regard for the judiciary, as was demonstrated by its disregard of a court order in the T. K Motors' case,\u000aand considering further that the Court of Appeal of The Gambia in the case of Pa Salla Jagne v The State,\u000aruled that 'Now there are no human rights laws or goals and objective laws in the country', it would be\u000areversing the clock of justice to request the Complainant to attempt local remedies.\u000a41. It should also be noted that the government also claims that the communication lacks 'proofs in\u000asupport'. The position of the Commission has always been that a communication must establish a prima\u000afacie evidence of violation. It must specify the provisions of the Charter alleged to have been violated. The\u000astate also claims that the Commission is allowed under the Charter to take action only on cases that reveal\u000aa series of serious or massive violations of human rights.\u000a42. This is an erroneous proposition. Apart from Article 47 and Article 49 of the Charter, which empower the\u000aCommission to consider inter-state complaints, Article 55 of the Charter provides for the consideration of\u000a"communications other than those of States Parties". Further to this, Article 56 of the Charter stipulates the\u000aconditions for consideration of such communications (see also Chapter XVII[sic] of the Rules of Procedure\u000aentitled "Procedure for the Consideration of The Communications Received in Conformity with Article 55 of\u000athe Charter"). In any event, the practice of the Commission has been to consider communications even if\u000athey do not reveal a series of serious or massive violations. It is out of such useful exercise that the\u000aCommission has, over the years, been able to build up its case law and jurisprudence.\u000a43. The argument that the action of the government is in conformity with regulations previously laid down\u000aby law is unfounded: the Commission decided in its decision on communication 101/93, with respect to\u000afreedom of association, that, "competent authorities should not enact provisions which limit the exercise of\u000athis freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional provisions or undermine\u000afundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights standards". And more\u000aimportantly, the Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Freedom of Association had also reiterated\u000athat: "The regulation of the exercise of the right to freedom of association should be consistent with States'\u000aobligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights". It follows that any law, which is\u000apleaded for curtailing the enjoyment of any of the rights provided for in the Charter, must meet this\u000arequirement.\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the Commission declared the communications admissible.\u000aMerits\u000a44. The Complainant alleges that by suspending the Bill of Rights in the 1970 Gambian Constitution, the\u000agovernment violated Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter.\u000a45. Article 1 of the Charter provides that "The Member States ... parties to the present Charter shall\u000arecognise the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined in this Charter...", while Article 2 reads: "Every\u000aindividual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the\u000apresent Charter...".\u000a46. Article 1 gives the Charter the legally binding character always attributed to international treaties of this\u000asort. Therefore a violation of any provision of the Charter automatically means a violation of Article 1. If a\u000aState party to the Charter fails to recognise the provisions of the same, there is no doubt that it is in\u000aviolation of this Article. Its violation, therefore, goes to the root of the Charter.\u000a47. The Republic of the Gambia ratified the Charter on 6th June 1983. In its first periodic report to the\u000aCommission in 1992, the Gambian government asserted that "Most of the rights set out in the Charter have\u000abeen provided for in Chapter 3, Sections 13 to 30 of the 1970 Constitution...The Constitution predicts the\u000aGambian accession to the covenants, but in fact gave legal effect to some of the provisions of the Charter".\u000aThis therefore means that the Gambian government gave recognition to some of the provisions of the\u000aCharter (i.e. those contained in chapter 3 of its Constitution), and incorporated them into its domestic law.\u000a48. By suspending Chapter 3, (the Bill of Rights), the government therefore restricted the enjoyment of the\u000arights guaranteed therein, and, by implication, the rights enshrined in the Charter.\u000a49. It should however be stated that the suspension of the Bill of Rights does not ipso facto mean the\u000asuspension of the domestic effect of the Charter. In Communication 129/94, the Commission held that "the\u000aobligation of ... a government remains unaffected by the purported revocation of the domestic effect of the\u000a4\u000a\u000aCharter".\u000a50. The suspension of the Bill of Rights and consequently the application of the Charter was not only a\u000aviolation of Article 1 but also a restriction on the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the\u000aCharter, thus violating Article 2 of the Charter as well.\u000a51. Article 4 of the Charter states that "Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the\u000aintegrity of his person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right''.\u000a52. While the Complainant alleges that there have been extra-judicial killings, no concrete evidence was\u000aadduced to support this allegation. The military government has provided official post-mortem reports on\u000athe causes of the deaths of Messrs. Koro Ceesay and Sadibu Hydara. The government does not dispute\u000athe fact that soldiers died during the counter coup in November 1994, but claims, "soldiers of both sides lost\u000atheir lives due mainly to the fact that the rebels were fighting back with soldiers loyal to the government". It\u000aalso claims that since the take-over, not a single individual has been deliberately killed.\u000a53. It is not for the Commission to verify the authenticity of the post-mortem reports or the truth of the\u000agovernment's defence. The burden is on the Complainant to furnish the Commission with evidence of his\u000aallegations. In the absence of concrete proof, the Commission cannot hold the latter to be in violation of\u000aArticle 4 of the Charter.\u000a54. Article 5 of the Charter reads: "... All forms of ... torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\u000atreatment shall be prohibited".\u000a55. The Complainant alleges that the military perpetrated a reign of terror, intimidation and torture when it\u000aseized power. While there is evidence of intimidation, arrests and detentions, there is no independent\u000areport of torture.\u000a56. The Complainant further alleges that detention of persons incommunicado and preventing them from\u000aseeing their relatives constitutes torture. The State has refuted this claim and has challenged the\u000aComplainant to verify the truth from those who were detained. To date, the Commission has received no\u000aevidence from the complainant. In the absence of proof therefore, the Commission cannot hold the\u000agovernment to be in violation of Article 5. In this regard, the Commission is relying on its decision in\u000acommunication ACHPR/60/91: 27 [sic]* where it held that " without specific information as to the nature of\u000athe acts themselves, the Commission is thus unable to find a violation of Article 5".\u000a57. Article 6 of the Charter reads: "Every individual shall have the right to liberty and to the security of his\u000aperson. No one may be deprived of this freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by\u000alaw. In particular, no one may be arbitrarily arrested".\u000a58. The Military government has not refuted the allegations of arbitrary arrests and detentions, but has\u000adefended its position by stating that, its action must be "studied and placed in the context of the changed\u000acircumstances in The Gambia". It also claims that it is acting within the confines of legislation 'previously\u000alaid down by law', as required by the wordings of Article 6 of the Charter.\u000a59. The Commission in its decision on communication 101/93 laid down a general principle with respect to\u000afreedom of association that "competent authorities should not enact provisions which limit the exercise of\u000athis freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional provisions or undermine\u000afundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution or international human rights standards" . This principle\u000atherefore applies not only to freedom of association but also to all other rights and freedoms. For a State to\u000aavail itself of this plea, it must show that such a law is consistent with its obligations under the Charter. The\u000aCommission finds the arrests and incommunicado detention of the aforementioned persons inconsistent\u000awith Gambia's obligations under the Charter. They constitute arbitrary deprivation of their liberty and thus a\u000aviolation of Article 6 of the Charter. Decree No. 3 is, therefore, contrary to the spirit of Article 6.\u000a60. Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter reads: Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\u000acomprises:... the right to be tried within a reasonable period of time by an impartial court or tribunal.\u000a61. Given that the Minister of Interior could detain anyone without trial for up to six months, and could\u000aextend the period ad infinitum, his powers in this case, are analogous to that of a court, and with all intents\u000aand purposes, he is more likely to use his discretion at the detriment of the detainees, who are already in a\u000adisadvantaged position. The victims will be at the mercy of the Minister who, in this case, will render favour\u000arather than vindicating a right. This power granted to the Minister renders valueless the provision enshrined\u000ain Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter.\u000a62. Article 7(2) of the Charter reads:\u000aNo one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offence at\u000athe time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offence for which no provision was made at\u000a5\u000a\u000athe time it was committed.\u000a63. This provision is a general prohibition on retroactivity. It is to ensure that, citizens at all times are fully\u000aaware of the state of the law under which they are living. The Economic Crimes (Specified Offences)\u000aDecree of 25th November 1994, which was deemed to have come into force in July 1994, is therefore, a\u000aserious violation of this right.\u000a64. Article 9 of the Charter reads:\u000a1.\u000a2. Every individual shall have the right to receive information.\u000a3. Every individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinion within the law.\u000a65. The government did not provide any defence to the allegations of arrests, detentions, expulsions and\u000aintimidation of journalists, made by the Complainant. The intimidation and arrest or detention of journalists\u000afor articles published and questions asked deprives not only the journalists of their rights to freely express\u000aand disseminate their opinions, but also the public, of the right to information. This action is clearly a breach\u000aof the provisions of Article 9 of the Charter.\u000a66. The Complainant alleges that political parties have been banned, and that an Independent Member of\u000aParliament and his supporters were arrested for planning a peaceful demonstration. In addition, Ministers\u000aand Members of Parliament in the former regime have been banned from taking part in any political activity\u000aand some of them restricted from traveling out of the country; with a maximum sentence of three years for\u000aany default.\u000a67. The imposition of the ban on former Ministers and Members of Parliament is in contravention of their\u000arights to participate freely in the government of their country provided for under Article 13(1) of the Charter.\u000aArticle 13(1) reads: Every citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the government of his country,\u000aeither directly or through freely chosen representatives in accordance with the provisions of the law.\u000a68. Also, the banning of political parties is a violation of the Complainants' rights to freedom of association\u000aguaranteed under Article 10(1) of the Charter. In its decision on communication 101/93, the Commission\u000astated a general principle on this right, to the effect that "competent authorities should not enact provisions\u000awhich limit the exercise of this freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional\u000aprovisions or undermine fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights\u000astandards". And more importantly, the Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Freedom of Association\u000ahad also reiterated that: "The regulation of the exercise of the right to freedom of association should be\u000aconsistent with States' obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights". This principle\u000adoes not apply to freedom of association alone but to all other rights and freedoms enshrined in the\u000aCharter, including, the right to freedom of assembly. Article 10(1) provides:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to free association provided that he abides by the law.\u000a69. The Commission also finds the ban an encroachment on the right to freedom of assembly guaranteed\u000aby Article 11 of the Charter. Article 11 reads:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others\u000a70. The restrictions to travel placed on the former Ministers and Members of Parliament is also a violation\u000aof their right to freedom of movement and the right of ingress and egress provided for under Article 12 of\u000athe Charter. Article 12 provides: (1) Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and\u000aresidence within the borders of a state provided he abides by the law. (2) Every individual shall have the\u000aright to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. This right may only be subject to\u000arestrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or\u000amorality.\u000a71. Section 62 of the Gambian Constitution of 1970 provides for elections based on universal suffrage, and\u000aSection 85(4) made it mandatory for elections to be held within at most five years. Since independence in\u000a1965, The Gambia has always had a plurality of parties participating in elections. This was temporarily\u000ahalted in 1994 when the military seized power.\u000a72. The Complainant alleges that the right of Gambian people to self-determination has been violated. He\u000aclaims that the policy that the people freely choose to determine their political status, since independence\u000ahas been "hijacked" by the military. That the military has imposed itself on the people.\u000a6\u000a\u000a73. It is true that the military regime came to power by force, albeit, peacefully. This was not through the will\u000aof the people who have known only the ballot box since independence, as a means of choosing their\u000apolitical leaders. The military coup was therefore a grave violation of the right of Gambian people to freely\u000achoose their government as entrenched in Article 20(1) of the Charter. Article 20(1) provides:\u000aAll peoples shall ... freely determine their political status... according to the policy they have freely chosen. 2\u000a74. The rights and freedoms of individuals enshrined in the Charter can only be fully realised if\u000agovernments provide structures which enable them to seek redress if they are violated. By ousting the\u000acompetence of the ordinary courts to handle human rights cases, and ignoring court judgements, the\u000aGambian military government demonstrated clearly that the courts were not independent. This is a violation\u000aof Article 26 of the Charter. Article 26 of the Charter reads:\u000aStates Parties to the Charter shall have the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts...and shall\u000aallow the establishment and improvement of appropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion\u000aand protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the present Charter.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission\u000a\u000aFor the above reasons, the Commission\u000aHolds a violation of the following provisions of the Charter: Articles 1, 2, 6,7(1)(d), 7(2), 9(1), 9(2), 10(1),\u000a11, 12(1), 12(2), 20(1) and 26 of the Charter (for the period within which the violations occurred).\u000aRequests the Government of The Gambia to bring its laws in conformity with the provisions of the Charter.\u000a\u000aAlgiers, Algeria, 11th May 2000.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a* Editor's note: Decision 60/91 has only 14 paragraphs in English and in French.

aV212/98 Amnesty International / Zambia\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The communication is submitted by Amnesty International on behalf of William Steven Banda and John\u000aLyson Chinula.\u000a2. Complainant alleges that Zambia has violated the provisions of African Charter in that:\u000a3. Mr William Steven Banda was served with a deportation order on 10th November 1991. The reason given\u000awas that "in my opinion by his presence he (is) likely to be a danger to peace and good order in Zambia".\u000aHe contested the order through the courts of Zambia.\u000a4. On 25th October 1994, William Steven Banda was deported to Malawi unlawfully, wrongfully and out of\u000apolitical malice. He alleges that he was blindfolded and drugged, driven by Zambian immigration service\u000aand para-military police officers. He entered Malawi through Mchinji border post and later dumped at\u000aLilongwe Police station.\u000a5. John Luson Chinula was removed from his home in Ndola on 31st August 1994. He was driven to Lusaka\u000aInternational Airport with the intention of deporting him. He was served with a deportation order signed by\u000athe Minister of Home Affairs alleging that he was a threat to Zambia's peace and security. He was forcibly\u000asedated and later found himself at Lilongwe Police station in Malawi. His Warrant of Deportation also\u000aalleged that he was "by his presence, likely to be a danger to peace and good order in Zambia". No reason\u000ain law or in fact was advanced for this finding.\u000a6. Both Complainants were prominent political figures in Zambia. They were leading members of UNIP, the\u000aparty that had been in power since Independence in 1964. UNIP was defeated by MMD in the first\u000amulti-party elections of November 1991.\u000a7. William Steven Banda exhausted all domestic remedies in that, his matter went to the Supreme Court of\u000aZambia. John Lyson Chinula could not effect any remedies through the Zambian courts because he was\u000adeported and was given no opportunity to approach the Zambian courts.\u000a8. It is alleged by the Complainant that prior to his forcible expulsion from Zambia under order of\u000adeportation, William Banda exhausted local remedies through his appeal to the High Court of Zambia in\u000a1992 and the Supreme Court of Zambia in 1994.\u000a9. Complainant alleges that the Zambian government's deportation of the two men amounted to "forcible\u000aexile".\u000a10. Complainant alleges that attempts to seek redress through existing national legal remedies both in\u000aZambia and in Malawi have been futile.\u000a11. Complainant also charges that John Chinula was not allowed recourse to the national courts of Zambia.\u000aHe was prevented from returning to Zambia by threats of imprisonment by the Zambian authorities.\u000a12. Complainant states that Banda and Chinula have obtained two judgements at the High Court of Malawi\u000aconfirming that they were not citizens of Malawi. The government of Malawi has failed to comply with the\u000ajudgement of the Court which ordered that they be assured to return to Zambia. They have therefore\u000aexhausted all available local remedies at their disposal.\u000a13. Complainant prays that the Commission adopt Rule 111 interim measures to allow the deportees to\u000areturn to Zambia immediately.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a14. Complainant alleges that Articles 2, 5, 7(1)(a), 8, 9, 9(2), 10, 12(2), 13(1), 18(1), 18(2) of the African\u000aCharter have been violated.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a15. Communication is dated 6th March 1998 and was sent by mail.\u000a16. On 18th March 1998, a letter was sent to the Complainant acknowledging receipt.\u000a17. At its 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission decided to be seized of this\u000amatter and declared the communication admissible. The Commission also requested that provisional\u000ameasures be adopted by the Government of Zambia, namely to allow the burial of Mr John L. Chinula, in\u000aZambia and the return of Mr William S. Banda to his family in Zambia pending the finalisation of the matter\u000aby the Commission.\u000a18. On 10th July 1998, the Secretariat of the Commission wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zambia,\u000ainforming them of the decision of the 23rd Ordinary Session, drawing attention to the Rule 111 request for\u000aprovisional measures to be taken by the government of Zambia.\u000a19. A copy of the Note was also sent to the Embassy of Zambia in Addis Ababa. When there was no reply,\u000athe Secretariat sent a reminder on 17th September 1998. The Embassy replied on 21st September that the\u000aNote Verbale was received but did not enclose the communication referred to.\u000a20. The representative of the Government of Zambia appeared before the Commission on 26th and 27th of\u000aOctober 1998 at the 24th Ordinary Session. He presented a statement in response to the communication.\u000a21. At the 24th Ordinary Session, the Commission postponed consideration of this for a decision on the\u000amerits to the next session.\u000a22. On 26th November 1998, the Secretariat conveyed the decision of the Commission to the parties\u000aconcerned.\u000a23. In preparation for a hearing on this matter, the Rapporteur for this communication requested the parties\u000ato address only some of the critical matters he had identified. Mr Ahmed Motala represented Amnesty\u000aInternational. Mr Clifford Msika of the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, Lilongwe, Malawi,\u000aassisted him. Mr William Steven Banda was also present. The Zambian Government was represented by\u000aMr Palan Mulonda, Senior State Advocate in the Ministry of Legal Affairs accompanied by Mr K.K.\u000aNsemukila, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Home Affairs Department and Ms Lucy M. Mungoma of Foreign\u000aAffairs Department with responsibility for Africa and OAU relations. The Commission also heard testimony\u000afrom Mr William Steven Banda.\u000aArgument\u000a24. Mr Motala argued that Zambia was bound by the African Charter which it ratified in 1984. It, therefore,\u000awas obliged to extend the rights in the Charter to "every individual" except where political rights are\u000aspecifically indicated as in Article 13 for example. He argued that Zambia was in violation of Article 12\u000aespecially sub-article 2 which provides that "every individual" has a right to leave one's country and to\u000areturn. It also says that a "non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party may only be expelled\u000afrom it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law...". He alleged discrimination on the basis of\u000aethnic group and social origin (Article 2) and on the basis of political opinion. The treatment the\u000aComplainants received violated the victims' rights to human dignity and freedom of movement. In the case\u000aof Chinula, he was deprived of the right to have his cause heard (Article 7). He insisted that the actions\u000aagainst Complainants were politically motivated. They have been left in a strange country destitute.\u000a25. Mr Mulonda, for the government, stated that the government did not act with political malice. It acted\u000awithin the law. The investigations against Banda began in 1976 and against Chinula in 1974 long before the\u000apresent regime came into power. He denied that the deportees were drugged and dumped across the\u000aborder. He stated that the Malawi authorities received them. The government of Zambia was acting within\u000aits sovereign rights in ordering its internal affairs, regulating immigration and was within the provision or\u000alimitation of the right stipulated in Article 12: "This right may only be subject to restriction as provided for by\u000alaw for the protection of nation security, law and order, public health and morality".\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a26. Admissibility of communications under the African Charter is governed by Article 56, which sets out\u000aconditions that must be met before they are considered by the Commission.\u000a27. Article 56 of the Charter reads:\u000aCommunications ... shall be considered if they: ...(5) are sent after exhausting local remedies, if unless it is\u000aobvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged.\u000a28. This provision of the Charter is necessarily first considered before any substantive consideration of a\u000acomplaint.\u000a29. In the present case all local remedies have been exhausted and there is documentary evidence made\u000aavailable to the Secretariat of the Commission in support of this claim. As already stated in the case of\u000aChinula, the arbitrary deportation prevented him from exercising this right.\u000a30. The Complainant has attached to the communication copies of the following judgements/orders\u000aobtained by William Banda and John Chinula;\u000a31. Consent Order of 13th March 1995, High Court of Lilongwe, in Miscellaneous Cause No. 2 of 1995;\u000a32. Judgement of 30th June 1997, High Court of Malawi in Lilongwe, in Miscellaneous Cause No. 2 of 1995;\u000a33. Judgement No. 16 of 1994, Supreme Court of Zambia in Lusaka, in Banda vs. Chief Immigration Officer\u000aand Attorney General;\u000a34. Judgement No. JH/12 of 1991, High Court of Zambia in Chipata, in Banda vs Chief Immigration Officer\u000aand Attorney General.\u000aFor these reasons the Commission declares the communication admissible.\u000a\u000aMerits\u000a35. Zambia ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights in January 1984.\u000a36. A number of supporting documents were submitted: On Banda, the transcript of the Judgement by\u000aKakusa J in the High Court of Zambia held at Chipata; the judgement on appeal by Bweupe DCJ in the\u000aSupreme Court in Lusaka. The various decisions of the Malawi Court and affidavits submitted in support.\u000aThe Government also submitted documents on Banda and Chinula.\u000a37. Regarding William Steven Banda, the judgement of Justice Kakusa in the High Court is instructive. The\u000ajudge found that there was no evidence, on a balance of probabilities, to prove that Banda was born in\u000aZambia of Zambian parents. He found that Banda was an unreliable witness. He, however, refused to rule\u000aas to where Banda originated from. He dismissed all evidence that suggested that Banda was from Malawi,\u000aas inadmissible and hearsay. He also noted that the government had failed to produce the alleged\u000aMalawian father of Banda. The judge also made the following obiter dictum without justifying his opinion,\u000athat "once it is shown on a balance of probabilities that a petitioner is not a citizen of this Republic he\u000abecomes a deportable person even if the country to which he must proceed is unknown ... possession of a\u000aNational Registration Card ... does not confer citizenship..." (at p J25). It appears that the authorities relied\u000aon this statement in deporting William Steven Banda.\u000a38. The judge also expressed himself in sympathy with Banda's predicament. He said "the petitioner has\u000abeen in Zambia for a long time and has, in his own way, contributed in the political arena ... Zambia has\u000abecome almost the petitioner's only home - a de facto situation - upon which the executive may exercise its\u000adiscretion and, maybe, consider normalising the status of petitioner should he apply... If this court were\u000aempowered to declare persons like petitioner be Zambians, the petitioner would have received a favourable\u000adeclaration considering his long stay in Zambia and the role he played" (J25).\u000a39. It is not denied that on the day of the judgement, William Steven Banda was taken into custody and\u000adeported to Malawi. In addition, Banda charges that his pleas that he be taken to South Africa were ignored\u000aincluding his request for a five-days stay of execution of the warrant.\u000a40. It is evident that the Malawi Courts are irrelevant for purposes of deciding this matter against Zambia.\u000aThe fact that they declared Complainants not to be Malawi citizens is neither here nor there. Secondly, the\u000aCommission is not competent to substitute the judgements of the Zambian courts, especially on matters of\u000afact. It must be accepted that the legal processes were appropriate and conducted in a manner that\u000a3\u000a\u000ashowed respect for the rule of law. The legal processes in Zambia did not violate the principles of the\u000aCharter. The Commission must, therefore, accept that William Steven Banda was not a Zambian by birth or\u000adescent.\u000a41. This does not mean, however, that the Commission should not raise questions of law especially as the\u000aZambian courts did not consider the obligations of Zambia under the African Charter. The court also failed\u000ato rule on the alleged reason for the deportation, namely, that his presence was likely "to endanger peace\u000aand good order in Zambia...". There was no judicial inquiry on the basis in law and in terms of\u000aadministrative justice for relying on this "opinion" of the Minister of Home Affairs for the action taken. The\u000afact that Banda was not a Zambian by itself, does not justify his deportation. It must be proved that his\u000apresence in Zambia was in violation of the laws. To the extent that neither Banda nor Chinula were\u000asupplied with reasons for the action taken against them means that the right to receive information was\u000adenied to them (Article 9(1)).\u000a42. The Rapporteur invited the parties to give guidance on the authority of the Charter where it was in\u000acontradiction to domestic law. That seems relevant because Zambia ratified the Charter by Executive Act.\u000aThat means that there is legislative process that domesticates international human rights treaties. Mr\u000aMulonda affirmed Zambia's commitment to abide by the treaties it is party to. He also confirmed that\u000aZambia operated a dual legal system and that the Charter is not considered to be a self executing\u000ameasure. Nonetheless, Zambia accepted the binding character of the Charter in Zambia.\u000a43. By all accounts, though, Banda was in possession of Zambian national registration certificate and a\u000apassport. For many years he freely used these without challenge. Immediately following the verdict of the\u000aSupreme Court, he voluntarily presented himself to the police but he was forcibly deported. This meant that\u000ahe was denied the opportunity to pursue the option of applying for citizenship by naturalisation in terms of\u000athe Citizenship Act. Granted, the government argues that Banda had obtained the documents of\u000aregistration and Passport by making false claims about his place of birth. He could not therefore, be\u000aapproaching the court with clean hands. The unstated implication being that the chances of his obtaining\u000anaturalisation were negligible. In truth, of course, the Court did not say that Banda was an illegal immigrant.\u000aIt simply disputed his claims to being Zambian by birth. It was not proved, therefore, that Banda was in\u000aZambia illegally. It was not proved, therefore, that Banda was in Zambia illegally.\u000a44. Zambia has contravened Article 7 of the Charter in that he was not allowed to pursue the administrative\u000ameasures, which were opened to him in terms of the Citizenship Act. More importantly, Zambia is in breach\u000aof Article 7(2) which says that "no one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a\u000alegally punishable offence at the time it was committed..." By all accounts, Banda's residence and status in\u000aZambia had been accepted. He had made a contribution to the politics of the country. The provisions of\u000aArticle 12(4) have been violated.\u000a45. The allegations of violations of Articles 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 may now be addressed. The evidence that\u000aWilliam Steven Banda was a political opponent of the ruling MMD cannot be lost sight of. The manner in\u000awhich he was treated was demeaning of the dignity and status of somebody of his standing in society. It\u000aappears that he was singled out for action because of his ethnic origin, which incidentally, is also found in\u000aZambia. The authorities insisted on deporting him to Malawi even though, he told them that he knew\u000anobody there. There was no compelling evidence that he had roots in Malawi having lived in Zambia, by\u000atheir own admission, since about 1964. Counsel for Zambia argued that Banda was "accepted" by the\u000aMalawi immigration authorities. Whatever may have been the "legal" basis for such "acceptance", Malawi\u000acourts have ruled that they were not citizens of Malawi. In addition, unlawful deportation could not be said\u000ato obliterate their rights in Zambia.\u000a46. John Lyson Chinula was in an even worse predicament. He was not given any opportunity to contest\u000athe deportation order. Surely, government cannot say that Chinula had gone underground in 1974 having\u000aoverstayed his visiting permit. Chinula, by all account, was a prominent businessman and politician. If\u000agovernment wished to act against him they could have done so. That they did not, does not justify the\u000aarbitrary nature of the arrest and deportation on 31st August 1994. He was entitled to have his case heard\u000ain the Courts of Zambia. Zambia has violated Article 7 of the Charter. Having made that finding, the findings\u000ain para. 30 above also obtain in this circumstance.\u000a47. The Commission had requested provisional measures in terms of Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure.\u000aZambia must be required to allow the return of William Steven Banda with a view to making application for\u000acitizenship by naturalisation. No evidence was led before the Commission for compensation. The evidence\u000ais that Banda had lost his job as governor after the 1991 elections. No award for compensation is called for.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000a48. John Lyson Chinula died in Malawi. He was a prominent businessman. His deportation must have\u000acaused prejudice to his business interests. His family is requesting the return of his body for burial in\u000aZambia. The Government of Zambia should be required to grant that wish.\u000a49. The Government of Zambia has relied on the "claw-back" clause of Article 12(2):\u000aThis right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law\u000aor order, public health or morality...\u000a50. The deportation order also stated that the deportees were considered " a danger to peace and good\u000aorder to Zambia". The Commission is of the view that the "claw-back" clauses must not be interpreted\u000aagainst the principles of the Charter. Recourse to these should not be used as a means of giving credence\u000ato violations of the express provisions of the Charter. Secondly, the rules of natural justice must apply.\u000aAmong these are in the audi alterm partem rule, the right to be heard, the right of access to the Court. The\u000aCourt in Zambia, in Banda's case failed to examine the basis of administrative action and as such, it has\u000anot been proved that the deportees were indeed a danger to law and order. In any event the suggestion\u000athat they were "likely" to be a danger was vague and not proved. It is important for the Commission to\u000acaution against a too easy resort to the limitation clauses in the African Charter. The onus is on the state to\u000aprove that it is justified to resort to the limitation clause. The Commission should act bearing in mind the\u000aprovisions of Articles 61 and 62 of the Charter.\u000a51. Article 2 of the Charter reads:\u000aEvery individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in\u000athe present Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, colour, sex, language,\u000areligion political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.\u000a52. By forcibly expelling the two victims from Zambia, the State has violated their right to enjoyment of all\u000athe rights enshrined in the African Charter. This article imposes an obligation on the Zambian Government\u000ato secure the rights protected in the African Charter to all persons within their jurisdiction irrespective of\u000apolitical or any other opinion. This obligation was reaffirmed by the Commission in Rencontre africaine pour\u000ala défense des droits de l'Homme / Zambia (Communication 71/92). The arbitrary removal of one's\u000acitizenship in the case of Chinula cannot be justified.\u000a53. Article 9(2) states:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law.\u000a54. Both Banda and Chinula were leading politicians and businessmen. Both had lived in Zambia for\u000adecades. Even if deportation action had been initiated against them in 1974 and 1976, it can be safely\u000aassumed that the action had been advanced unless it is proved that that was due to unlawfulness, fraud or\u000aobstruction of the course of justice. None of this was alleged. Action was accelerated upon the assumption\u000aof office of MMD government in 1991, we are therefore persuaded that the deportations were politically\u000amotivated. This provision of the Charter reflects the fact that freedom of expression is a fundamental\u000ahuman right, essential to an individual personal development, political consciousness and participation in\u000athe public affairs of his country. The Commission has to determine whether the "deportations", being\u000apolitically, motivated violate the provisions of Article 9(2) of the African Charter as the two victims were\u000adenied the right to freedom of conscience as stipulated in Article 8 of the Charter.\u000a55. Article 8 of the African Charter states:\u000aFreedom of conscience, the profession and free practice of religion shall be guaranteed.\u000aNo one may, subject to law and order, be submitted to measures restricting the exercise of these freedoms.\u000a56. Article 10 of the Charter, which states:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to the free association provided that he abides by the law.\u000a57. In deporting the two men, the government of Zambia has denied them the exercise of their right to\u000afreedom of association. This is so since they have been prevented from associating with their colleagues in\u000athe United National Independence Party and participating in their activities.\u000a58. As the African Commission ruled in the case of John K. Modise/ Botswana, by forcing Banda and\u000aChinula to live as stateless persons under degrading conditions, the government of Zambia has deprived\u000athem of their family and is depriving their families of the men's support, and this constitutes a violation of\u000athe dignity of a human being. Thereby violating Article 5 of the Charter, which guarantees the right to:\u000a5\u000a\u000athe respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status.\u000a59. The forcible expulsion of Banda and Chinula by the Zambian government has forcibly broken up the\u000afamily unit which is the core of society thereby failing in its duties to protect and assist the family as\u000astipulated in Articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Charter:\u000a"The family shall be the natural unit and basic of society. It shall be protected by the State..." "The State\u000ashall have the duty to assist the family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values recognised by\u000athe community."\u000a60. Article 7(1)(a) states that:\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to have his cause heard... ...(a) "the right to an appeal to competent\u000anational organs against acts of violating his fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed ...\u000a61. The Zambia government by denying Mr Chinula the opportunity to appeal his deportation order has\u000adeprived him of a right to fair hearing which contravenes all Zambian domestic laws and international\u000ahuman rights laws.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the Commission\u000aHolds a violation of Articles 2, 7(1)(a), 8, 9(2), 10, 18(1) and 18(2) of the Charter.\u000aBujumbura, 5th May 1999.\u000a\u000a6\u000a\u000a

aV220/98 Law Offices of Ghazi Suleiman / Sudan\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. [The] Complainant is a Human Rights Law office in Sudan and is submitting the communication on\u000abehalf of all university students and teachers in Sudan.\u000a2. The complaint was sent by post and received at the Secretariat on 14th October 1998.\u000a3. [The] Complainant alleges that on 26th September the Minister of Education in Sudan announced that all\u000athe universities in Sudan would be closed for one month.\u000a4. It is alleged that the closure of universities is in order to assist the military mobilisation for the civil war in\u000aSouthern Sudan.\u000a5. The Complainant has included with the complaint, a sworn affidavit by a university lecturer in the\u000aKhartoum University to attest to these allegations.\u000a6. [The] Complainant notifies the [African] Commission that though an administrative appeal has been filed\u000aagainst the decision of the Minister of Education, he does not believe this will yield any realistic success.\u000a7. The Complainant urges the [African] Commission to adopt provisional measures under Rule 111 of its\u000aRules of Procedure which will request the government of Sudan to re-open the universities immediately and\u000aprevent further interference with university teaching.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a8. The Complainant alleges a violation of Articles 6, 7(c) and 17(1) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a9. At the 24th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 22nd to 31st October 1998, the [African]\u000aCommission decided to be seized of the communication.\u000a10. On 26th November 1990, the Secretariat informed the two parties of the [African] Commission's\u000adecision.\u000a11. On 3rd May 1999, during the 25th Ordinary Session of the [African] Commission in Bujumbura, Burundi,\u000aa representative of the government of Sudan submitted a written response to the [African] Commission\u000aconcerning the communication.\u000a12. At its 25th Ordinary Session held in Bujumbura, Burundi, the [African] Commission postponed\u000aconsideration of the communication to the next session.\u000a13. On 13th May 1999, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission wrote letters to all the parties notifying\u000athem of this decision.\u000a14. On 21st September 1999, the Complainant notified the Secretariat of the [African] Commission of a new\u000aaddress for all correspondences relating to the communication.\u000a15. During the 26th Ordinary Session, the [African] Commission received a written response, together with a\u000athree paged document in Arabic, from Dr Ahmed El Mufti, Rapporteur of the Advisory Council for Human\u000aRights, Ministry of Justice, Sudan concerning the communication. The attached document is said to be the\u000adecision of the Constitutional Division of the High Court.\u000a16. The [African] Commission considered the communication at its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali,\u000aRwanda and requested the Complainant to submit written observations on the outcome of the\u000aadministrative appeal filed against the decision of the Minister of Education, and generally, on the\u000aadministrative appeal processes in the Republic of Sudan.\u000a17. On 21st January 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission wrote to the parties informing them\u000aof the decision of the [African] Commission. It specifically requested the government of Sudan to furnish it\u000awith the translation of the decision of the Constitutional Division of the High Court in English or French.\u000a18. On 23rd February 2000, following an email from Dr Curtis Doebbler of the Complainant Firm requesting\u000athe Secretariat to furnish him on the progress of all communications filed, the Secretariat forwarded to him\u000athrough email the letter of 21st January 2000. It also requested him to indicate a fax number to enable it\u000asend observations received from the government of Sudan for his response.\u000a19. On 1st March 2000, the Secretariat received an email from Dr Curtis Doebbler indicating a fax number\u000afor the above documents to be sent. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the same and intimated to\u000a1\u000a\u000ahim the necessity of submitting the requested written responses on time.\u000a20. On 8th March 2000, the observation of the government of Sudan was faxed to the Complainant in the\u000aUS as requested.\u000a21. The Complainant repeated its request for information on the progress of all communications pending\u000abefore the [African] Commission on 9th and 16th March 2000.\u000a22. At last, the Secretariat received an e-mail from Dr Curtis Doebbler on 17th March 2000, acknowledging\u000areceipt of the e-mail indicating the facts of all the pending communications filed by the Complainant, and\u000aalso promising to furnish it with their responses no later than 24th March 2000.\u000a23. At the 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the [African] Commission heard oral submissions from\u000aparties and decided to consolidate all the cases. It requested to furnish it with written submissions on the\u000aissue of exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a24. On 30th June 2000, the above decisions were communicated to parties.\u000a25. On 4th September 2000, Dr Curtis Doebbler wrote from Cairo to the Secretariat of the [African]\u000aCommission requesting information on the decision taken by the [African] Commission at the 27th Session\u000ain Algiers.\u000a26. The Secretariat responded on 7th September 2000, informing him that same had earlier been faxed to\u000ahim and observing that there were at least three e-mail addresses given by him to the Secretariat for\u000acommunication purposes and proposing that he should indicate the most suitable e-mail address for future\u000acorrespondence in order to avoid delays and missing mails. The mails were dispatched to though all the\u000ae-mail addresses designated by him and also through fax.\u000a27. On 14th September 2000, Dr Curtis Doebbler acknowledged receipt of the mails but pleaded for an\u000aadjournment to enable him submit in advance a full brief on the issue of exhaustion of local remedies and\u000ato arrange for his witnesses.\u000a28. On 13th March 2001, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submission. At the 29th Ordinary\u000aSession, the [African] Commission will hear evidence on exhaustion of local remedies and will then decide\u000aon admissibility.\u000a29. At the 29th Ordinary session held in Tripoli, the Rapporteur introduced the communications and\u000areviewed the facts and the status of the case. The [African] Commission thereafter heard the parties to the\u000acase. Following detailed discussions, the [African] Commission noted that the Complainant had submitted a\u000adetailed brief on the case. It was therefore recommended that consideration of this communication be\u000adeferred to the 30th Session pending submission of detailed replies by the Respondent State.\u000a30. On 19th June 2001, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the above\u000adecision and requested the Respondent State to forward its written submissions within two (2) months from\u000athe date of notification of the decision.\u000a31. On 14th August 2001, a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within\u000athe prescribed time to enable the Secretariat proceed with the communication.\u000a32. During the 30th Session, the Rapporteurs introduced the communications and reviewed the facts and\u000athe status of each case. The [African] Commission thereafter heard the oral submission of the Respondent\u000aState to the case. Following detailed discussions, the [African] Commission noted that the Respondent\u000aState did not respond to the questions raised by the Complainant. The [African] Commission also heard\u000aoral submissions by Dr Curtis Doebbler and recommended that consideration of these communications be\u000adeferred to the 31st Session, pending detailed written submission by the Respondent State to the\u000asubmissions of the Complainant.\u000a33. On 15th November 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties on the decision\u000aof the [African] Commission and requested Respondent State to forward its written submissions within two\u000a(2) months from the date of notification of this decision.\u000a34. On 7th March 2002 [sic], a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within\u000athe prescribed time to enable the Secretariat to proceed with the communication.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a35. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides: "The communications stipulated in Article 55 received by\u000athe Commission relating to human and peoples' rights, must meet the following conditions in order to be\u000ainvestigated:\u000a2\u000a\u000a(5) Be subsequent to exhausting all local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that\u000athe procedure for such recourse is abnormally prolonged;"\u000a36. Concerning the question of exhausting local avenues of recourse, the Complainant informed the\u000a[African] Commission that no effective recourse was available and that, even if used, the Constitutional\u000aCourt is not qualified due to the state of emergency and the political limitations, which makes it impossible\u000ato legitimately complain to the court.\u000a37. He maintains that the grounds for a local remedy that could apply are rendered ineffective by the fact\u000athat the legal system in Sudan is neither free nor independent since the Sudanese courts have been\u000acontrolled by the executive since 1998 and that, given this situation, the executive could not rule on\u000aproceedings brought against the Sudanese government which are based on international humanitarian law,\u000aor even apply this law when it is clearly relevant.\u000a38. The Complainant alleges that, in practice, the procedures in place, which allow for compensation for\u000ahuman rights violations committed by the Government of Sudan, are often inaccessible to those individuals\u000awhose rights have been violated, due to the fact that current administrative and legal solutions are serious\u000aobstacles to their use. Consequently, complainants who ask that their rights be protected before Sudanese\u000acourts, come up against obstacles which make these avenues of redress ineffective.\u000a39. The Sudanese government alleges that the complainants did not use the remedies available to them in\u000athe local courts before applying to the [African] Commission. It insists that neither the lawyer lodging the\u000acomplaint, nor the complainants, filed an appeal against the decision; this is proved from the registers of\u000athe administrative courts.\u000a40. The government maintains that the Complainants, despite their insistence in previous correspondence,\u000adid not transmit to them the reference number of the appeal that had been filed which proves that no\u000aappeal was filed, contrary to the assertions of the Complainants who therefore did not exhaust all the local\u000aremedies as provided in Article 56 of the African Charter.\u000a41. It argues that the right of the Complainants to file an appeal against a decision of the court, is provided\u000afor in Article 20(1) of the Administrative and Constitutional Code of Justice of 1996 as amended in 2000,\u000aand documentation on decisions handed down in similar cases was submitted.\u000a42. Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that "a communication be introduced subsequent to\u000aexhaustion of local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that the procedure for\u000asuch recourse is abnormally prolonged". The complaint before the [African] Commission was received by\u000athe Secretariat on 14th[[/sup]] October 1998 and the decision to close the universities was taken on 26th September 1998, an interval of one\u000amonth between closure of the universities and receipt of the complaint.\u000a\u000a43. The [African] Commission is of the view that an interval of one month is a short time within which the\u000aComplainant could have accessed and exhausted all local remedies. Furthermore, the Complainant gives\u000ano indication of instituting proceedings before the domestic courts.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, and in accordance with Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the [African]\u000aCommission declares this communication inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a\u000aDone at the 31st Ordinary session held in Pretoria, South Africa from 2nd May to 16th May 2002.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a

aV227/99 Democratic Republic of Congo / Burundi,\u000aRwanda, Uganda\u000a\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. On 8th March 1999, the Secretariat of the African Commission received from Mr Léonard She Okitundu,\u000aMinister of Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a letter with Reference No\u000aCABMIN/MDH/MM/201/MZ/99, dated 24th February 1999, a communication presented on behalf of the\u000aCongolese government based on the provisions of Article 49 of the Charter.\u000a2. The communication is filed against the Republics of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda (hereinafter referred\u000ato, respectively, as 'Burundi', 'Rwanda' and 'Uganda'). It alleges grave and massive violations of human and\u000apeoples' rights committed by the armed forces of these three countries in the Congolese provinces where\u000athere have been rebel activities since 2nd August 1998, and for which the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000ablames Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda. In support of its complaint the Democratic Republic of Congo states\u000athat the Ugandan and Rwandan governments have acknowledged the presence of their respective armed\u000aforces in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo under what it terms the 'fallacious\u000apretext' of 'safeguarding their interests'. The complaint states, furthermore, that the Congolese government\u000ahas 'sufficient and overwhelming evidence of Burundi's involvement'.\u000a3. In particular, the Democratic Republic of Congo asserts that on Monday, 3rd August 1998, thirty-eight\u000a(38) officers and about [one hundred] (100) men of the Congolese forces were assassinated, after being\u000adisarmed, at Kavumu airport, Bukavu, in the Congolese province of South Kivu. Relatedly, on Tuesday, 4th\u000aAugust 1998, over fifty (50) corpses were buried in Bukavu, about twenty (20) of them near the fuel station\u000aat the Nyamwera market, opposite Ibanda mosque. Other corpses (mostly civilians) were found at the\u000amilitary camp called 'Sa?o camp' in Bukavu. On 17th August 1998, the Rwandan and Ugandan forces who\u000ahad been on Congolese territory for many weeks, besieged Inga hydroelectric dam, in Lower Congo\u000aprovince, a wholly civilian facility. The presence of these forces disrupted the lives of millions of people and\u000athe economic life of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It also caused the death of many patients including\u000achildren in hospitals, due to the cutting off of electricity supply to incubated operating theatres and other\u000arespiratory equipment.\u000a4. On Monday, 24th August 1998, over eight hundred and fifty-six (856) persons were massacred in Kasika,\u000ain Lwindi chiefdom, and Mwenga. The bodies found over a distance of sixty kilometres (60 km) from\u000aKilungutwe to Kasika (in South Kivu province) were mainly those of women and children. The women had\u000abeen raped before being killed by their murderers, who slashed them open from the vagina up to the\u000aabdomen and cut them up with daggers. On 2nd September 1998, in a bid to ambush the men of the\u000aCongolese army based in Kamituga, the Rwandan and Ugandan forces in Kitutu village massacred thirteen\u000a(13) people. On 6th October 1998, forty-eight (48) civilians were killed in Lubarika village. In Uvira town, on\u000athe banks of Lake Tanganyika, a massacre of the population including intellectuals and other able-bodied\u000apersons took place. This was partly evidenced by the discovery of three hundred and twenty-six (326)\u000abodies in Rushima river, near Luberizi. Five hundred and forty-seven (547) bodies were also discovered\u000aburied in a mass grave at Bwegera, and one hundred and thirty-eight (138) others were found in a\u000abutcher's shop in Luvingi village. From 30th December 1998 to 1st January 1999, six hundred and twelve\u000a(612) persons were massacred in Makobola, South Kivu province. All these atrocities were committed by\u000athe Rwandan and Ugandan forces which invaded territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u000aaccording to the complaint of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u000a5. The Democratic Republic of Congo also claims that the forces of Rwanda and Uganda aimed at\u000aspreading sexually transmitted diseases and committing rape. To this end, about two thousand (2000)\u000aAIDS suffering or HIV-positive Ugandan soldiers were sent to the front in the eastern province of Congo\u000awith the mission of raping girls and women so as to propagate an AIDS pandemic among the local\u000apopulation and, thereby, decimate it. The Democratic Republic of Congo notes that 75% of the Ugandan\u000aarmy are suffering from AIDS. A white paper annexed to the communication enumerates many cases of\u000a1\u000a\u000arape of girls and women perpetrated by the forces of Rwanda and Uganda, particularly in South Kivu\u000aprovince. It further states that on Monday, 5th October 1998, in Lumunba quarter, Babozo division, Bagira\u000acommune, under the instructions of a young Rwandan officer nicknamed 'terminator', who was then\u000acommanding the Bagira military camp, several young Congolese girls were raped by soldiers based at the\u000asaid camp. Similar cases of rape have been reported from Mwenga, Walungu, Shabunda and Idjwi.\u000a6. The Democratic Republic of Congo avers that since the beginning of the war in its eastern provinces, the\u000acivilian population has been deported by the Rwandan and Ugandan armies to what it refers to as\u000a'concentration camps' situated in Rwanda. It further states that other people are simply massacred and\u000aincinerated in crematories (especially in Bugusera, Rwanda). The goal of these operations is to make the\u000aindigenous people disappear from these regions and thus, to establish what it terms 'Tutsiland'.\u000a7. The Democratic Republic of Congo also accuses Rwanda and Uganda of carrying out systematic looting\u000aof the underground riches of the regions controlled by their forces, just as the possessions of the civilian\u000apopulation are being hauled away to Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. To substantiate its accusations, it\u000astates that on 4th September 1998, the contents of all the safes of the local branch of the Central Bank of\u000aCongo in Bukavu town were looted and the booty taken away to Rwanda. In Kalema, a town in Maniema\u000aprovince, all the minerals in the factory of the SOMINKI firm were looted by the same forces. The\u000aDemocratic Republic of Congo claims that between October and December 1998, the gold produced by the\u000aOKIMO firm and by local diggers, yielding $100,000,000 (one hundred million US dollars) was carted to\u000aRwanda. Still according to its estimation, the coffee produced in the region and in North Kivu yielded about\u000a$70,000,000 (seventy million US dollars) to Uganda in the same period. As for the wood produced by the\u000aAMEXBOIS firm based in Kisangani town, it is exported to Uganda. Rwanda and Uganda have also taken\u000aover control of the fiscal and customs revenue collected respectively by the Directorate General of Taxes.\u000aThe plunder of the riches of the eastern provinces of Congo is also affecting endangered animal species\u000asuch as okapis, mountain gorillas, rhinoceros, and elephants.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a8. The Democratic Republic of Congo claims, among other things, that it is the victim of an armed\u000aaggression perpetrated by Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda; and that this is a violation of the fundamental\u000aprinciples that govern friendly relations between States, as stipulated in the Charters of the United Nations\u000a(UN) and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); in particular, the principles of non-recourse to force in\u000ainternational relations, the peaceful settlement of differences, respect for the sovereignty and territorial\u000aintegrity of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. It emphasises that the massacres\u000aand other violations of human and peoples' rights that it accuses Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of, are\u000acommitted in violation of the provisions of Articles 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a9. It also claims violation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the\u000aGeneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and of the Additional Protocol on the Protection of Victims of\u000aInternational Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8th June 1977.\u000a10. From the foregoing, the Democratic Republic of Congo, based on the facts presented and the law cited,\u000arequests the [African] Commission to:\u000a1. Declare that [t]he violations of the human rights of the civilian population of the eastern provinces of\u000athe Democratic Republic of Congo by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi are in contravention of the\u000arelevant provisions of the African Charter cited above; and\u000a2. Examine the communication diligently, especially in the light of Article 58(1)&Article 58(3) of the\u000aCharter with a view to producing a detailed, objective and impartial report on the grave and massive\u000aviolations of human rights committed in the war-affected eastern provinces and to submit it to the\u000aAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU.\u000a11. The Democratic Republic of Congo also requests the [African] Commission to:\u000a1. "... Take due note of the violations of the relevant provisions of the Charters of the [UN], the [OAU],\u000aand the one on Human and Peoples' Rights;\u000a2. Condemn the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has generated grave\u000aviolations of the human rights of peaceful peoples;\u000a2\u000a\u000a3. Deploy an investigation mission with a view to observing in loco the accusations made against\u000aBurundi, Rwanda and Uganda;\u000a4. Demand the unconditional withdrawal of the invading troops from Congolese territory in order to put\u000aan end to the grave and massive violations of human rights;\u000a5. Demand that the countries violating human and peoples' rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000apay just reparation for the damages caused and the acts of looting; and\u000a6. Indicate the appropriate measures to punish the authors of the war crimes or crimes against\u000ahumanity, as the case may be, and the creation of an ad hoc tribunal to try the crimes committed\u000aagainst the Democratic Republic of Congo. The ad hoc tribunal may be created in collaboration with\u000athe [UN]".\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a12. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the [African] Commission on 8th March 1999.\u000aThe same day, two letters were dispatched by fax, to the Ministry of Human Rights and the Ministry of\u000aForeign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Congo respectively, acknowledging receipt.\u000a13. In compliance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the Rules of Procedure, the Secretariat\u000athen submitted the communication to the [African] Commission, meeting at its 25th Ordinary Session from\u000a26th April to 5th May 1999, in Bujumbura (Burundi).\u000a14. At its 25th Ordinary session held in Bujumbura, Burundi, the [African] Commission took a decision of\u000aseizure on the communication and requested the Complainant State to forward an official copy of its\u000acomplaint to the Secretary-General of the OAU.\u000a15. On 28th May 1999, Notes Verbale together with a copy of the communication were each sent to the\u000aMinistries of External Affairs/External Relations of the Respondent States informing them of the\u000acommunication filed against them by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u000a16. On 2nd June 1999, the Secretariat wrote to the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000ainforming them of the decision of seizure taken by the [African] Commission and requesting them to comply\u000awith the provisions of Article 49 of the Charter.\u000a17. At the 26th Session of the [African] Commission held in Kigali, Rwanda, the communication was not\u000aexamined, as the [African] Commission considered it necessary to allow the Respondent States more time\u000ato communicate their reactions.\u000a18. On 14th December 1999, the Secretariat wrote to the various parties requesting their reactions\u000aregarding the issue of admissibility.\u000a19. At the 27th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2000 in Algiers, Algeria, the [African]\u000aCommission heard oral submissions on the admissibility of the case from representatives of the\u000aComplainant State and from two Respondent States (Rwanda and Uganda). The [African] Commission,\u000aafter examining the case according to the provisions of its Rules of Procedures, thereafter declared the\u000acommunication admissible and requested parties to furnish it with arguments on the merits of the case.\u000a20. The parties were accordingly informed of the above decision on 14th July 2000.\u000a21. At the 28th Session of the [African] Commission held from 23rd October to 6th November 2000 in\u000aCotonou, Benin, the communication was not considered as the [African] Commission had not received any\u000aresponse from Respondent States on the request that was extended to them following the 27th Session.\u000a22. During the Session, however, the delegation of Rwanda transmitted to the Secretariat of the [African]\u000aCommission, a submission, which stated that the [African] Commission should not have declared\u000acommunication 227/99 admissible because the procedure followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000awas not valid and that the [African] Commission itself had not respected the provisions of its own Rules of\u000aProcedure. The submission further stated that the matters addressed by the communication were pending\u000abefore competent authorities of the Organisation of African Unity and other international bodies like the UN\u000aSecurity Council and ECOSOC. Finally, Rwanda refuted allegations of human rights violations made\u000aagainst it by the Democratic Republic of Congo and justified the presence of its troops in this country on\u000agrounds of security, while accusing the Democratic Republic of Congo of hosting groups hostile to Rwanda.\u000a23. The submission of Rwanda was transmitted to all States concerned with communication 227/99.\u000a24. In October 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received from Uganda a submission on\u000acommunication 227/99 in which the Respondent State recognised and justified the presence of its troops in\u000a3\u000a\u000athe Democratic Republic of Congo. The troops were said to be in the Democratic Republic of Congo to\u000aprevent Ugandan rebels from attacking the Ugandan territory.\u000a25. Uganda stated in its submission that since the early 1990s the territory of the Democratic Republic of\u000aCongo (then the Republic of Zaire) has provided sanctuary to bands of armed rebel groups. These rebel\u000agroups, which Uganda claims support former dictator Idi Amin, have posed a significant danger for Uganda\u000asince 1996.\u000a26. Uganda stated that supported by both Sudan and Mobutu's government in the Democratic Republic of\u000aCongo, these groups grew to 6,000, posing a serious security threat to Uganda and that therefore Ugandan\u000atroops were present in the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to prevent Ugandan rebels from\u000aattacking the Ugandan territory.\u000a27. The submission further states that after Mobutu's overthrow in 1997, the Kabila government invited\u000aUganda to enter eastern Congo to work together to stop the activities of the anti-Uganda rebels and that\u000aUgandan armed forces remained in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the request of President Kabila\u000asince his forces 'had no capability to exercise authority' in the remote eastern region. Uganda attached the\u000aProtocol between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Uganda on Security along the\u000aCommon Border to show that both sides recognised the problem of armed groups and decided to\u000acooperate.\u000a28. According to Uganda, President Kabila revoked the above-mentioned agreement in August 1998 as a\u000anew rebellion started in the Democratic Republic of Congo (when the coalition that had overthrown Mobutu\u000adisintegrated) and blamed this 'internal rebellion', on the invasion of Uganda and Rwanda. The Democratic\u000aRepublic of Congo then started looking for allies in its struggle against the rebels and it turned to forces\u000ahostile to the governments of Rwanda and Uganda, specifically the Allied Democratic Force and pro-Idi\u000aAmin groups. Uganda said it therefore had no option but to keep its troops in the Democratic Republic of\u000aCongo, in order to deal with the threat of attacks posed by these foreign-sponsored rebel groups.\u000a29. To support its actions, Uganda cited provisions of international instruments:\u000a1. Article 51\u000a× Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence\u000aif an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has\u000ataken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by\u000aMembers in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security\u000aCouncil and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under\u000athe present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or\u000arestore international peace and security.\u000aof the UN Charter;\u000a2. Article 3\u000a× Calls upon all States to refrain from all acts of aggression and other uses of force contrary to the\u000aCharter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning\u000aFriendly Relations and Co-operation among States In accordance with the Charter of the United\u000aNations;\u000aof the UN General Assembly Resolution on the Definition of Aggression;\u000a3. The UN General Assembly Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly\u000aRelations and Cooperation among States; and\u000a4. Article 23 of the African Charter.\u000a30. In its submission, Uganda also points to the lack of evidence implicating it in the alleged human rights\u000aviolations, stating for example that, Ugandan troops have never been in some places mentioned in the\u000acommunication. The submission characterises the violations relating to HIV/AIDS as 'the most ridiculous\u000aallegation'. Referring to the joint case against itself, Rwanda, and Burundi, Uganda claims that '[t]here is\u000anever group responsibility for violations.' In addition, "allegations of human rights violations must be verified\u000aby an independent body or by a fact-finding Commission". Uganda contrasts the allegations it faces with\u000aevidence of the Democratic Republic of Congo government's involvement in violations in its eastern\u000aprovinces.\u000a31. As for the withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the submission relies\u000aon the Democratic Republic of Congo's failed request to the [International Court of Justice] (ICJ) to order\u000athe unconditional withdrawal of Ugandan troops.\u000a4\u000a\u000a32. Regarding payment of reparations, Uganda points to the lack of documentation on this issue and,\u000aconcerning the illegal exploitation of the Democratic Republic of Congo's natural resources, Uganda denied\u000ainvolvement and affirmed its "unconditional support to the United Nation's efforts to set up a panel of\u000aexperts [that the Democratic Republic of Congo has also approved] to investigate" the issue.\u000a33. On the issue of investigation of human rights violations, while Uganda welcomed the Democratic\u000aRepublic of Congo's call for independent investigation, it portrayed the Democratic Republic of Congo's\u000auninvestigated allegations as 'disturbing'.\u000a34. Uganda also noted that the Democratic Republic of Congo has accused Uganda in several other fora:\u000athe UN Security Council, the ICJ, the Lusaka Initiative, and the OAU. According to the Respondent State,\u000athese actions "present a dilemma to the conduct of international affairs...and adjudication," undermining the\u000acredibility of these institutions and the [African] Commission as divergent opinions may be reached.\u000a35. In conclusion Uganda contends that "there is no legal basis on which the African Commission can deal\u000awith the communication and declare any of the remedies sought by the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000aagainst Uganda.".\u000a36. Copies of the submissions of Uganda on communication 227/99 were transmitted to all States\u000aconcerned by the communication.\u000a37. In December 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received a set of five (5) submissions\u000afrom the Democratic Republic of Congo containing reports on alleged violations of human rights by armed\u000aforces of the Respondent States and their alleged allies in the territory of the Democratic Republic of\u000aCongo. The submissions also stated that the foreign uninvited troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000awere looting the resources of the country.\u000a38. The Secretariat of the [African] Commission transmitted these submissions to the respective parties to\u000athe communication.\u000a39. At the 29th Session, which was held from 23rd April to 7th May 2001 in Tripoli, Libya, the communication\u000awas not considered because the [African] Commission had still not received any submission from one of\u000athe Respondent State, namely, Burundi. On that occasion, all relevant letters and submissions by the other\u000aStates were transmitted to the delegations of all the Respondent States including Burundi, for their\u000aconsideration and reaction to the [African] Commission.\u000a40. In August 2001, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received a request from the Ministry of\u000aHuman Rights of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which deplored the delays in the processing of\u000acommunication 227/99 and invited the [African] Commission to summon an extraordinary session in order\u000ato deal diligently with the communication.\u000a41. By Notes Verbales ACHPR/COMM/044 sent to their respective Ministries of Foreign/External Affairs on\u000a26th September 2001, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission informed all States concerned by\u000acommunication 227/99 that it was going to consider the said communication on the merits, at its 30th\u000aOrdinary Session scheduled from 13th to 27th October 2001 in Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a42. In October 2001, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received a Note Verbale from Rwanda,\u000awhich restated the objections raised in its submission of October 2000 concerning communication 227/99,\u000aadding that if Rwanda's arguments were not taken into account, it should not be called upon to present a\u000adefence.\u000a43. At its 30th Session, the [African] Commission discussed the request by the Democratic Republic of\u000aCongo about organising an extraordinary session to deal with communication 227/99 and resolved to raise\u000athe issue with the relevant authorities of the Secretariat of the African Union. The [African] Commission also\u000aheard oral statements by the delegations of Rwanda and Uganda on the issue, written copies of which\u000awere also handed over to its Secretariat.\u000a44. In its statement, the Rwandan delegation reiterated its arguments stated during the 28th Session and\u000aobjected to the proposed extraordinary session to deal with the communication on the grounds that the\u000acommunication could be considered during an ordinary session and that an extraordinary session will have\u000afinancial implication[s]. Rwanda therefore recommended that the [African] Commission deals with the\u000acommunication during its 31st Session scheduled for May 2002 in Pretoria, South Africa. The statement\u000afurther justified the presence of Rwandan troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo by the assistance\u000athat the Government of this country is granting elements hostile to the Government of Kigali and concluded\u000athat as long as such a threat exists for Rwanda, it could not withdraw its troops from the Democratic\u000aRepublic of Congo.\u000a45. In its statement, the Ugandan delegation said that they had not received the documents sent to them on\u000acommunication 227/99 and could not present their defence at that stage. The delegation further objected to\u000a5\u000a\u000athe holding of an extraordinary session to deal with the communication and added that the facts\u000acomplained of by the Democratic Republic of Congo are also pending before the ICJ and that consideration\u000aof the communication by the [African] Commission would prejudice the court hearing.\u000a46. At the 31st Session of the [African] Commission, which was held from 2nd to 16th May 2002 in Pretoria,\u000aSouth Africa, the [African] Commission did not consider the communication because there had been no\u000aresponse from the OAU regarding the request from the Democratic Republic of Congo on the holding of the\u000aextraordinary session on the communication. During that session, the [African] Commission resolved to\u000aproceed as follows: the African Commission would hold the extraordinary session in case the Secretariat\u000aGeneral of the OAU agree[d] to it, or (in case the OAU did not accept the idea of extraordinary session), the\u000aAfrican Commission would arrange its agenda for the 32nd Ordinary Session in such a way as to have\u000asufficient time to deal with the communication. That decision was communicated to the delegations of all\u000athe States concerned who were attending the session.\u000a47. By Note Verbale ACHPR/COMM 227/99 of 11 June 2002, the Secretariat transmitted that decision to\u000athe States concerned by the communication.\u000a48. A reminder was also sent to the same States by Notes Verbale ACHPR/COMM 227/99 on 8th October\u000a2002.\u000a49. During its 32nd Ordinary Session which took place from 17 to 23 October 2002 in Banjul, the Gambia,\u000athe [African] Commission did not consider this communication because of the circumstances of the\u000asession1 which did not provide enough time to deal with this important communication.\u000a50. The [African] Commission took a decision on the merits of the communication during its 33rd Ordinary\u000aSession, which was held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a51. The procedure for bringing inter-state communications before the [African] Commission is governed by\u000aArticles 47 to 49 of the Charter. At this stage, it is important to mention that this is the first inter-State\u000acommunication brought before the African Commission.\u000a52. It is to be noted that Burundi2 , a Respondent State was provided with all the relevant submissions\u000arelating to this communication, in conformity with Article 57 of the Charter. But neither did Burundi react to\u000aany of them nor did it make any oral submission before the [African] Commission regarding the complaint.\u000a53. The African Commission would like to emphasise that the absence of reaction from Burundi does not\u000aabsolve the latter from the decision the African Commission may arrive at in the consideration of the\u000acommunication. Burundi by ratifying the African Charter indicated its commitment to cooperate with the\u000a[African] Commission and to abide by all decisions taken by the latter.\u000a54. In their oral arguments before the [African] Commission at its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria (27th\u000aApril to 11th May 2000), Rwanda and Uganda had argued that the decision of the Complainant State to\u000asubmit the communication directly to the Chairman of the [African] Commission without first notifying them\u000aand the Secretary General of the OAU, is procedurally wrong and therefore fatal to the admissibility of the\u000acase.\u000a55. Article 47 requires the Complainant State to draw, by written communication, the attention of the\u000aviolating State to the matter and the communication should also be addressed to the Secretary General of\u000athe OAU and the Chairman of the [African] Commission. The State to which the communication is\u000aaddressed is to give written explanation or statement elucidating the matter within three months of the\u000areceipt of the communication.\u000a56. By the provisions of Article 48 of the Charter, if within three months from the date on which the original\u000acommunication is received by the State to which it is addressed, the issue is not settled to the satisfaction\u000aof the two States involved through bilateral negotiation or by any other peaceful procedure, either State\u000ashall have the right to submit the matter to the [African] Commission through the Chairman and to notify the\u000aother States involved.\u000a57. The provisions of Articles 47 and 48, read in conjunction with Rule 88 to Rule 92 of the Rules of\u000aProcedure of the [African] Commission are geared towards the achievement of one of the essential\u000aobjectives and fundamental principles of the Charter: conciliation.\u000a58. The [African] Commission is of the view that the procedure outlined in Article 48 of the Charter is\u000apermissive and not mandatory. This is borne out by the use of the word "may". Witness the first sentence of\u000a6\u000a\u000athis provision: "If a State Party to the Present Charter has good reasons to believe that another State Party\u000ato this Charter has violated the provisions of the Charter, it may draw, by written communication, the\u000aattention of that State to the matter".\u000a59. Moreover, where the dispute is not settled amicably, Article 48 of the Charter requires either State to\u000asubmit the matter to the [African] Commission through the Chairman and to notify the other States involved.\u000aIt does not, however, provide for its submission to the Secretary General of the OAU. Nevertheless, based\u000aon the decision of the [African] Commission at its 25th Ordinary Session, requesting it to forward a copy of\u000aits complaint to the Secretary General of the OAU (see paragraph 14 above), the Complainant State had\u000adone so.\u000a60. Furthermore, it appears that the main reason why the Charter makes provision for the Respondent\u000aState to be informed of such violations or notified of the submission of such a communication to the\u000a[African] Commission, is to avoid a situation of springing surprises on the States involved. This procedure\u000aenables the Respondent States to decide whether to settle the complaint amicably or not. The [African]\u000aCommission is of the view that even if the Complainant State had not abided by the said provision of the\u000aCharter, such omission is not fatal to the communication since after being seized of the case, a copy of the\u000acommunication, as is the practice of the [African] Commission, was forwarded to the Respondent States for\u000atheir observations (see paragraph 15 above).\u000a61. Article 49 on the other hand, provides for a procedure where the Complainant State directly seizes the\u000a[African] Commission without passing through the conciliation phase. Accordingly, the Complainant State\u000amay refer the matter directly to the [African] Commission by addressing a communication to the Chairman,\u000athe Secretary General of the OAU and the State concerned. Such a process allows the requesting State to\u000aavoid making contacts with the Respondent State in cases where such contacts will not be diplomatically\u000aeither effective or desirable. In the [African] Commission's considered opinion that seems to be the case\u000ahere. Indeed, the situation of undeclared war prevailing between the Democratic Republic of Congo and its\u000aneighbours to the east did not favour the type of diplomatic contact that would have facilitated the\u000aapplication of the provisions of Articles 47 and 48 of the [African] Charter. It was also for this reason that\u000athe [African] Commission took the view that Article 52 did not apply to this communication.\u000a62. The [African] Commission is mindful of the requirement that it can consider or deal with a matter\u000abrought before it if the provisions of Article 50 of the Charter and 97(c) of the Rules of Procedure are met,\u000athat is if all local remedies, if they exist, have been exhausted, unless such would be unduly prolonged.\u000a63. The [African] Commission takes note that the violations complained of are allegedly being perpetrated\u000aby the Respondent States in the territory of the Complainant State. In the circumstances, the [African]\u000aCommission finds that local remedies do not exist, and the question of their exhaustion does not, therefore,\u000aarise.\u000a64. The effect of the alleged activities of the rebels and armed forces of the Respondent State Parties to\u000athe Charter, which also back the rebels, fall not only within the province of humanitarian law, but also within\u000athe mandate of the [African] Commission. The combined effect of Articles 60 and 61 of the [African] Charter\u000acompels this conclusion; and it is also buttressed by Article 23 of the African Charter.\u000a65. There is also authority, which does not exclude violations committed during armed conflict from the\u000ajurisdiction of the [African] Commission. In communication 74/92 Commission nationale des droits de\u000al'Homme et des libertés, the [African] Commission held that the African Charter "unlike other human rights\u000ainstruments, does not allow for States Parties to derogate from their treaty obligations during emergency\u000asituations. Thus, even a situation of ....war...cannot be cited as justification by the State violating or\u000apermitting violations of the African Charter" (see also 159/96 UIDH et al. / Angola).\u000aFrom the foregoing, the [African] Commission declares the communication admissible.\u000a\u000aMerits\u000a66. The use of armed force by the Respondent States, which the Democratic Republic of Congo complains\u000aof, contravenes the well-established principle of international law that States shall settle their disputes by\u000apeaceful means in such a manner that international peace, security and justice are not endangered.\u000aIndeed, there cannot be both national and international peace and security guaranteed by the African\u000aCharter under the conditions created by the Respondent States in the eastern provinces of the\u000a7\u000a\u000aComplainant State.\u000a67. Rwanda and Uganda, in their oral arguments before the [African] Commission at its 27th Ordinary\u000aSession held in Algeria had argued that the decision of the Complainant State to submit the communication\u000adirectly to the Chairman of the [African] Commission without first notifying them and the Secretary General\u000aof the OAU, is procedurally wrong and therefore fatal to the admissibility of the case. But the African\u000aCommission found otherwise.\u000a68. The [African] Commission finds the conduct of the Respondent States inconsistent with the standard\u000aexpected of them under UN Declaration on Friendly Relations, which is implicitly affirmed by the Charters\u000aof the UN and OAU, and which the [African] Commission is mandated by Article 23 of the African Charter to\u000auphold. Any doubt that this provision has been violated by the Respondent States is resolved by recalling\u000aan injunction in the UN Declaration on Friendly Relations: "No State or group of States has the right to\u000aintervene directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever [sic], in the internal or external affairs of any other\u000aStates. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against\u000athe personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements are in violation of\u000ainternational law...Also no State shall organise, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive,\u000aterrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State or interfere\u000ain civil strife in another State.". The substance of the complaint of the Democratic Republic of Congo\u000aagainst the Respondents is covered by the foregoing prohibition. The Respondent States have therefore\u000aviolated Article 23 of the African Charter. The conduct of the Respondent States also constitutes a flagrant\u000aviolation of the right to the unquestionable and inalienable right of the peoples of the Democratic Republic\u000aof Congo to self-determination provided for by Article 20 of the African Charter, especially clause 1 of this\u000aprovision.\u000a69. The Complainant State alleges grave and massive violations of human and peoples' rights committed\u000aby the armed forces of the Respondent States in its eastern provinces. It details series of massacres,\u000arapes, mutilations, mass transfers of populations and looting of the peoples' possessions, as some of those\u000aviolations. As noted earlier on, the series of violations alleged to have been committed by the armed forces\u000aof the Respondent States fall within the province of humanitarian law, and therefore rightly covered by the\u000aFour Geneva Conventions and the Protocols additional to them. And the [African] Commission having\u000afound the alleged occupation of parts of the provinces of the Complainant State by the Respondents to be\u000ain violation of the Charter cannot turn a blind eye to the series of human rights violations attendant upon\u000asuch occupation.\u000a70. The combined effect of Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter enables the [African] Commission to\u000adraw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights, the Charter of the UN, the Charter of\u000athe OAU and also to take into consideration, as subsidiary measures to determine the principles of law,\u000aother general or special international conventions, laying down rules recognized by Member States of the\u000aOAU, general principles recognised by African States as well as legal precedents and doctrine. By virtue of\u000aArticles 60 and 61, the [African] Commission holds that the Four Geneva Conventions and the two\u000aAdditional Protocols covering armed conflicts constitute part of the general principles of law recognised by\u000aAfrican States, and take [the] same into consideration in the determination of this case.\u000a71. It is noted that Article 75(2)\u000a× Art 75. Fundamental guarantees 2. The following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in\u000aany place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents: (a) violence to the life, health, or\u000aphysical or mental well-being of persons, in particular: (i) murder; (ii) torture of all kinds, whether physical or\u000amental; (iii) corporal punishment; and (iv) mutilation;\u000aof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 prohibits the following acts at any time\u000aand in all places whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents:\u000a1. Violence to life, health, or physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular;\u000a2. Murder;\u000a3. Torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental;\u000a4. Corporal punishment;\u000a5. Mutilations; and\u000a6. Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment; enforced\u000aprostitution and any form of indecent assault.\u000a\u000a8\u000a\u000a72. The Complainant State alleges the occupation of the eastern provinces of the country by the\u000aRespondent States' armed forces. It alleges also that most parts of the affected provinces have been under\u000athe control of the rebels since 2nd August 1998, with the assistance and support of the Respondent States.\u000aIn support of its claim, it states that the Ugandan and Rwandan governments have acknowledged the\u000apresence of their respective armed forces in the eastern provinces of the country under what it calls the\u000a'fallacious pretext' of 'safeguarding their interests'. The [African] Commission takes note that this claim is\u000acollaborated by the statements of the representatives of the Respondent States during the 27th Ordinary\u000aSession held in Algeria.\u000a73. Article 23 of the Charter guarantees to all peoples the right to national and international peace and\u000asecurity. It provides further that the principles of solidarity and friendly relations implicitly affirmed by the\u000aCharter of the UN and reaffirmed by that of the OAU shall govern relations between states. The principles\u000aof solidarity and friendly relations contained in the Declaration on Principles of International Law\u000aConcerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the UN Charter (Res.\u000a2625 (XXV), adopted by the UN General Assembly on 24th October 1970, prohibits threat or use of force by\u000aStates in settling disputes. Principle 1 provides: "Every State has the duty to refrain in its international\u000arelations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any\u000aState, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the [UN]. Such a threat or use of force\u000aconstitutes a violation of international law and the Charter of the [UN] and shall never be employed as a\u000ameans of settling international issues".\u000a74. In the same vein, Article 33\u000a× Article 33 - 1. The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance\u000aof international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation,\u000aconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful\u000ameans of their own choice. 2. The Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to\u000asettle their dispute by such means.\u000aof the UN Charter enjoins "parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the\u000amaintenance of international peace and security...first of all, to seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry,\u000amediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other\u000apeaceful means of their own choice". Chapter VII of the same Charter outrightly prohibits threats to the\u000apeace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. Article III of the OAU Charter states that "The\u000aMember States, in pursuit of the purposes stated in Article II, solemnly affirm and declare their adherence\u000ato the following principles:\u000a1. Non-interference in the internal affairs of States;\u000a2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State and for its inalienable right to\u000aindependent existence;\u000a3. Peaceful settlement of disputes by negotiation, mediation, conciliation or arbitration."\u000a75. It also contravenes the well-established principle of international law that States shall settle their\u000adisputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not\u000aendangered. As noted in paragraph 66 above, there cannot be both national and international peace and\u000asecurity guaranteed by the Charter with the conduct of the Respondent States in the eastern provinces of\u000athe Complainant State.\u000a76. The [African] Commission therefore disapproves of the occupation of the Complainant's territory by the\u000aarmed forces of the Respondent forces and finds it impermissible, even in the face of their argument of\u000abeing in the Complainant's territory in order to safeguard their national interests and therefore in\u000acontravention of Article 23 of the [African] Charter. The [African] Commission is of the strong belief that\u000asuch interests would better be protected within the confines of the territories of the Respondent States.\u000a77. It bears repeating that the [African] Commission finds the conduct of the Respondent States in\u000aoccupying territories of the Complainant State to be a flagrant violation of the rights of the peoples of the\u000aDemocratic Republic of Congo to their unquestionable and inalienable right to self-determination provided\u000afor by Article 20 of the African Charter.\u000a78. As previously stated, the [African] Commission is entitled, by virtue of Articles 60 and 61 of the African\u000aCharter, to draw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights,...the Charter of the UN,\u000a9\u000a\u000athe Charter of the OAU...and also take into consideration, as subsidiary measures to determine the\u000aprinciples of law, other general or special international conventions, laying down rules recognised by\u000aMember States of the OAU...general principles recognised by African States as well as legal precedents\u000aand doctrine. Invoking these provisions, the [African] Commission holds that the Four Geneva Conventions\u000aand the two Additional Protocols covering armed conflicts, fall on all fours with the category of special\u000ainternational conventions, laying down rules recognised by Member States of the OAU and also constitute\u000apart of the general principles recognised by African States, and to take [the] same into consideration in the\u000adetermination of this case.\u000a79. The [African] Commission finds the killings, massacres, rapes, mutilations and other grave human\u000arights abuses committed while the Respondent States' armed forces were still in effective occupation of the\u000aeastern provinces of the Complainant State reprehensible and also inconsistent with their obligations under\u000aPart III of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 and\u000aProtocol 1 of the Geneva Convention.\u000a80. They also constitute flagrant violations of Article 2 of the African Charter, such acts being directed\u000aagainst the victims by virtue of their national origin; and Article 4, which guarantees respect for life and the\u000aintegrity of one's person and prohibits the arbitrary deprivation [of] rights.\u000a81. The allegation of mass transfer of persons from the eastern provinces of the Complainant State to\u000acamps in Rwanda, as alleged by the Complainant and not refuted by the Respondent, is inconsistent with\u000aArticle 18(1) of the African Charter, which recognises the family as the natural unit and basis of society and\u000aguarantees it appropriate protection. It is also a breach of the right to freedom of movement, and the right to\u000aleave and to return to one's country guaranteed under Articles 12 (1) and (2) of the African Charter\u000arespectively.\u000a82. Article 56\u000a× Art 56. Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces\u000a1. Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical\u000agenerating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military\u000aobjectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among\u000athe civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations\u000ashall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the\u000aworks or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.\u000a2. The special protection against attack provided by paragraph 1 shall cease: (a) for a dam or a dyke only if\u000ait is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military\u000aoperations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; (b) for a nuclear electrical\u000agenerating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military\u000aoperations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; (c) for other military\u000aobjectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular,\u000asignificant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate\u000asuch support.\u000a3. In all cases, the civilian population and individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection\u000aaccorded them by international law, including the protection of the precautionary measures provided for in\u000aArticle 57. If the protection Ceases and any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in\u000aparagraph 1 is attacked, all practical precautions shall be taken to avoid the release of the dangerous\u000aforces.\u000a4. It is prohibited to make any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in paragraph 1 the\u000aobject of reprisals.\u000a5. The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to avoid locating any military objectives in the vicinity of the\u000aworks or installations mentioned in paragraph 1. Nevertheless, installations erected for the sole purpose of\u000adefending the protected works or installations from attack are permissible and shall not themselves be\u000amade the object of attack, provided that they are not used in hostilities except for defensive actions\u000anecessary to respond to attacks against the protected works or installations and that their armament is\u000alimited to weapons capable only of repelling hostile action against the protected works or installations.\u000a10\u000a\u000a6. The High Contracting Parties and the Parties to the conflict are urged to conclude further agreements\u000aamong themselves to provide additional protection for objects containing dangerous forces.\u000a7. In order to facilitate the identification of the objects protected by this article, the Parties to the conflict\u000amay mark them with a special sign consisting of a group of three bright orange circles placed on the same\u000aaxis, as specified in Article 16 of Annex I to this Protocol [Article 17 of Amended Annex]. The absence of\u000asuch marking in no way relieves any Party to the conflict of its obligations under this Article.\u000aof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 provides: "(1) Works or installations\u000acontaining dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be\u000amade object of military attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause\u000athe release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. (2) The\u000aspecial protection against attack provided by paragraph 1 shall cease: (a) for a dam or dyke only if it is\u000aused for other than its normal function in a regular, significant and direct support of military operations and\u000aif such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support... (3) In all cases, the civilian population\u000aand individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection accorded them by international law,\u000aincluding the protection of precautionary measures provided for in Article 57."\u000a83. As noted previously, taking Article 56, quoted above into account, and by virtue of Articles 60 and 61 of\u000athe African Charter, the [African] Commission concludes that in besieging the hydroelectric dam in Lower\u000aCongo province, the Respondent States have violated the [African] Charter.\u000a84. The besieg[ing] of the hydroelectric dam may also be brought within the prohibition contained in The\u000aHague Convention (II) with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land which provides in Article 23\u000a× Art. 23. Besides the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially prohibited (a) To employ\u000apoison or poisoned arms; (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or\u000aarmy; (c) To kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down arms, or having no longer means of defence,\u000ahas surrendered at discretion; (d) To declare that no quarter will be given; (e) To employ arms, projectiles,\u000aor material of a nature to cause superfluous injury; (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, the national\u000aflag or military ensigns and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva\u000aConvention; (g) To destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be\u000aimperatively demanded by the necessities of war.\u000athat "Besides the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially prohibited...to destroy the\u000aenemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war".\u000aBy parity of reason, and bearing in mind Articles 60 and 61 of the [African] Charter, the Respondent States\u000aare in violation of the said Charter with regard to the just noted Article 23.\u000a85. The case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia v. Zejnil Delalic, Zdravko Mucic, Hazim\u000aDelic and Esad Landzo (the Celebici Judgment; Nov., 16, 1998 at para. 587) is supportive of the [African]\u000aCommission's stance. It states, inter alia, that "international law today imposes strict limitations on the\u000ameasures which a party to an armed conflict may lawfully take in relation to the private and public property\u000aof an opposing party. The basic norms in this respect, which form part of customary international\u000alaw...include the fundamental principle...that private property must be respected and cannot be\u000aconfiscated...pillage is formally forbidden".\u000a86. The raping of women and girls, as alleged and not refuted by the Respondent States, is prohibited\u000aunder Article 76\u000a×\u000a1. Women shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected in particular against rape, forced\u000aprostitution and any other form of indecent assault.\u000a2. Pregnant women and mothers having dependent infants who are arrested, detained or interned for\u000areasons related to the armed conflict, shall have their cases considered with the utmost priority.\u000a3. To the maximum extent feasible, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to avoid the pronouncement\u000aof the death penalty on pregnant women or mothers having dependent infants, for an offence related to the\u000aarmed conflict. The death penalty for such offences shall not be executed on such women.\u000aof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which provides that "women shall be\u000athe object of special respect and shall be protected in particular against rape, forced prostitution and any\u000a11\u000a\u000aform of indecent assault". It also offends both the African Charter and the Convention on the Elimination of\u000aAll Forms of Discrimination against Women; and on the basis of Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter\u000afind the Respondent States in violation of the Charter.\u000a87. The [African] Commission condemns the indiscriminate dumping of and or mass burial of victims of the\u000aseries of massacres and killings perpetrated against the peoples of the eastern province of the\u000aComplainant State while the armed forces of the Respondent States were in actual fact occupying the said\u000aprovinces. The [African] Commission further finds these acts barbaric and in reckless violation of\u000aCongolese peoples' rights to cultural development guaranteed by Article 22 of the African Charter, and an\u000aaffront on the noble virtues of the African historical tradition and values enunciated in the preamble to the\u000aAfrican Charter. Such acts are also forbidden under Article 34\u000a× Remains of deceased\u000a1. The remains of persons who have died for reasons related to occupation or in detention resulting from\u000aoccupation or hostilities and those or persons not nationals of the country in which they have died as a\u000aresult of hostilities shall be respected, and the grave sites of all such persons shall be respected,\u000amaintained and marked as provided for in Article 130 of the Fourth Convention, where their remains or\u000agrave sites would not receive more favourable consideration under the Conventions and this Protocol.\u000a2. As soon as circumstances and the relations between the adverse Parties permit, the High Contracting\u000aParties in whose territories graves and, as the case may be, other locations of the remains of persons who\u000ahave died as a result of hostilities or during occupation or in detention are situated, shall conclude\u000aagreements in order: (a) to facilitate access to the gravesites by relatives of the deceased and by\u000arepresentatives of official graves registration services and to regulate the practical arrangements for such\u000aaccess; (b) to protect and maintain such gravesites permanently; (c) to facilitate the return of the remains of\u000athe deceased and of personal effects to the home country upon its request or, unless that country objects,\u000aupon the request of the next of kin.\u000a3. In the absence of the agreements provided for in paragraph 2 (b) or (c) and if the home country or such\u000adeceased is not willing to arrange at its expense for the maintenance of such gravesites, the High\u000aContracting Party in whose territory the gravesites are situated may offer to facilitate the return of the\u000aremains of the deceased to the home country. Where such an offer has not been accepted the High\u000aContracting Party may, after the expiry of five years from the date of the offer and upon due notice to the\u000ahome country, adopt the arrangements laid down in its own laws relating to cemeteries and graves.\u000a4. A High Contracting Party in whose territory the grave sites referred to in this Article are situated shall be\u000apermitted to exhume the remains only: (a) in accordance with paragraphs 2 (c) and 3, or (b) where\u000aexhumation is a matter or overriding public necessity, including cases of medical and investigative\u000anecessity, in which case the High Contracting Party shall at all times respect the remains, and shall give\u000anotice to the home country or its intention to exhume the remains together with details of the intended place\u000aof reinterment.\u000aof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which provides for respect for the\u000aremains of such peoples and their gravesites. In disregarding the last provision, the Respondent States\u000ahave violated the African Charter on the basis of Articles 60 and 61 of this instrument.\u000a88. The looting, killing, mass and indiscriminate transfers of civilian population, the besiege and damage of\u000athe hydro-dam, stopping of essential services in the hospital, leading to deaths of patients and the general\u000adisruption of life and state of war that took place while the forces of the Respondent States were occupying\u000aand in control of the eastern provinces of the Complainant State are in violation of Article 14 guaranteeing\u000athe right to property, Articles 16 and 17 (all of the African Charter), which provide for the rights to the best\u000aattainable state of physical and mental health and education, respectively.\u000a89. Part III of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949,\u000aparticularly in Article 27\u000a× Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family\u000arights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be\u000ahumanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and\u000aagainst insults and public curiosity. Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their\u000ahonour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.\u000a12\u000a\u000aWithout prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and sex, all protected persons shall\u000abe treated with the same consideration by the Party to the conflict in whose power they are, without any\u000aadverse distinction based, in particular, on race, religion or political opinion.\u000aHowever, the Parties to the conflict may take such measures of control and security in regard to protected\u000apersons as may be necessary as a result of the war.\u000aprovides for the humane treatment of protected persons at all times and for protection against all acts of\u000aviolence or threats and against insults and public curiosity. Further, it provides for the protection of women\u000aagainst any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent\u000aassault. Article 4\u000a× Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever,\u000afind themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying\u000aPower of which they are not nationals.\u000aNationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral\u000aState who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall\u000anot be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic\u000arepresentation in the State in whose hands they are.\u000aThe provisions of Part II are, however, wider in application, as defined in Article 13.\u000aPersons protected by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and\u000aSick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949, or by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of\u000athe Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949, or\u000aby the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949, shall not be\u000aconsidered as protected persons within the meaning of the present Convention.\u000aof the Convention defines a protected person as those who, at a given moment and in any manner\u000awhatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or\u000aOccupying Power of which they are not nationals.\u000a90. The Complainant State alleges that between October and December 1998, the gold produced by the\u000aOKIMO firm and by local diggers yielded $100,000,000 (one hundred million US dollars) to Rwanda. By its\u000acalculation, the coffee produced in the region and in North Kivu yielded about $70,000,000 (seventy million\u000aUS dollars) to Uganda in the same period. Furthermore, Rwanda and Uganda took over control of the fiscal\u000aand customs revenue collected respectively by the Directorate General of Taxes. The plunder of the riches\u000aof the eastern provinces of Congo is also affecting endangered animal species such as okapis, mountain\u000agorillas, rhinoceros, and elephants.\u000a91. Indeed, the Respondent States, especially Uganda, ha[ve] refuted these allegations, pretending for\u000aexample that its troops never stepped in some of the regions they are accused of human rights violations\u000aand looting of the natural resources of the Complainant State. However, the African Commission has\u000aevidence that some of these facts did take place and are imputable to the armies and agents of the\u000aRespondent States. In fact, the UN ha[s] acknowledged that during the period when the armies of the\u000aRespondent States were in effective control over parts of the territory of the Complainant State, there were\u000alootings of the natural resources of the Complainant State. The UN set up a Panel of Experts to investigate\u000athis matter3\u000a92. The Report of the Panel of Experts, submitted to the Security Council of the UN in April 2001 (under\u000areference S/2001/357) identified all the Respondent States among others actors, as involved in the conflict\u000ain the Democratic Republic of Congo 4 The report profusely provides evidence of the involvement of the\u000aRespondent states in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Complainant State. It is stated in\u000aparagraph 5 of the summary of the Report: "During this first phase (called mass-scale looting phase by the\u000aexperts), stockpiles of minerals, coffee, wood, livestock and money that were available in territories\u000aconquered by the armies of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda were taken, and either transferred to those\u000acountries or exported to international markets by their forces and nationals."5 .\u000a93. Paragraph 25 of the Report further states: "The illegal exploitation of resources (of the Democratic\u000aRepublic of Congo) by Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda took different forms, including confiscation,\u000aextraction, forced monopoly and price-fixing. Of these, the first two reached proportions that made the war\u000ain the Democratic Republic of the Congo a very lucrative business".\u000a94. The [African] Commission therefore finds the illegal exploitation/looting of the natural resources of the\u000acomplainant state in contravention of Article 21 of the African Charter, which provides: "All peoples shall\u000afreely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in the exclusive interest of\u000athe people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it... (2) States Parties to the present Charter shall\u000a13\u000a\u000aindividually and collectively exercise the right to free disposal of their wealth and natural resources with a\u000aview to strengthening African Unity and solidarity."\u000a95. The deprivation of the right of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in this case, to freely\u000adispose of their wealth and natural resources, has also occasioned another violation - their right to their\u000aeconomic, social and cultural development and of the general duty of States to individually or collectively\u000aensure the exercise of the right to development, guaranteed under Article 22 of the African Charter.\u000a96.

aV231/99 Avocats Sans Fronti?res (on behalf of Gaëtan\u000aBwampamye) / Burundi\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. Lawyers Fabien Segatwa, Moussa Coulibaly and Cédric Vergauwen, respectively called to the bars of\u000aBurundi, Niger and Brussels and members of ''Avocats Sans Fronti?res'' in Burundi, and acting on behalf of\u000aMr Gaetan Bwampamye, currently detained at the Mpimba Prison (Bujumbura) present the facts of the\u000acase as follows:\u000a2. On 25 th September 1997, Mr Gaëtan Bwampamye was sentenced to death by the Criminal Chamber of\u000athe Appeal Court of Ngozi after being convicted for having (in Ruhoro, on 21 October 1993, as author,\u000aco-author or accomplice) incited the population to commit crimes, and for having (under the same\u000acircumstance, organised as attack geared towards provoking massacres), set up barricades with a view to\u000ahindering the enforcement of public order, all of which are offences under Articles 212, 417 and 425 of the\u000aPenal Code of Burundi.\u000a3. On 2 nd October 1997, he filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Burundi. In support of his appeal, he\u000ainvoked six grounds, including the violation of Article 75 of the Penal Procedure Code of Burundi, Article 14\u000aparagraph 3(d)\u000a× Article 14 3. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the\u000afollowing minimum guarantees, in full equality: ...\u000a(d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own\u000achoosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance\u000aassigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any\u000asuch case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it;\u000aof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , as well as Article 51 of Decree No. 100/103 of\u000a29 th August 1979, defining the status of the profession of lawyers. According to the complainants, the latter\u000aargument was invoked by the accused to denounce the fact that he was denied the services of his counsel\u000aduring the public prosecution's closing address and that, in spite of his request for assistance, he was\u000acompelled to prepare his own defence.\u000a4. The Complainants assert that on 3 rd June 1997, the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Appeal closed the\u000ahearing of the witnesses, and on account of the volume of the case, decided to adjourn the hearing to 20 th\u000aAugust 1997.\u000a5. During the hearing of 20 th August 1997, the prosecution refused to make its closing address, arguing\u000athat it needed more time to study the contents of the statement of the defence counsel. The Criminal\u000aChamber therefore decided to adjourn the case to 25 September 1997. On that day, the counsel for the\u000adefence was unable to attend the hearing due to ill health. Despite the repeated requests of Mr\u000aBwampanye for the case to be adjourned to another date, the Chamber decided to hear the prosecution,\u000aand compelled the accused to defend himself, without the assistance of his lawyer. The verdict sentencing\u000ahim to death was rendered that same day at the end of the submissions.\u000a6. The Complainants point out that the Supreme Court had rejected this argument, which the accused had\u000ainvoked before it. The accused had wanted the ruling of the Ngozi Court of Appeal quashed on the grounds\u000athat insofar as the court is concerned, the law does not obligate the judge to designate a lawyer, but he\u000amay do so.\u000a7. The Supreme Court continues in the following terms "further, whereas for the specific case in question,\u000athe accused has always been assisted by a lawyer, the evidence being that his lawyer had already\u000asubmitted his 19 page written arguments on 20 th August 1997, that has no furthermore they had already\u000apleaded together in the public hearing, whereas in the face of such situation, the plaintiff justification in\u000asaying that the judge should have designated a lawyer for him whereas he already had one who had\u000aalready accomplished all the essential duties expected of a lawyer; that consequently, this argument is also\u000ato be rejected" .\u000a8. This line of argument of the Supreme Court is challenged by the complainants who raise a certain\u000anumber of points of law, including inter alia , the ignorance according to them by the said court of the\u000aprinciples of the right of defence and judicial assistance. They claim that, this ruling of the Supreme Court is\u000a1\u000a\u000anot only contrary to the provisions of Article 73 of Burundi's Criminal Procedure Code which unequivocally\u000aestablishes the right to judicial assistance but also the general principle of oral submissions in criminal\u000aproceedings.\u000a9. They assert on the one hand that "whilst it is customary for a lawyer to communicate his pleas to the\u000aprosecution before the closing address of the latter, no written rule requires him to do so" . On the other\u000ahand, the complainants assert that "the lawyer is obviously never bound by the contents of a statement of\u000adefence deposited before the hearing. Such a statement therefore is not exhaustive and may only be\u000aconfined to certain aspects of the case and not focus on issues that the defence intends to elaborate on\u000alater at the bar. Counsel for the defence may also renounce certain arguments contained in his note,\u000adepending on for instance the issues raised by the prosecution. This freedom is at the very core of the\u000arights of the defence. Before any decision, they assert, there is the unconditional right to oral submissions\u000aand freedom of speech" .\u000a10. The Complainants assert that this same freedom of speech was accorded to the prosecution, and recall\u000athat the "prosecutor is never bound by the written closing speeches of his office." The principle is\u000afurthermore established by the old saying that "the written word is not, as free as the spoken word" . They\u000avehemently assert, that in indicating in its judgement that the lawyer had already submitted a 19-page\u000astatement of defence and that in this respect, he had accomplished all the fundamental duties of a lawyer",\u000athe Court ignores all the principles that have just been set forth and, consequently, authorises a blatant\u000aviolation of the rights of the defence in general and the rights of judicial assistance in particular".\u000a11. On the basis of the foregoing, the Complainant whilst stressing that the aim of the present complaint is\u000ato highlight the above-mentioned violations, call on the Commission to rule that:\u000a1.\u000a2. By refusing Mr Gaetan Bwampamye the assistance of his legal counsel to plead his case, the\u000aCriminal Chamber of the Ngozi Court of Appeal held a hearing which was not equitable under the\u000aAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and all the relevant international instruments.\u000a3. To establish the violation by the Republic of Burundi of the rights enshrined in the Charter more\u000aspecifically, the violation of Article 7.1.c of the Charter and the general principles on the rights of the\u000adefence;\u000a4. To report its findings to the parties concerned and to the Assembly of Heads of State and\u000aGovernment of the OAU.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a12. The communication is dated 11 th April 1999. It was sent to the Secretariat by E-mail.\u000a13. On account of the fact that the judgement of the Ngozi Court of Appeal (a major piece written in Kirundi)\u000awas still being translated, the communication could not be brought before the Commission during its 25 th\u000aOrdinary Session held in Bujumbura, in May 1999. Towards the end of the said Session however, the\u000aplaintiffs forwarded to the Secretariat the outstanding documents, thus enabling it to complete the file on\u000athe communication and bring the matter before the 26 th Session of the Commission.\u000a14. At its 26 th Session, the Commission heard from the representatives of Mr Bwampamye who had come\u000ato present their position on the matter. After a long debate, the Commission reached a decision to be\u000aseized of the communication. Mr Bwampamye was represented by the following lawyers: Segatwa Fabien,\u000aSeydou Doumbia and Boubine Toure (all of them being members of Avocats Sans Fronti?res ).\u000a15. On 13 th December 1999, the Secretariat informed the parties of this decision and a letter signed by the\u000aChairman of the Commission, Rule 111 requesting a stay of execution was addressed to the Burundian\u000aHead of State.\u000a16. On 15 th February 2000, the Burundi office of Avocats Sans Fronti?res acknowledged receipt of the\u000aletter of 13 th December 1999, addressed to it by the Secretariat without, however, communicating its\u000aobservations as regards the admissibility of the communication.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a17. At its 27 th Ordinary Session held in Algiers, Algeria, the Commission examined the case and declared\u000ait admissible and requested the parties to furnish it with arguments on its merits. It also requested the\u000aChairman of the Commission to repeat its earlier appeal for stay of execution pending the determination of\u000athe communication.\u000a18. The above decision was communicated to parties on 1 st August 2000.\u000a19.During its 28 th Session, the Respondent State and Counsel for the complainant presented their written\u000aand oral submissions before the Commission\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a20. Article 56(5) of the Charter stipulates that "communications relating to human and peoples'\u000arights...received by the Commission shall be considered if they...are sent after exhausting local remedies, if\u000aany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged..."\u000a21. It is apparent from an examination of the documents appended to the dossier that the verdict handed\u000adown on 25 th September 1997, by the Ngozi Court of Appeal, sentencing Mr Gaëtan Bwampamye to death\u000awas confirmed on 5 October of the same year by the Supreme Court of Burundi. The Commission notes,\u000aconsequently, that the domestic remedies had been duly exhausted. For these reasons, it declares the\u000acommunication admissible.\u000a22. In its oral submission, the respondent state argued that the Complainant had not exhausted other local\u000aremedies which include "le recours dans l'intér?t de la loi" , revision and the plea for pardon.\u000a23. The Commission however holds the view that the Complainant could only benefit from the first two\u000aremedies at the initiative of the Ministry of Justice and also as a result of discovery of new facts that may\u000alead to reopening the file. With regard to the plea for pardon, it is not a judicial remedy but serves to affect\u000athe execution of a sentence. For these reasons the Commission maintains its decision on admissibility.\u000aMerits\u000a24. Article 7 (1) (c) of the Charter states: "Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\u000acomprises...the right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice" .\u000a25. In its verdict of 5 th October 1997, the Supreme Court of Burundi adjudged and stated:\u000a"Whereas this Court is of the view that the law implies no obligation on the part of the judge to nominate a\u000alawyer, though he may do so; Whereas in the case under consideration, the accused had always been\u000aassisted by a lawyer, proof being that his 19 page written plea of 20 th August was filed by his lawyer; and\u000athat they had appeared together at the public sitting; Whereas, in view of such situation, the appellant has\u000ano reason to claim that the judge should appoint a lawyer for him, since he already had one who had\u000aperformed all essential functions of a lawyer for him; this procedure is, therefore, also hereby rejected..."\u000a26. The Commission recalls that the right to fair trial involves fulfilment of certain objective criteria, including\u000athe right to equal treatment, the right to defence by a lawyer, especially where this is called for by the\u000ainterests of justice, as well as the obligation on the part of courts and tribunals to conform to international\u000astandards in order to guarantee a fair trial to all. The Commission shall examine the verdict of the Ngozi\u000aCourt of Appeal, as well as that of the Supreme Court in light of the above criteria.\u000a27. The right to equal treatment by a jurisdiction, especially in criminal matters, means, in the first place,\u000athat both the defence and the public prosecutor shall have equal opportunity to prepare and present their\u000apleas and indictment during the trial. Simply put, they should argue their cases before the jurisdiction on an\u000aequal footing. Secondly it entails the equal treatment of all accused persons by jurisdictions charged with\u000atrying them. This does not mean that identical treatment should be meted to all accused. The idea here is\u000athe principle that when objective facts are alike, the response of the judiciary should also be similar. There\u000ais a breach of the principle of equality if judicial or administrative decisions are applied in a discriminatory\u000amanner. In the case under consideration, it is expected of the Commission to attend to the first aspect, that\u000ais, observation of the rule of equality of the means utilised by the defence and the prosecution.\u000a28. The right to defence also implies that at each stage of the criminal proceedings, the accused and his\u000acounsel should be able to reply to the indictment of the public prosecutor and should, in any case, be the\u000alast to intervene before the court retires for deliberations.\u000a3\u000a\u000a29. The Ngozi Court of Appeal had on 25 th September 1997, handed down a verdict sentencing Mr\u000aBwampamye to death, thereby following the prayer of the public prosecutor, paying no heed to the\u000aaccused's prayer for adjournment of the case, pleading the absence of his lawyer. The Commission holds\u000athe view that the judge should have upheld the prayer of the accused, in view of the irreversible character\u000aof the penalty involved. This was all the more imperative considering that during the 20 >\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000a

aV233/99-234/99 Interights (on behalf of Pan African\u000aMovement and Citizens for Peace in Eritrea) v Ethiopia\u000aand Interights (on behalf of Pan African Movement and\u000aInter African Group) / Eritrea\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The Complainant alleges that sometime in the second quarter of 1998 there was an international armed\u000aconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia that led to the beginning of active hostilities between the two\u000acountries.\u000a2. During this period it is alleged by the Complainant that thousands of persons of Ethiopian nationality\u000awere expelled from Eritrea, either directly or constructively by the creation of conditions in which they had\u000ano choice other than to leave Eritrea. In particular, over 2,500 were forcibly expelled and dumped at the\u000aborder where there was ferocious fighting and heavily infested with anti-personnel land mines.\u000a3. It is also alleged that between June 1998 and July 1999, more than sixty one thousand people of\u000aEritrean ethnic descent who are legal residents or citizens of Ethiopia were deported from Ethiopia. Most of\u000athese are urban deportees.\u000a4. The Complainant asserts that in both cases, thousands of persons of Ethiopian origin and those of\u000aEritrean origin were arrested and interned in Eritrea and Ethiopia respectively under harsh conditions with\u000ano visitation rights for their families, no food, clothing and toilet facilities for extended periods of time.\u000a5. The Complainant alleges that some Ethiopian women and young girls were tortured and raped in the\u000aaffected areas by Eritrean soldiers.\u000a6. The Complainant also alleges that most of the deportees were subjected to cruel, inhuman and\u000adegrading treatment. Furthermore, the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia arbitrarily deprived most of the\u000adeportees [of] their property.\u000a7. Specifically in the case of those persons deported by the government of Eritrea, some deportees were\u000aforced to work without salaries in exchange for protection. Yet others were forced out of their rental\u000aaccommodation, suffering forcible eviction and homelessness as a result.\u000a8. While in the case of those persons deported by the government of Ethiopia, the deportees, prior to their\u000adeportation were required to transfer their rights over their property in Ethiopia by a power of attorney to a\u000alegal agent. In compliance with this, husbands often designated their wives as their legal agents, only to\u000afind that their wives were given a month or two to sell their properties and were then deported a week or\u000atwo after they were told to sell. In effect, the deportation was accompanied in most cases by an\u000aexpropriation of the property of the deportees. In some cases some deportees also had their rental\u000aproperties taken over. Some bank accounts were frozen, and some savings books were destroyed, making\u000ait impossible for the deportees or their designated agents to gain access to such savings.\u000a9. The Complainant claims that while effecting the said deportations, parents and children were forcibly\u000aseparated without any provision for the care, feeding, and housing of the children. As at the time of\u000asubmission of the complaints, neither parents nor children can travel across the Eritrean-Ethiopian border\u000aand even telephone communication is impractical.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a10. The Complainant alleges violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 12(1), (2), (4) and (5), 14, 15, 16 and\u000a18(1) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a11. The complaint lodged by INTERIGHTS against Eritrea and Ethiopia was received at the Secretariat of\u000athe African Commission on 5th October 1999.\u000a12. At its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali, Rwanda, the African Commission decided to be seized of\u000acommunications 233/99 and 234/99 and requested the parties to furnish it with additional information on its\u000a1\u000a\u000aadmissibility in accordance with Article 56 of the Charter.\u000a13. On 17th January 2000, the Secretariat conveyed the above decision to the parties and forwarded a copy\u000aof the summary of the communication and the original text of the complaint together with the documents\u000aattached thereto.\u000a14. On 30th April 2000, during the 27th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the Allard K.\u000aLowenstein International Human Rights Law Clinic at the Yale Law School in the United States submitted\u000aan amicus curiae brief to the African Commission on the complaint brought against Ethiopia.\u000a15. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the African Commission heard the representatives of the\u000aparties on the admissibility of the case. It declared both communications admissible and requested parties\u000ato submit their arguments on the merits. The various parties were informed accordingly of the decision of\u000athe African Commission.\u000a16. At its 28th Ordinary Session held in Cotonou, Benin, the African Commission heard both parties.\u000a17. At its 29th Ordinary Session held in Libya, the African Commission heard both parties and decided to\u000aconsolidate communications 233/99 and 234/99. The African Commission deferred consideration both\u000acommunications on the merits to the 30th Ordinary Session and invited parties to the communications\u000a233/99 and 234/99 to submit arguments for the purpose of clarifications in terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of\u000aProcedure of the African Commission:\u000a1. On the desirability or otherwise of considering the communications under the provisions of Article 47\u000ato Article 54 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on communications between\u000aStates and to follow the procedure laid down thereunder;\u000a2. On the extent to which matters covered by the complaint are the subject of the Peace Agreement\u000abetween the Government of Democratic Federal Republic of Ethiopia and the Government of State\u000aof Eritrea signed in Algiers on 12th December 2000, including the mechanism for the consideration\u000aof claims by individuals in either State whose citizenship may be in dispute Article 5(8)\u000a× Article 5.\u000a8) Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on\u000abehalf of its nationals, including both natural and juridical persons. All claims submitted to the\u000aCommission shall be filed no later than one year from the effective date of this agreement. Except\u000afor claims submitted to another mutually agreed settlement mechanism in accordance with\u000aparagraph 16 or filed in another forum prior to the effective date of this agreement, the Commission\u000ashall be the sole forum for adjudicating claims described in paragraph 1 or filed under paragraph 9\u000aof this Article, and any such claims which could have been and were not submitted by that deadline\u000ashall be extinguished, in accordance with international law.\u000a;\u000aAnd in the alternative:\u000a3. Indicate the relevance or otherwise of Article 56 (7); and\u000a4. Whether a final decision on the merits at this stage will have an impact and what effect, if any, that\u000awould have on the peace process between the two countries.\u000a18. On 18th June 2001 both parties were informed of the African Commission's decision and were invited to\u000aforward their submissions on the above-mentioned questions.\u000a19. At its 30th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission heard oral\u000asubmissions from all the parties and decided as follows :\u2022 the Governments of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea should\u000asubmit claims relating to the abovementioned communication to the Claims Commission;\u000a\u2022 that any correspondence relating to communication 233/99 and 234/99 made to the Claims\u000aCommission should be copied and forwarded to the African Commission;\u000a\u2022 to postpone further consideration on the merits of communication 233/99 and 234/99 to the 31st\u000aOrdinary Session to ascertain whether matters covered by the communication are also covered by\u000aand have been submitted to the Claims Commission.\u000a20. On 24th October 2001 the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a21. During the 31st Ordinary Session of the African Commission, Eritrea submitted a letter from the\u000aPresident of the Claims Commission. In that letter the President of the Claims Commission states to the\u000aeffect that, Eritrea and Ethiopia can provide the African Commission with copies of their statements of claim\u000aor other appropriate information relating to the Claims Commission if required by the African Commission.\u000a22. At its 31st Ordinary Session, the African Commission heard oral submissions from all the parties to the\u000acommunication and decided to defer consideration of the matter to the 32nd Session in order to allow the\u000aComplainants time to forward their written responses to the written submissions of Ethiopia.\u000a23. On 7th June 2002, all the parties to the above-mentioned communication were informed of the African\u000aCommission's decision. INTERIGHTS was requested to forward its written response to the Secretariat of\u000athe African Commission within 2 months from the date of notification.\u000a24. On 30th July 2002, INTERIGHTS was reminded that the Secretariat was awaiting to receive their written\u000asubmissions on or before the 7th August 2002. There has been no response from INTERIGHTS thus far.\u000a25. At its 32nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission heard oral submissions from the State of Eritrea\u000aand decided to defer consideration of this communication to the 33rd Ordinary Session. Parties to the\u000acommunication were informed accordingly.\u000a26. At its 33rd Ordinary Session, held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\u000adecided to suspend consideration of these communications sine die.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a27. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the Charter is governed by the\u000aconditions stipulated in Article 56 of the Charter. This Article lays down seven (7) conditions, which\u000agenerally must be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\u000a28. Of the seven conditions, the government of Ethiopia claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled\u000athree; namely Article 56 (1), (5) and (7). Additionally, it questions the neutrality, credibility and integrity of\u000athe NGOs submitting the communication.\u000a29. The State of Eritrea on its part claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled two conditions, namely\u000aArticles 56 (6) and (7).\u000a30. Article 56 (1) of the African Charter stipulates: "Communications relating to human and peoples' rights\u000areferred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (1) Indicate their authors even if the latter request\u000aanonymity."\u000a31. The government of Ethiopia submits that the Complainants being NGOs are expected to provide the\u000anames of their representatives, and since they failed to do so in their letter of August 1999 the African\u000aCommission should reject the communication.\u000a32. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia questions the neutrality, credibility and integrity of the NGOs\u000asubmitting the communications. This, the government alleges, is evidenced by the superficial treatment\u000agiven by the Complainant NGOs to the plight of thousands of Ethiopians suffering in the hands of the\u000aEritrean government whereas with respect to Eritrea, they submitted a detailed verbatim report. Ethiopia\u000athus claims that the submission on Ethiopia is only an attempt by the Complainant to give it a semblance of\u000acredibility.\u000a33. The African Commission is of the view that in terms of Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, it is enough\u000aif the said complaint bears, as in this case, the name of one of the organisation's representatives. Thus the\u000apresent complaint cannot be declared inadmissible on the basis of Article 56 (1).\u000a34. With respect to the question of the neutrality, credibility and integrity of the NGOs submitting the\u000acommunication, the African Commission does not consider this issue as one that falls within the\u000arequirement for the admissibility of the communication as stipulated under Article 56 of the Charter. In any\u000acase, the evidence before the African Commission does not lead it to uphold the submission of the\u000agovernment of Ethiopia on the credibility, neutrality and integrity of the NGOs particularly INTERIGHTS\u000awhich effectively became the Complainant.\u000a35. Article 56 (5) of the African Charter stipulates: "Communications relating to human and peoples rights\u000areferred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (5) Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any\u000aunless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a36. Regarding the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the government of Ethiopia submits that the\u000aComplainants have not availed themselves of the remedies available at the local courts before approaching\u000a3\u000a\u000athe African Commission.\u000a37. The Complainant asserts, and the African Commission is of the opinion that there were no domestic\u000aremedies available to the Complainants, as a practical matter in this case. In coming to this decision the\u000aAfrican Commission relies on its decision on the issue in communication 71/92 Rencontre africaine pour la\u000adéfense des Droits de l'Homme/Zambia, a case that involved mass deportation and transfer of multiple\u000avictims. In this case the African Commission observed: "The mass nature of the arrests, the fact that victims\u000awere kept in detention prior to their expulsion, and the speed with which the expulsions were carried out\u000agave the Complainants no opportunity to establish the legality of these actions in the courts. For\u000aComplainants to contact their families, much less attorneys was not possible. Thus the recourse referred to\u000aby the government ... was, as a practical matter, not available to the Complainants."\u000a38. The government of Eritrea alleges that the Complainant has not fulfilled the conditions stipulated under\u000aArticle 56 (6) of the African Charter. Article 56 (6) of the African Charter reads: "Communications relating to\u000ahuman and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (6) are submitted within a\u000areasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the time local remedies are\u000aexhausted or from the date the commission is seized with the matter."\u000a39. The African Commission is of the view that bearing in mind its decision in relation to Article 56 (5)\u000acompliance with the provisions of Article 56 (6) of the African Charter by the Complainant is rendered\u000ainapplicable.\u000a40. Both the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia also raise an objection to the African Commission\u000aadmitting the communications stating that the Complainants did not comply with the provisions of Article 56\u000a(7) of the African Charter.\u000a41. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, after hearing the representatives of the parties on the\u000aadmissibility of the case, the African Commission decided to declare both communications admissible.\u000a42. It is to be recalled that at its 29th Ordinary Session held in Libya, the African Commission heard oral\u000asubmissions from all the parties and decided to consolidate Communications 233/99 and 234/99. The\u000aAfrican Commission also postponed further consideration on the merits of the case to the 30th Ordinary\u000aSession and invited parties to the communication 233/99 and 234/99 to submit arguments for the purpose\u000aof clarifications in terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u000aClarifications Sought by the African Commission in Terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure\u000a\u000aThe desirability or otherwise of considering the communications under Articles 47 - 54 of the\u000aAfrican Charter\u000a43. The Respondent States argue that it is undesirable that the communications before the African\u000aCommission be converted into State-to-State proceedings. The government of Ethiopia takes this position\u000abecause the two countries, Ethiopia and Eritrea have already negotiated and signed a Peace Agreement\u000awith regard to the conflict that gave rise to the human rights violations that were committed by the\u000arespective States. Therefore the African Commission should discontinue considering the complaints before\u000ait and let the Ethio-Eritrean Claims Commission handle the matters raised within the complaints.\u000a44. The communications presently before the African Commission are governed by Articles 55 - 57 of the\u000aCharter, a category of cases clearly distinct from complaints governed by Articles 47 - 54 of the Charter.\u000aThe provisions of the African Charter and the Rules of Procedure do not provide for any procedure to\u000aconvert non-State communications into inter-state communications. The initiation of an inter-state complaint\u000ais dependent on the voluntary exercise of the sovereign will of a State party to the Charter, which decision\u000acan only be made by States in accordance with the Charter. From the submissions of the Respondent\u000aStates, the African Commission comes to the conclusion that Ethiopia and Eritrea do not wish to initiate an\u000ainter-state complaint before the African Commission; furthermore they believe that the complaint against\u000athem that is before the African Commission should be dismissed as they believe that the Ethio-Eritrean\u000aClaims Commission would be better suited to handle the matters raised in those complaints. The African\u000aCommission cannot and will therefore not consider the communication under Articles 47 - 54, a procedure\u000arelating to the consideration of inter-state communications.\u000aThe extent to which matters covered by the complaints are the subject of the Peace Agreement\u000a4\u000a\u000abetween the Governments [of] Ethiopia and Eritrea signed on 12th December 2000, including the\u000amechanism for the consideration of claims by individuals in either State whose citizenship may be\u000ain dispute (Article 5 (8)\u000a× Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on behalf of its\u000anationals, including both natural and juridical persons.

Except for claims submitted to another\u000amutually agreed settlement mechanism in accordance with paragraph 16 or filed in another forum prior to\u000athe effective date of this agreement, the Commission shall be the sole forum for adjudicating claims\u000adescribed in paragraph 1 or filed under paragraph 9 of this Article, and any such claims which could have\u000abeen and were not submitted by that deadline shall be extinguished, in accordance with international law.\u000a)\u000a45. The matters raised by the Complainants before the African Commission relate to abuse of human rights\u000aof people in violation of the provisions of the African Charter by the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea\u000aduring the period of the Ethiopia-Eritrean Conflict.\u000a46. Article 5 (1)\u000a× Article 5\u000a1. Consistent with the Framework Agreement, in which the parties commit themselves to addressing the\u000anegative socio-economic impact of the crisis on the civilian population, including the impact on those\u000apersons who have been deported, a neutral Claims Commission shall be established. The mandate of the\u000aCommission is to decide through binding arbitration all claims for loss, damage or injury by one\u000aGovernment against the other, and by nationals (including both natural and juridical persons) of one party\u000aagainst the Government of the other party or entities owned or controlled by the other party that are\u000a\u000a(a) related to the conflict that was the subject of the Framework Agreement, the Modalities for its\u000aImplementation and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and\u000a\u000a(b) result from violations of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or\u000aother violations of international law. The Commission shall not hear claims arising from the cost of military\u000aoperations, preparing for military operations, or the use of force, except to the extent that such claims\u000ainvolve violations of international humanitarian law.\u000aof the Peace Agreement between the Respondent States establishes a Claims Commission and further\u000aspells out its mandate. Article 5(1) of the Peace Agreement provides: "(1) Consistent with the Framework\u000aAgreement, in which the parties commit themselves to addressing the negative socio-economic impact of\u000athe crisis on the civilian population, including the impact on those persons who have been deported, a\u000aneutral Claims Commission shall be established. The mandate of the Commission is to decide through\u000abinding arbitration, all claims for loss, damage or injury by one Government against the other, and by\u000anationals (including both neutral and juridical persons) of one party against the Government of the other\u000aparty or entities owned or controlled by the other party that are:\u000a(a) related to the conflict that was the subject of the Framework Agreement, the Modalities for its\u000aImplementation or, Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and\u000a(b) result from violations of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or\u000aother violations of international law."\u000a47. The mechanism for considering claims brought by Ethiopia and Eritrea is governed by Article 5 (8)\u000a× Article 5.\u000a8) Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on behalf of its\u000anationals, including both natural and juridical persons. All claims submitted to the Commission shall be filed\u000ano later than one year from the effective date of this agreement. Except for claims submitted to another\u000amutually agreed settlement mechanism in accordance with paragraph 16 or filed in another forum prior to\u000a5\u000a\u000athe effective date of this agreement, the Commission shall be the sole forum for adjudicating claims\u000adescribed in paragraph 1 or filed under paragraph 9 of this Article, and any such claims which could have\u000abeen and were not submitted by that deadline shall be extinguished, in accordance with international law.\u000aof the Peace Agreement which provides: "(8) Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the\u000aparties on its own behalf and on behalf of its nationals, including both natural and juridical persons. All\u000aclaims submitted to the Commission shall be filed no later than one year from the effective date of this\u000aagreement.

As part of their submissions on the clarification sought by the African Commission, the government of\u000aEthiopia forwarded documents relating to the Claims Commission's hearings that were held from 1st to 2nd\u000aJuly 2001. During the hearings, the Claims Commission addressed itself to the nature of the claims that the\u000agovernments of Ethiopia and Eritrea will place before it. The Claims Commission was of the view that its\u000ajurisdiction under Article 5 (1)\u000a× Article 5\u000a1. Consistent with the Framework Agreement, in which the parties commit themselves to addressing the\u000anegative socio-economic impact of the crisis on the civilian population, including the impact on those\u000apersons who have been deported, a neutral Claims Commission shall be established. The mandate of the\u000aCommission is to decide through binding arbitration all claims for loss, damage or injury by one\u000aGovernment against the other, and by nationals (including both natural and juridical persons) of one party\u000aagainst the Government of the other party or entities owned or controlled by the other party that are\u000a\u000a(a) related to the conflict that was the subject of the Framework Agreement, the Modalities for its\u000aImplementation and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and\u000a\u000a(b) result from violations of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or\u000aother violations of international law. The Commission shall not hear claims arising from the cost of military\u000aoperations, preparing for military operations, or the use of force, except to the extent that such claims\u000ainvolve violations of international humanitarian law.\u000aincludes two basic types of claims. The Parties may file traditional Inter-State claims under the principles of\u000athe law of State Responsibility for injury to the Claimant State. These may include claims for injuries to the\u000aState occurring by reason of injuries to its nationals in violation of international law.\u000aOr, the Parties may choose to file the claims of individual nationals that fall within the scope of Article 5(1).\u000aThe Claims Commission is open to either approach, or to a combination of them, so long as no duplicate\u000acompensation for the same injury results.\u000a49. At the 31st Session of the African Commission, both the Respondent States asserted that they had filed\u000awith the Claims Commission, all the matters covered by communication 233/99 and 234/99.\u000a50. The government of Eritrea contended that it made claims for violations of the rights of Eritrean citizens\u000aand/or Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean ethnic origin and that these claims also constitute allegations of\u000aviolations of the African Charter and of international law (Statements of Claims Nos. 15, 16, 17, 19 and 21).\u000aThe claims include the internment without trial of civilians because of their membership in political\u000aorganisations or for reasons of their ethnicity or national origin. The government of Eritrea stated that it\u000amade claims on behalf of persons of Eritrean citizenship and/or Eritrean national origin for:\u000a\u2022 The illegal internment of civilians in concentration camps without formal accusation or trial;\u000a\u2022 The physical maltreatment and torture of such individuals;\u000a\u000a6\u000a\u000a\u2022 The discriminatory dismissals from employment, evictions from rental property, and seizure of\u000aproperty from persons of Eritrean national origin who are still present in Ethiopia.\u000a51. The government of Ethiopia also argues that the allegations presented in this communication have\u000abeen submitted to the Claims Commission. They state that in their Statement of Claim No. 5 that they\u000asubmitted before the Claims Commission, they made claims for the unlawful treatment of Ethiopian\u000anationals living in Eritrea, including arbitrary detention, mass internment, torture, abuse, murder, forced\u000adisappearances, forced conscription into the military, confiscation of property and systematic rape of\u000aEthiopian women. The Statement of Claim also includes factual representations relating to the Eritrean\u000agovernment's policy of discrimination against Ethiopians in Eritrea, including arbitrary dismissal of Ethiopian\u000anationals from public and private employment in Eritrea; Eritrea's unlawful restrictions on the freedom of\u000amovement, including exit from Eritrea and forceful expulsion of Ethiopians and unlawful and inhuman\u000aconditions during the expulsion of Ethiopian nationals from Eritrea.\u000aThe Relevance or Otherwise of Article 56 (7) of The African Charter\u000a\u000a52. Article 56 (7) of the African Charter provides: "Communication relating to human and peoples' rights\u000areferred to in Article 55 received by the Commission, shall be considered if they: (7) do not deal with cases\u000awhich have been settled by these States involved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the\u000a[UN], or the Charter of the [OAU] or the provisions of the present Charter."\u000a53. Article 56 (7) of the Charter precludes the African Commission from considering cases that have been\u000asettled by States in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the UN, or the Charter of the OAU or\u000athe provisions of the present Charter.\u000a54. The Complainant refers the African Commission to its decision in communication 59/91 Emgba\u000aMekongo Louis/Cameroon, where it held that mediation by political institutions such as the European Union\u000awas irrelevant to Article 56 (7) of the Charter. INTERIGHTS thus submits that this holding applies with\u000aequal force to the political organs of the OAU.\u000a55. The Claims Commission created by a Peace Agreement should not be viewed as a political organ of\u000athe OAU; rather it is a body that has been established under a Peace Agreement and which, under Article 5\u000a(13)\u000a× Article 5\u000a13. In considering claims, the Commission shall apply relevant rules of international law. The Commission\u000ashall not have the power to make decisions ex aequo et bono.\u000a, is bound to apply rules of international law and cannot make decisions ex aequo et bono. Indeed the\u000aClaims Commission has ruled that in dealing with evidence, they must apply evidentiary rules that prove or\u000adisprove disputed facts (see decision number 4 of the Claims Commission). The Claims Commission\u000atherefore has the capacity, unlike the African Commission to deal with complex matters such as the\u000acitizenship status of the individuals, what amount of compensation shall be awarded and to whom, in\u000arespect of the violations that they have suffered. Such was the complexity that the African Commission was\u000afaced with in Emgba Mekongo Louis/Cameroon (supra) where it found a violation of Mekongo's rights but\u000astated "that it was unable to determine their amount and the quantum should be determined under the law\u000aof Cameroon".\u000a56. In communication 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project/Nigeria, the African Commission held that it would\u000anot rely on the process or mechanism of a "discretionary, extra-ordinary ... non-judicial nature" or that "have\u000ano obligation to decide according to legal principles" to preclude the admissibility of a communication under\u000aArticle 56(7) of the African Charter. The African Commission would say that this is clearly not the case with\u000aregard to the Claims Commission as has been demonstrated by Article 5(13) of the Peace Agreement that\u000aprovides that it is bound to apply rules of international law and cannot make decisions ex aequo et bono.\u000aThis therefore puts the Claims Commission under those bodies envisaged under Article 56 (7).\u000a57. From the submissions of the Respondent States, it seems to the African Commission, that the matters\u000abrought before it, are matters that have been placed before the Claims Commission which can therefore\u000aadequately deal with such matters.\u000a58. At the 31st Ordinary Session, the Complainants requested the African Commission to defer\u000aconsideration of these communications to the 32nd Ordinary Session to enable them submit written\u000aresponses to the Respondent States' submissions. The African Commission granted the request and\u000a7\u000a\u000ainformed the parties accordingly. The Secretariat of the African Commission has written to the\u000aComplainants asking them to forward the stated written responses but there has been no reaction from\u000athem.\u000a59. In principle the appropriate remedy of those claims submitted to the Claims Commission should be\u000amonetary compensation. However, it is also within the Claims Commission's mandate to provide other\u000atypes of remedies that are acceptable within international practice. It is probable that the African\u000aCommission will reach a decision finding the Respondent States in violation of the rights of the individuals\u000aon whose behalf INTERIGHTS is acting. However, as was the case in Emgba Mekongo Louis/Cameroon\u000a(supra), the African Commission would certainly be constrained in awarding compensation and may have\u000ato refer this matter to the Claims Commission and at which point the matter would certainly be time barred.\u000a60. While the African Commission would have opted to proceed and deal with the instant communications,\u000athe Respondent States Parties have assured the African Commission that all the issues before the African\u000aCommission will be brought before the Claims Commission.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the African Commission decides as follows:\u000a\u2022 to suspend consideration of communication 233/99 and 234/99 sine die, and await the decision of\u000athe Claims Commission with regard to matters contained in this communication;\u000a\u2022 that the Respondent States keep the African Commission regularly informed of the process before\u000athe Claims Commission with particular reference to the matters contained in these communications;\u000a\u2022 the Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea are requested to transmit a copy of the text of the\u000adecision of the Claims Commission to the Secretariat of the African Commission as soon as it is\u000adelivered;\u000a\u2022 in the event that the Claims Commission does not fully address the human rights violations\u000acontained herein, to reopen the matter for consideration;\u000a\u2022 reserves its decision on the merits of these communications.\u000a\u000aTaken at the 33rd Ordinary Session in Niamey, Niger May 2003.\u000a\u000a8\u000a\u000a

aV235/00 Curtis Francis Doebbler / Sudan\u000aSummary of Alleged Facts\u000a1. The Complainant represents 14,000 Ethiopian refugees who fled Ethiopia prior to 1991 during the\u000aMengistu regime and lived in Sudan and were a subject of forced repatriation pursuant to a decision\u000aadopted by the Respondent State and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in\u000aSeptember 1999. The Complainant states that during the 1980s and early 1990s an estimated 80,000\u000aEthiopians entered Sudan fleeing from persecution and from events disturbing public order in Ethiopia.\u000a2. The Complainant alleges that the current Government in Ethiopia was formed by officials of the Tigrayan\u000aPeople's Liberation Front (TPLF) party, who were allies with the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party\u000a(EPRF) during the struggle against the Mengistu regime. The supporters of the EPRP are allegedly the\u000amain target of repression by the Ethiopian government throughout the country.\u000a3. The Complainant alleges that all Ethiopian refugees in Sudan were previously granted asylum by the\u000aGovernment of Sudan in accordance with its international obligations. The United Nations High\u000aCommissioner for Refugees, the agency responsible for the protection of refugees worldwide, also\u000ahonoured this recognition until September 1999.\u000a4. The Complainant alleges that in September 1999, the Government of Sudan signed an agreement with\u000athe UNHCR to invoke the Cessation Clauses Article 1(C) (5)\u000a× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\u000alonger, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\u000aceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\u000aProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\u000ato invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\u000aprotection of the country of nationality; http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html accessed 25.10.2010\u000aof the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees with effect from 1st March 2000.\u000a5. The Complainant alleges that by this agreement, Ethiopian refugees in Sudan would lose their right to\u000awork or receive any social assistance as a way of coercing them into forced repatriation back to Ethiopia.\u000a6. The Complainant states that in February 2000, a notice was posted on the door of the UNHCR\u000acompound in Khartoum, Sudan, entitled "Information Announcement to the Ethiopian Refugees in\u000aSudan"and stated in part:\u000aThe Government of Sudan represented by the Commission for Refugees (COR) and the United Nations\u000aHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would like to inform all Ethiopian Refugees in Sudan of the\u000afollowing:\u000aAll Ethiopian Refugees outside Ethiopia after 1st March 2000 will lose their legal refugee status. This means\u000aall the legal rights granted by international, regional and local regulations which guarantee refugees status\u000aor condition as stipulated in the 1951 Geneva convention generally governing that status and treatment of\u000arefugees etc..., the legal status in respect of resolving individual cases and the right to appear before the\u000acourts etc..., the right to acquire employment and the guarantees, the issue of comprehensive guidance\u000aand supply of shelter, health and treatment, education, food, social security, etc ...and in conclusion, the\u000avarious administrative assistance, and permits like travel permits, employment permits, driving licences,\u000aidentity cards, residence and travel documents for travelling abroad and commercial licences etc...; all will\u000acease to exist forthwith. ... In light of this new situation, any Ethiopian refugee who decides to remain in the\u000aSudan after 1st March 2000 will bear full responsibility of the consequences which may follow as the result\u000aof the forfeiture of his entitlements which he used to enjoy as a refugee before 1st March 2000. ... To avoid\u000aunnecessary problems, which will occur as a result of your illegal stay in the Sudan after 1st March 2000,\u000awe request you to seriously consider the circumstances which will assist you in taking a reasonable\u000adecision to guarantee your safety and that of the future of your family.\u000a7. The Complainant states that although the Government had only agreed to withdraw refugee status,\u000adozens of refugees reported that the UNHCR informed them that they would be deported after 1st March\u000a2000 and that any benefits that they were receiving would cease. Furthermore, some of the refugees were\u000aarrested, beaten, and further mistreated as a consequence of their protests against their involuntary\u000arepatriation.\u000a1\u000a\u000a8. The Complainant states that the Respondent State, the UNHCR and the Government of Ethiopia entered\u000ainto an agreement to forcibly repatriate them. This action consisted of several steps, including all of the\u000afollowing: the withholding of social welfare benefits such a medical attention, food, clothing, and housing\u000aentitlements; and the implementation of an unfair screening procedure.\u000a9. The Complainant states that some of the refugees who protested the removal of their refugee status\u000awere sometimes arrested and deported or threatened with arrest and deportation, forcing many of them to\u000aflee to neighbouring countries.\u000a10. The Complainant further alleges that at the time, Ethiopia was involved in a full-scale international\u000aarmed conflict with its neighbour Eritrea.\u000a11. The Complainant states that the UNHCR and the Respondent State agreed bi-laterally to establish a\u000ascreening procedure. The Complainant alleges that this procedure did not provide the basic minimum\u000astandards of due process. For example, the refugees were not allowed to be legally represented; the\u000aGovernment of Sudan and/or the UNHCR recruited unqualified persons to do the screening. The screening\u000adid not take into account the 1969 African Refugee Convention or the African Charter in their evaluation of\u000aindividual cases; the screenings did not start until months after the threat of forcible refoulement had been\u000amade, and implemented in large parts. Interpreters were recruited from the Ethiopian Embassy in Khartoum\u000a- the embassy of the State from which they harboured or had a recognised, well-founded fear of\u000apersecution.\u000a12. The Complainant states that some of the refugees had lived and settled in Sudan for up to thirty years;\u000athat many of them are opponents of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and\u000athe Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), ruling the country since 1991. The Complainant states that\u000amany refugees feared that they would be sent to the Ethiopia/Eritrea warfront, due to the war which was\u000aongoing during the whole of 2000 or that they would be mistreated or even killed by the Ethiopian\u000aGovernment.\u000a13. The Complainant states that some of the refugees, such as Mr Luel Kassa, who was forced to return in\u000aearly 2001, were arrested upon return; and others fled Ethiopia again to Sudan or a third country as soon\u000aas they were able to.\u000a14. The Complainant states further that many of the estimated 14,000 Ethiopian refugees who are still living\u000ain Sudan do not wish to return to Ethiopia because they have a well-founded fear of persecution or because\u000athey are fleeing the war and famine in Ethiopia.\u000a15. The Complainant states that in March 2001, more than 1,700 Ethiopian refugees in Port Sudan and\u000aKhartoum staged a hunger strike to protest their return. Their main complaint: the unfair process for\u000adetermining their status.\u000a16. Since March 2001, the Complainant has contacted the Government of Sudan and the UNHCR in an\u000aeffort to resolve this matter, but without success.\u000a17. The Complainant states that although some refugees were allowed to stay in Sudan, others remained\u000awithout the consent of the Government of Sudan and feared the prospect of immediate deportation without\u000adue process of law. The Complainant further alleges that many of these refugees live in inhuman conditions\u000aafter being denied the basic necessities of life.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a18. The Complainant alleges violations of Articles 4, 5, 6, 12(3), (4) and (5) of the African Charter on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights (African Charter).\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a19. The complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 22 February 2000.\u000a20. At the 27th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2000 in Algiers, Algeria, the African\u000aCommission decided to be seized of the communication and requested the parties to address it on the\u000aexhaustion of domestic remedies.\u000a21. The above decision was communicated to the parties on 30 June 2000.\u000a22. At its 28th Ordinary Session held from 23 October to 6 November 2000 in Cotonou, Benin, the African\u000aCommission decided to defer consideration of this communication to the 29th Ordinary Session.\u000a23. On 13th March 2001, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submissions on admissibility.\u000a2\u000a\u000a24. At the 29th Ordinary Session held from 23rd April to 7th May 2001 in Tripoli, Libya, the Respondent State\u000ainformed the African Commission that they were not aware of communications 235/00 and 236/00 submitted by Dr Curtis Doebbler against Sudan. During the Session, the Secretariat provided the\u000aRespondent State with copies of the said communications. The African Commission decided to defer\u000aconsideration of these communications to the next session.\u000a25. On 19th June 2001, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the decision of\u000athe African Commission and requested the Respondent State to forward its written submissions within two\u000a(2) months from the date of notification of this decision.\u000a26. On 14th August 2001, a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within\u000athe prescribed time to enable the Secretariat to process the Communication.\u000a27. During the 30th Ordinary Session held from 13th to 27th October 2001 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aSecretariat of the African Commission received the Respondent State's written submissions in Arabic on all\u000apending communications against it on admissibility.\u000a28. During the same Session, the African Commission heard the oral submissions of the parties with\u000arespect to the communication. The African Commission noted that the Respondent State had not\u000aresponded to the issues raised by the Complainant. The African Commission therefore decided to defer the\u000acommunication to the 31st Session, pending receipt of detailed written submissions from the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a29. On 15th November 2001, the Secretariat informed the parties of the decision and requested the\u000aRespondent State to forward its written submissions on the issues raised by the Complainant within two (2)\u000amonths from the date of notification of this decision.\u000a30. On 7th March 2002, a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within the\u000aprescribed time.\u000a31. At its 31st Ordinary Session held from 2nd to 16th May 2002, in Pretoria, South Africa, upon the request\u000aof the Complainant, the African Commission decided to suspend consideration of this communication in\u000aorder to allow the parties to pursue an amicable settlement.\u000a32. On 29th May 2002, the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\u000a33. On 17th August 2002, the Complainant informed the Secretariat that he had written to the Respondent\u000aState with a view to negotiating an amicable settlement. However, he had not received any response from\u000athe Government of Sudan.\u000a34. On 16th January 2003, the Secretariat received a request from the Complainant for a hearing on\u000aadmissibility. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of this correspondence on 27th January 2003.\u000a35. The Secretariat informed both parties that the admissibility of the communication would be considered\u000aat the 33rd Ordinary Session.\u000a36. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\u000adeferred its decision on admissibility to allow the parties more time to send their written submissions on\u000aadmissibility.\u000a37. On 18th June 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed both parties of the\u000aabove-mentioned decision and requested them to forward their written submissions on admissibility within\u000athree (3) months from the date of notification of this decision.\u000a38. On 18th September 2003, the Secretariat reminded the parties to provide the African Commission with\u000atheir submissions on admissibility.\u000a39. By letter dated 19 September 2003, the Complainant forwarded a brief on admissibility concerning the\u000aexhaustion of domestic remedies.\u000a40. By a Note Verbale dated 30th September 2003, the Respondent State was informed that the\u000acommunication would be considered at the 34th Ordinary Session. The arguments of the Complainant were\u000aattached to the Note Verbale.\u000a41. During its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul from 6th to 20th November 2003, the African Commission\u000aconsidered the Respondent State's arguments on admissibility and declared the communication\u000ainadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\u000a42. On 4th December 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission transmitted the decision to the\u000aparties.\u000a43. On 10th February 2004, the Complainant requested the African Commission to reconsider its decision\u000aon admissibility and requested an oral hearing at the next Ordinary Session.\u000a44. During the 35th Ordinary Session, the Commission considered the request to reconsider its decision on\u000aadmissibility, and deferred it to the 36th Ordinary Session. The Commission requested the Secretariat to\u000a3\u000a\u000ainform both parties of the decision and deferred consideration of the matter to the 37th Ordinary Session.\u000aThe same decision was communicated to the parties. The Secretariat requested them to submit additional\u000aarguments on admissibility. A copy of the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the Respondent State,\u000awhich was duly requested to forward its response.\u000a45. On 25th October 2005, the African Commission informed the Complainant of its decision to grant him an\u000aopportunity to argue for the re-opening of the communication at its 36th Session.\u000a46. At the 36th Ordinary Session, the African Commission, upon consideration of the arguments put forward\u000aby the Complainant in his "Brief on the Issue of Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies", decided to reconsider\u000aits decision adopted during the 34th Ordinary Session, at its 37th session.\u000a47. On 14th March 2005 the parties were informed about the decision of the African Commission and a\u000acopy of the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the Respondent State, which was duly requested to\u000aforward its response.\u000a48. During the 37th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission decided to defer reconsideration of the admissibility to the next session.\u000a49. On 28th June 2005, both the Complainant and the Respondent State were informed of the decision. The\u000aRespondent State was also reminded to forward its written submissions on admissibility within two (2)\u000amonths from the date of notification of this decision.\u000a50. At the 38th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21st November to 5th December 2005,\u000athe Respondent State submitted written arguments on admissibility. The African Commission deferred\u000areconsideration of the admissibility of the communication to its 39th Ordinary Session.\u000a51. On 16th December 2005, the Secretariat informed the parties of the decision. A copy of the Respondent\u000aState's arguments was sent to the Complainant.\u000a52. On 8th March 2006, the Secretariat received from the Respondent State a copy of the minutes of an\u000aAugust 2000 meeting between the Government of Sudan, the Government of Ethiopia and the UNHCR. A\u000acopy of the latter documents was transmitted to the Complainant.\u000a53. On 23rd March 2006, the Secretariat received a response to the Respondent State's submissions of 3rd\u000aDecember 2005. The document was duly transmitted to the Respondent State.\u000a54. At the 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, the Gambia from 9th to 23rd May 2006, the African\u000aCommission reconsidered its decision on admissibility and declared that the communication was\u000aadmissible.\u000a55. By a Note Verbale of 14th July 2006, to the Secretariat informed both parties of the aforementioned\u000adecision and requested them to submit their arguments on the merits within two (2) months.\u000a56. On 18th September 2006, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant, requesting that the\u000adeadline for submission of arguments on the merits be extended by six (6) months, as the Complainant had\u000abeen unable to contact the Secretariat.\u000a57. On 16th October 2006, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the letter from the Complainant, and\u000areminded both parties to submit their arguments on the merits by the end of October 2006.\u000a58. On 11th April 2007, the Secretariat received the arguments on merits from the Complainant.\u000a59. On 25th April 2007, the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's submissions\u000aand reminded the Respondent State to submit its arguments on the merits by 10th May 2007.\u000a60. On 20th June 2007, the Secretariat sent a Note Verbale to the Respondent State reminding the\u000aRespondent State that the African Commission intended to consider the communication on the merits\u000aduring the 42nd Ordinary Session and requested it to forward its arguments on the merits by the end of July\u000a2007.\u000a61. On 6th June 2007, the Secretariat informed the Complainant that the Respondent State had yet to\u000asubmit its arguments on the Merits.\u000a62. By a Note Verbale of 30th October 2007, the Respondent State was reminded to submit its argumemts\u000aon the Merits before the commencement of the 42nd Ordinary Session in Congo, Brazzaville.\u000a63. On 3rd November 2007, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the Respondent State that\u000ait had not yet received its submission on the merits.\u000a64. On 23rd November 2007, during the 42nd Ordinary Session, the Respondent State submitted its\u000aarguments on the merits. The arguments were in Arabic. During the 42nd Session the African Commission\u000adeferred consideration of the communication on the merits in order to allow for translation of the\u000aRespondent State's submissions.\u000a65. On 27th December 2007, the Secretariat informed the parties of its decision to defer the communication.\u000aIt acknowledged receipt of the State Party's brief on the merits, and also forwarded it to the Complainant.\u000a4\u000a\u000a66. At the 43rd Ordinary Session, which took place from 7th to 22nd May 2008 in Ezulwini, Swaziland, the\u000aAfrican Commission deferred the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session, to give the Secretariat\u000aenough time to prepare the draft decision on the merits.\u000a67. On 2nd June 20008, the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\u000a68. During the 44th Session held in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria, the African Commission considered\u000athe communication and decided to defer it to the 45th session in order to finalise its decision on the merits.\u000a69. By letter and Note Verbale of 23rd January 2009, both the Respondent State and the Complainant were\u000ainformed of the decision of the Commission.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a70. The African Commission recalls that it declared the communication inadmissible during the 34th\u000aOrdinary Session of the Commission. The Complainant filed a request for the reopening of the case during\u000athe 35th Ordinary Session. This request was considered during the 36th Ordinary Session.\u000a71. When declaring the communication inadmissible, the African Commission stated the following: Although\u000athe parties have not provided the African Commission in writing with further written submissions on the\u000aissue of local remedies, the African Commission is in a position to rule on the admissibility of this\u000acommunication by making reference to the written submissions of the Complainant (received on 13th March\u000a2001) and those of the Respondent State (received during the 30th Ordinary session) as well as the oral\u000asubmissions submitted by both parties during the 33rd Ordinary Session.\u000a72. The Complainant alleges that there were no effective local remedies against the Government's threat to\u000aforcibly repatriate the Ethiopian refugees. The refugees had been denied the right to legal representation\u000aduring the hearings that were aimed at determining whether there was any risk if they returned to Ethiopia\u000ato be tortured or be subjected to inhuman, degrading and cruel treatment.\u000a73. The Complainant submits that the procedure for repatriation agreed to by the UNHCR and Sudan was\u000aunacceptable for the following reasons: firstly, the Ethiopian refugees were given no opportunity to make\u000arepresentations during the decision - making process, despite public announcements to this effect.\u000aSecondly, most of the interpreters/translators were taken from the Ethiopian Embassy, the country from\u000awhich the refugees were fleeing and they could therefore have been biased or prejudiced.\u000a74. The Complainant adds that the Respondent State denied visas to the legal representatives of the\u000arefugees. By failing to ensure that the refugees were given a fair hearing in matters concerning their human\u000arights under the African Charter, the Respondent State had by doing so denied them the right to access\u000alocal effective remedies.\u000a75. The Respondent State argued that there had been no complaint against illegal or forced repatriation of\u000aEthiopians, and that this communication does not contain any concrete indication in this regard. The\u000aRespondent State acknowledges that it understood the situation in Ethiopia was not favourable to those\u000awho feared persecution in their country of origin, but reassured the African Commission that every\u000arepatriation procedure in this case followed the principle of the Convention signed between Sudan,\u000aEthiopia, and the UNHCR.\u000a76. Furthermore, the Respondent State submitted that the Complainant neither approached the UNHCR\u000anor any Court or administrative body to rule on any allegations of violation committed during the process of\u000arepatriation. The Complainant could have submitted an administrative application or referred the matter to\u000athe competent courts available in Sudan.\u000a77. The Respondent State informed the African Commission that Article 20 of the 1996 Code of\u000aAdministrative Courts gives the Complainant the right to lodge an appeal against any administrative\u000adecision. An appeal could have been lodged in the Supreme Court against any administrative decision\u000ataken by the President of the Republic, the Federal Council of Ministers, the Government of any region or\u000aFederal or Regional Minister. The African Commission notes that the Complainant in this communication\u000amakes no mention of any attempt on his part to access the available local remedies in the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a78. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares that communication inadmissible for\u000anon-exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a\u000a5\u000a\u000aCommission's Decision on Review\u000a\u000a79. The Commission accepted the Complainant's request to reconsider its decision on the basis of the\u000asubmission by the Complainant that the Commission had not addressed itself to its jurisprudence,\u000aregarding the exceptions to the exhaustion of local remedies rule, in particular the non-applicability of\u000adomestic remedies to situations of massive violation of human rights, as is alleged in this instance.\u000a80. The Commission reconsidered its decision under Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of\u000aProcedure. Rule 118(2) reads as follows: If the Commission has declared a communication inadmissible\u000aunder the Charter, it may reconsider this decision at a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration.\u000a81. Rule 118(2) does not stipulate the conditions under which the Commission may reconsider its previous\u000adecision. The Commission may exercise its discretionary powers to reconsider its decision upon a party\u000amoving it, and adducing compelling reasons. The Commission is called upon at all times to protect human\u000aand peoples' rights. A decision to reconsider its decision must be aimed at protecting human and peoples'\u000arights.\u000a82. Further to that general principle, a party seeking the reconsideration or review of a decision must show\u000athat the Commission failed to take into account the criteria set out in Article 56 of the Charter, or it erred in\u000areaching the decision it did. The review must be based on the same facts as was initially before the\u000aCommission. A party cannot introduce new facts or information at the review stage.\u000a83. The Commission has in the past, based on its jurisprudence, held that the requirement of exhaustion of\u000alocal remedies does not hold ".... where it is impractical or undesirable for the Complainants or victim to\u000aseize the domestic courts."1\u000a84. Based on the above reasons the Commission reconsidered and departed from its previous decision\u000aand considered the parties' submissions on admissibility.\u000aDecision on admissibility\u000a\u000a85. The admissibility of the communications submitted under the African Charter is governed by Article 56\u000aof the African Charter. Of the seven conditions stipulated by this article, six have been met. The seventh\u000awhich is Article 56(5), stipulates that:\u000acommunications shall be considered if they [quote]"are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless\u000ait is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged... .\u000a86. The Respondent State claims that the Complainant did not exhaust local remedies. It stressed that the\u000aComplainant had the right to lodge an appeal against any administrative decision in accordance with Article\u000a20 of the 1996 Code of Administrative Courts, and they could lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court\u000aagainst any administrative decision taken by the President of the Republic, the Federal Council of\u000aMinisters, the Government of any region or to the Federal or Regional Minister.\u000a87. The Complainant submits that the African Commission has held that "the rule of exhausting domestic\u000aremedies is the most important condition for admissibility of Communications. There is no doubt therefore,\u000ain all communications seized by the African Commission, the first requirement considered concerns the\u000aexhausting of local remedies...."2 The Complainant argues that the reason for this rule has been defined by\u000athe Commission as a two-fold test. First, it is to give domestic courts an opportunity to decide upon cases\u000abefore they are brought to an international forum. If a right is not well provided for at the domestic level,\u000athere cannot be effective remedies at all.3\u000a88. Second, the Complainant states that the Respondent State should have notice of a human rights\u000aviolation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation before submitting them to an international\u000atribunal.4 The Complainant submits that the Respondent State was aware of the refugees' situation for\u000ayears and did not act to protect them. The Complainant alleges that there can be no doubt that the\u000aRespondent State Government had been put on notice of the situation giving rise to this communication.\u000aSuch notice was given by the refugees themselves communicating with the Government; the\u000acommunications of the refugees' legal representatives with the Government and coverage of the plight of\u000athe refugees by the news media.\u000a89. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State responded to these communications by denying\u000aany responsibility for the plight of the refugees. The Complainant states that, because of the serious\u000aviolations of human rights that have occurred, the requirement that the refugees resort to domestic\u000aremedies should be deemed waived and the Commission should consider the merits of this\u000a6\u000a\u000acommunication.\u000a90. The Complainant claims that when interpreting Article 56(5) of the Charter, the African Commission\u000ashould take into consideration generally recognised principles of international law in the interest of ensuring\u000athe protection of human rights.5\u000a91. The Complainant submits that the Commission has unequivocally held that when a Respondent State\u000araises the defence of non exhaustion of local remedies, it must discharge the burden by demonstrating the\u000aexistence of such remedies."6\u000a92. The Complainant urges the African Commission to draw inspiration from regional and international\u000ahuman rights mechanisms on this issue. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has repeatedly\u000aaffirmed that a state has duties "to organise the governmental apparatus and, in general, all the structures\u000athrough which public power is exercised, so that they are capable of judicially ensuring the free and full\u000aenjoyment of human rights." 7 The Court held that "the State claiming non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\u000ahas an obligation to prove that the domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and that they are effective."8\u000a93. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressly stated that the burden of proving that\u000aeffective local remedies exist and that they had not been exhausted fell upon the government making such\u000aa claim.9\u000a94. A similar view regarding the burden of proof was taken by the United Nations Human Rights Committee\u000awhereby a Respondent State "...had failed to provide.... sufficient information on effective remedies."10\u000aEqually, the European Court and Commission of Human Rights have held that the government shoulders\u000athe burden of proving that there are effective remedies.\u000a95. Similarly, the Grand Chamber of the European Court for Human Rights has expressed the opinion that\u000a"it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to satisfy the Court that\u000athe remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time."11 The Court\u000acontinued:" ...that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in\u000arespect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success."12 Only once this\u000aburden of proof has been met does the petitioner have to establish that the local remedy "was in fact\u000aexhausted or for some reason inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances."13\u000a96. The Complainant urges the Commission to apply the standards articulated above, which require the\u000aRespondent State to prove that effective local remedies exist in Sudan and that they are reasonably\u000aaccessible. The Complainant submits further that it is evident that the Respondent State has not met this\u000aburden of proof. It has not shown that the refugees had adequate and effective remedies. The Government\u000ahad itself prevented refugees accessing any remedies - irrespective of their effectiveness and adequacy that it alleges are available.\u000a97. The Complainant submits that communication 235/00 involves massive and serious violations of human\u000arights. He states that the African Commission has found that actions threatening the life and welfare of less\u000athan a thousand people amount to serious and massive violations of human rights.14\u000a98. The Complainant alleges that the present communication involves more than fourteen thousand\u000a(14,000) Ethiopian Refugees, whose daily survival is threatened and who cannot approach the authorities\u000afor fear that their refugee identity documents would be confiscated and they would be deported without the\u000adue process of law.\u000a99. The Complainant states that the Respondent State has suggested that the refugees could have\u000atheoretically relied on Administrative and Constitutional procedures in "Article 20 of the 1996 Constitutional\u000aand Administrative code, and in accordance with Article 120 (2)(b) of the Constitution." The Complainant\u000aalleges that this would not have been an adequate remedy because the Judiciary in Sudan is not\u000aindependent.\u000a100. The Complainant points to the fact that the Commission noted that the Respondent State had\u000adismissed over 100 judges when it came to power approximately twelve years earlier.15 The Complainant\u000afurther alleges that since 1989, the appointment of Judges is done in close coordination with the President.\u000aThe Complainant goes on to state that the 1998 Constitution of Sudan intentionally enhanced the powers of\u000athe President.16\u000a101. The Complainant alleges that on 12th December 1999, the President declared a State of Emergency\u000aand prolonged his control over the Judiciary until 2001. Cases brought to the Court challenging this\u000adeclaration of emergency have been dismissed with little or no attention to international human rights law.\u000aInstead the Courts have relied on vague references to customary presidential powers that override the\u000aclear words of the Constitution.17 The Complainant concludes that the Sudanese Courts have been under\u000athe control of the Sudanese Executive since 1989, and that an independent judiciary does not exist in\u000a7\u000a\u000aSudan.\u000a102. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has no system in place that can protect human\u000arights in the overwhelming majority of cases. He points to examples of Amal Aba al-Ajab v. Government of\u000aSudan case in which the Court refused to apply international human rights law.18 He also points to a similar\u000asituation in the case of Abdelraham et al v. Sudan, Case No. 7/98 of 13th August 1998. 19\u000a103. The Complainant submits that the lack of independence of the judiciary is the result of several steps\u000ataken by the Sudanese Government since it came to power in 1989. He cites the reports of Mr Leonard\u000aFranco, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan as well as numerous\u000anon-governmental organisations to demonstrate the lack of independence of the judiciary in Sudan.20\u000a104. The Complainant argues that although a new Constitution was adopted on 1st July 1998, the\u000aExecutive still exercises broad powers over the Judiciary: Section 5 of the Constitutional decree 13/1995,\u000aentitled 'Powers of the President' provides that ... "the President shall be the Guardian of the Judiciary and\u000athe Council of Justice in accordance with the Constitution and the Law" , ... "A Judge shall be guided by the\u000aconcept of supremacy of the Constitution, Law and general guidance of Sharia." Section 61 (1-3) provides\u000athat: "The Judiciary is responsible before the President for the performance of its functions effectively and\u000ahonestly for the prevalence of justice; its function is to adjudicate fairly in constitutional, administrative,\u000afamily, civil and criminal disputes and to exercise its judgment in accordance with the law."\u000a105. The Complainant alleges that Sudan is ruled under a State of Emergency whereby the president\u000aexercises almost complete control over the executive, legislative and judicial functions. The Complainant\u000aalleges further that for the foregoing reasons, no adequate and effective remedies exist in Sudan that the\u000arefugees should be required to exhaust.\u000a106. The Complainant submits that in the present case, the Respondent State has repeatedly denied the\u000avictims access to their legal representative, Dr Curtis F. J. Doebbler, by repeatedly refusing to grant him a\u000avisa to enter the country. The Government has also failed to make facilities available to the refugees, even\u000awhen they are in custody, to contact their legal representative.\u000a107. The Complainant rejected the submission by the Respondent State that redress by way of an appeal\u000ato the UNHCR or an appeal to the Sudanese Courts was available to the refugees.\u000a108. He submitted that neither of these means of redress was adequate. An appeal to the UNHCR was\u000aineffective because the refugees were denied legal representation. He argues that UNHCR decision\u000amakers refused to apply the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the 1969 OAU Convention\u000aGoverning the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa. Secondly, appeals to the Sudanese\u000aCourts were not possible, because there was no decision made by a Sudanese administrative body.\u000a109. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent State denied responsibility for the protection of\u000aEthiopian refugees under its jurisdiction.\u000a110. The Complainant stated that the Sudanese Government's position is in contrast to the position\u000aexpressed by the Commission, that: "the Charter specifies in Article 1 that the State Parties shall not only\u000arecognise the rights, duties and freedoms adopted by the Charter, but they should also\u000a"undertake.....measures to give effect to them." Therefore, if a State neglects to ensure the rights in the\u000aAfrican Charter, this can constitute a violation, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause\u000aof the violation.21\u000a111. The Complainant submitted further that the process offered by the UNHCR was flawed in several\u000aserious matters. Despite repeated requests to represent the refugees in procedures before the UNHCR, the\u000arefugees were denied the right to legal representation.\u000a112. The UNHCR recruited translators from the Ethiopian Embassy in Sudan to interview the\u000aComplainants. Because the procedures applied by UNHCR, did not apply the most basic standards of due\u000aprocess, it cannot be considered effective or adequate for protecting the rights of the refugees that are\u000aguaranteed in the African Charter.\u000a113. Moreover, the Complainant submitted that the right to appeal from procedures that do not meet the\u000astandards of due process is illusionary and cannot be deemed an effective remedy. The refugees could not\u000aappeal a decision by the UNHCR to the Sudanese administrative bodies. Only administrative decisions\u000amade by Sudanese Government authorities may be appealed. The Government of Sudan itself admitted\u000athat it had nothing to do with the decision of the UNHCR. Consequently, there was no domestic remedy\u000athat could adequately and effectively protect the victims' human rights.\u000a114. The Respondent State reiterated its position that the Complainant neither approached the UNHCR nor\u000aany court or administrative body to denounce the alleged violation of the rights of pre-1991 Ethiopian\u000arefugees. The Respondent State stressed that the Complainant could have challenged the manner in which\u000a8\u000a\u000athe repatriation exercise was carried out by lodging an appeal to the Supreme Court in accordance with\u000aArticle 20 of the 1996 Code of Administrative Courts. Article 20 of the Code provides that anyone can lodge\u000aan appeal to the Supreme Court against any administrative decision taken by the President of the Republic,\u000athe Federal Council of Ministers, the Government of any region or Federal or Regional Minister.\u000a115. The Respondent State added that the Complainant did not cite any case of refugees who had been\u000aillegally or forcibly returned to Ethiopia. The Respondent State acknowledged that the situation prevailing in\u000aEthiopia in March 2000 was not favourable to the repatriation of those refugees fearing persecution in their\u000acountry of origin. It stated however that the repatriation process followed the principles laid down in the\u000aTrilateral Agreement signed between the Government of Sudan, the Government of Ethiopia and the\u000aUNHCR in August 2000.\u000a116. The African Commission is of the view that, even if certain domestic remedies were available, it was\u000anot reasonable to expect refugees to seize the Sudanese Courts of their complaints, given their extreme\u000avulnerability and state of deprivation, their fear of being deported and their lack of adequate means to seek\u000alegal representation. The Commission notes that the refugees' legal representative was repeatedly denied\u000aentry into the country by the Respondent State's authorities.\u000a117. Furthermore, even accepting the argument of the Respondent State that the refugees could have\u000achallenged the decision to repatriate them before the Administrative Courts or appealed to the Supreme\u000aCourt, the Commission holds the view, which it has stated oftentimes before, that where the violations\u000ainvolve many victims, it becomes neither practical nor desirable for the Complainants or the victims to\u000apursue such internal remedies in every case of violation of human rights.22\u000aFor all these reasons, the African Commission declares this communication admissible.\u000aConsideration of Merits\u000a118. The present communication alleges that the Respondent State has violated the human rights of an\u000aestimated fourteen thousand Ethiopian refugees, following the invocation by the UNHCR of the Cessation\u000aClause under Article 1(C)(5)\u000a× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\u000alonger, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\u000aceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\u000aProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\u000ato invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\u000aprotection of the country of nationality(http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html accessed 25.10.2010)\u000aof the 1951 United Nations Refugees Convention.\u000aComplainant's submission on the Merits\u000a\u000a119. The Complainant states that sometime in September 1999, the Respondent State and the UNHCR\u000aconcluded an agreement, which inter alia stipulated that by 1st March 2000 Ethiopian refugees in Sudan\u000awould lose their right to work or receive any social assistance as a way of coercing them into forced\u000arepatriation.\u000a120. The Complainant states that the said refugees were subsequently repatriated involuntarily to Ethiopia,\u000aor were threatened with arrest or involuntary repatriation by the Respondent State upon protesting the\u000arepatriation. Others were forced to leave Sudan for third countries.\u000a121. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State violated Articles 4, 5, 6, 12(3), (4), and (5) of the\u000aAfrican Charter as a result of the failure to protect the Ethiopian refugees against the involuntary\u000arepatriation, and from threats of arrest. He states further that by failing to protect the refugees, it forced\u000athem to live under inhumane conditions, without the basic necessities of life. The Complainant is alleging\u000athat the Ethiopians are de facto refugees, and thus protected by Articles 12 of the African Charter of Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights.\u000a122. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has an obligation to ensure respect for the right\u000a9\u000a\u000ato life, the right to humane treatment and the right to security of person for every individual under its\u000ajurisdiction. It also has an obligation under Articles 7 of the African Charter, which requires that every\u000aindividual has a right to a fair determination of his human rights as protected in the Charter.\u000a123. The Complainant draws the attention of the African Commission to Articles 60 of the Charter, to draw\u000ainspiration from the UN Convention on Refugees of 195123 and the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the\u000aSpecific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, instruments which the Respondent State has signed and\u000aratified24 when determining the meaning of the above articles in the Charter in relation to those instruments.\u000a124. The Complainant argues that since the African Charter is a treaty that is later in time, than either the\u000aUN Refugees Convention, or the African refugees convention, the general principle of international law to\u000abe applied to resolve any conflict between treaties is that the latter treaty prevails over the former treaty that\u000aare not compatible. The Complainant relies on Article 30(3)\u000a× When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not\u000aterminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its\u000aprovisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\u000aof the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 25 which states that "the earlier treaty applies only to the\u000aextent that its provisions are compatible with those of the latter treaty." He argues that by applying this\u000aprinciple, any provisions of the UN refugees convention that are incompatible with either the African\u000arefugee convention or the Charter must be deemed to be overridden by these latter two instruments.\u000a125. The Commission wishes to state that it does not find any conflict or incompatibility between the African\u000aCharter and the two refugees' convention, or between the UN and the OAU refugees conventions. The\u000a1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa 1969 OAU\u000aConvention stipulates that it is a complement to the 1951 UN Refugees Convention. Paragraph 9 of its\u000apreamble recognises the 1951 UN Convention and the 1967 Protocol as the basic and universal\u000ainstruments relating to the status of refugees. Article VIII of the OAU Convention enjoins Member States to\u000acooperate with the UNHCR, and states further that the OAU Convention is a regional complement to the\u000a1951 UN Convention.\u000a126. In that respect the Commission shall read the provisions of the three instruments as complementing\u000aeach other. The Complainant's argument that the provisions of the latter convention prevail over the former\u000ado not in any way affect the interpretation the Commission will give to the applicable provisions, should it be\u000anecessary to do so under this communication. This is because the provisions are at most complementary to\u000aeach other and not mutually exclusive.\u000a127. Concerning the said violations, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State did not deny the\u000afacts as presented; rather it has merely alleged that the problem is the responsibility of the UNHCR. He\u000astates that both the Government of Sudan and the UNHCR recognised all of the refugees in the 1990s. The\u000aComplainant states that while the Respondent State claims that the refugees no longer need protection, the\u000arefugees, nevertheless, refute this claim. He argues that the refugees still deserve protection and, at the\u000avery least, they deserve a fair process to determine this question in each of their individual cases. He\u000aargues that since the Respondent State has denied the refugees protection, and a fair determination\u000aprocess, it is necessary to examine the de jure status individually.\u000a128. The Complainant argues that both customary international law and the African Charter provide special\u000aprotection to individuals who are unable to seek the protection of their own country. These persons refugees and asylum seekers - are recognised as being in particularly vulnerable positions. States are\u000aunder a legal obligation to consider refugees' claims to protection through a fair procedure and to provide\u000athem protection if their claims are found to be well-founded.\u000a129. Referring the Commission to Articles 12 of the African Charter, the Complainant argues that the\u000aCharter specifically recognises the need to protect such individuals, notwithstanding that it does not define\u000ain detail who qualifies as a refugee, except to describe them as any person who is persecuted. He goes on\u000ato state that the second preambular paragraph\u000a× Considering that the African Charter, while guaranteeing the freedom of movement and freedom of\u000aresidence of every individual within a state subject to being law abiding, recognises that when persecuted,\u000aevery individual shall have the right to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with the\u000arespective laws of the said countries, and international law,\u000aof Resolution No. 72/(XXXVI)/04, creating the Commission's Special Rapporteur, reiterates this protection,\u000awhile also drawing States' attention to their obligations under relevant international instruments. 26\u000a\u000a10\u000a\u000a130. The Complainant further argues that the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is lex specialis\u000ain relation to the African Charter.27\u000a131. He argues that the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa is lex\u000aspecialis to both the Charter and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. He states that this\u000ainstrument elaborates and strengthens the definition of a refugee deserving the protection of asylum. This\u000atreaty, he maintains, extends the definition of a refugee by stating in paragraph 2 of Article 1 that not only is\u000aa refugee a person as described by the UN Refugees Convention, but also that:\u000a[t]he term "refugee" shall also apply to every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign\u000adomination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or\u000anationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place\u000aoutside his country of origin or nationality.\u000a132. The Complainant concludes that, in the instance case, this expanded definition applies to the\u000aEthiopian refugees in addition to the definition in the UN Refugee Convention. This expanded definition\u000amust also be the basis of the interpretation and implementation of Article 12 by the Commission because it\u000aprovides individuals cumulatively the most adequate protection of their human rights in accordance with the\u000ainternational legal obligations that the Government of Sudan has voluntarily undertaken.\u000aRespondent State's Submission on the Merits\u000a\u000a133. The Respondent State in its submission states that Sudan is always committed to the implementation\u000aof international human rights instruments and continues to cooperate with the UN High Commission for\u000aRefugees which has the responsibility of monitoring international and regional conventions on refugees.\u000a134. The Respondent State denies all the Complainant's allegations. It argues that as a signatory to the\u000aAfrican Charter and various refugee instruments, it was merely cooperating with the UNHCR "...in\u000aperforming its functions, and assist it in facilitating its duties and carrying out its assignments to monitor and\u000aimplement the provisions" of the Geneva Convention.28 The Respondent State argues that refugees are\u000aonly entitled to receive support from the UN, where fear from persecution which caused him/her to flee, still\u000apersists.\u000a135. The Respondent State argues that following the fall of Mengistu's regime in 1991, the UNHCR was of\u000athe view that the circumstances which led to the flight of Ethiopians to Sudan and to the other countries of\u000athe world, no longer existed. The Respondent State states that the UNHCR believed that the situation in\u000aEthiopia after Mengistu's fall had sufficiently changed for the return of large numbers of refugees to that\u000acountry. It nevertheless argues that the announcement of the Termination of Refugee Status for Ethiopian\u000arefugees was not supposed to take place before an adequate period of time elapsed, to ensure stability and\u000asustainability of the change in the country of origin.\u000a136. The Respondent State, quoting Article 1(c) para. 1-6\u000a× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: 1) He has\u000avoluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or 2) Having lost his\u000anationality, he has voluntarily re-acquired it, or 3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the\u000aprotection of the country of his new nationality; or 4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country\u000awhich he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or 5) He can no longer, because\u000athe circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist,\u000acontinue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; Provided that this\u000aparagraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able to invoke\u000acompelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the\u000acountry of nationality; 6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because of the circumstances in\u000aconnection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the\u000acountry of his former habitual residence;\u000aof the 1951 UN Refugees Convention, which defines the six conditions under which refugee status ceases,\u000aargues that in the case of the Ethiopian refugees, the conditions no longer justified their continued stay in\u000aSudan. The Respondent State argues that these six conditions are based on the consideration that\u000ainternational protection is not usually granted when it is not justified.\u000a137. It cites the Cessation Clause, Article 1(C)(5)\u000a× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\u000alonger, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\u000a11\u000a\u000aceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\u000aProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\u000ato invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\u000aprotection of the country of nationality;\u000aas the source of the current dispute, which was not only directed at the Ethiopian refugees in Sudan, but to\u000aEthiopian refugees elsewhere in the world. The Respondent State argues that indeed the UNHCR had\u000aissued similar Cessation Clauses in the past for other refugees from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique,\u000aNamibia, South Africa and Chile, when the situation in those countries normalised. The Respondent State\u000asubmitted that since Sudan hosts a large number of Ethiopian refugees, to avoid the consequences which\u000aa hasty implementation would cause to the refugees and to the Sudanese as well, it requested the Third\u000aCommittee of the United Nations in New York for a gradual implementation of the Cessation Clause to the\u000aEthiopian refugees in the Sudan.\u000a138. The Respondent State states that a Tripartite Agreement between Sudan, Ethiopia and the UNHCR\u000awas executed in 1993. Under this Agreement a programme of voluntary repatriation began to be\u000aimplemented in 1993 and continued into 1998. The Respondent State submits further that, according to this\u000aAgreement, 720,000 refugees returned voluntarily. However, at the end of the programme, a considerable\u000anumber of the refugees remained in the Sudan.\u000a139. The Respondent State stated that, both Ethiopia and Sudan requested the UNHCR on 29th December\u000a1999 and 1st February 2000 respectively for a postponement of the repatriation due to the outbreak of the\u000awar with Eritrea. The Respondent State, Ethiopia and the UNHCR later concluded another Tripartite\u000aAgreement on 25th August 2000 to repatriate refugees at the end of the war with Eritrea, and the end of the\u000arainy season.\u000a140. The August 2000 agreement provided, inter alia, for transport modalities, provision of return packages\u000afor the returnees, such as cups, blankets, food allowances and other non food items. It also established a\u000amechanism for a residual caseload of individuals with compelling reasons for international protection, and\u000athose who for social and economic reasons wished to remain in Sudan.\u000a141. A screening process was carried out jointly by the Sudanese Commission on Refugees and the\u000aUNHCR to determine those who continued to need international protection. It was agreed that the\u000aregularisation for those wishing to remain in Sudan was a matter for bilateral discussion between the two\u000agovernments. The screening process was envisaged to end in November 2000. Repatriation would be\u000aconducted between 1st and 31st December 2000, since food and funding would not be available in 2001.\u000aThe implementation for repatriation was delayed to a later date (14th March 2001) to allow for proper\u000aimplementation and assessment.\u000a142. The Respondent State argues that the UNHCR brought in the best cadres serving in different parts of\u000athe world to take part in this exercise, so as to ensure equity and justice. The Respondent State submits\u000athat the repatriation was voluntary. It denies that any refugees were imprisoned, tortured or were subjected\u000ato involuntary return. It submits further that no person was denied social services, such as medical care,\u000afood or shelter. Assistance was extended to refugees throughout up to their final place of residence. Those\u000aremaining were assisted until all phases of the implementation of the cessation clause were exhausted,\u000aincluding the reconciliation of their legal status.\u000a143. The Respondent State submitted further that of those who did not opt for voluntary repatriation, 282\u000awere granted protection, while 2753 were not. The determination was done in accordance with the 1977\u000aUNHCR Executive Committee (EXCOM) decision, which requires Member States to adopt comprehensive\u000aprocedures to ensure that asylum seekers are given adequate time to make an appeal for reconsideration\u000aof a decision to accredit them, to the same committee or another authority.\u000a144. By June 2001, the Respondent State had registered 7,072 Ethiopians from both the 1993 to 1998, and\u000athe 2000 repatriation phases and issued them with an annually renewable residence permits, pursuant to\u000aUNHCR Executive Committee (EXCOM) decision No 69, which requires Member States implementing the\u000acessation clause to make appropriate arrangements to enable persons expected to leave the country to\u000atake care of strong family and other social and economic engagements.\u000a145. The Respondent State drew that attention of the Commission to the date the communication was\u000areceived at the Commission's Secretariat on the 22nd February 2000. It submitted that the Communication\u000awas received prior to the date of the implementation of the Cessation clause. The Respondent State\u000asubmitted that "10,000 Ethiopian refugees actually returned to their country voluntarily in the wake of the\u000aimplementation of the clause... ." It argues that such returnees cannot be deemed to be included in the\u000acommunication.\u000a12\u000a\u000aCommission's Decision on Merits\u000a\u000a146. The present communication turns on issues relating to the application of two important principles in\u000ainternational refugee and human rights law. The first issue is the effect of the Cessation Clause and its\u000aapplication under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Status of Refugees vis-a-vis a State Party to the\u000aAfrican Charter. The second issue is the applicability of the non-refoulement principle based on the actions\u000ataken by the Respondent State as a consequence of the Cessation Clause. The African Commission is\u000atherefore required to determine whether or not the Respondent State, in applying the Cessation Clause,\u000aacted in a manner which amounted to the refoulement of refugees to their country of origin where they\u000afeared persecution, and hence constituting a violation of the African Charter.\u000a147. Before analysing the instant case, it is important to clarify these concepts, namely the "cessation\u000aclause," "refoulement"and "non-refoulement."\u000a148. Article 1(C)(5)\u000a× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\u000alonger, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\u000aceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\u000aProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\u000ato invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\u000aprotection of the country of nationality;\u000aof the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees stipulates one of the six conditions which brings to\u000aan end the refugee status and hence the protection hitherto enjoyed by a refugee during asylum in a host\u000acountry, after fleeing persecution or the fear of persecution in his/her home country. Article 1(C)(5) of the\u000a1951 UN Refugees Convention reads as follows:\u000a[t]his Convention shall cease to apply to any person, (i.e. a refugee) if [h]e can no longer, because the\u000acircumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist,\u000acontinue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\u000aProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee ...who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising\u000aout of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality.\u000a149. The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa\u000astipulates a cessation clause of its own. Article 1(4)(e) reads as follows: [t]his Convention shall cease to\u000aapply to any refugee if (s)he can no longer, because of the circumstances in connection with which he was\u000arecognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the\u000acountry of his nationality.\u000aAccording to the two conventions the status of a refugee ceases when circumstances which caused the\u000aperson to assume refugee status cease to exist. Such a person can no longer refuse the protection of his or\u000aher country. International protection is granted to refugees because they do not enjoy the protection of their\u000aown home countries. The Cessation Clause does not apply when compelling reasons arising out of\u000aprevious persecution force a person to refuse the protection of ones country.\u000a150. "Non-refoulement", on the other hand, is a principle which has taken an increasingly fundamental\u000acharacter, as one of the cornerstones of international refugee law. It prohibits the return of an individual to a\u000acountry in which he or she may be persecuted.29 This principle is set out in the 1951 UN Refugee\u000aConvention, Article 33 (1)] which states that: "No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler") a\u000arefugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be\u000athreatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or\u000apolitical opinion."30\u000a151. The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa31\u000aenshrines the principle of non-refoulement in Article 2(3) of this Convention. It reads as follows: "[n]o\u000aperson shall be subjected by a Member State to measures such as rejection at the frontier, return or\u000aexpulsion, which would compel him to return to or remain in a territory where his life, physical integrity or\u000aliberty[/quote] would be threatened for the reasons set out in paragraphs 1 and 2."\u000a152. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1 of the OAU Convention define the conditions which compel an\u000aindividual to flee the country of his habitual residence and seek asylum in another country.\u000a153. Having seen the applicable provisions, it is incumbent upon the Commission to determine whether the\u000a13\u000a\u000aRespondent State violated the African Charter.\u000a154. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent State denied 14,000 Ethiopian refugees the\u000aprotection they deserved and a fair determination process when it executed a joint agreement with the\u000aUNHCR in September 1999, giving effect to the cessation clause by 1st March 2000.\u000a155. Did the actions of the Respondent State, in executing the joint agreement in September 1999 and\u000aposting the notice in February 2000, amount to committing a refoulement, i.e. the act of expelling the\u000arefugees? The mere execution of the agreement and posting of the notice did not constitute an act\u000aamounting to an expulsion or repatriation. The September 1999 and the subsequent notice clearly\u000aexpressed the intent to apply the Cessation Clause. They created an atmosphere which triggered this\u000acommunication even before the Cessation Clause implementation was set in motion. The repatriation\u000aprocess under the refugee conventions is conducted in a voluntary manner.\u000a156. The Respondent State, being a party to the September 1999 agreement was thus responsible for\u000awhatever action that would follow the execution of the said agreement. The Respondent State cannot\u000ablame the UNHCR for its own actions. The Respondent State has however stated that it did not refoule the\u000arefugees. It has submitted that it did not forcibly repatriate them; it did not imprison them nor deny them the\u000abasic necessities of life as alleged by the Complainant.\u000a157. The Respondent State denied that it repatriated refugees during the Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict. In fact\u000ait submitted that both Ethiopia and itself requested the UNHCR to postpone the repatriation during the\u000aEthiopian Eritrean War. Repatriation resumed after the end of the conflict when a tripartite agreement was\u000aconcluded in August 2000. The agreement provided for voluntary repatriation, inclusive of UNHCR\u000aassistance to the returnees as well as modalities for determination of a caseload of refugees who did not\u000aopt to be repatriated.\u000a158. The Respondent State stated that the refugees were not denied assistance, in spite of the notice, till\u000athe end of the repatriation programme. 282 refugees continued receiving protection after the cessation\u000aclause.\u000a159. The Complainant alleged that the Respondent State had mistreated the refugees for protesting their\u000aforcible repatriation. He alleged that the refugees were beaten, arrested, forcefully repatriated, and in other\u000acases were threatened with forced repatriation for demanding to remain in Sudan for fear of persecution if\u000athey were returned to Ethiopia.\u000a160. The African Commission wishes to state that the accounts by the two parties about the events\u000asubsequent to the Cessation Clause differ in certain respects. The Complainant, who claimed to represent\u000a14,000 refugees, submitted that many of the refugees did not want to return to Ethiopia because they were\u000aaligned to the opposition EPRP and feared persecution. The Respondent State submitted that most of the\u000apre-1991 refugees returned. A substantial number were granted further protection and others were issued\u000awith residence permits due to family or socio-economic reasons. The Respondent State argues that by\u000aJune 2001 it had issued residence permits to more than 7000 refugees who did not opt to be repatriated. At\u000athe same time it stated that other post 1991 refugees who had fled the current Ethiopian regime continued\u000ato remain in Sudan.\u000a161. The African Commission has not found any substantive reasons to doubt the account by the\u000aRespondent State. The African Commission holds that thousands of refugees repatriated voluntarily under\u000athe tripartite arrangements and those who remained were accorded refugee status or assumed normal\u000aimmigrant status upon being granted residence permits.\u000a162. The African Commission states, however, that the allegations made by the Complainant could have\u000abeen a case of a few refugees who feared the worst during the time immediately after the Cessation Clause\u000awas announced. The fear of the unknown by a substantial number of refugees who were able to\u000acommunicate with their lawyer as well as the publicity generated by press reports, coupled with the\u000afrustrations of denial of visas by the Respondent State to the Complainant, compounded the perception that\u000athe Respondent State was about to refoule the refugees.\u000a163. The Commission has found no evidence that refugees were refouled as a result of the cessation\u000aclause. The Commission has not established any cases of imprisonment, arrest, and forcible repatriation.\u000aThere was no concrete evidence brought to the attention of the Commission to the effect that such cases, if\u000aany, were linked to the promulgation and implementation of the cessation clause. The Respondent State\u000ademonstrated by providing figures, which were not refuted, of refugees who repatriated voluntarily prior to\u000aand after the cessation clause, as well as those who were granted further protection or alternative solutions\u000ato repatriation. The Complainant allegations that Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the African Charter were violated\u000ahave not been proved.\u000a14\u000a\u000a164. The Complainant argues that Article 7 of the African Charter requires that every individual has a right\u000ato a fair determination of the human rights protected in the Charter.\u000a165. The Respondent State denied that it violated Article 7 of the African Charter. It argued that there is no\u000auniform process for determination of refugee status and appeals under the international refugee regime. It\u000astated that it had established a joint determination mechanism involving the Sudanese Commission of\u000aRefugees and the UNHCR to carry out determination for the refugees who did not opt for voluntary\u000arepatriation under EXCOM decision No 69. The Commission, while reiterating the need to adopt judicial\u000aremedies in the event of the failure of such administrative mechanisms, takes note of the EXCOM\u000astipulated mechanism for the reconsideration of decisions by the same committee or another authority, in\u000athe event of dissatisfaction with a decision of the Joint Committee.\u000a166. The Commission wishes to state that the Complainant raised issues which, in actual fact, had been\u000ataken care of. The Communication appears to have been instituted before the implementation of the\u000aCessation Clause began. Hence when implementation began, the alleged violation of the refugees' rights\u000aexpressed by the Complainant was eventually taken care of by the Respondent State.\u000a167. The Complainant submitted that the refugees continued to consider themselves as de facto refugees\u000apost-the cessation clause based on paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 12 of the African Charter:\u000a(3) Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in\u000aaccordance with the law of those countries and international conventions. (4) A non-national legally\u000aadmitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a\u000adecision taken in accordance with the law. (5) The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited.\u000aMass expulsion shall be that which is aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.\u000aGoing by the aforesaid submission, the Commission finds that based on the information before it, there\u000awere only cases of refugees who repatriated voluntarily, or those who remained within the Respondent\u000aState under various recognised legal status, namely those who retained their status or those who became\u000aimmigrants upon the grant of residence permits, and the post-1991 refugees who were, in any case, not the\u000asubject of the Communication. The Commission, therefore, finds that there was at no time any case of de\u000afacto refugees.\u000aThe Commission finds that the Communication was filed in anticipation of a violation, which did not happen\u000ain actual fact after the implementation of the cessation clause set in motion.\u000a168. The Complainant's allegation that Article 12 of the African Charter was violated has also not been\u000aproved.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission\u000a\u000aThe African Commission finds that the allegations concerning violations of Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12(3), (4)\u000aand (5) of the African Charter have not been proved.\u000aDone in Banjul, The Gambia at the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights held from 11th-25th November 2009.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 See Amnesty International, et al. vs Sudan, Consolidated comm. 48/90, [50/91], 52/91 and 89/93, 27th\u000aOrdinary Session, 10th Activity Report (2000).\u000a2 228/99-The Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman/ Sudan, 33rd Ordinary Session, Sixteenth Annual Activity\u000aReport (2003) at para. 29.\u000a3 communication155/96-Social and Economic Rights Action Group and Centre for Economic and Social\u000aRights/ Nigeria, Fifteenth Annual Activity Report (2003) para 37.\u000a4 Ibid. at para 38.\u000a5 See Article 60 of the African Charter.\u000a6 Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l'Homme v.

[Judgment of November 13, 1981], No. G 101/81. Series A, para. 26). Second, the objection\u000aasserting non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, to be timely, must be made at an early stage of the\u000aproceedings by the State entitled to make it, lest a waiver of the requirement be presumed. Third, the State\u000aclaiming non-exhaustion has an obligation to prove that domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and\u000athat they are effective (Velásquez Rodríguez Case, Preliminary Objections, Judgment of June 26, 1987.\u000aSeries C No. 1, para. 88; Fairén Garbi and Solís Corrales Case, Judgment of June 26, 1987.

aV239/01 Interights (on behalf of Jose Domingos\u000aSikunda) / Namibia\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The communication is submitted by INTERIGHTS (the Complainant), a human rights NGO based in the\u000aUnited Kingdom, on behalf of Jose Domingos Sikunda.\u000a2. Mr Sikunda is of Angolan descent but has been living in Namibia for 25 years.\u000a3. The Complainant alleges that sometime in 2000, Mr Sikunda was arrested and detained by Namibian\u000aauthorities. No reasons were given for his arrest and detention.\u000a4. It is alleged that on 24th October 2000 the [H]igh [C]ourt of Namibia ordered the release of Mr Sikunda\u000afrom detention but that the government of Namibia declined to comply with the order.\u000a5. It is also alleged that Mr Sikunda's lawyers then sought to enforce the High Court order and on 31st\u000aOctober the Judge issued a rule nisi directing the Minister to show cause why he should not be cited for\u000acontempt of the court order. The case was adjourned twice and on 12th January 2001 Judge Teek delivered\u000ahis ruling recusing himself from the case without either party having applied for it.\u000a6. The Complainant states that there is a pending court order restraining the deportation of Mr Sikunda\u000awhich will lapse on 1st February 2001; and that the Namibian authorities have indicated their preparedness\u000ato deport Mr Sikunda to Angola whose government accuses Mr Sikunda of being a UNITA rebel. The\u000aComplainant alleges that such an act will put Mr Sikunda at real risk of torture and extra-judicial death.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a7. The Complainant alleges a violation of Articles 4, 5 and 12 (4) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a8. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the [African] Commission on 31st January 2001\u000aby fax, a copy of which was forwarded to the Chairman of the African Commission requesting him to appeal\u000a(under Rule 111 of the [African] Commission's Rules of Procedure) to the Namibian government to refrain\u000afrom taking any measures that may put the life of Mr Sikunda at risk.\u000a9. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the communication on 2nd February 2001 and requested the\u000aComplainant to furnish it with further information.\u000a10. On 19th February 2001, the Chairman of the African Commission wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs\u000aof the Republic of Namibia expressing concern over the alleged deportation of Mr Sikunda.\u000a11. On 22nd February 2001, the government of Namibia responded to the Chairman's appeal declining it\u000aand stating that the actions of the Namibian government were legal and aimed at protecting the security of\u000athe country and its citizens.\u000a12. On 12th March 2001 a copy of the above-mentioned written response was forwarded to the\u000aComplainant and they were reminded to furnish the [African] Commission with further information.\u000a13. On 21st March 2001, the Complainant responded to the request for further information stating that will\u000arevert back to the [African] Commission with additional submissions and evidentiary material.\u000a14. At its 29th Ordinary Session, the [African] Commission decided to be seized of the complaint.\u000a15. On 23rd May 2001, the Secretariat conveyed the above decision to the parties and requested parties to\u000afurnish it with additional information on admissibility in accordance with Article 56 of the African Charter and\u000aforwarded a copy of the text of the complaint to the Respondent State. The parties were requested to\u000apresent their written submissions to the Secretariat within three months of notification of the decision.\u000a16. During his promotional visit to Namibia from 2nd to 7th July 2001, Commissioner Chigovera raised the\u000amatter of this complaint with officials from the Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs and urged them to\u000asubmit their written submissions to the Secretariat as soon as possible.\u000a17. On 17th August 2001, the Parties were reminded to forward their written submissions to the Secretariat\u000aon or before the 23rd of August 2001.\u000a18. On 18th and 21st September 2001, the Secretariat wrote to the Respondent State and the Complainant\u000arespectively reminding them to forward their submissions on admissibility.\u000a1\u000a\u000a19. On 24th September 2001, the Secretariat received a letter from INTERIGHTS stating that they would\u000anot be able to forward their submissions for consideration at the forthcoming 30th Session as there are\u000aelements missing from their submissions that have not been transmitted by the lawyers of the victims.\u000a20. At its 30th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission considered the\u000acommunication and decided to defer the matter to the 31st Ordinary Session to allow the Complainants\u000aforward their submissions on admissibility.\u000a21. On 9th November 2001, the parties were informed of the [African] Commission???s decision.\u000a22. On 2nd January 2002, the Complainants were reminded to submit their written submissions on\u000aadmissibility.\u000a23. By email on 7th January 2002, the Complainants informed the Secretariat that they had sent a request\u000afor supplementary information to their colleagues in Namibia but had not yet heard from them and in the\u000aevent that they do not hear from them they would actively consider sending a notification for discontinuance\u000aof the case.\u000a24. On 19th March 2002, the Secretariat wrote enquiring as to whether the Complainants still wished to\u000aproceed with the communication and if that were the case to forward their written submissions on\u000aadmissibility.\u000a25. The Complainant on 20th March 2002 wrote informing the Secretariat that despite repeated attempts\u000athey had failed to secure a response from their colleagues at the National Society for Human Rights. The\u000aComplainants assured the Secretariat that if this situation does not change before the next session, then\u000athey would request the [African] Commission to authorise them to withdraw the communication.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a26. Article 56 of the African Charter governs admissibility. The most relevant provisions of that Article\u000aprovide communications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they: "(5)... are sent after\u000aexhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a27. The Respondent State argues that following refusal by the Minister of Home Affairs to honour the High\u000aCourt decision on 24th October 2000 ordering Sikunda's release from detention, Sikunda's lawyers sought\u000ato enforce the court order by an application to commit the Minister of Home Affairs for contempt of court.\u000a28. The Respondent State submits that INTERIGHTS submitted the present communication to the African\u000aCommission on 31st January 2001 whilst the matter of hearing the application of a rule nisi showing cause\u000awhy the Home Affairs Minister should not be held in contempt of court was still pending before the High\u000aCourt. Indeed, [the] High Court heard the matter on 1st February 2001 and delivered judgement on 9th\u000aFebruary 2001, finding the Minister of Home Affairs in contempt of court. Therefore, the Respondent State\u000aargues, that INTERIGHTS by submitting a complaint on 31st January 2001 had failed to meet the\u000arequirements of Article 56(5) of the African Charter.\u000a29. The Complainants on the other hand have been repeatedly requested by the [African] Commission to\u000afurnish their submissions on admissibility, especially on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies\u000abut there has not been any response from them.\u000a30. Thus, from the information available to the [African] Commission and principally from the copy of the\u000ajudgement of the High Court of Namibia delivered on 9th February 2001; the [African] Commission observes\u000athat the Complainant brought the matter before it prior to exhausting domestic remedies, indeed while the\u000amatter was still pending before the High Court of Namibia.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the [African] Commission in conformity with Article 56(5) of the African Charter\u000adeclares this communication inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\u000a\u000aNOTE:\u000a2\u000a\u000aWhen the Chair of the [African] Commission wrote to the Government of Namibia expressing concern over\u000athe alleged deportation of Mr Sikunda, the government responded stating that its actions were legal and\u000aaimed at protecting the security of the country and its citizens.\u000aFollowing the decision that the [African] Commission has come to, the [African] Commission would like to\u000astate that in circumstances where an alleged violation is brought to the attention of the [African]\u000aCommission and where it is alleged that irreparable damage may be caused to the victim, the [African]\u000aCommission will act expeditiously appealing to the Responding State to desist from taking any action that\u000amay cause irreparable damage until after the [African] Commission has had the opportunity to examine the\u000amatter fully. In such cases the [African] Commission acts on the facts as presented and it was therefore in\u000athis vein that the [African] Commission wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia\u000aexpressing concern over the alleged deportation of Mr Sikunda.\u000a\u000aDone at the 31stOrdinary session of the African Commission held in Pretoria, South Africa, from\u000a2ndto 16th May 2002.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a

aV250/02 Liesbeth Zegveld and Mussie Ephrem / Eritrea\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The complaint is filed by Dr Liesbeth Zegveld, an international lawyer at a Netherlands based firm Böhler\u000aFranken Koppe De Feijter, and Mr Mussie Ephrem, an Eritean living in Sweden.\u000a2. The complainants allege that eleven (11) former Eritrean government officials, namely, Petros Solomon,\u000aOgbe Abraha, Haile Woldetensae, Mahmud Ahmed Sheriffo, Berhane Ghebre Eghzabiher, Astier\u000aFeshation, Saleh Kekya, Hamid Himid, Estifanos Seyoum, Germano Nati and Beraki Ghebre Selassie were\u000aillegally arrested in Asmara, Eritrea on 18th and 19th September 2001 in violation of Eritrean laws and the\u000aAfrican Charter. They were part of a group of fifteen (15) senior officials of the ruling Peoples' Front for\u000aDemocracy and Justice (PFDJ) who had been openly critical of the Eritrean Government policies. In May\u000a2001, they wrote an open letter to ruling party members criticising the government for acting in an 'illegal\u000aand unconstitutional' manner. Their letter also called upon "all PFDJ members and Eritrean people in\u000ageneral to express their opinion through legal and democratic means and to give their support to the goals\u000aand principles they consider just". The government subsequently announced that the eleven individuals\u000amentioned above, on whose behalf the present complaint is being filed, had been detained 'because of\u000acrimes against the nation's security and sovereignty.\u000a3. The complaint also alleges that the detainees could be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the\u000apeaceful expression of their political opinions. Their whereabouts is currently unknown. The Complainants\u000aallege that the detainees may be held in some management building between the capital Asmara and the\u000aport of Massawa. They have reportedly not been given access to their families or lawyers. The\u000aComplainants fear for the safety of the detainees.\u000a4. The Complainants state that they have made a request for habeas corpus to the Minister of Justice of\u000aEritrea. They claim that they could not submit the same to the courts, as the place of detention of the 11\u000aformer officials was unknown. They allege that in the habeas corpus the Eritrean authorities were asked,\u000aamong others, to reveal where the 11 detainees were being held, to either charge and bring them to court\u000aor promptly release them, to guarantee that none of them would be ill treated and that they have immediate\u000aaccess to lawyers of their choice, their families and adequate medical care. The Complainants allege that\u000ano reaction has been received from the Eritrean authorities.\u000a5. Together with their complaint the Complainants submitted a request for provisional measures to the\u000aAfrican Commission in accordance with Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a6. The Complainants allege violations of Articles 2, 6, 7(1) and 9(2) of the African Charter.\u000a7. The Complainants pray that should the detainees be tried, the trial should be held in accordance with\u000ainternational human rights standards and without recourse to the death penalty. They claim that such a trial\u000ashould not be before the Special Court, which they allege fails to meet international standards of fair trial.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a8. The complaint was dated 9th April 2002 and received at the Secretariat on 9th April 2002 by fax, and on\u000a9th and 11th April 2002 by email.\u000a9. On 19th April 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants acknowledging receipt of the complaint,\u000aand informing them that their request for provisional measures was noted and would be acted upon\u000aaccordingly.\u000a10. On 3rd May 2002, the African Commission wrote a letter of appeal to His Excellency Issayas Afewerki,\u000aPresident of the State of Eritrea, respectfully urging him to intervene in the matter being complained of\u000apending the outcome of the consideration of the complaint before the [African] Commission.\u000a11. At its 31st Ordinary Session held from 2nd to 16th May 2002 in Pretoria, South Africa, the African\u000aCommission considered the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a12. On 20th May 2002, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Eritrea responded to the [African]\u000aCommission appeal and confirming to the latter that the alleged victims on whose behalf the complaint was\u000afiled had their quarters in appropriate government facilities, had not been ill-treated, have had continued\u000a1\u000a\u000aaccess to medical services and that the government was making every effort to bring them before an\u000aappropriate court of law as early as possible.\u000a13. On 28th May 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants and the Respondent State of the [African]\u000aCommission's decision to be seized of the matter and requested them to forward their submissions on\u000aadmissibility before the 32nd Ordinary Session of the [African] Commission.\u000a14. The Secretariat of the African Commission forwarded the Ministry's response to the Chairperson of the\u000aAfrican Commission on 7th June 2002 and to the Complainants on 18th June 2002.\u000a15. On 25th October 2002, the African Commission wrote, by way of follow up on its urgent appeal in the\u000amatter, to the Respondent State reminding it that it was the responsibility of the Member State's General\u000aProsecutor to bring the accused before a competent court of law in accordance with the rules guaranteeing\u000afair trial under relevant national and international instruments.\u000a16. The two parties made submissions on admissibility.\u000a17. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\u000aheard oral submissions from both parties to the communication and decided to declare the communication\u000aadmissible.\u000a18. On 10th June 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote informing the parties to the\u000acommunication of the African Commission's decision and requested them to forward their submissions on\u000athe merits of the communication within 3 months.\u000a19. The Chairperson of the African Commission forwarded a letter dated 10th June 2003 appealing to His\u000aExcellency the President of Eritrea to intervene in this matter and urge the authorities holding the 11\u000aindividuals to release them or bring them before the courts in Eritrea.\u000a20. At its 34th Ordinary Session, held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and delivered its decision on the merits.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a21. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\u000aby the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This article lays down seven (7) conditions,\u000awhich must generally be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\u000a22. At issue in the present communication is whether the complainants have pursued and exhausted the\u000adomestic legal remedies of Eritrea, and if not, whether the exception to the exhaustion of domestic\u000aremedies rule should apply. This issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies is governed by Article 56(5) of\u000athe African Charter and it provides:\u000a"Communications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they are sent after exhausting local\u000aremedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged."\u000a23. The rule requiring exhaustion of local remedies has been applied by international adjudicating bodies\u000aand is premised on the principle that the Respondent State must first have an opportunity to redress by its\u000aown means within the framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to\u000athe individual.\u000a24. In determining whether this communication should be declared admissible or otherwise, the African\u000aCommission must have regard to the arguments put forward by the Complainants and the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a25. The Complainants submit they have attempted to exhaust local remedies in Eritrea. They state that on\u000a26th November 2001 and on 9th April 2002, they submitted a habeas corpus request through the Eritrean\u000aMinister of Justice asking the Eritrean Authorities to disclose where the 11 detainees were being held and\u000awhy. The complainants also requested that the detainees be brought to court and charged in accordance\u000awith the law, however, there was no response to their request. A similar request was made on 26th June\u000a2002 (which is after the African Commission was seized of their complaint) to the Eritrean High Court in\u000aAsmara to which there was no reply either.\u000a26. In her oral submissions during the 33rd Ordinary Session of the African Commission, Zegveld stated\u000athat in an attempt to access the local courts, they had requested locally based legal practitioners (whom\u000ashe declined to name) to bring the matter before the local courts. However, the said lawyers later informed\u000aher that they would not be able to pursue the detainees' case in the domestic courts for fear of persecution\u000a2\u000a\u000aby the authorities and for fear of jeopardising their legal practice.\u000a27. The Complainants further submit that for more than 18 months, the 11 detainees have been held in\u000adetention without formal charges and with no access to their lawyers or families thus rendering them unable\u000ato seek legal or administrative redress. Furthermore, there has been no response from the government of\u000aEritrea or High Court of Asmara, in relation to the Complainants' requests of 26th November 2001 and 9th\u000aApril 2002.\u000a28. Under the circumstances presented above, the Complainants aver that the requirement to exhaust local\u000aremedies can no longer apply because even where such remedies would have been existent they have\u000abeen unduly prolonged in this case.\u000a29. The Complainants refer the African Commission to a decision of the European Court of Human Rights\u000ain Ocalan v. Turkey1 where the court held that Ocalan's isolation and the fact that the Turkish police\u000aobstructed his access to lawyers made it impossible for the applicant to have effective recourse to a\u000adomestic remedy under Turkish Law.\u000a30. In its written submissions, the Respondent State argues that the Complainants addressed their habeas\u000acorpus request to the Minister of Justice who is a member of the Executive branch with no capacity to\u000aaddress and take decisions on this matter either in substance or in procedure. They submit that only the\u000ajudiciary has the authority to take action on any civil, criminal and other issues of judicial nature including,\u000athe matter of habeas corpus.\u000a31. During the 33rd Ordinary Session, the Representative of the Respondent State submitted that to date\u000athe complainants have not submitted themselves to the courts in Eritrea. He informed the African\u000aCommission that he had personally checked with the High Court of Asmara to establish whether the matter\u000ahad been brought to the court's attention but there was no case file on this matter.\u000a32. The Representative of the Respondent State argues that the Complainants' assertion that they have\u000anot been able to access the domestic courts is speculative. He stated that Zegveld should accredit herself\u000ato the courts in Eritrea to enable her bring this matter before the local courts.\u000a33. The Respondent State further submits that they have been unable to bring the 11 detainees before a\u000acourt of law because of the nature of the criminal justice system in Eritrea. The Representative of the\u000aRespondent State informed the African Commission that the criminal justice system in Eritrea was inherited\u000afrom Ethiopia and is therefore lacking. Within the High Court of Asmara, there is only one chamber\u000aresponsible for handling criminal cases including criminal matters from the lower courts. As such, the\u000aCourt's calendar is highly congested and difficult to manage. Therefore cases are bound to take time before\u000athey are heard by the courts and this is the very reason for the delay in bringing the matter of the 11\u000adetainees before a court of law.\u000a34. There are exceptions to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies and the Complainants have\u000aargued that they could not exhaust the domestic remedies because the domestic legislation of Eritrea does\u000anot afford due process of law for the protection of the rights that have allegedly been violated.\u000a35. At this stage, it should be made clear that, when a person is being held in detention and accused for\u000acommitting a crime, the African Commission holds that it is the responsibility of the Member State, through\u000aits appropriate judicial bodies, to bring this person promptly before a competent court of law in order to\u000aenable him/her to be tried in accordance with rules guaranteeing the right to a fair trial in accordance with\u000anational and international standards.\u000a36. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Velasquez case2 while interpreting Article 46\u000a× Article 46 1. Admission by the Commission of a petition or communication lodged in accordance with\u000aArticles 44 or 45 shall be subject to the following requirements:\u000aa. That the remedies under domestic law have been pursued and exhausted in accordance with generally\u000arecognised principles of international law; b. That the petition or communication is lodged within a period of\u000asix months from the date on which the party alleging violation of his rights was notified of the final judgment;\u000ac. That the subject of the petition or communication is not pending in another international proceeding for\u000asettlement; and d. That, in the case of Article 44, the petition contains the name, nationality, profession,\u000adomicile, and signature of the person or persons or of the legal representative of the entity lodging the\u000apetition.\u000a2. The provisions of paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of this article shall not be applicable when:\u000aa. The domestic legislation of the state concerned does not afford due process of law for the protection of\u000a3\u000a\u000athe right or rights that have allegedly been violated; b. The party alleging violation of his rights has been\u000adenied access to the remedies under domestic law or has been prevented from exhausting them; or c.\u000aThere has been unwarranted delay in rendering a final judgment under the aforementioned remedies.\u000ahttp://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr8.html accessed 19.10.2010\u000aof the American Convention (similar to Article 56(5) of the African Charter) which relates to the issue of\u000aexhaustion of domestic remedies, stated that, for the rule of prior exhaustion of domestic remedies to be\u000aapplicable, the domestic remedies of the State concerned must be available, adequate and effective in\u000aorder to be exhausted. The Court also opined that where a party raises non-exhaustion of local remedies\u000abecause of the unavailability of due process in the State, the burden of proof will shift to "the State claiming\u000anon-exhaustion and it has an obligation to prove that domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and that\u000athey are effective" .\u000a37. In consolidated communication 147/95 and 149/963 , the African Commission also ruled that domestic\u000aremedies must be available, effective and sufficient; a domestic remedy is considered available if the\u000apetitioner can pursue it without impediment, it is effective if it offers a prospect of success and it is sufficient\u000aif it is capable of redressing the complaint.\u000a38. The African Commission notes that by its own admission, the Respondent State has indicated that it\u000ahas not yet put in place structures that would ensure that cases are handled 'within reasonable time'.\u000aHowever, the Respondent State goes ahead to assure the African Commission that the detainees will be\u000abrought before a court of competent jurisdiction in due course.\u000a39. The State has a constitutional or statutory requirement to provide an accessible, effective and possible\u000aremedy whereby alleged victims can seek recognition and restoration of their rights before resorting to the\u000ainternational system for protection of human rights. Such procedures should not be mere formalities that,\u000arather than enable the realisation of those rights, to the contrary, dilute with time any possibility of success\u000awith respect to their assertion, recognition or exercise.\u000a40. Very clearly, the situation as presented by the Respondent State does not afford due process of law for\u000aprotection of the rights that have been alleged to be violated; the detainees have been denied access to the\u000aremedies under domestic law and have thus been prevented from exhausting them. Furthermore, there has\u000abeen unwarranted delay in bringing these detainees to justice.\u000a41. For these reasons, the African Commission declares this communication admissible.\u000a\u000aRuling by the African Commission on request by the Respondent State to revisit the decision on admissibility\u000a\u000a42. The present communication was declared admissible at the 33rd Ordinary Session of the African\u000aCommission's held in May 2003. In response to the African Commission's request for written submissions\u000aon the merits, the Respondent State in a Note Verbale expressed its dismay at the African Commission's\u000adecision to declare the matter admissible. They stated that they found the African Commission's decision\u000aon admissibility unacceptable and therefore requested that the African Commission revisits its decision on\u000aadmissibility.\u000a43. Before dealing with the merits of the communication, the African Commission would like to pronounce\u000aitself on the request by the Respondent State to revisit its decision on admissibility.\u000a44. Firstly, it should be noted that the Respondent State did not bring any new element, either on the facts\u000aof the case as considered by the African Commission or on the legal grounds upon which [it] is making\u000asuch a request.\u000a45. Secondly, Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure stipulate that: "If the\u000aCommission has declared a communication inadmissible under the Charter, it may reconsider this decision\u000aat a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration...."\u000aThe Rules of Procedure do not make provision for the African Commission to revisit its decision once a\u000acommunication has been declared admissible. Furthermore, it has been the practice of the African\u000aCommission not to reconsider a decision declaring a communication admissible.\u000a\u000aFor these reasons the African Commission upholds its decision on admissibility in this matter.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000aMerits\u000a46. The African Commission delivered its decision on admissibility of this communication at its 33rd\u000aOrdinary Session and informed the parties of its decision on 10th June 2003. The Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission further requested the parties to forward their submissions on the merits of the communication\u000awithin 3 months. Whereas the Complainants forwarded their written submissions on the merits of the\u000acommunication, none were received from the Respondent State. It is an established principle of the African\u000aCommission that where allegations of violations of provisions of the African Charter go uncontested by the\u000aGovernment concerned, the African Commission must decide on the facts as given. This principle also\u000aconforms to the practice of other international human rights adjudicatory bodies. In the present\u000acommunication therefore, the African Commission is left with no alternative but to proceed and deliver a\u000adecision on the merits based on the submissions of the Complainants. 4 Although the African Commission\u000ahas in this decision referred to the oral submissions made by the Respondent State during the 33rd\u000aOrdinary Session, especially as they relate to some issues that touch upon the merits of the\u000acommunication, the Respondent State's failure to present comprehensive submissions on the merits has\u000abeen done at its own peril.\u000a47. By Note Verbale dated 20th May 2002, the Respondent State informed the African Commission that the\u000a11 persons had indeed been detained for "conspiring to overthrow the legal government of the country in\u000aviolation of relevant OAU resolutions, colluding with hostile foreign powers with a view to compromising the\u000asovereignty of the country, undermining Eritrean national security and endangering Eritrean society and the\u000ageneral welfare of its people". The Respondent State further stated that such detention was in conformity\u000awith the criminal code of the country. In their oral submissions made during the 33rd Ordinary Session in\u000aMay 2003, the Respondent State further admitted that they had not at the time brought the 11 detainees\u000abefore any court of law.\u000a48. The Complainants aver that the 11 persons who were former Eritrean Government officials, had been\u000aopenly critical of the Eritrean government policies and as a direct result of their open letter criticising the\u000agovernment of Eritrea for acting in an illegal and unconstitutional manner, they were arrested and detained\u000afor committing "crimes against the nation's security and sovereignty".\u000a49. The Complainants state that the 11 detainees have since September 2001 been held incommunicado\u000aand have never been brought before any courts of law in violation of Article 17(4)\u000a× Every person who is held in detention shall be brought before a court of law within forty-eight (48) hours\u000aof his arrest, and if this is not reasonably possible, as soon as possible thereafter, and no such person shall\u000abe held in custody beyond such period without the authority of the court.\u000a(http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dd8aa904.html accessed 19.10.2010)\u000aof the Constitution of the State of Eritrea and Article 6 of the African Charter. Article 17(4) of the\u000aConstitution provides that every person who is held in detention must be brought before a court of law\u000awithin 48 hours of his arrest and no person shall be held in custody beyond such a period without the\u000aauthority of the court.\u000a50. The Complainants submit that the above-mentioned acts by the Respondent State violate Articles 2, 6\u000aand 7(1) of the African Charter.\u000a51. Article 2 of the African Charter provides: "Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights\u000aand freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such as\u000arace, ethnic group, colour, sex, language, religion, or any other opinion, national or social origin, fortune,\u000abirth or other status." Article 6 of the African Charter provides: "Every individual shall have the right to\u000aliberty and to the security of his person. No one may be deprived of his freedom except for reasons and\u000aconditions previously laid down by law. In particular, no one may be arbitrarily arrested or detained." Article\u000a7(1) of the African Charter provides: "1. Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\u000acomprises [a] The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts of violating his fundamental\u000arights as recognised and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force; [b] The right\u000ato be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal; [c] The right to defence,\u000aincluding the right to be defended by counsel of his choice; [d] The right to be tried within a reasonable time\u000aby an impartial court or tribunal;"\u000a52. Although Article 6 of the African Charter guarantees the right to liberty and security of the person, this is\u000anot an absolute right because the African Charter allows the deprivation of this right through lawful means.\u000aThe African Charter specifically prohibits arbitrary arrests and detention.\u000a\u000a5\u000a\u000a53. Evidence before the African Commission indicates that the 11 persons have been held incommunicado\u000aand without charge since they were arrested in September 2001. This fact has not been contested by the\u000aRespondent State. They are being held in custody and have been cut off from communication with the\u000aoutside world, with no access to their lawyers or families. Their whereabouts are unknown putting their fate\u000aunder the exclusive control of the Respondent State.\u000a54. The African Commission on two occasions wrote letters of appeal to the President of the State of\u000aEritrea informing him about the communication before the African Commission and requested him to\u000aintervene in the matter to ensure that the 11 persons are removed from secret detention and brought before\u000athe courts of law in Eritrea. In a Note Verbale dated 20th May 2002, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the\u000aState of Eritrea informed the African Commission that the 11 persons were being held in appropriate\u000agovernment facilities, that they had not been ill-treated and had access to medical services. The Ministry\u000aassured the African Commission that the government was making every effort to bring them before an\u000aappropriate court of law as early as possible. The African Commission notes that to date it has not received\u000aany information or substantiation from the Respondent State demonstrating that the 11 persons were being\u000aheld in appropriate detention facilities and that they had been produced before courts of law.\u000a55. Incommunicado detention is a gross human rights violation that can lead to other violations such as\u000atorture or ill-treatment or interrogation without due process safeguards. Of itself, prolonged incommunicado\u000adetention and/or solitary confinement could be held to be a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\u000aand treatment. The African Commission is of the view that all detentions must be subject to basic human\u000arights standards. There should be no secret detentions and States must disclose the fact that someone is\u000abeing detained as well as the place of detention. Furthermore, every detained person must have prompt\u000aaccess to a lawyer and to their families and their rights with regards to physical and mental health must be\u000aprotected as well as entitlement to proper conditions of detention.5\u000a56. The African Commission holds the view that the lawfulness and necessity of holding someone in\u000acustody must be determined by a court or other appropriate judicial authority. The decision to keep a\u000aperson in detention should be open to review periodically so that the grounds justifying the detention can be\u000aassessed. In any event, detention should not continue beyond the period for which the State can provide\u000aappropriate justification. Therefore, persons suspected of committing any crime must be promptly charged\u000awith legitimate criminal offences and the State should initiate legal proceedings that should comply with fair\u000atrial standards as stipulated by the African Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair\u000aTrial 6 and elaborated upon in its Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa7\u000a57. In the present communication, the Respondent State did not provide the African Commission with any\u000adetails regarding the specific laws under which the 11 persons were detained but instead generally states\u000athat their detention is in "consonance with the existing criminal code ...and other relevant national and\u000ainternational instruments". The 11 persons were detained on account of their political beliefs and are being\u000aheld in secret detention without any access to the courts, lawyers or family. Regrettably, these persons'\u000arights are continually being violated even today, as the Respondent State is still holding them in secret\u000adetention in blatant violation of their rights to liberty and recourse to fair trial 8\u000a58. The Complainants further allege that the 11 persons were arrested and detained because they\u000aexpressed opinions that were critical of the Respondent State. The Complainants submit that this amounts\u000ato a violation of Article 9(2) of the African Charter, which provides "every individual shall have the right to\u000aexpress and disseminate his opinions within the law" .\u000a59. The right to freedom of expression has been recognised by the African Commission as a fundamental\u000aindividual human right which is also a cornerstone of democracy and a means of ensuring the respect for\u000aall human rights and freedoms.9 Nonetheless, this right carries with it certain duties and responsibilities and\u000ait is for this reason that certain restrictions on freedom of expression are allowed. However, Article 9(2) as\u000awell as Principle II (2)\u000a× Any restrictions on freedom of expression shall be provided by law, serve a legitimate interest and be\u000anecessary and in a democratic society.\u000aof the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa categorically state that such restrictions\u000ahave to be provided for by law.10\u000a60. It is a well settled principle of the African Commission that any laws restricting freedom of expression\u000amust conform to international human rights norms and standards relating to freedom of expression11 and\u000ashould not jeopardise the right itself. In fact, the African Charter in contrast to other international human\u000arights does not permit derogation from this or any other right on the basis of emergencies or special\u000acircumstances.\u000a6\u000a\u000a61. Consequently, if any person expresses or disseminates opinions that are contrary to laws that meet the\u000aaforementioned criteria, there should be due process and all affected persons should be allowed to seek\u000aredress in a court of law.12\u000a62. The facts as presented leave no doubt in the mind of the African Commission that the Respondent\u000aState did indeed restrict the 11 persons' right to free expression. No charges have been brought against the\u000a11 persons and neither have they been brought before the courts.

aV253/02 Antonie Bissangou / Congo\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. On March 14th, 1995 the complainant brought a case against the Republic of Congo and the Municipal\u000aOffice of Brazzaville before the Court of First Instance of Brazzaville, sitting on civil matters, with a view to\u000aobtaining the recognition of the responsibility of the Congolese Republic, as well as reparation for the\u000adamage caused to his personal property and real estate following barbaric acts carried out by soldiers,\u000aarmed bands and uncontrolled elements of the Congolese National Police Force, during the socio-political\u000aupheavals that took place in the country in 1993.\u000a2. On February 18th 1997 the civil division of the Court of First Instance passed a ruling ordering the\u000aCongolese Republic and the Municipal Office of Brazzaville to pay the following amounts:\u000aPrincipal amount for all the damage caused: 180,000,000.00 FCFA\u000aDamages: 15,000,000.00 FCFA\u000aAmount representing legal costs: 7,000.00 FCFA\u000aTotal amount: 195,037,000.00 FCFA\u000aThat is the equivalent of 297,333.98 euros, the whole being immediately enforceable.\u000a3. On March 19th 1997, the ruling became legally binding and a certificate of no-appeal was issued to the\u000acomplainant (see file).\u000a4. In a letter dated May 20th 1999, the Minister of Justice asked the Minister of Economy, Finance and\u000aBudget of Congo to enforce the ruling. However, in a letter dated December 30th 1999, the Minister of\u000aEconomy, Finance and Budget refused to execute the ruling, for no apparent reason.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a5. The complainant alleges the violation of violates Articles 2, 3, 21(2) of the African Charter. The\u000acomplainant is asking the African Commission to recommend to the Republic of Congo Brazzaville to\u000acomply with the ruling which has been passed on behalf of the Congolese people, and to comply at the\u000asame time with the provisions of the Charter to which it is signatory.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a6. The complaint was received by the Secretariat of the African Commission on 27th June 2002.\u000a7. On 1st August 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the complainant informing him that the complaint was\u000aregistered and that it would be considered at the [African] Commission's 32nd Ordinary Session, which was\u000ascheduled to take place from 17th to 31st October 2002 in Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a8. At its 32nd Ordinary Session held from 17th to 23rd October 2002 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered the Complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a9. On October 30th, 2002 the Secretariat communicated the above decision to the Parties and requested\u000athem to submit in writing, their observations on the matter of exhaustion of local remedies. The Secretariat\u000aalso sent a copy of the communication to the Respondent State.\u000a10. The Complainant sent his comments on admissibility to the Secretariat in a letter dated 17th December\u000a2002.\u000a11. On 24th March 2003, a reminder was sent by Note Verbale to the Respondent State, requesting its\u000acomments on admissibility to be sent to the Secretariat of the [African] Commission.\u000a12. On 25th March 2003, the Secretariat sent the Complainant's observations to the Respondent State and\u000areminded the latter to send its observations concerning the exhaustion of local remedies before the 15th\u000aApril 2003.\u000a13. During the 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and deferred its decision on admissibility to the 34th Ordinary\u000aSession. The Parties were requested to send further information on the procedure to be followed for the\u000arecovery of the debt.\u000a14. On 23rd June 2003, the Secretariat informed the Parties of this decision and requested the Respondent\u000aState to submit its observations on the admissibility of the communication within three (3) months from the\u000adate of the receipt of this Note, and to include the details of Congo's legislation on the matter of debt\u000a1\u000a\u000arecovery.\u000a15. On 22nd September 2003, the Secretariat again contacted the Parties involved in the communication\u000aand requested them to submit their written observations on admissibility.\u000a16. On 6th October 2003, the Secretariat received written submissions from the Complainant.\u000a17. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's submissions on 15th October 2003 and on\u000athe same date forwarded the said submissions to the Respondent State reminding it to forward its written\u000asubmission with regard to admissibility and to provide more information on all the local remedies available\u000ain the context of debt recovery in Congolese legislation.\u000a18. On the 4th November 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received written observations\u000afrom the Respondent State.\u000a19. During the 34th Ordinary Session of the African Commission held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in\u000aBanjul, The Gambia, the Respondent State made an oral presentation of its grounds of defence on the\u000aadmissibility of the communication.\u000a20. After consideration of the communication during its 34th Ordinary Session, the African Commission\u000adecided to defer its decision to the 35th Ordinary Session in order to allow the plaintiff time to submit his\u000awritten observations on the admissibility of the communication, taking into account the observations of the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a21. On 7th December 2003, the Secretariat notified the Parties of the decision of the African Commission\u000aand sent to the Complainant a copy of the observations submitted by the Respondent State.\u000a22. On 9th March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the Parties that consideration of\u000athe admissibility of the communication was scheduled for the 35th Ordinary Session. The Complainant was\u000arequested to send his reaction to the written observations submitted by the Respondent State.\u000a23. On 30th March and 5th April 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the observations\u000afrom the Complainant on the matter of admissibility. These observations were forwarded by DHL to the\u000aRespondent State on the 30th April 2004.\u000a24. During the 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul from 21st May to 4th June 2004, the African Commission\u000aheard oral submissions from the Respondent State. After having considered the communication, the\u000aAfrican Commission declared it admissible.\u000a25. On 18th June 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the Parties of the [African]\u000aCommission's decision and requested them to submit more information on the merits of the communication.\u000a26. A reminder was sent to both Parties on 6th September 2004.\u000a27. On the 28th October 2004, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received the written observations\u000afrom the Complainant on the merits of the communication and acknowledged receipt thereof.\u000a28. During the 36th Ordinary Session held from 23rd November to 7th December 2004 in Dakar, Senegal,\u000athe African Commission considered the communication and deferred its consideration on the merits to the\u000a37th Ordinary Session.\u000a29. By correspondence of 20th December 2004, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission informed\u000aParties to the communication of the above decision.\u000a30. On 10th March 2005, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission conveyed the comments of the\u000aComplainant to the Respondent State reminding it to send its written arguments as early as possible.\u000a31. During the 37th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to defer its consideration on the merits to\u000athe 38th Ordinary Session.\u000a32. By correspondence dated 28th June 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the\u000aparties of the decision of the African Commission and requested the Respondent State to submit its\u000aarguments on the merits of the case within two months.\u000a33. The Secretariat of the [African] Commission sent a reminder to the Respondent State on 10th October\u000a2005.\u000a34. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005, the African Commission\u000adecided to defer its decision on the merits to the 39th Ordinary Session.\u000a35. On 15th December 2005, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission conveyed this decision on\u000adeferment to the Parties.\u000a36. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 11th to 25th May 2006, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to defer its decision on the merits to its 40th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a37. By Note Verbale of 14th July 2006 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\u000a[African] Commission's decision.\u000a38. At its 40th Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th November 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and took a decision on the merits.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a39. The admissibility of communications submitted in conformity with Article 55 of the Charter is governed\u000aby the conditions spelt out by Article 56 of the same Charter. According to Article 56(5) communications\u000acan only be considered if they are submitted "after the exhaustion of local remedies, if any, unless it is\u000aobvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a40. According to Article 56(2), communications brought before the African Commission shall be "compatible\u000awith the Charter of the [OAU] or with the present Charter", and in terms of Article 56(5), communication will\u000anot be examined unless they "are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this\u000aprocedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a41. The Complainant has submitted evidence that he brought an action before the Court of First Instance\u000awhich delivered a ruling on the 18th February 1997, condemning the Respondent State to pay to him the\u000aamount of 195,037,000 FCFA, namely the equivalent of 297,333.98 Euros. This judgment was not\u000acontested by the Respondent State. A certificate of no appeal had been delivered to the Complainant by\u000athe Registrar of the Court.\u000a42. The Complainant added the certificate of no appeal to the case file, which means that the judgment is\u000afinal and should be executed. He produced supporting documents certifying that the file had been\u000aforwarded by the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of the Economy, Finances and Budget for execution.\u000aThe Complainant alleges that despite several notices sent requesting it to honour its debt, the Respondent\u000aState has refused to comply.\u000a43. The Complainant alleges that the ruling, in relation to which execution is being called for is final and\u000abinding. He contends that the certificate of no appeal added to the case file legally establishes that there\u000aare no other remedies to be brought against the said ruling.\u000a44. The Complainant alleges that in a country where the rule of law exists, the fact that an Administrative\u000aOfficer refuses to execute a decision of the Court against which there are no more legal remedies, is a\u000aconstitutive case of criminal offence.\u000a45. The Respondent State, in making an oral presentation of its grounds of defence before the African\u000aCommission during its 34th Ordinary Session, did not contest the facts of the complaint. It however raised a\u000aplea of inadmissibility regarding the Complainant's request on the grounds that the rule of exhaustion of\u000alocal remedies had not been observed.\u000a46. Regarding the incompatibility with the Charter, the Congolese State alleges that the object of the\u000acommunication does not fall under the jurisdiction devolving on the [African] Commission in terms of Article\u000a45 of the Charter that is to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in Africa. According to the State,\u000a"...The [African Charter] has established a non-jurisdictional mechanism to guarantee rights and freedoms,\u000athe decisions of the latter having just a moral significance and are not binding. Therefore, the [African]\u000aCommission could not turn into a jurisdiction to consider requests for the payment of money against states."\u000a47. The [African] Commission observes that the communication is based on allegations of violation of\u000aprovisions of the Charter which it has the mandate to promote and protect. As the State itself\u000aacknowledged it in its submission, the African Commission "controls the conformity of State Parties actions\u000ato [African Charter]". The [African] Commission finds that in the case under consideration, in seizing the\u000a[African] Commission, the Complainant does not have any other intention than to request the latter to play\u000aits role by controlling the conformity to Articles 2, 3, 21(2) of the Charter of an action (the refusal to enforce\u000aa court decision in favour of the Complainant) of a State party (the Republic of Congo). The [African]\u000aCommission concludes that the object of the communication falls under its mandate and, as a result, finds\u000athat the communication is compatible with the Charter.\u000a48. Regarding the exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State contends that the complainant had a\u000aremedy against the refusal of the Minister of the Economy, Finances and Budget to execute this ruling in\u000aaccordance with the provisions of Articles 405 to 409 of the Code of Civil, Commercial, Administrative and\u000aFinancial Procedure. These articles stipulate that: "any citizen who is qualified and so wishes has the right\u000a3\u000a\u000ato bring an appeal for annulment against any regulatory or individual decision by an administrative\u000aAuthority. Such an appeal must be brought within two (2) months from the date of the publication or\u000anotification of the grievance on the one hand, and exceptionally within four (4) months in case of silence\u000afrom the administration which is interpreted as an implicit dismissal, on the other...".\u000a49. Article 410 of the same Code adds: "Nonetheless, before applying for the annulment of an\u000aadministrative decision, the interested Party may present, within 2 months, an appeal to a higher or the\u000asame administrative Authority to cancel the said decision. In such a case, the application for annulment will\u000aonly be effective either from the date of the notification of the dismissal of the administrative appeal, or on\u000athe expiry of the 4 months stipulated in the Article 408 mentioned above"\u000a50. The Respondent State alleges that in the case under consideration, starting from the date of the\u000anotification of the unjustified dismissal of his case by the Minister for Economy, Finance and Budget, the\u000acomplainant should have, within 2 months, brought an appeal either to the same administrative authority, or\u000ato the Head of Government as a higher administrative authority.\u000a51. The Respondent State contends that such an early administrative appeal would have allowed the\u000aComplainant to have the negative decision annulled. Otherwise, the Complainant should have secured the\u000areal grounds for the dismissal of his claims to allow him make a submission for an annulment at the expiry\u000aof the above mentioned deadlines.\u000a52. The Respondent State alleges that since the refusal of the Minister was an administrative decision, the\u000aAdministrative Chamber of the Supreme Court was competent to deal with its annulment, in accordance\u000awith the provisions of Article 3 of law No. 17-99 of 15th April 1999 modifying and supplementing certain\u000aprovisions of law No. 025-92 of 20th August 1992 and law No. 30-94 of 18th October 1994 governing the\u000aorganisation and functioning of the Supreme Court. This article stipulates that: "the Supreme Court shall\u000arule on appeals relating to abuses of power lodged against decisions from various authorities".\u000a53. Finally the Respondent State stresses that the Complainant, an attorney by profession, is hardly\u000aignorant of the procedural subtleties of Congolese law and that under the circumstances, he should have\u000asubmitted his grievances beforehand to the Congolese Courts which have primacy over subsidiary\u000ainternational appeals.\u000a54. The Respondent State concluded that the Complainant did not resort to any internal remedy after the\u000aadministrative decision rejecting his case and, in consequence, did not comply with one of the essential\u000arules governing the admissibility of communications before the African Commission, namely that of\u000aexhaustion of local remedies.\u000a55. All the conditions laid down by Article 56 have been fulfilled by this communication. However, the rule\u000astipulating the exhaustion of local remedies as a requirement for the submission of a communication before\u000athe African Commission assumes that the Respondent State should first of all have the opportunity to\u000acompensate, by its own means and within the context of its system of domestic law, for any prejudice that\u000amay have been caused to an individual.\u000a56. The African Commission, in communications 48/90, 50/91 [52/91] and 89/93 Amnesty International [et]\u000aal./Sudan, ruled that all local remedies, if they exist, if they are of a legal nature, are effective and are not\u000asubordinate to the discretionary power of the public authorities, should be exhausted.\u000a57. The [African] Commission is of the view that the Complainant has exhausted all local remedies in\u000aendeavouring to assert his right to compensation for the prejudice suffered and rejects the Respondent\u000aState's claims that he should have appealed against the decision of the Minister before seizing the [African]\u000aCommission.\u000a58. The [African] Commission notes that no strict legal provision grants the Minister responsible for the\u000abudget any authority to refuse to pay damages which are legally granted. The execution of the judgments\u000amade against the Respondent State therefore appears to be subject to the regular procedure provided for\u000ain the Administrative Procedure Code (Article 293 and the following ones).\u000a59. Under these circumstances, the question which arises is whether the complainant should have initiated\u000athe procedures of forced execution against the Respondent State as provided for by the Administrative\u000aProcedure Code. The [African] Commission considers that it is unreasonable to require from a citizen who\u000ahas won the case of a payable debt against the State at the end of a legal proceedings to institute\u000aprocedures of seizure against it (assuming that it is possible to resort to this means of imposition against\u000athe public authorities). As it happened, the Complainant, having duly notified his judgment to the competent\u000aauthorities in accordance with the relevant articles of the Administrative Procedure Code, he had a right to\u000aexpect the immediate execution of his judgment.1\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000a60. The [African] Commission is of the view that the Minister had no right to hinder or delay the execution of\u000aa final judgment without legitimate reason. The [African] Commission observes that the decision of the\u000aMinister was unjustified and that the Respondent State did not, at any time try to clarify to the [African]\u000aCommission the reasons for the refusal by its Officer. In this context, the [African] Commission supports the\u000aposition of the European Court according to which even the inability of the Respondent State to pay could\u000anot justify the refusal by the Minister to execute a final judgment.2\u000a61. Furthermore, the [African] Commission considers that the appeal provided for in Article 402 of the\u000aAdministrative Procedure Code does not constitute a legal remedy which can be used by the complainant.\u000aThe [African] Commission reiterates that local remedies, if any, should be legal, effective and not subject to\u000athe discretionary powers of the public Authorities. Concerning the appeal for annulment provided for in\u000aArticle 410 of the Administrative Procedure Code, the [African] Commission is not convinced that it would\u000ahave allowed the Complainant to gain satisfaction. Even a ruling by the Supreme Court setting aside the\u000aunjustified decision of the Minister would have given the Complainant the power to demand the execution\u000aof his judgment without however providing him with any means to enforce this ruling. Under these\u000acircumstances, the [African] Commission considers this remedy as ineffective.\u000a62. In conclusion, even assuming that the above-mentioned appeals had enabled the complainant to\u000arecover his debt, the [African] Commission observes that the complainant had not been informed of the\u000areasons underlying the decision of the Minister, a decision about which, moreover, he does not appear to\u000ahave been notified.\u000a63. For these reasons and considering the fact that the complainant had duly exhausted all local remedies,\u000athe African Commission declares the communication admissible.\u000aMerits\u000a64. The Complainant alleges the violation of Article 2 of the African Charter which stipulates that "Every\u000aindividual has the right to enjoy the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present\u000aCharter..." and the violation of Article 3 of the African Charter which stipulates that "Every individual shall be\u000aequal before the law, every individual shall be entitled to equal protection of the law".\u000a65. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State does not treat its citizens in the same manner\u000aand does not guarantee the total equality of its citizens before the law by leaving it to the discretion of the\u000aMinister of the Economy, Finance and the Budget to choose which judgments to honour. In support of his\u000aallegations, he alludes to the letter of the Permanent Secretary of the Minister dated 30th December 1999\u000awhich rejects, without justification, the request for execution of his judgment and those of two other people.\u000a66. It is important to point out here that a judgment rendered in the presence of both Parties had jointly and\u000aseverally condemned the Republic of Congo and the Mayor's Office of Brazzaville to pay the Complainant\u000athe amounts of 180,000,000 FCFA representing principal and 15,000,000 FCFA representing damages and\u000ainterest, in compensation for the prejudice caused to his personal assets and property by the soldiers and\u000aofficers of the national Police Force during the socio-political upheavals of 1993. Neither the Republic of\u000aCongo, nor the Brazzaville Mayor's Office lodged an appeal against the judgment, so that the latter became\u000afinal on the 19th March 1997. On the 30th December 1999, with no apparent reason, the Permanent\u000aSecretary of the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Budget informed the Minister of Justice about his\u000arefusal to execute the judgment of the Complainant.\u000a67. The Respondent State does not oppose the facts alleged in this communication but refutes the\u000aallegations of discrimination. It retorts that the three individuals affected by the Minister's refusal do not\u000acome from the same ethnic group or region nor do they share the same religion or political opinion. One of\u000athe individuals concerned is even said to be a former Minister of the Government who was actually holding\u000aoffice at the time of the rejection. Under the circumstances, the Congolese State contends that the\u000acommunication constitutes an abuse of rights in terms of Rule 144(1)(c) of the African Commission's Rules\u000aof Procedure.\u000a68. The two provisions cited by the Complainant repose, on the one hand, on the principle of\u000anon-discrimination and on the other, on that of equality. These principles mean that citizens should be\u000atreated in a fair and equitable manner before the law and have the right to enjoy, with no distinction\u000awhatsoever, the rights guaranteed by the Charter. The right to equality is all the more important since it\u000adetermines the possibility for the individual to enjoy many other rights.\u000a69. Like Article 14\u000a\u000a5\u000a\u000a× The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without\u000adiscrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion,\u000anational or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u000aof the European Convention, Article 2 does not stipulate a general banning of discrimination; it only\u000aprohibits discrimination where it affects the enjoyment of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter. The\u000a[African] Commission considers that the Complainant has not adequately supported his claims of\u000adiscrimination to show that this Article has been violated; besides, his not having proven how the enjoyment\u000aof one of the rights guaranteed by the Charter had been hindered in a discriminatory manner, his complaint\u000ais not based on any of the grounds of discrimination listed out in Article 2 or on grounds similar to the latter.\u000a70. Nonetheless, the [African] Commission notes that Article 3 of the African Charter contains a general\u000aguarantee of equality which supplements the ban on discrimination provided for in Article 2. In this regard,\u000athe African Charter differs from the European Convention [on Human Rights] and draws inspiration from the\u000aAgreement on Civil and Political Rights [sic]. Equality before the law, protected by Article 3(1) relates to the\u000astatus of individuals before the law. Equal protection by the law, guaranteed in Article 3(2) relates to the\u000aimplementation of the law and is applicable where the rights of the Complainant are implemented\u000aunequally.\u000a71. The [African] Commission further notes that for Article 3 to be applicable, the inequality alleged by the\u000aComplainant should follow from the 'law'. In this context, the legislative or regulatory Act constitutes the\u000amost unambiguous form of law. It is obvious however that Member States could easily circumvent the\u000aCharter i[f] the term 'law' were to be restricted to these formal methods of legislating. The [African]\u000aCommission is of the opinion that the Member States would violate Article 3 if they were to exercise a\u000apower or judgment conferred by a law in a discriminatory manner. As it happens, the refusal by the Minister\u000aof the Economy, Finance and the Budget is not based on any specific legislative authority. Nevertheless,\u000athe [African] Commission feels that it was incumbent on the Minister to honour the judgment by virtue of the\u000arule of law and of the principle of the res judicata.\u000a72. In this context the [African] Commission observes that the complainant was unjustifiably refused the\u000aimplementation of a legal ruling which had the character of res judicata. The Minister of the Economy,\u000aFinance and the Budget rejected his request for execution as well as that of two other individuals for no\u000aapparent reason. In [its] claims before the African Commission, the Respondent State did not put forward\u000aany argument to explain the decision of the Minister in rejecting the Complainant's claim. Moreover, in its\u000asubmissions dated 30th March 2004 in reaction to the Complainant's arguments, the State has quoted\u000avictims of the same violent events who have been compensated. The Minister thereby transformed the right\u000aof the Complainant to an effective remedy before the Courts into an illusion and denied him the right to fair\u000alegal compensation. Under these circumstances, the [African] Commission is of the view that the decision\u000aof the Minister arbitrarily deprived the Complainant of the protection of the law accorded to other citizens in\u000aaccordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Charter.\u000a73. Furthermore, although the Complainant does not specifically mention this Article of the Charter, the\u000aexamination of the facts shows a violation of Article 7 of the Charter concerning the right to fair trial. The\u000aeffective exercise of this right by individuals requires that:\u000a"All State Institutions against which an appeal has been lodged or a legal ruling has been pronounced\u000aconform fully with this ruling or this appeal." 3\u000a74. The [African] Commission notes that in similar instances, the European Court of Human Rights\u000adeclared that the right to access to a Court guaranteed by Article 6(1)\u000a× In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is\u000aentitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal\u000aestablished by law. Judgement shall be pronounced publicly by the press and public may be excluded from\u000aall or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society,\u000awhere the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or the extent\u000astrictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the\u000ainterests of justice.\u000aof the European Convention on Human Rights would be illusory if the domestic laws of a State allowed a\u000afinal and binding legal ruling to remain ineffective to the detriment of one Party. The Court therefore ruled\u000athat the execution of a judgment, no matter from what jurisdiction, should be considered as being an\u000aintegral part of the 'proceedings' in accordance with Article 6. The Court further recognised that the\u000aeffective protection of the person to be tried and the re-establishment of legality constituted an obligation for\u000a6\u000a\u000athe State to comply with a judgment or ruling pronounced by the highest Court in the land. In consequence,\u000aby virtue of this Article, the execution of a legal ruling can neither be unduly prevented, nullified nor\u000adelayed. 4\u000a75. The [African] Commission is also of the view that the right to be heard guaranteed by Article 7 of the\u000aAfrican Charter includes the right to the execution of a judgment. It would therefore be inconceivable for this\u000aArticle to grant the right for an individual to bring an appeal before all the national courts in relation to any\u000aact violating the fundamental rights without guaranteeing the execution of judicial rulings. To interpret\u000aArticle 14 any other way would lead to situations which are incompatible with the rule of law. As a result,\u000athe execution of a final judgment passed by a Tribunal or legal court should be considered as an integral\u000apart of the right to be heard which is protected by Article 7.\u000a76. Furthermore, the [African] Commission considers that the refusal by the Minister to honour the\u000ajudgment passed in favour of the Complainant also constitutes a violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\u000aAlthough the complainant only alluded to this Article at the moment of his argument, the [African]\u000aCommission considers that his initial claims sufficiently supported a claim of violation of the right to\u000aproperty. Drawing inspiration from the jurisprudence of the European Court for Human Rights under Article\u000a1 of Protocol No. 1\u000a× 1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be\u000adeprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law\u000aand by the general principles of international law.\u000aThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as\u000ait deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the\u000apayment of taxes or other contributions or penalties."\u000aof the European Convention on Human Rights,5 the [African] Commission considers that a monetary\u000acompensation granted by judgment having acquired the authority of res judicata should be considered as\u000aan asset. Therefore, the unjustified refusal of the Respondent State to honour the final judgment passed in\u000afavour of the Complainant hindered the enjoyment of his assets.\u000a77. The African Commission appreciates the fact that in spite of the situation which was then prevailing in\u000athe Republic of Congo during the period under review, the Court had been able to act rapidly and firmly in\u000apronouncing the judgments in a bid to restore the rule of law.\u000a78. The African Commission nonetheless remains conscious of the fact that without a system of effective\u000aexecution, other forms of private justice can spring up and have negative consequences on the confidence\u000aand credibility of the public in the justice system.\u000a79. Finally, the [African] Commission wishes to make some comments with regard to the claims of the\u000aComplainant based on Article 21(2) of the Charter. This Article stipulates that "in case of spoliation the\u000adispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of their property as well as to an adequate\u000acompensation". The Complainant contends that the Respondent State violated this Article in refusing to\u000ahonour a judgment of the Brazzaville High Court upholding the total responsibility of the Respondent State\u000aand that of the Brazzaville Mayor's Office in relation to the looting of his assets by the soldiers and the\u000aunruly elements of the National Police Force.\u000a80. The African Charter does not provide a definition of the concept of 'people' that is found in Articles 19 to\u000a24. This concept nonetheless defines third generation rights whose recognition constitutes the main\u000adistinctive feature of the African Charter. Article 21 of the Charter is one of these rights; it guarantees to all\u000apeoples the right to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. Under the terms of this Article, a\u000apeople stripped of their wealth and natural resources ha[ve] the right to the recovery of its property and to\u000aan adequate compensation.\u000a81. In communication 155/96 (2001) Social and Economic Rights Action Center, Centre for Economic and\u000aSocial Rights/Nigeria, the African Commission recalled in the following terms, the origin of Article 21: "[This]\u000aprovision dates back to the colonial period during which the material and human resources of Africa had\u000abeen greatly exploited by foreign powers, thus creating a tragedy for the Africans themselves, depriving\u000athem of their inalienable rights and land". Considering its nature and its objective, this Article can only be\u000areferred to in the exclusive interest of a people that has the legitimate right to an adequate compensation\u000aas well as to the recovery of its assets in case of spoliation.\u000a82. In this case, the movable and immovable property of the complainant that had been destroyed during\u000athe socio-political events which shook the country in 1993 does not constitute the wealth and natural\u000aresources of a people but rather individual assets. It is important to point out that in the present\u000acommunication the complainant is acting on his own behalf and on behalf of a group of individuals or of a\u000a7\u000a\u000apopulation living in a given territory. Under these circumstances, the African Commission does not find any\u000aviolation of Article 21(2) of the African Charter.\u000a83. The Complainant also requests the [African] Commission to prescribe the Respondent State to pay him\u000adamages and a daily penalty for delay in payment of the sum granted to him by a court ruling, which he\u000aestimates at 200.000.000 FCFA [and] 50.000.000 FCFA respectively.\u000a84. The [African] Commission, although admitting that the Complainant suffered some loss due to the delay\u000ain the payment of the sum granted by Congolese courts, does not consider itself in a position to put a figure\u000ato the loss. This is the reason why, relying on its jurisprudence, especially its decision on communication\u000a59/916 , the [African] Commission recommends that the amount of the compensation be determined\u000aaccording to Congolese legislation.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the African Commission\u000aObserves that the Republic of Congo is in violation of Articles 3, 7 and 14 of the African Charter;\u000aSays that there was no violation of Articles 2 and 21(2) of the African Charter;\u000aUrges the Republic of Congo to harmonise its legislation with that of the African Charter;\u000aRequests the Republic of Congo to compensate the Complainant as required by paying him the amount\u000afixed by the High Court of Brazzaville, namely the global amount of 195,037,000 FCFA equivalent to\u000a297,333.00 euros;\u000aFurther requests the Republic of Congo to pay compensation for the loss suffered by the Complainant, the\u000aamount of which shall be determined in accordance with Congolese legislation.\u000a\u000aDone at the 40th Ordinary Session of the African Commission held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 15th\u000a- 29th November 2006.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 See the decision of the European Court on Human Rights in the case Metaxas vs. Greece, no. 8415/02,\u000apara. 19, 27th May 2004.\u000a2 Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/03, para 34\u000a× The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil\u000arights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal; in this way it embodies the "right to a court", of\u000awhich the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes\u000aone aspect. However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a\u000afinal, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable\u000athat Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are\u000afair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article\u000a6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to\u000alead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook\u000ato respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be\u000aregarded as an integral part of the "trial" for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of\u000a19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, p. 510, § 40)\u000a7th May 2002, and Ruianu vs. Rumania, no. 34647/97, 17th June 2003.\u000a3 See Guidelines and Principles on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa.\u000a4 See, among others, the rulings on Hornsby v.

aV254/02 Mouvement des réfugiés mauritaniens au\u000aSénégal pour la defense des droits de l'Homme /\u000aSenegal\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The Complainant alleges that on the eve of the demonstration by the refugees of Podor in\u000acommemoration of the International Refugee Day, the Prefect of the town of Podor banned the said\u000ademonstration.\u000a2. The Complainant does not show whether he had complied with the necessary procedures to obtain\u000aauthorisation for the demonstration. He however points out that he had sent the programme of the\u000ademonstration to the following institutions and persons: African Commission; UN High Commissioner for\u000aRefugees; Commission for Assistance to Returnees and Displaced Persons; Governor of Saint-Louis;\u000aPrefect of Podor; Deputy Prefect of Thille Boubacar and the press.\u000a3. The text of the decision of the Prefect of Podor banning the demonstration which was scheduled to take\u000aplace on Thursday 20th and Friday 21st June 2002 in the towns of Madina Moussa, Diolly, Podor and\u000aNgaolé was dated 19th June 2002, citing the need to keep law and order as the reason for this action.\u000a4. The submission of the Complainant includes the programme of the demonstration sent to the above\u000amentioned institutions and persons, the decision of the Prefect of Podor dated 19th June 2002 banning the\u000ademonstration scheduled to take place on Thursday 20th and Friday 21st June 2002 in towns of Madina\u000aMoussa, Diolly, Podor and Ngaolé.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a5. The Complainant alleges that Senegal violated Articles 5, 9 and 11 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a6. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 6th August 2002.\u000a7. On 12th August 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the\u000acommunication and informed the Complainant that the complaint was registered and would be considered\u000aat the 32nd Ordinary Session scheduled to take place in Banjul, The Gambia, from 17th to 31st October\u000a2002.\u000a8. At the 32nd Ordinary Session held from 17th to 23rd October 2002 in Banjul, The Gambia, after\u000aconsidering the communication, the African Commission decided to be seized with the said communication.\u000a9. On 30th October 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the\u000aabove-mentioned decision and asked them to provide it with more information on the admissibility of the\u000acommunication, in accordance with Article 56 of the African Charter. It also sent a copy of the\u000acommunication to the Respondent State. It requested the parties to send their written observations to the\u000aSecretariat within two months after notification of the decision.\u000a10. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\u000aconsidered this communication and declared it inadmissible.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a11. The admissibility of the communications submitted under Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\u000aby the conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter. The applicable provision in this particular case\u000ais that of Article 56(5) which stipulates that: "communications....shall be considered if they: (5)...are sent\u000aafter exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...".\u000a12. In the case under consideration, the Complainant alleges that on the eve of the demonstration for the\u000acommemoration of the International Refugee Day, the Prefect of the town of Podor issued a ban of the\u000a1\u000a\u000ademonstration by Mauritanian refugees.\u000a13. The Complainant filed the decision of the Prefect of Podor banning the demonstration scheduled to take\u000aplace on 20th and 21st June 2002 in the towns of Madina Moussa, Diolly, Podor and Ngaolé.\u000a14. In the Complainant's written observations, it is alleged that according to the information received, the\u000aprocedure applied in such a case by Conseil d'Etat would be unduly prolonged, but without elaborating\u000ahow.\u000a15. In its response, the Respondent State refers to the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter and\u000aRule 116 of its [sic] Rules of Procedure which provides for the exhaustion of local remedies as a\u000arequirement for the African Commission to rule on the admissibility of communications.\u000a16. The Respondent State also recalls that the guidelines for submission of communications provide that\u000aeach communication should particularly indicate that local remedies have been exhausted.\u000a17. The representative of the Respondent State stated during the 33rd Ordinary Session that the\u000aComplainant had not undertaken any efforts to challenge the decision banning the demonstration.\u000a18. She pointed out the decision complained of was an administrative measure against which the\u000aComplainant could have taken legal action and obtained redress in the following two ways:\u000a1. Appeal to a higher administrative authority which consists of seizing the hierarchical authority for\u000aabuse of authority, including the Governor, the Minister of Interior, the Prime Minister and, finally,\u000athe President of the Republic in accordance with the Institutional Act No. 92-24 of 30th May 1992\u000arelating to Conseil d'Etat as amended and Article 729 of the Code of Civil Procedure;\u000a2. Administrative law action, through seizure of Conseil d'Etat cancelling the administrative decision\u000acomplained of for abuse of authority.\u000a19. The representative of the Respondent State demonstrated that these local remedies existed but that\u000athe Complainant had not utilised any of them. She further pointed out that in emergency cases, the\u000aprocedure of hour by hour interim order in an urgent case was also available to those seeking justice. She\u000atherefore concluded that the Complainant had not exhausted local remedies.\u000a20. In light of the above submissions, the African Commission notes that the Complainant did not provide\u000aproof of attempting to exhaust the local remedies that were available to him.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor these reasons, the African Commission, Declares the communication inadmissible for\u000anon-exhaustion of local remedies.\u000aTaken at the 33rd Ordinary Session in Niamey, Niger, May 2003.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a

aV256/02 Samuel Kofi Woods, II and Kabineh M. Ja'neh /\u000aLiberia\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The complaint is filed by Mr Samuel Kofi Woods, II and Mr Kabineh M. Ja'neh on behalf of Hassan Bility,\u000aAnsumana Kamara and Mohamed Kamara, all Liberian journalists for the independent Analyst Newspaper\u000ain Monrovia.\u000a2. The Complainants allege that in the afternoon of 24th June 2002, plain-cloth[ed] state security officers\u000afrom the National Police Force, National Security Agency, National Bureau of Investigation, Fire Service,\u000aImmigration, Ministry of Defence, Anti-Terrorist Unit, Special Security Service, and Ministry of National\u000aSecurity arrested Hassan Bility, Ansumana Kamara and Mohammed Kamara, all journalists working for the\u000aindependent Analyst Newspaper in Monrovia.\u000a3. The complaint also alleges that the said arrest and detention of the journalists was not disputed as the\u000aMinister of Information, Mr Reginald Goodridge has confirmed the same. To date, there was no charge\u000aproffered [sic] against them and they continue to languish in detention, which is in contravention of the\u000aAfrican Charter, the Constitution of Liberia and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\u000a4. It is alleged that in consideration of the available constitutional local remedies vis-?-vis the arbitrary\u000aarrest and detention of these journalists, and further to the petition filed by an assortment of human rights\u000aorganisations in Liberia filed a petition at the First Judicial Circuit Court, Criminal Assizes "B" of\u000aMontserrado County, the latter issued a Special Writ of Habeas Corpus, which, however, was allegedly not\u000acomplied with.\u000a5. The Complainants further allege that the subsequent announcement by the Liberian Government of its\u000aintention to arraign the detained journalist before a military tribunal would restrain, deprive and deny them\u000aof their human rights to liberty, freedom and due process of laws as enshrined in the Liberian Constitution,\u000athe African Charter, and the UDHR.\u000a6. Together with their complaint the Complainants submitted a request for provisional measures to the\u000aAfrican Commission in accordance with Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a7. The Complainants allege violations of Articles 6, 7(b), and 7(d) of the African Charter.\u000a8. The Complainants pray that in addition to provisionally ordering the immediate release of the detainees\u000ain consonance with Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, the Commission grant\u000aany and all other remedies/redress that it shall deem right and appropriate.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a9. The Complaint was dated 9th August 2002 and received at the Secretariat on 16th August 2002 by post.\u000a10. At its 32nd Ordinary Session held from 17th to 23rd October 2002 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a11. On 23rd October 2002, the African Commission appealed to His Excellency Charles Taylor, President of\u000athe Republic of Liberia, respectfully urging him to intervene in the matter being complained of pending the\u000aoutcome of the consideration of the complaint before the African Commission.\u000a12. On 4th November 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants and Respondent State to inform\u000athem that the African Commission had been seized of the communication and requested them to forward\u000atheir submissions on admissibility before the 33rd Ordinary Session of the [African] Commission.\u000a13. The Secretariat requested the parties on several to submit their arguments on admissibility.\u000a14. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered this communication and declared it inadmissible.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a15. Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that "a communication be introduced subsequent to\u000aexhaustion of local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that the procedure for\u000asuch recourse is abnormally prolonged".\u000a16. The Complainants have, despite repeated requests, however, not furnished their submissions on\u000aadmissibility, especially on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor this reasons, and in accordance with Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the African\u000aCommission,\u000aDeclares this communication inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a

aV266/03 Kevin Mgwanga Gunme et al / Cameroon\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The Complainants are 14 individuals who brought the communication on their behalf and on behalf of the\u000apeople of Southern Cameroon1 against the Republic of Cameroon, a State Party to the African Charter on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights.\u000a2. The Complain[an]ts allege violations which can be traced to the period shortly after "La Republique du\u000aCameroun" became independent on 1st January 1960. The Complainants state that Southern Cameroon\u000awas a United Nations Trust Territory administered by the British, separately from the Francophone part of\u000athe Republic of Cameroon, itself a French administered United Nations Trust Territory. Both became UN\u000aTrust Territories at the end of the 2nd World War, on 13 December 1946 under the UN Trusteeship System.\u000a3. The Complainants allege that during the 1961 UN plebiscite, Southern Cameroonians were offered "two\u000aalternatives" , namely: a choice to join Nigeria or Cameroon. They voted for the later. Subsequently,\u000aSouthern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun, negotiated and adopted the September 1961\u000aFederal Constitution, at Foumban, leading to the formation of the Federal Republic of Cameroon on 1st\u000aOctober 1961. The Complainants allege further that the UN plebiscite ignored a third alternative, namely\u000athe right to independence and statehood for Southern Cameroon.\u000a4. The Complainants allege that the overwhelming majority of Southern Cameroonians preferred\u000aindependence to the two alternatives offered during the UN plebiscite. They favoured a prolonged period of\u000atrusteeship to allow for further evaluation of a third alternative. They allege further that the September 1961\u000aFederal Constitution did not receive the endorsement of the Southern Cameroon House of Assembly.\u000a5. The Complainants allege that the violations suffered by the people of Southern Cameroon emanate from\u000athe UN plebiscite of 11 February 1961 organised to determine the political future of Southern Cameroon,\u000aand the failure by the Respondent State to abide by the 1961 Federal Constitutional[sic].\u000a6. They allege that on 1st October 1961 La République du Cameroun, with the tacit approval of the British\u000agovernment, drafted gendarmes, police and soldiers from the Francophone side into Southern Cameroon,\u000awhich amounted to "forceful annexation" of Southern Cameroon. They allege that, >"[a]t no time was\u000asovereignty over Southern Cameroon transferred to a new Federal United Cameroons or any other entity."\u000aThey argue that the failure to exercise the third alternative, impacted negatively on the right of the people of\u000aSouthern Cameroon to self determination.\u000a7. The Complainants allege further that "notwithstanding the forceful annexation," the people of Southern\u000aCameroon remained a separate and distinct people. Their official working language is English, whereas the\u000apeople in La République du Cameroun are Francophones. The legal, educational and cultural traditions of\u000athe two parts remained different, as was the character of local administration. In spite of the foregoing, they\u000aallege further that the Respondent State manipulate [sic] demographic data to deny the people of Southern\u000aCameroon equal rights to representation in government. They allege that the people of Southern Cameroon\u000ahave been denied powerful positions within the national/federal government. They claim that the\u000aSeptember 1961 Federal Constitution was designed to respect those differences.\u000a8. The Complainants allege further that from the outset of unification in 1961, and the declaration of a\u000aunitary state in 1972, Southern Cameroonians remain marginalised. They allege that Southern Cameroon\u000awas allocated 20% instead of 22% of the seats in the Federal/National Assembly, as per the population\u000aratio, thus denying them equal representation. They allege that in 1961 West Cameroon was allocated 20\u000arepresentatives in the Federal Assembly instead of 26. Later when representation to the Assembly was\u000aexpanded to 180 representatives, West Cameroon was allocated 35 representatives, instead of 40\u000arepresentatives. The Complainants allege further that the Francophones occupy local administrative\u000apositions in Southern Cameroon, and abuse their positions to amass land, and access economic\u000aresources, while the Southern Cameroonians play the minutest role at the local or national level.\u000a9. It is further alleged that several towns in Southern Cameroon were denied basic infrastructure, hence\u000adenying them the right to development. It is alleged that the Respondent State, relocated or located various\u000aeconomic enterprises and projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, the deep seaport, and the oil\u000arefinery to towns and cities in Francophone Cameroon, notwithstanding their lack of economic viability,\u000athereby denying employment opportunities and secondary economic benefits to the people of Southern\u000aCameroon.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000a10. The Complainants allege further that the Francophones have monopolistic control of the Ministry of\u000aNational Education. That the Respondent State has under funded primary education in Southern\u000aCameroon, it failed to build new schools, understaffed primary schools, and it is closing all teacher training\u000acolleges. They allege further that the Respondent State "Cameroonised" the GCE from the University of\u000aLondon, leading to mass protests which forced government to create an independent GCE Board. That,\u000aupon unification, diplomas awarded by the City & Guild, a technical education institution based in England,\u000awere replaced by the Certificat d'Aptitude Professionelle (CAP) and the BAC Technique. These measures\u000ahave resulted in persistent high levels of illiteracy in many areas in Southern Cameroon.\u000a11. The Complainants allege that political unification and the application of the civil law system resulted in\u000athe discrimination against Anglophones in the legal and judicial system. Southern Cameroonian companies\u000aand businesses were forced to operate under the civil law system. The Companies Ordinance of the\u000aFederation of Nigeria, which was until then applicable in Southern Cameroon, was abolished. Many\u000aSouthern Cameroonian businesses went bankrupt, following the refusal by Francophone banks to lend\u000athem finances, in some cases, unless their articles of association were drafted in French.\u000a12. They allege that Anglophones facing criminal charges were transferred to the Francophone zone for\u000atrial, under the Napoleonic Code, thereby adversely affecting their civil rights. The Complainants state that\u000athe common law presumption of innocence upon arrest is not recognised under the civil law tradition, since\u000aguilt is presumed upon arrest and detention. The courts conduct trial in the French language without\u000ainterpreters. Furthermore, they allege that Southern Cameroon court decisions are ignored by the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a13. The Complainants allege that the entry by the Respondent State as a State Party to the Organisation\u000apour l'Harmonisation des Droits d'Affaires en Afrique (OHADA), a treaty for the harmonisation of business\u000alegislation amongst Francophone countries in Africa, constituted discrimination against the people of\u000aSouthern Cameroon on the basis of language. OHADA stipulates that the language of interpretation of the\u000atreaty shall be French. The Complainants argue that the Constitution recognises English and French as the\u000aofficial languages of Cameroon. They argue therefore that by signing the OHADA treaty, Cameroon\u000aviolated the language rights of the English speaking people of Cameroon. They allege that any company\u000anot registered under the OHADA law cannot open a bank account in Cameroon.\u000a14. The Complainants allege further that, on 3rd April 1993, representatives of the people of Anglophone\u000aCameroon adopted the Buea Declaration, which declared the preparedness of the Anglophones "... to\u000aparticipate in the forthcoming constitutional talks with their Francophone brothers...". The Declaration stated\u000athat:\u000a1. "...the imposition of the Unitary State on Anglophone Cameroon in 1972 was unconstitutional, illegal\u000a2.\u000aand a breach of faith,\u000a3. That the only redress adequate to right the wrongs done to Anglophone Cameroon and its people\u000asince the imposition of the Unitary state is a return to the original form of government of the\u000aReunified Cameroon,\u000a4. That to this end, all Cameroonians of Anglophone heritage are committed to working for the\u000arestoration of a federal Constitution and a federal form of government, which takes cognizance of\u000athe bicultural nature of Cameroon and under which citizens shall be protected against such\u000aviolations as have been enumerated.\u000a5. That the survival of Cameroon in peace and harmony depends upon the attainment of this objective\u000atowards which all patriotic Cameroonians, Francophones as well as Anglophones, should\u000arelentlessly work."\u000a15. Subsequent to the 1993 Buea Declaration, it is alleged that between 29th April and 1st May 1994, the\u000aSecond Anglophone Conference convened in Bamenda adopted the Bamenda Proclamation, which stated,\u000ainter alia, that: "....one year since the Anglophone constitutional proposals were officially submitted, the\u000agovernment had not reacted to them;\u000athat all efforts to generate the interest and understanding of the Francophone officials and Francophone\u000apublic generally in the Anglophone constitutional proposals had been greeted with responses ranging from\u000aindifference through apathy to hostility..."\u000aIN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING the Anglophone people of Cameroon...; reiterated the Resolution\u000ataken at its first session in April 1993... It stated further in paragraph 6 of the Proclamation that; "6. Should\u000athe Government either persist in its refusal to engage in meaningful constitutional talks or fail to engage in\u000a2\u000a\u000asuch talks within a reasonable time, the Anglophone Council shall inform the Anglophone people by all\u000asuitable means. It shall, thereupon, proclaim the revival of the independence and sovereignty of the\u000aAnglophone territory of Southern Cameroon and take all measures necessary to secure, defend and\u000apreserve the independence, sovereignty and integrity of the said territory." (emphasis added)\u000a16. The Complainants allege that the failure by the Respondent State to address the concerns of the\u000aSouthern Cameroon people for a new constitution, coupled with the adoption of the 1995 December\u000aConstitution by the National Assembly of La République du Cameroun without public debate, meant that\u000athe door was being finally closed on any future constitutional links between the Southern Cameroon and La\u000aRépublique du Cameroun. Henceforth, the Complainants decided to conduct a signature referendum, in\u000aview of >"the hostile atmosphere created by the occupying power... which would not want to allow any form\u000aof consultation which might reveal the true suppressed aspirations of the people of Southern Cameroons."\u000a17. The Complainants aver that between 1st and 30th September 1995, the Southern Cameroons National\u000aCouncil (SCNC) conducted a signature referendum which revealed that 99% of Southern Cameroonians\u000afavour full independence by peaceful separation from the Respondent State.\u000a18. Besides their claim for statehood, the Complainants allege further that human rights of various\u000aindividuals have been systematically violated by the Respondent State. The Complainants compiled eye\u000awitness accounts and field investigations relating to arbitrary arrests, detentions, torture, punishment,\u000amaiming and killings of persons who have advocated for the self determination of Southern Cameroon.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a19. The Complainants allege that;\u000a\u000a1. Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17(1), 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1), 24 of the African Charter\u000ahave been violated.\u000a2. the Republic of Cameroon has violated its general duty under Article 26 of the African Charter to\u000aguarantee the independence of the judiciary.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a20. The complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 9th January 2003.\u000a21. On 10 January 2003, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the complaint.\u000a22. On 19 January 2003, the Secretariat wrote another letter to the Complainants requesting for further\u000ainformation relating to the communication.\u000a23. On 21 April 2003, the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Complainants requesting them to forward their\u000aclarifications. By a letter dated 8 May 2003, Counsel for the Complainants sent the clarifications sought by\u000athe Secretariat.\u000a24. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15-29 May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\u000aconsidered the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\u000a25. On 9 June 2003, the Secretariat informed the parties that the African Commission had been seized with\u000athe matter and requested them to forward their submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000a26. On 9 September 2003, the Complainants informed the Secretariat that they would be forwarding their\u000asubmissions on admissibility and requested to make oral submissions at the 34th Session of the African\u000aCommission.\u000a27. On 22 September 2003, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submissions on admissibility along\u000awith supplemental evidence. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt thereof on the same day.\u000a28. On 3 October 2003, the Respondent State informed the Secretariat that it had not received a copy of\u000athe communication forwarded to it by DHL on 9th June 2003.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a29. On 6 October 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainant requesting for another copy of the\u000asupplemental evidence to be forwarded to the Respondent State.\u000a30. On 27 October 2003, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the Complainant's submissions on\u000aadmissibility to the Respondent State and informed the latter that the Secretariat would give the\u000aaccompanying documents to the delegation of Cameroon attending the 34th Ordinary Session. The\u000aSecretariat also informed the Respondent State that the DHL office in Cameroon had confirmed delivery of\u000athe communication.\u000a31. On 27 October 2003, the Secretariat received another copy of the supplemental evidence from the\u000aComplainant for onward transmission to the Respondent State. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of\u000athe same.\u000a32. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission examined the matter and decided to defer consideration on admissibility of the matter to the\u000a35th Ordinary Session because the Respondent State claimed that they were unaware of the\u000acommunication.\u000a33. On 14 November 2003, the Secretariat furnished the delegates representing the Respondent State at\u000athe 34th Ordinary Session with the following documents:\u000a\u2022 A copy of communication 266/2003;\u000a\u2022 A copy of the Complainants' submissions on admissibility and the accompanying documents.\u000a34. On 4 December 2003, both parties to the communication were informed of the decision of the African\u000aCommission to defer consideration of the matter on admissibility to the 35th Ordinary Session. The\u000aRespondent State was reminded to forward its submissions on admissibility to the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission within 3 months.\u000a35. On 5 March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the Respondent State's\u000asubmissions on admissibility and acknowledged receipt of the same on 9 March 2004.\u000a36. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21 May - 4 June 2004, the African\u000aCommission heard the oral submissions of the parties, and declared the communication admissible.\u000a37. On 15 June 2004, the Secretariat informed the parties about the African Commission's decision and\u000arequested them to submit their written submissions on the merits within 3 months.\u000a38. On 13 August 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a correspondence from the\u000aRespondent State, which was forwarded to the Complainant on 26 August 2004.\u000a39. On 20 September 2004, the Secretariat received the written submissions of the Respondent State on\u000amerits, which was transmitted to the Complainants on 12 November 2004.\u000a40. On 23 and 28 September 2004, the Secretariat received the written submissions of the Complainants\u000aon the merits, which was transmitted to the Respondent State on 12 November 2004.\u000a41. At its 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 24 November - 7 December 2004, the African\u000aCommission decided to defer its consideration on the merits to the next session. It also rejected an\u000aapplication to stay the proceedings by third parties purporting to represent the applicants claiming to have\u000aentered into negotiation with the Respondent State.\u000a42. On 23 December 2004, the Secretariat wrote to the said third parties informing them of this decision.\u000a43. The Commission also decided to forward the decision on admissibility of the communication to the\u000aRespondent State, upon its request.\u000a44. On 30 March 2005, the Secretariat received further submissions from the Complainants, who also\u000arequested to make an oral presentation to the next session.\u000a45. On 31 March 2005, the Secretariat handed over copies of the decision on admissibility and the various\u000asubmissions from the Complainants to the delegation of the Respondent State that visited the Secretariat\u000aon the same date.\u000a46. At the 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 27 April - 11 May 2005, the African\u000aCommission considered this communication and decided to defer its decision to the 38th Ordinary Session.\u000a47. On 7 May 2005, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of this decision.\u000a48. The Complainants were notified of the decision on 13 May 2005.\u000a49. On 7 June 2005, the Secretariat received submissions from the Complainant, which were sent to the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a50. On 12 July 2005, the Secretariat received submissions from the Respondent State, which were later\u000asent to the Complainant.\u000a4\u000a\u000a51. At the 38th Ordinary Session held from 21 November - 5 December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and deferred its decision on the merits to the 39th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a52. On 30 January 2006, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of this decision.\u000a53. The Complainants were notified of this decision on 5th February 2006.\u000a54. At the 39th Ordinary session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 11 - 25 May 2006, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to defer it for further consideration at the 40th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a55. At the 40th Ordinary session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 14 - 28 November 2006, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to defer its decision on the merits to the 41st\u000aSession.\u000a56. At the 41st Ordinary Session held in Accra, Ghana, from 16 - 30 May 2007 the Commission considered\u000athe communication and deferred its decision to allow more time for the Secretariat to conduct further\u000aresearch and finalise the draft decision.\u000a57. At the 42nd Ordinary session held in Brazzaville, Congo, from 14 - 28 November 2007, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to defer it for further consideration at the 43rd\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a58. At the 43rd Ordinary Session held in Ezulwini, Swaziland, from 7 - 22 May 2008, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to defer its decision on the merits to the 44th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a59. At the 44th Ordinary Session held in Abuja, Nigeria, from 10 - 24 November 2008, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to defer it to the 45th Ordinary Session in order to\u000afinalise the draft decision on the merits.\u000a60. During the 6th Extra Ordinary session held from 28 March - 3 April 2009 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aCommission considered the communication and resolved to finalise it during the 45th Ordinary Session.\u000a61. At the 45th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, between 13 and 27 May 2009, the\u000aCommission adopted the decision on the merits of the communication.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a62. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\u000aby the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This Article lays down seven (7) conditions,\u000awhich must be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\u000a63. Of the seven conditions, the Respondent State claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled four,\u000anamely: Articles 56(1), 56(2), 56(3) and 56(4). From the submissions of the Respondent State, there is an\u000ainference that Article 56(7) has not been fulfilled by the Complainant.\u000a64. The Respondent State submits that contrary to Article 56(1) of the African Charter, the victims of the\u000aalleged violations, indicated in the communication have not been identified.\u000a65. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that:\u000aCommunications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they:\u000a1. Indicate their authors even if the latter request anonymity\u000a66. In this particular matter, the African Commission notes that the authors of the communication have\u000abeen identified at page 1 of the communication and they are 14 in number. Their ages and professions\u000ahave also been given as well as their addresses of service. Furthermore, the communication reveals that\u000athe authors of the communication are members of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) and\u000athe Southern Cameroons Peoples' Organisation (SCAPO), organisations that were established principally\u000ato protect and advance the human and peoples' rights of Southern Cameroonians, including their right to\u000aself-determination.\u000a\u000a5\u000a\u000a67. Article 56(1) of the African Charter requires a communication to indicate its authors and not the victims\u000aof the violations. Thus the present communication cannot be declared inadmissible on the basis of Article\u000a56(1). In coming to this decision, the African Commission would like to refer to its decision in consolidated\u000acommunication - Malawi African Association et al/ Mauritania2 where it held that "Article 56.1 demands\u000asimply that communications should indicate the names of those submitting and not those of all the victims\u000aof the alleged violations".\u000a68. The Respondent State argues that this communication does not meet the requirements of Article 56(2),\u000abecause the Complainants are advocating for secession under the pretext of allegations of violation of the\u000aprovisions of the African Charter and other universal human rights instruments. While conceding that the\u000aright to self determination is an inalienable right, the Respondent State argues that the UN has established\u000athat this right should not "be interpreted as authorising or encouraging any measure that would partly or\u000awholly compromise the entire territory or the political unity of sovereign and independent States". The\u000aRespondent State submits further that it is established that the only entities likely as peoples to call for the\u000aexternal right to self determination from preexisting States are the "peoples under foreign subjugation,\u000adomination and exploitation".\u000a69. The Complainants argue that the communication meets the requirements in Article 56(2) because it\u000aalleges violations of the African Charter and other international human rights instruments.\u000a70. Article 56(2) provides that "Communications... received by the African Commission shall be considered\u000aif they:\u000a(2) are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter."\u000a71. The condition relating to compatibility with the African Charter basically requires that:\u000a\u2022 The communication should be brought against a State party to the African Charter3\u000a\u2022 The communication must allege prima facie violations of rights protected by the African Charter4\u000a\u2022 The communication should be brought in respect of violations that occurred after [the] State's\u000aratification of the African Charter, or where violations began before the State Party ratified the\u000aAfrican Charter, have continued even after such ratification5\u000a72. It is apparent to the African Commission that the present communication meets all the above\u000arequirements. The communication has been brought against Cameroon, which is State party to the African\u000aCharter. It reveals prima facie violations of the African Charter, all of which are alleged to have continued to\u000aoccur following Cameroon's ratification of the African Charter.\u000a73. The Respondent State also submits that the communication has been written in disparaging or insulting\u000alanguage. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants' use of the phrases such as "forceful\u000aannexation" and "State sponsored terrorism" to characterise violations by the government of Cameroon\u000aagainst the people of Southern Cameroons, allegedly committed between 1961 and 2002 and a report titled\u000a"Let My People Go Part II", are disparaging and insulting language, contrary to Article 56(3) of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a74. Article 56(3) of the African Charter provides that: Communications ... received by the Commission shall\u000abe considered if they: (3) Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State\u000aconcerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity.\u000a75. The African Commission acknowledges that the above-mentioned provision is quite subjective because\u000astatements that could be disparaging or insulting to one person may not be seen in the same light by\u000aanother person. Matters relating to human rights violations normally elicit strong language from the victims\u000aof the said violations. Nonetheless Complainants should endeavour to be respectful in the phrases they\u000achoose to use when presenting their communications.\u000a76. The Respondent State submits further that the Complainants are not the sole authors of some of the\u000adocuments and that the facts have been distorted.\u000a77. The Complainants submit that they did not author the offensive publication, but rely on it to buttress\u000atheir allegations. They argue further that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated\u000athrough the media. They state that the evidence in support of their allegations is based on eye-witness\u000aaccounts and documents prepared by those who have personal knowledge of the events and from official\u000arecords.\u000a78. Article 56(4) of the African Charter provides that: Communications ... received by the Commission shall\u000abe considered if they: (4) are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media\u000a6\u000a\u000a79. The African Commission has perused the appendices to the communication and has observed that they\u000acontain the following documents:\u000a\u2022 Appendix II is a publication by SCNC/SCAPO - Let my People Go!\u000a\u2022 Appendix IV contains court documents, namely a motion on notice, 2 affidavits, originating\u000asummons, a ruling of the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja, terms agreed by the parties to be\u000aembodied in the order of the court and an enrolment of order. [[/li]]\u000a\u2022 Exhibit SC contains among others numerous documents, declarations, agreements between\u000aGermany and Great Britain, UN General Assembly Resolutions, the Statute of the International\u000aCourt of Justice and the UN Charter, a Petition made by the Federal Republic of Southern\u000aCameroons to the United Nations etc.\u000a80. Article 56(4) relates to communications brought before the African Commission based exclusively on\u000anews disseminated through the mass media. Looking at the nature of documents described herein above, it\u000ais quite clear that the Complainants do not base their case on mass media news, but on official records and\u000adocuments, as well as international statutes. This clearly falls outside the ambit of Article 56(4).\u000a81. With respect to Article 56(5) , which relates to exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants submit\u000athat there are no local remedies to exhaust in respect of the claim for self-determination because this is a\u000amatter for an international forum and not a domestic one. They argue that the issue for determination in this\u000acommunication is whether or not the "union" of La République du Cameroun and Southern Cameroons was\u000aeffected in accordance with UN Resolutions, International Treaty obligations and indeed International law.\u000aThey assert that the right to self determination is a matter that cannot be determined by a domestic court.\u000a82. The Respondent State concedes that no local remedies exist with respect to the claim for self\u000adetermination. The Respondent State, however argues that, the right to self determination for the people of\u000aSouthern Cameroon was solved when the British Trusteeship over British Cameroon ended following the\u000aplebiscite of 11th and 12th February 1961. Furthermore, it argues that the 1963 International Court of\u000aJustice (ICJ) decision in the Northern Cameroon case found in favour of the Republic of Cameroon and put\u000athe matter of Southern Cameroon to rest. The Respondent State believes that the Complainants are\u000aseeking a similar declaratory decision which should not be entertained by the African Commission.\u000a83. The African Commission believes that this argument is an inference by the Respondent State that the\u000aComplainants have not met the conditions laid down in Article 56(7) of the African Charter. Article 56(7)\u000aprovides: Communications ... received by the African Commission shall be considered if they: (7) do not\u000adeal with cases which have been settled by these States involved in accordance with the principles of the\u000aCharter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or the provisions of the\u000apresent Charter.\u000a84. Article 56(7) of the African Charter bars the African Commission from entertaining cases that have been\u000asettled by another international settlement procedure.6 The issue that the African Commission needs to\u000aexamine is whether the abovementioned complaint has been settled by some other international settlement\u000aprocedure.\u000a85. The African Commission has read the judgment of the ICJ in the Northern Cameroons case7 . In that\u000acase the Government of the Republic of Cameroon asked the Court to declare whether, "in the application\u000aof the Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of the Cameroons under the British Administration, the\u000aUnited Kingdom failed, with regard to the Northern Cameroons, to respect certain obligations flowing from\u000athat Agreement."8\u000a86. It is the view of the African Commission that the matter before the ICJ was unrelated to the issues\u000abefore the African Commission. The African Commission states that for a matter to fall within the scope of\u000aArticle 56(7) of the African Charter it should have involved the same parties, the same issues, raised by the\u000acomplaint before the African Commission, and must have been settled by an international or regional\u000amechanism. The case before the ICJ was between the Republic of Cameroon and the United Kingdom,\u000aand involved the interpretation and application of the Trusteeship treaty. These facts clearly differ from the\u000acomplaint before the Commission. As such the case falls outside the scope of Article 56(7) of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a87. For the reasons outlined herein above, the African Commission declares this communication\u000aadmissible.\u000a\u000a7\u000a\u000aPreliminary issue raised by the Respondent State regarding the jurisdiction of the African Commission\u000a\u000a88. Before dwelling on the substance of the allegations, the Commission wishes to dispose of some\u000apreliminary legal issues raised by the Respondent State. The Respondent State questions the\u000aCommission's jurisdiction rationae temporis, and states the following: "...the complaint by the Complainants\u000acontains an impressive number of cases of so called massive violations of human rights which [are] alleged\u000ato have been carried out between 1961 and 2002. In this regard, the State of Cameroon refuses to\u000aacknowledge in limine litis the jurisdiction rationae temporis of the Commission with regard to acts before\u000a18 December 1989, the date of entry into force of the Charter."\u000a89. The Respondent State also challenged the notion, or the existence of a territory known as "Southern\u000aCameroon." It states as follows: "....it should be pointed out that in spite of the fact that the complainants\u000arefused to reveal their identities, they by no means ascertained to have been victims9 of violations imputed\u000ato the State of Cameroon. And even when they act on behalf of a so called territory called Southern\u000aCameroon. The State of Cameroon will point out that no territory exists called as such in the Republic of\u000aCameroon..."\u000a90. The Respondent State, similarly, questions the existence of a "people" known as "Southern\u000aCameroonians" and as such states that, "...[s]upposing that there are a people of Southern Cameroons,\u000anevertheless, it would have to be proven that it is entitled to claim its self determination, under the specific\u000aform of 'separate statehood'."\u000a91. The Commission proposes to deal, firstly, with the question of its jurisdiction then the question whether\u000athe people of "Southern Cameroon" exist as a "people" and whether the territory otherwise referred to as\u000a"Southern Cameroon" does exist, and if it does, can its "people" exercise their alleged "right to\u000aself-determination?"\u000aDecision on the preliminary issue of the Commission's jurisdiction rationae temporis\u000a\u000a92. The Respondent State raises objection to the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction rationae temporis.\u000aThe Complainants responded that although those violations were carried out before the African Charter\u000acame into force for Cameroon, they did not stop even after 18 December 1989.\u000a93. The Commission acknowledges the Respondent State's argument that its jurisdiction rationae temporis\u000ais limited in limine, and as such it cannot address violations retrospective [of] the entry into force of the\u000aCharter. The Commission is aware that the Africa Charter entered into force in respect of the Respondent\u000aState on 18 December 1989. The Commission has been informed by the Complainants that some of the\u000aalleged violations occurred before that date.\u000a94. The Commission stated its position on this principle in communication 97/93 John K. Modise v.\u000aBotswana. In that communication the Complainant was arrested by the Botswana authorities in 1978 and\u000adeported to apartheid South Africa, in violation of his citizenship rights. The communication was filed in\u000a1993. The Commission held that: "The Republic of Botswana ratified the African Charter on 17 July 1986.\u000aAlthough some of the events described in the communication took place before ratification, their effects\u000acontinue to the present day. The current circumstances of the Complainant are a result of a present policy\u000adecision taken by the Botswana government against him."\u000a95. The Commission expanded the principle further in its decision on the consolidated communications\u000aNos 54/91 [61-91, 98-93, 164-197, 210-98] Malawi African Association et al v. Mauritania, where it, inter\u000aalia, considered an allegation of violations of the right to a fair trial. The Commission held that: "Mauritania\u000aratified the Charter on 14 June 1986, and it came into force on 21 October 1986. The September trials, thus\u000atook place prior to the entry into force of the Charter. These trials led to the imprisonment of various\u000apersons. The Commission can only consider a violation that took place prior to the entry into force of the\u000aCharter if such a violation continues or has effects which themselves constitute violations after the entry\u000ainto force of the Charter..."10\u000a96. The Commission has through its jurisprudence established the principle that violations that occurred\u000aprior to the entry into force of the Charter, in respect of a State party, shall be deemed to be within the\u000ajurisdiction rationae temporis of the Commission, if they continue, after the entry into force of the Charter.\u000aThe effects of such violations may themselves constitute violations under the Charter. In other words, this\u000aprinciple presupposes the failure by the State party to adopt measures, as required by Article 1 of the Africa\u000aCharter to redress the violations and their effects, hence failing to respect, and guarantee the rights.\u000a\u000a8\u000a\u000a97. The Commission therefore decides that it has the competence to consider this complaint against the\u000aRespondent State, in relation to violations which emanated prior to 18 December 1989, the date the African\u000aCharter entered into force for the Republic of Cameroon, if such violations or their residual effects\u000acontinued after that date.\u000a\u000aConsideration of the Merits\u000a\u000a98. The communication alleges that the Respondent State violated Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, 10, 11, 12,\u000a13, 17(1) in respect of individual Southern Cameroonians; and Articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 in\u000arespect of the peoples of Southern Cameroons; and the general obligation under Article 26 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a\u000aDecision on the Merits\u000aAlleged violation of Article 2\u000a\u000a99. The Complainants allege that there have been various cases of discrimination against the people of\u000aSouthern Cameroon contrary to Article 2 of the African Charter. Article 2 states that: "Every individual shall\u000abe entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present Charter\u000awithout distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, colour, sex, language, religion, political or any\u000aother opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or any status".\u000a100. The Complainants submit that Southern Cameroonians are discriminated against by the Respondent\u000aState, in various forms. These include under-representation of Southern Cameroonians in national\u000ainstitutions, economic marginalisation through the denial of basic infrastructure, such as roads, persistence\u000ahigh levels of unemployment and illiteracy in Southern Cameroon. It is submitted that Southern\u000aCameroonians are discriminated against in the legal and judicial system.\u000a101. The Complainants submitted further that the company law applied in Southern Cameroon was\u000aabolished in favour of the Napoleonic Code upon unification in 1972. They argued that Southern\u000aCameroonians could not register companies whose articles of association were in the English language.\u000a102. The issue for determination is whether the refusal to register the said companies was directly related\u000ato the unification of the legal system in 1972, and if it constituted discrimination? Could the 1972 unification\u000aprejudice registration of companies after ratification on 18 December 1989? This would be the case only if\u000athe unification impacted negatively on the registration of companies after December 1989. The\u000aComplainants argue that the refusal to register companies had such an effect. In order for the Southern\u000aCameroonian companies to do business they had to register under the Francophone civil law system. The\u000aRespondent State did not dispute this allegation. English is one of the official languages in Cameroon.\u000aSouthern Cameroonians had a legitimate expectation that the English language could be used to conduct\u000aofficial business, including the registration of companies. The Commission makes a finding that the refusal\u000ato register companies established by Southern Cameroonians on account of language amounted to a\u000aviolation of Article 2 of the African Charter.\u000a103. The Complainants submit further that the ratification of the Treaty for the Harmonisation of Business\u000aLaw in Africa, otherwise known as Organisation pour l'Hamonisation des Droits d'Affaires en Afrique\u000a(OHADA), has discriminated against the people of Southern Cameroon on the basis of language. OHADA\u000ais an instrument harmonising business law amongst French speaking countries in Africa. It states that the\u000alanguage of interpretation and settlement of disputes arising under OHADA shall be French.\u000a104. The Complainants alleged that the ratification of OHADA was discriminatory to individual businesses\u000aand business people from Southern Cameroon. At this point we adopt the legal principle that businesses or\u000acorporate bodies are legal persons. The Complainants submit that objections against OHADA were\u000aignored, and that companies not registered under OHADA could not open bank accounts in Cameroon.\u000a105. The Respondent State argued that OHADA is not aimed at promoting the superiority of one legal\u000asystem over the other, but rather to harmonise business law in the contracting states by elaborating simple,\u000amodern, common rules aimed at encouraging regional development and growth, setting up appropriate\u000ajudicial procedures and encouraging arbitration for the settlement of contractual disputes.\u000a9\u000a\u000a106. It states further that other non French speaking countries including Ghana and Nigeria, were\u000aundergoing the process of acceding to the OHADA treaty. The Respondent State submitted that it had\u000ataken several measures, such as the translation of the OHADA laws into English, with the support of the\u000aOHADA Permanent Secretariat and the African Development Bank, and the training of Anglophone and\u000aFrancophone magistrates at the Ecole regionale superieure de la Magistature in Porto Novo, Republic of\u000aBenin. It stated further that the apprehension by the Anglophones was merely a transitory situation.\u000a107. The Commission takes note of the fact that the Respondent State had taken measures to address the\u000adiscriminatory effects of the ratification of OHADA. Had such measures not been taken upon the ratification\u000aof OHADA in 1996, the Commission would not have hesitated to find a violation. The Commission is\u000acognisant of the bilingual nature of the Respondent State and the Western African region, in which the\u000aRespondent State finds itself. The Respondent State is from time to time being expected to interact with its\u000aneighbours in ECOWAS, or any other sub regional group, where both the French and the English language\u000acontinue to be lingua franca.\u000a108. The mere accession or ratification of OHADA should not be deemed a violation of Article 2, unless the\u000aRespondent State had manifestly failed to take any steps to ameliorate the effects of the linguistic\u000adifferences. The Respondent State has shown that it took measures, such as the training of magistrates,\u000aand translation of texts to address the discriminatory concerns. The OHADA ratification, however, resulted\u000ain the discrimination of Anglophone based companies and businesses, which could not open bank\u000aaccounts unless they registered under OHADA. There was no response from the Respondent State on this\u000aissue. Nor were any measures taken to address this complaint. Notwithstanding the translation of OHADA\u000ainto English, it was wrong for institutions, such as banks to force Southern Cameroon based companies to\u000achange their basic documents into French. The banks and other institutions could have dealt with the\u000acompanies without imposing the language conditionality. Banking documents should have been translated\u000ainto English. The Commission finds that the Respondent State failed to address the concerns of Southern\u000aCameroonian businesses, which were forced to re-register under OHADA, and as such violated Article 2 of\u000athe African Charter.\u000a\u000aAllegation of violation of Article 3\u000a\u000a109. The Complainants alleged violation of Article 3, which protects the individual's right to equality before\u000athe law and equal protection of the law. African Commission notes that although the communication alleges\u000aviolation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Complainants did not specifically argue or bring evidence of\u000aany instance against the Respondent State. In the absence of such evidence, the African Commission\u000acannot find violation of Article 3 of the Charter.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 4\u000a\u000a110. The Complainants allege violations of Article 4, the right to life, inviolability of the human being, and\u000athe integrity of the person. They submit that the Respondent State committed violations against individuals\u000ain Southern Cameroon. The communication gives account of people who were killed by the police during\u000aviolent suppressions of peaceful demonstrations, or died in detention as a result of the bad conditions and\u000athe ill-treatment in prison.\u000a111. The Respondent State contends that the allegations are not substantiated by documentary evidence.\u000aNo certificates to ascertain the cause of death, no forensic medical certificates, no investigation reports by\u000ahuman rights organisation were produced. It states further that "the catalogue published by the press\u000aorgans of the SCNC and SCAPO cannot be considered as a reliable source".11 The Respondent State\u000ahowever, admitted to the death of six people on the 26th March 1990, which occurred after a confrontation\u000abetween security forces and demonstrators, whom it argued, were involved in an illegal political rally in\u000aBamenda.\u000a112. The African Commission observes that the parties do not have equal access to official evidence such\u000aas police reports, death certificates and forensic medical certificates. The Complainants endeavoured to\u000ainquire into the alleged violations and gave names of the alleged victims. The Respondent State restricted\u000aitself to questioning the reliability of the evidence presented by the Complainants. It did not deny the\u000a10\u000a\u000aalleged violations. The Respondent State had the opportunity to inquire into the alleged violations. The\u000aRespondent State did not conduct such investigation and redress the victims, it thus failed to protect the\u000arights of the alleged victims. The Commission finds that it violated Article 4 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 5\u000a\u000a113. The communication gives details of victims who were subjected to torture, amputations and denial of\u000amedical treatment by the Respondent State's law enforcement officers, in violation of Article 5 of the African\u000aCharter. The Respondent State responded by stating that some SCNC and SCAPO members had\u000aperpetrated terrorist acts in the country, killing law enforcement officers, vandalising State properties,\u000astealing weapons and ammunitions.\u000a114. The Commission holds the view that even if the State was fighting alleged terrorist activities, it was not\u000ajustified to subject victims to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and treatment. It therefore\u000afinds that the Respondent State violated Article 5 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 6\u000a\u000a115. The communication further gives details of victims who were arrested, detained for days, sometimes\u000afor months without trial before being released in violation of Article 6 of the Charter.\u000a116. The Respondent State did not deny the allegations instead it tried to justify them. For instance, it\u000astates that: "...concerning citizens who had been arrested for committing various ordinary law offences\u000asince the return to multi party democratic processes, most of them are SCNC and SCAPO activists who, in\u000atheir logic of contestation, defied republican institutions especially the forces of law and order, either during\u000ademonstration of the anniversary of "Southern Cameroon" every 1 October of the year, or at the approach,\u000aduring and after important elections."\u000a117. It goes on to state that, "whatever the circumstances, the more it is true that every individual shall\u000ahave the right to liberty and the security of his person, the more it is accepted that an individual may be\u000adeprived of his freedom for reason and conditions previously laid down by the law. (Article 6 of the Charter)\u000aThe cases of arrest registered since the return to multiparty politics in this part of the territory has always\u000aobeyed the principle of legality..." .\u000a118. The Commission states that a State Party cannot justify violations of the African Charter by relying on\u000athe limitation under Article 6 of the Charter. The Respondent State is required to convince the Commission\u000athat the measures or conditions it had put in place were in compliance with Article 6 of the Charter. The\u000aCommission has previously expressed itself on the effect of claw back clauses. Communication 211/98\u000aLegal Resources Foundation/Zambia,12 states the following; "The Commission has argued forcefully that\u000ano State Party to the Charter should avoid its responsibility by recourse to the limitations and "claw back"\u000aclauses in the Charter. It was stated following developments in other jurisdictions, that the Charter cannot\u000abe used to justify violations of sections of it. The Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses\u000amust reinforce each other. The purpose or effect of any limitation must also be examined, as the limitation\u000aof the right cannot be used to subvert from the popular will, as such cannot be used to limit the\u000aresponsibilities of State Parties in terms of the Charter."\u000a119. Further to the foregoing, communication 147/95 and 149/96, Sir Dawda Jawara/The Gambia, the\u000aCommission stated that, "[t]he Commission in its decision on communication 101/93 laid down a general\u000aprinciple with respect to freedom of association, that 'competent authorities should not enact provisions\u000awhich limit the exercise of this freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional\u000aprovisions or undermine fundamental rights guaranteed by constitution or international human rights\u000astandards.' This therefore applies not only to right to freedom of expression of association, but also to all\u000aother rights and freedoms ... for a State to avail itself of this plea, it must show that such a law is consistent\u000awith its obligations under the Charter." 13\u000a120. In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Respondent State has violated Article 6 as\u000aalleged by the Complainants.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 7(1)\u000a\u000a121. The Complainants alleged that the Respondent State violated Article 7(1), on the right to fair trial.\u000aThey allege that individuals were transferred from Southern Cameroon to Francophone Cameroon for trial\u000aby military tribunals and that other victims were tried in civil law courts, without interpreters.\u000a122. The Respondent State admits that between 1997 and 2001, some individuals were transferred from\u000athe North West Cameroon, and were tried for various criminal offences by the Yaoundé Military Tribunal.\u000aThese offences include unlawful incitement, disturbances of public peace, destruction of public property,\u000aassassination of gendarmes and civilian individuals, illegal possession of weapons and ammunition and the\u000aillegal declaration of the independence of Anglophone Cameroon on 30 December 1999.\u000a123. The Respondent States asserts the following: "[a]ware that in the past the actions of SCNC militants\u000ahave always ended up in assassinations, kidnapping of persons, destruction and setting ablaze of public\u000abuildings, public authorities could not remain indifferent in front of this manifest determination to cause\u000adisorder and disturbances. About three days before 1 October 2001, gendarmes were dispatched nearly\u000aeverywhere in the areas and localities targeted by the SCNC."\u000a124. The Respondent State submitted that some of the victims were released, albeit after prolonged\u000aperiods of detention, for lack of evidence. Others were released on bail, and fled the country. It argues that\u000athe prolonged detention was due to administrative bottlenecks, which are a constant concern of the\u000agovernment. The Respondent State did not indicate the measures it had taken to address the chronic\u000aadministrative problems causing prolonged detentions.\u000a125. The Respondent State denied that it ignored or failed to implement Court decisions in Anglophone\u000aCameroon. It cited a number court decisions it had complied with, including those which overturned\u000aexecutive decisions. The Complainant did not give any specific case or decision which was not complied\u000awith by the Respondent State.\u000a126. The Commission wishes to state that the rights outlined in Article 7 constitute fundamental tenets of\u000aany democratic state. It is through respect for these rights that other rights guaranteed by the Charter may\u000aalso be realised. The Commission has adopted the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial and\u000aLegal Assistance in Africa, to assist State Parties to better guarantee the rights enshrined in Article 7.\u000a127. The Respondent State did not explain why it transferred individuals from North West Cameroon for\u000atrial by the Yaoundé and Bafoussam Military Tribunals, nor the reason why the victims were tried by\u000atribunals outside the jurisdictions where the offences were allegedly committed. The Commission has\u000astated previously that trial by military courts does not per se constitute a violation of the right to be tried by a\u000acompetent organ. What poses [a] problem is the fact that, very often, the military tribunals are an extension\u000aof the executive, rather than the judiciary. Military tribunals are not intended to try civilians. They are\u000aestablished to try military personnel under laws and regulations which govern the military. In\u000acommunication 218/98 Civil Liberties Organisation, Legal Defence Centre, Legal Defence and Assistance\u000aProject v. Nigeria the Commission stated the following: "The military tribunals are not negated by the mere\u000afact of being presided over by military officers. The critical factor is whether the process is fair, just and\u000aimpartial"14\u000a128. The accused persons were not military personnel. The offences alleged to have been committed were\u000aquite capable of being tried by normal courts, within the jurisdictional areas the offences were allegedly\u000acommitted. The Commission finds that trying civilians by the Yaoundé and the Bafoussam Military Tribunals\u000awas a violation of Article 7(1)(b) of the Charter.\u000a129. The Complaints submit that the accused were tried in a language they did not understand, without the\u000ahelp of interpreters. The Respondent State did not contradict that allegation. The Commission states that it\u000ais a prerequisite of the right to a fair trial, for a person to be tried in a language he understands, otherwise\u000athe right to defence is clearly hampered. A person put in such a situation cannot adequately prepare his\u000adefence, since he would not understand what he is being accused of, nor would he apprehend the legal\u000aarguments mounted against him.15 The aforementioned Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair\u000aTrial and Legal Assistance in Africa, states that one of the essential elements of a fair hearing is: "...an\u000aentitlement to the assistance of an interpreter if he or she cannot understand or speak the language used in\u000aor by the judicial body." 16\u000a130. The Commission recognises that the Respondent State is a bilingual country. Its institutions including\u000athe judiciary can use either French or English. However since not all the citizens are fluent in both\u000alanguages, it is the State's duty to make sure that, when a trial is conducted in a language that the accused\u000a12\u000a\u000adoes not speak, he/she is provided with the assistance of an interpreter. Failing to do that amounts to a\u000aviolation of the right to a fair trial.\u000a131. The Commission therefore concludes that the Respondent State violated Articles 7(1)(b), 7(1)(c) and\u000a7(1)(d) of the Charter.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 9\u000a\u000a132. The communication alleges violation of Article 9 of the Charter. The Complainants did not make any\u000asubmissions concerning Article 9. The Commission has therefore not made any finding regarding Article 9.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 10\u000a\u000a133. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State violated Article 10 of the African Charter. The\u000aparties did not make any submission on Article 10 of the Charter. The Commission finds no violation of\u000aArticle 10.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 11\u000a\u000a134. The Commission examined whether Article 11 was violated. The Commission deems that there is\u000aenough information on the record, based on the both parties to enable the Commission to make its\u000adetermination.\u000a135. Article 11 states that: "Every individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others. The\u000aexercise of this right shall be subject only to necessary restrictions provided for by law in particular those\u000aenacted in the interest of national security, the safety of others, health, ethics and rights and freedoms of\u000aothers."\u000a136. The facts before the Commission depict cases of suppression of demonstrations, including the use of\u000aforce against, the arrest and detention of people taking part in such demonstrations. The Commission has\u000aheld previously that: "...the Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each\u000aother." 17\u000a137. The Complainant states that several victims were arrested and held in detention for long periods, for\u000aexercising their right to freedom of assembly. Some of the detained persons were acquitted. There were\u000aothers who died at the hands of security forces or in detention, after being accused of participation in\u000a"unlawful political rallies." The victims who died, or had been detained suffered while exercising their\u000aexercise of the right to freedom of assembly.\u000a138. The Commission does not condone unlawful acts by individuals or organisations to advance political\u000aobjectives, because such actions or their consequences are likely to violate the African Charter. It\u000aencourages individuals and organisations, when exercising their right to freedom of assembly, to operate\u000awithin the national legal framework. This requirement does not absolve States Parties from their duty to\u000aguarantee the rights to freedom of assembly, while maintaining law and order. The Respondent States\u000aadmits that it detained demonstrators, applied excessive force to enforce law and order, and in some cases\u000alives were lost. The Commission concludes therefore that Article 11 of the African Charter was violated.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 12\u000a\u000a139. The Complainants alleged that Article 12 was violated by the Respondent State. They did not\u000asubstantiate any infringement by the Respondent State of the right to freedom of movement. The\u000aCommission finds no violation of Article 12.\u000a\u000a13\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 13\u000a\u000a140. The Complainants alleged violation of Article 13. They stated that the people of Southern Cameroon\u000awere not adequately represented in the institutions of the Republic of Cameroon except for "token"\u000aappointments. They allege further that the Respondent State manipulated demographic data to deny\u000aSouthern Cameroonians equal representation in government.\u000a141. The Respondent State submitted that, upon the introduction of multi-partyism in 1992, many Southern\u000aCameroonian opposition parties, such as the Social Democratic Front (SDF), have participated in\u000amunicipal, legislative and presidential elections. Opposition parties control several councils and are\u000arepresented in the National Assembly. It argues that access to high office is open to all citizens without\u000adistinction. The Respondent State accused the Complainants of bad faith, and stated that some of the\u000ahighest positions in the Republic had been held by Southern Cameroonians. It accuses SCNC and SCAPO\u000aof persecuting fellow Anglophones who refuse to adhere to the secession agenda.\u000a142. The Complainants claim that Southern Cameroonians have since 1961 been accorded only 20 %\u000arepresentation in the Federal/National Assembly instead of the 22% they think they deserve. The\u000aComplainants' main complaint is the ratio of representation, rather than the non representation. The\u000aRespondent State states that 20% representation cannot be said to be "tokenism".\u000a143. The Commission is inclined to agree with the Respondent State. It finds that in spite of the alleged\u000adisproportionate percentage, Southern Cameroonians were representation [sic], and hence participated in\u000apublic affairs of the Respondent State as required under Article 13 of the African Charter.\u000a144. The Commission states that it is not sufficient for the Complainants to assert in general terms that a\u000acertain category of citizens were denied the right to access public positions or that they were\u000aunder-represented in government or public administration. The Complainants did not furnish the\u000aCommission with information or cases that individuals in Southern Cameroon were denied representation\u000aor denied access to public services. The Commission finds that allegations concerning "tokenism" have not\u000abeen substantiated and concludes that there is no violation of Article 13.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 17\u000a\u000a145. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State violated Article 17 of the Charter, because it is\u000adestroying education in the Southern Cameroons by underfunding and understaffing primary education.\u000aThat it imposed inappropriate reform of secondary and technical education. It discriminates Southern\u000aCameroonians in the admission into the Polytechnique in Yaoundé, and refused to grant authorisation for\u000aregistration of the Bamenda University of Science and Technology, thereby violating Article 17 on the right\u000ato education.\u000a146. The Respondent State denied that it is destroying the education system in the Southern Cameroon. It\u000aprovided detailed data and statistics on the measures it had taken to carter for the education sector in the\u000aSouthern Cameroons. It stated that in certain cases it had provided more resources to Southern Cameroon\u000athan it had done for other regions. The Complainants contested the reliability of the data and statistics, but\u000adid not convince the Commission that the data should not be relied upon.\u000a147. Regarding the alleged discrimination concerning admission of Southern Cameroonians into the\u000aPolytechnique in Yaounde, the Respondent State argued that admission to the National Advanced School\u000aof Engineering is based on merit, as is the case with all higher institutions of learning. It stated that the\u000aSchool has trained a number of civil engineers from both the Anglophone and Francophone parts.\u000a148. Concerning the alleged refusal to grant authorisation for the registration of the Bamenda University of\u000aScience and Technology, the Respondent State stated that the said university did not fulfill conditions for\u000aestablishment of private universities. The Complainant did not show whether the criteria were met by the\u000aBamenda University of Science and Technology or not. The Commission reiterates that for it to make\u000afinding on any allegations, the Parties have to provide it with the necessary information. Rule 119 of the\u000aRules of Procedure of the Commission, (which govern this communication) require parties to furnish\u000aexplanation or statements, including additional information.\u000a149. The Complainants should have done so under Rule 119 (3) of the Rules of Procedure. The\u000aCommission allowed Parties to make oral submission in this particular case. The Complainants did not\u000asubstantiate the allegations. For the above reasons, the African Commissions finds that there is no violation\u000a14\u000a\u000aof Article 17(1) of the Charter.\u000a150. The Commission then examined the alleged violation of Articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 19\u000a\u000a151. The Complainants premised the complaint alleging violation of their collective rights on the events\u000awhich happened prior to 18 December 1989. The Commission has already expressed itself on the question\u000aof its jurisdiction rationae temporis. The Complainants alleged that the Respondent State, "forcefully and\u000aunlawfully annexed" Southern Cameroon. They argue that the Respondent State: "........established its\u000acolonial rule there, complete with its structures, and its administrative, military and police personnel,\u000aapplying a system and operating in a language alien to the Southern Cameroon, ... and continues to\u000aexercise a colonial sovereignty over Southern Cameroon to this day."\u000a152. They argue further that: "... the occupation and assumption of a colonial sovereignty over Southern\u000aCameroon by the Respondent State amounts to violation of Articles 19 and 20 of the African Charter....,\u000aboth of which outlaw domination, and colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. Article 19 places an\u000aabsolute ban on the domination of one people by another. Article 20 emphatically asserts the right of every\u000apeople to existence, to self determination, and of resistance to colonialism or oppression by resorting to any\u000ainternationally recognised means of resistance"\u000a153. These are very serious allegations which go to the root of the statehood and sovereignty of the\u000aRepublic of Cameroon. The Respondent State responded by arguing that the Commission is:\u000a"...incompetent to handle the issue of the process of decolonisation that took place in this State and under\u000athe auspices of the United Nations."\u000a154. Respondent State submits further that the Commission cannot examine or adjudicate on the 1961 UN\u000aplebiscite, on events which took place between the October 1961 and 1972, when the Federal and Union\u000aConstitutions were adopted, because they predated the entry into force of the Charter.\u000a155. The Commission concedes that it is not competent to adjudicate on the legality of those events, due to\u000alimitation imposed on its jurisdiction rationae temporis, for reasons stated hereinabove. The Commission\u000acannot make a finding on allegations made by the Complainants concerning "illegal and forced annexation,\u000aor colonial occupation of Southern Cameroon by the Respondent State," since they fall outside its\u000ajurisdiction rationae temporis.\u000a156. The Commission states, however that, if the Complainants can establish that any violation committed\u000abefore 18 December 1989, continued thereafter, then the Commission shall have competence to examine\u000ait.\u000a157. The Complainants alleged cases of economic marginalisation, and denial of basic infrastructure by the\u000aRespondent State, as constituting violations of Article 19. They allege that these violations were a\u000aconsequence of the events of 1961 and 1972, and continued after 18 December 1989.\u000a158. The Respondent State contested the allegation of economic marginalisation. It submitted documents\u000aand statistics in support of its provision of basic infrastructure in Southern Cameroon. The statistical\u000ainformation and data show that, for the period 1998 up to 2003/4, the North West and South West\u000aprovinces, (Southern Cameroon,) were allocated substantially higher budgetary resources, than the\u000aFrancophone provinces, for the construction and maintenance of roads, and running of education training\u000ainstitutions. The documents show that the situation in the Anglophone regions is not that different from\u000aother parts of the country. It argued that the problem concerning inadequate infrastructural development is\u000anot peculiar to Southern Cameroon.\u000a159. The Complainants rejected as adulterated the data and statistics provided by the Respondent. The\u000aComplainants did not furnish any document to support their allegation. The Commission finds no reason\u000awhy it should not rely on the data and statistics provided by the Respondent State in its decision. The\u000aCommission holds that the Respondent State allocated public resources to the Anglophone provinces\u000awithout discrimination.\u000a160. The Respondent State did not however respond specifically to the allegations concerning the\u000arelocation of major economic projects and enterprises from Southern Cameroon. It explained the reason for\u000arelocating the seaport to Douala from Limbe, otherwise known as Victoria. It argues that, Douala being the\u000agateway into Cameroon, the government needed to monitor the movement of persons and good for evident\u000a15\u000a\u000asecurity reasons and efficient customs control.\u000a161. Every State has an obligation under international law to preserve the integrity of its entire territory. The\u000amaintenance of security and movements of persons and goods on the territory is part of that obligation. The\u000aargument by the Respondent State that it could not guarantee the security of persons and goods at Limbe,\u000aunless it moved the port, is tantamount to acknowledging that it had no control of Limbe. The Commission\u000abelieves that the security and customs authorities could have effectively monitored the movement of\u000apersons and goods, even if the seaport had continued to be at Limbe.\u000a162. The Commission states that the relocation of business enterprises and location of economic projects\u000ato Francophone Cameroon, which generated negative effects on the economic life of Southern Cameroon\u000aconstituted violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 20\u000a\u000a163. The Complainants state that the "alleged unlawful and forced annexation and colonial occupation" of\u000aSouthern Cameroon by the Respondent State constituted a violation of Article 20 of the Charter. They claim\u000athat Southern Cameroonians are entitled to exercise the rights to self determination under Article 20 of the\u000aCharter as a separate and distinct people from the people of "La Republique du Cameroon." Article 20\u000astipulates that: 1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and\u000ainalienable right to self determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\u000aeconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\u000a2. Colonised or oppressed peoples shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination by\u000aresorting to any means recognised by the international community.\u000a3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the states parties to the present Charter in their\u000aliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\u000a164. The Complainants submit that the UN plebiscite was premised on certain conditions, including the\u000aconvening of a conference of equal representative delegations from the Republic of Cameroon and\u000aSouthern Cameroon to work out the conditions for the transfer of sovereign powers to the future federation.\u000aIt is further submitted that such arrangements should have been approved by the separate parliaments of\u000athe Republic of Cameroon and Southern Cameroon before sovereignty was transferred to a single entity\u000arepresenting both sides. The Complainants submit that the results of the plebiscite were never submitted to\u000athe parliament of the Southern Cameroon for approval.\u000a165. The Respondent State did not respond to the allegations concerning "unlawful annexation and\u000acolonialism." It submitted instead that the issues are incapable of adjudication by the Commission on\u000aaccount of its lack of jurisdiction.\u000a166. The Respondent State contested further the claim that Southern Cameroonians are a "separate and\u000adistinct people" . The Commission shall examine this issue.\u000a167. The Complainants reiterate that their "separate and distinct" identity is based on the British\u000aadministration over Southern Cameroon. They submit that they speak the English language, and apply the\u000acommon law legal tradition, as opposed to the Francophone zone, where French is spoken and the civil law\u000asystem is applicable.\u000a168. The Respondent State submitted that it does not dispute the basic historical facts concerning the Trust\u000aadministration, but denies that Southern Cameroonians exist as a "people." It states the following; "[t]he\u000acomplainants raise in order to shore up this assertion the use of the English language (working language),\u000athe specificity of the legal system, of the educational system, of the system of government, traditional\u000acultures. In fact, the specificities of former Southern Cameroons stem solely from the heritage of British\u000aadministration and the legacy of Anglo-Saxon culture. No ethno-anthropological argument can be put\u000aforward to determine the existence of a people of Southern Cameroons, the Southern part being of the\u000alarge Sawa cultural area, the northern part being part of the Grass fields' cultural area. Since 1961,\u000aalthough some specificities had been preserved on more than one aspect, there had been remarkable\u000arapprochement at the administrative and legal levels. The 'separate and distinct people' thesis is no longer\u000avalid today."\u000a169. The Commission shall clarify its understanding of "peoples' rights" under the African Charter. The\u000aCommission is aware the controversial nature of the issue, due to the political connotation that it carries.\u000aThat controversy is as old as the Charter. The drafters of the Charter refrained deliberately from defining\u000a16\u000a\u000ait.18 To date, the concept has not been defined under international law. However, there is recognition that\u000acertain objective features attributable to a collective of individuals, may warrant them to be considered as\u000a"people".\u000a170. A group of international law experts commissioned by UNESCO to reflect on the concept of "people"\u000aconcluded that where a group of people manifest some of the following characteristics; a common historical\u000atradition, a racial or ethnic identity, cultural homogeneity, linguistic unity, religious and ideological affinities,\u000aterritorial connection, and a common economic life, it may be considered to be a "people". Such a group\u000amay also identify itself as a people, by virtue of their consciousness that they are a people.19 This\u000acharacterisation does not bind the Commission but can only be used as a guide.\u000a171. In the context of the African Charter, the notion of "people" is closely related to collective rights.\u000aCollective rights enumerated under Articles 19 to 24 of the Charter can be exercised by a people, bound\u000atogether by their historical, traditional, racial, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious, ideological, geographical,\u000aeconomic identities and affinities, or other bonds.\u000a172. The drafters of the Charter provided for the protection of "peoples rights" under the Charter. In his\u000abook, entitled; The Law of the African (Banjul) Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, Justice Hassan B.\u000aJallow,20 an eminent African Jurist, who participated in the drafting the African Charter, sheds light on this\u000aissue. He says that: "[t]he concept of peoples' rights, to which a whole chapter had been devoted in the\u000adraft did not mean there was any grading of rights. There were economic, social and cultural rights which\u000ahave particular importance to developing countries and which together with civil rights and political rights in\u000aone complementary whole should henceforth be given an important place."21\u000a173. Justice Jallow cites the late President Leopold Sedar Senghor, the first President of Senegal and an\u000aeminent African Statesman, who told the inaugural meeting of African Legal Experts to draft the Charter,\u000athe following: "People will perhaps expatiate for a long time upon the 'People Rights' we were very keen on\u000areferring [sic] to. We simply meant, by so doing, to show our attachment to economic, social, and cultural\u000arights, to collective rights in general, rights which have a particular importance in our situation of a\u000adeveloping country. We are certainly not drawing lines of demarcation between the different categories of\u000arights. We want to show essentially that beside civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights\u000ashould henceforth be given the important place they deserve. We wanted to lay emphasis on the right to\u000adevelopment and the other rights which need the solidarity of our States to be fully met; the right to peace\u000aand security, the right to a healthy environment, right to participate in the equitable share of the common\u000aheritage of mankind, the right to enjoy a fair international economic order and, finally the right to natural\u000awealth and resources." 22\u000a174. The African Commission has itself dealt with the issues of peoples' rights without defining the term\u000a"people" or "peoples' rights". In its acclaimed Report of the Working Group of Experts on Indigenous\u000aPopulations/Communities,23 the African Commission described its dilemma of defining the concepts in the\u000afollowing terms: "[d]espite its mandate to interpret all provisions of the African Charter as per Article 45(3),\u000athe African Commission initially shied away from interpreting the concept of 'peoples'. The African Charter\u000aitself does not define the concept. Initially the African Commission did not feel at ease in developing rights\u000awhere there was little concrete international jurisprudence. The ICCPR and the ICESR do not define\u000a'peoples'. It is evident that the drafters of the African Charter intended to distinguish between the traditional\u000aindividual rights where the sections preceding Article 17 make reference to "every individual". Article 18\u000aserves as a break by referring to the family. Articles 19-24 make specific reference to "all peoples."\u000a175. It continues: "Given such specificity, it is surprising that the African Charter fails to define "peoples"\u000aunless it was trusted that its meaning could be discerned from the prevailing international instruments and\u000anorms. Two conclusions can be drawn from this. One, that the African Charter seeks to make provision for\u000agroup or collective rights, that is, that set of rights that can conceivably be enjoyed only in a collective\u000amanner like the right to self determination or independence or sovereignty...".24\u000a176. The Commission deduces from the foregoing discourse that peoples' rights are equally important as\u000aare individual rights. They deserve, and must be given protection. The minimum that can be said of\u000apeoples' rights is that, each member of the group carries with him/her the individual rights into the group, on\u000atop of what the group enjoys in its collectivity, i.e. common rights which benefit the community such as the\u000aright to development, peace, security, a healthy environment, self determination and the right to equitable\u000ashare of their resources.\u000a177. It is in the light of the above that the Commission shall examine the allegations against the\u000aRespondent State, concerning the violations of the collective rights cited hereinabove.\u000a\u000a17\u000a\u000a178. The Commission states that after thorough analysis of the arguments and literature, it finds that the\u000apeople of Southern Cameroon can legitimately claim to be a "people". Besides the individual rights due to\u000aSouthern Cameroon[ians], they have a distinct identity which attracts certain collective rights. The\u000aUNESCO Group of Experts report referred to hereinabove, states that for a collective of individuals to\u000aconstitute a >\u000a\u000a18\u000a\u000a

aV269/03 INTERIGHTS (on behalf of Safia Yakubu Husaini\u000aet al) / Nigeria\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The complaint is filed by INTERIGHTS on behalf of Safiya Yakubu Husaini and others who have been\u000aallegedly subjected to gross and systematic violations of fair trial and due process rights in the Sharia\u000aCourts in Nigeria.\u000a2. The Complainant alleges that Ms Safiya Hussaini, a Nigerian woman and nursing mother was sentenced\u000ato death by stoning by a Sharia Court in Gwadabawa, Sokoto State, Nigeria, for an alleged crime of\u000aadultery, which sentence was the latest in a series of serious and massive violations of the right to fair trial\u000aand associated guarantees.\u000a3. The Complainant alleges that Safiya's case is only one of the many cases to be decided under the\u000arecently introduced pieces of Sharia penal legislation in northern Nigerian States. All laws in Nigeria, at\u000aboth Federal and State levels, ought to be compatible with both the [C]onstitution of 1999 and international\u000a(including regional) treaties ratified by Nigeria, and are required to particularly comply with the African\u000aCharter which is domestic law in the country.\u000a4. In its complaints, the Complainant also enumerates other similar instances of alleged violations of fair\u000atrial, personal dignity and the right to life. It alleged that in December 2002, a Ms Hafsatu Abubakar from\u000aSokoto State was charged with 'zina', which is either voluntary premarital sexual intercourse or, if the\u000aperson is married, to [sic] adultery.\u000a5. On 19th January 2001, an unmarried woman called Bariya Magazu received 100 lashes in Zamfara State\u000afor having committed the offence of 'zina'[i]. Ms Magazu was also initially convicted of false accusation for\u000afailing to prove her declaration that three particular men had coerced her into having sexual intercourse,\u000awhich men were not prosecuted. By an order of an Islamic Court in the same State, a Mr Umaru Bubeh\u000areceived 80 strokes of the cane on 9th March 2001 for drinking alcohol. On 4th May 2001, a Mr Lawal\u000aIncitara's hand was amputated after a [i]Sharia Court in same state found him guilty of stealing bicycles.\u000a6. In Sokoto State, Sani Shehu and Garga Dandare were sentenced to have their right hands and left feet\u000aamputated after being convicted by a Sharia Court in Sokoto State on 20th December 2001. On 27th\u000aDecember 2001, the Upper Sharia Court in the same State convicted a Mr Aminu Bello of theft and\u000asentenced him to have his right hand amputated.\u000a7. The Complainant alleges that in none of these cases did the victims/accused persons receive, nor were\u000athey offered, competent or any legal representation. The rights of legal representation in the Sharia Courts\u000aare very limited and, even where they allow legal representation, only lawyers who are Muslims can\u000apractice in them.\u000a8. It is further alleged that the new Sharia penal legislations that are adopted in the various Nigeria States\u000acontain specifications that limit their application to people of Muslim faith but they dispense with all the fair\u000atrial safeguards recognised in the African Charter. Moreover, unlike in other criminal cases where accused\u000apersons are able to appeal to the Nigerian Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country,\u000aappeals in the Sharia criminal cases end before the special Sharia Courts of Appeal. In effect, the Sharia\u000apenal legislation subjects persons of Muslim faith to lower standards of fair trial merely by reason of their\u000afaith. In all the cases regarding the application of Sharia law for criminal cases, there is discrimination on\u000agrounds of the faith of the accused.\u000a9. The complaint also alleges that the rights of those tried under Sharia law are protected to a lesser extent\u000athan in the Penal Code for Northern Nigeria, valid for non-Muslim people, particularly concerning the right\u000aof representation, the right of appeal and the lack of knowledge of criminal procedure by the court. Under\u000aSharia law, the death penalty is applied for offences that are not punishable with the death penalty under\u000athe Penal Code for Northern Nigeria. The criteria [sic] for appointing judges to the same court also fails\u000ashort of international standards of training judicial personnel, and there is no requirement for judges to be\u000alegally qualified in law.\u000a10. Together with its complaint, the Complainant submitted a request for provisional measures to the\u000aAfrican Commission in accordance with Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a11. The Complainant alleges serious and massive violations of Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 26 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a12. The complaint was dated 30th January 2002 and received at the Secretariat on 31st January 2002.\u000a13. On 5th February 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant\u000aacknowledging receipt of the complaint, and requesting the latter to forward the relevant information and\u000aevidentiary materials on the developments surrounding the application of the Penal Provisions of Sharia\u000areligious law before Nigerian Sharia Courts, and to forward to it complete and specific cases of alleged\u000airregularities supported by relevant documentations. The Complainant was also asked to indicate to the\u000a[African] Commission which of the specific decisions of the Sharia Courts had been executed, and which\u000awere pending.\u000a14. On 6th February 2002, the Chairman of the African Commission addressed an urgent appeal to His\u000aExcellency, President Olusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, respectfully urging him to\u000asuspend further implementation of the Sharia penal statutes and decisions as well as convictions thereof,\u000aincluding the case of Ms Safiya Yakubu, pending the outcome of the consideration of the complaints before\u000athe African Commission.\u000a15. On the same date, the Chairman of the African Commission addressed a similar Urgent Appeal to His\u000aExcellency Amara Essy of the African Union, respectfully urging Him to draw the attention of the President\u000aof the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the [African] Commission's requests, and to positively respond thereof.\u000a16. On 8th February 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission faxed a copy of the Chairman's Urgent\u000aAppeal to the High Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Banjul, The Gambia for onward\u000atransmission of the same to His Excellency, President Olusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of\u000aNigeria.\u000a17. On 3rd March 2002, the Complainant wrote to the Secretariat informing the latter that it will assemble as\u000amany of the documents as exist and would get back to the Secretariat on its progress.\u000a18. On 7th March 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant confirming\u000areceipt of the same and reminding the latter that it would be awaiting for [sic] the relevant information.\u000a19. On 19th March 2002, the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the African Union wrote to the\u000aChairman of the African Commission that the Secretary General of the African Union had formally taken up\u000athe matter at the level of H.E. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The\u000aSecretariat of the African Commission brought the same to the attention of the Chairman.\u000a20. On 21st March 2002, the Chief of Staff to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria wrote, on\u000abehalf of H. E. President Olusegun Obasanjo, to the Chairman of the African Commission acknowledging\u000areceipt of the Urgent Appeal and assuring him that the administration and many Nigerians equally shared\u000ahis concern. The letter further expressed his optimism that, in the long run, justice would be done and\u000aSafiya??s life would be spared. While noting that the Federal Government could not unilaterally suspend\u000athe Sharia Penal Statutes and decisions which were within the prerogative of the State government in\u000aaccordance with the Nigerian Constitution, the letter assured the Chairman that the Administration would\u000aleave no stone unturned in ensuring that the right to life and human dignity of Safiya, and that of all other\u000aNigerians that may be affected in future were adequately protected.\u000a21. On 2nd April 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant reminding it of\u000athe need for further information on Ms Amina Lawal who was alleged to have been sentenced to a similar\u000apunishment by a Sharia Court in Katsina State. While informing the same of the pledge by the Nigerian\u000aAdministration regarding the case of Safiya and the follow up by the AU Secretary General, the Secretariat\u000areminded the Complainant that it still awaited for the submission of the documentation and information as\u000arequested in its previous letters.\u000a22. On 19th April 2002, the Political Affairs Department of the African Union wrote to the Secretariat of the\u000aAfrican Commission informing the latter of the decision by the Federal Court of Appeal in Nigeria\u000aoverturning the death sentence imposed on Safiya by a lower Court in Sokoto State thereby making the\u000aneed to make further Presidential intervention unnecessary.\u000a23. During the 31st Ordinary Session held in Pretoria, South Africa in May 2002, the Complainant orally\u000ainformed the Secretariat that it was trying to compile the relevant information on the complaint and that it\u000a2\u000a\u000awould be best if the Secretariat waited for the same before further action on complaint.\u000a24. On 27th August 2002, the Secretariat received a letter from the International Commission of Jurists [ICJ]\u000aexpressing its concern in the fate of Ms Amina Lawal and her child.\u000a25. By a letter of 27th August 2002, the Secretariat informed the ICJ that the African Commission was\u000afollowing the developments in Nigeria regarding the application of Sharia Penal Statutes in the country,\u000aincluding and particularly, the case of Ms Lawal, through the appropriate channels.\u000a26. During the 32nd Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2002, the Complainant orally\u000ainformed the Secretariat that it was unable to compile the requested information in time, that it was in touch\u000awith its local partners in Nigeria on the case and suggested the [African] Commission went ahead in dealing\u000awith the complaint.\u000a27. During the intersession period before the 33rd Ordinary Session, the Secretariat called the Complainant\u000ato inquire about the progress it made and on the status of the cases pending before national courts.\u000a28. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held in Niamey, Niger from 15 to 29 May 2003, the African Commission\u000aexamined the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a29. On 12th June 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants and Respondent State informing them of\u000athis decision and requested them to forward their written submissions on admissibility before the 34th\u000aOrdinary Session of the [African] Commission.

aV272/03 Association of Victims of Post Electoral\u000aViolence & INTERIGHTS / Cameroon\u000a272/03 Association of Victims of Post Electoral Violence & INTERIGHTS v Cameroon\u000a\u000aSummary of the Facts\u000a1. The communication had been initiated against the Republic of Cameroon, State Party1 to the African\u000aCharter, by two Non Governmental Organisations (NGO); The Association of the Victims of Post Electoral\u000aViolence of 1992 of the North West Region, headquartered in Bamenda, Cameroon; and The International\u000aCentre for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS)2 , headquartered in London, UK.\u000a2. In the communication, the complainants contend that on the 23rd October 1992, in reaction to the\u000aconfirmation by the Supreme Court of Cameroon of the victory of the candidate Paul Biya of the Cameroon\u000aPeoples' Democratic Party (CPDM) in the presidential elections of the 11th October 1992, the members of\u000athe Social Democratic Front (SDF), the Principal Opposition Party, attacked the symbols of the State and\u000athe militants of the Party which won the elections, in the city of Bamenda, their Party stronghold.\u000a3. Property belonging to CPDM militants and to other citizens are said to have been destroyed. The\u000adamages caused to Messrs. Albert Cho Ngafor and Joseph Ncho Adu are estimated at one billion CFA\u000afrancs for each of them. Damages to the tune of 800 million CFA francs are said to have been caused to\u000aabout a hundred other individuals.\u000a4. Certain victims such as Mr. Albert Cho Ngafor, who had been sprayed with petrol, were moreover\u000asubjected to serious physical attacks.\u000a5. In consequence the Cameroonian Authorities arrested certain individuals presumed to be responsible for\u000athese events; the said Authorities also set up, in February 1993, a Committee responsible for the\u000acompensation of the victims.\u000a6. However, having waited in vain for their compensation, the victims of the post electoral violence of\u000aBamenda organised themselves into an Association and embarked on certain activities in order to have the\u000amatter settled amicably.\u000a7. This method however proved fruitless, as, in spite of firm promises made by the President of the\u000aRepublic, who had been approached in the context of the measures taken towards an amicable settlement,\u000ano concrete result had been obtained by the victims of the violence.\u000a8. On the 13th March 1998, the victims of the Bamenda events brought an appeal for responsibility against\u000athe Cameroonian State to the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court. The appeal in question had\u000abeen recorded on the 22nd April 1998 by the Clerk of Courts, under the number 835/97-98.\u000a9. On the 16th July 1998, the Government of Cameroon reacted, requesting the Supreme Court to declare\u000athe victims' submission inadmissible and since then, the proceedings have been blocked in spite of all the\u000aefforts made by the Counsels of the complainants, with the support of certain administrative Authorities, like\u000athe Commissioner of the District of Mezam (home region of the victims).\u000a\u000aThe Complaint\u000a10. The complainants allege the violation of Articles 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter by the Republic\u000aof Cameroon. In consequence, the complainants are requesting the African Commission to:\u000a\u2022 Declare the refusal by the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Cameroon to consider\u000atheir appeal against the Government of Cameroon as contrary to the principles of the right to a fair\u000ahearing, as stipulated by the African Charter in its Article 7 and by the relevant provisions of other\u000ainternational human rights instruments;\u000a\u2022 Note that the Government of Cameroon has not respected its obligation to protect the physical\u000aintegrity (Article 4) and property (Article 14) of individuals living on its territory or under its\u000ajurisdiction;\u000a\u2022 Request the Government of Cameroon to pay full compensation for the damages suffered by the\u000avictims of the post electoral violence in Bamenda;\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000a\u2022 Request the Government of Cameroon to enact positive legislation to ensure the fair, equitable and\u000arapid compensation for the victims of human rights violations and to ascertain that the human rights\u000aviolations committed in Bamenda do not happen again in Cameroon.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a11. The communication which was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on the 04/04/2003\u000ahad been registered under N° 272/2003, for consideration by the African Commission at its 33 rd Ordinary\u000aSession (15-29 May, in Niamey, Niger).\u000a12. By letter ACHPR/COMM/2 of the 15th April 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission\u000aacknowledged receipt of the Communication to the Complainants.\u000a13. During its 33rd Ordinary Session, the African Commission examined the complaint and decided to be\u000aseized of it. Consideration of its admissibility was deferred to its 34th Ordinary Session scheduled to be held\u000afrom the 7th to 21st October 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a14. By letter and by Note Verbale of the 27th June 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission\u000ainformed both the complainants and the Respondent State of the decision of the African Commission.\u000a15. On the 5th August 2003, the Secretariat received a memorandum from the complainants on the\u000aadmissibility of the complaint and conveyed it to the Respondent State by Note Verbale dated 6th August\u000a2003, whilst reminding it to convey its own memorandum to the Secretariat as early as possible.\u000a16. By Note Verbale of the 14th October 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cameroon\u000arequested additional information and more time for it to prepare its memorandum on the admissibility of the\u000acase.\u000a17. By letter of the 17th October 2003, the Secretariat contacted the complainants requesting them to\u000aprovide the supplementary information required by the Respondent State. The complainants complied\u000awithout delay and the request of the Respondent State was met on the 30th October 2003.\u000a18. During its 34th Ordinary Session which was held from the 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The\u000aGambia, the African Commission examined the complaint and heard the Parties. Sequel to this, the African\u000aCommission deferred its decision on admissibility of the case to its 35th Ordinary Session.\u000a19. By Note Verbale and by letter of the 16th and 17th December 2003 respectively, the Secretariat of the\u000aAfrican Commission informed the Parties reminding the Respondent State that its memorandum on\u000aadmissibility was still outstanding.\u000a20. By letter dated 16th March 2004, and received at the Secretariat of the Commission on the 18th March\u000a2004, the complainants conveyed a letter transmitting additional arguments in response to the oral\u000aarguments made by Respondent State at the 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 6th to\u000a20th November 2003.\u000a21. On the 19th March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission sent a Note Verbale to the\u000aRespondent State reminding it to send its comments on the admissibility of the complaint.\u000a22. By Note Verbale dated 6th April 2004 and received at the Secretariat of the African Commission, the\u000aRespondent State, referring to the Note Verbale sent to it on the 16th December 2003, informed the\u000aSecretariat that the case of which the African Commission had been seized and which opposed it to the\u000acomplainants, was still pending before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Cameroon\u000awhich had deferred the said case to the 26th May 2004.\u000a23. During its 35th Ordinary Session which was held in May/June 2004 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission examined the Complaint and heard the Parties on the admissibility of the case. On this\u000aoccasion, the Respondent State submitted in writing, its memorandum on the admissibility of the case to\u000athe Secretariat of the African Commission, which in turn had conveyed it to the complainant party by letter\u000adated 17th November 2004.\u000a24. During its 36th Ordinary Session, which was held in November/December 2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the complaint and declared it admissible.\u000a25. By letters dated 20th December 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission notified this decision to\u000athe Parties and requested their arguments on the merits of the case as early as possible.\u000a26. On 30th March 2005, the arguments of the Respondent State on the merits of the communication had\u000abeen received at the Secretariat of the African Commission through a Note Verbale dated 16th March 2005.\u000a2\u000a\u000a27. On 14th April 2005, the Secretariat of the Commission acknowledged receipt of the memorandum from\u000athe Respondent State on the merits of the communication and on that same date, conveyed it to the\u000acomplainant party for reaction.\u000a28. On 3rd October 2005, the complainant sent its rejoinder to the observations of the Respondent State on\u000athe merits of the complaint by letter dated 26th September 2005. On the 13th October 2005, the Secretariat\u000aacknowledged receipt of the letter.\u000a29. On 30th November 2005, this document had been forwarded against a receipt of acknowledgement, to\u000athe delegation of the Respondent State attending the 38th Ordinary Session of the Commission.\u000a30. During this same Session (21st November - 5th December 2005, Banjul, The Gambia), the African\u000aCommission examined the complaint and in the absence of any reaction from the Respondent State to the\u000aarguments of the complainant party on the merits of the case, differed its decision at this point to its 39th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a31. On 7th December 2005, this decision was notified to the Parties and the Respondent State, in particular\u000ahad been invited to send its reaction on the submissions of the complainant within 3 months.\u000a32. In the absence of any reaction from the Respondent State, a reminder had been sent to it on the 23rd\u000aMarch 2006.\u000a33. By Note Verbale dated 29th March 2006, and received by the Secretariat of the African Commission on\u000athe 13th April 2006, the Respondent State conveyed its reaction on the arguments submitted by the\u000acomplainant party on the merits of the case.\u000a34. The Secretariat transmitted these arguments to the complainant party on the 8th May 2006.\u000a35. In a Note Verbale dated 30th June 2006 and a letter also dated 30th June 2006, the Parties had been\u000arespectively informed that during its 39th Ordinary Session, the African Commission had decided to defer\u000athe case to its 40th Ordinary Session scheduled for the 15th to 29th November 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a36. On the 4th October 2006, the Secretariat of the commission received a memorandum from the\u000acomplainant party in rejoinder to the arguments on the merits formulated by the Respondent State to the\u000acommunication.\u000a37. During its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from the 15th to 29th November 2006, the\u000aAfrican Commission decided to defer the case to its 41st Ordinary Session scheduled for the 16th to 30th\u000aMay 2007 in Accra, Ghana for a ruling on the merits of the case.\u000a38. In a Note Verbale dated 31st January 2007 and a letter also dated 31st January 2007, the Parties were\u000ainformed about the deferment of the case to the 41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission\u000ascheduled for the 16th to 30th May 2007 in Accra, Ghana.\u000a39. During its 41st Ordinary Session held in Accra, Ghana, the African Commission had deferred the\u000acommunication to its 42nd Ordinary Session for a decision on the merits of the case.\u000a40. By Note Verbale dated 15th June 2007 and a letter dated the same day, the Parties to the\u000acommunication had been informed of the deferment of the case to the 42nd Ordinary Session of the\u000aCommission scheduled for the 14th to 28th November 2007 in Brazzaville, Congo.\u000a41. In a Note Verbale dated 11th September 2007 a letter had been sent to the Respondent State\u000areminding it of the deferment of the communication to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\u000a42. By letter dated 13th September 2007, the complainant party had been reminded about the deferment of\u000athe communication to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\u000a43. The Parties had been respectively informed in a Note Verbale and a letter dated 19th December 2007\u000aabout the deferment of the examination of the decision on the merits to the 43rd Ordinary Session of the\u000aCommission to be held from 15th to 29th May 2008 in Ezulwini, in the Kingdom of Swaziland.\u000a44. In a Note Verbale dated 18th March 2008 and a letter dated 20th March 2008, the Parties had been\u000areminded of the deferment of the case to the 43rd Ordinary Session of the Commission. The Parties had\u000ahowever been informed of the change of dates of the said Session the holding of which had been brought\u000aforward to the 7th to 22nd May 2008 instead of from 15th to 29th May as had been initially announced.\u000a45. In a Note Verbale dated 24th October 2008, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State about the\u000adeferment of consideration on the decision on the merits of the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session\u000ascheduled for the 10th to 24th November 2008 in Abuja, Nigeria.\u000a46. During the same period of the 24th October 2008, the complainants had been informed by letter of the\u000adeferment of the communication for examination on the merits to the 44th Ordinary Session of the African\u000aCommission.\u000a47. After the examination of the communication at the 44th Ordinary Session held in Abuja in the Federal\u000aRepublic of Nigeria, the African Commission deferred the reexamination to the 45th Ordinary Session\u000a3\u000a\u000ascheduled for the 13th to 27th May 2009 in Banjul, the Gambia for the consideration of the new\u000adevelopments in the area of international law.\u000a48. In a Note Verbale dated 21st December 2008 and a letter dated the same day, the Secretariat informed\u000athe Parties to the communication about the deferment of the case to the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled\u000afor 13th to 27th May 2009. In addition by note Verbale dated 23rd April 2009 and a letter dated the same\u000aday, a reminder was sent to the parties.\u000a49. The parties to the communication were informed that the matter was deferred to the 46th Ordinary\u000aSession of the Commission scheduled to be held in Banjul, The Gambia from 11th-25th November 2009 in a\u000aNote Verbale and a letter both dated June 11th, 2009.\u000a\u000aThe Law\u000aAdmissibility\u000a50. The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights stipulates in its Article 56 that the communications\u000areferred to in Article 55 should necessarily, in order to be considered, be sent after all local remedies have\u000abeen exhausted, if they exist, unless the procedure of exhaustion of local remedies is unduly prolonged.\u000a51. In this instance, the complainant, while admitting that the case is still under consideration by the legal\u000aAuthorities of the Respondent State who had been seized of it, contends that the procedures are unduly\u000aprolonged and that under these conditions the requirement that local remedies be exhausted as stipulated\u000aby Article 56 of the African Charter, cannot apply.\u000aArguments of the Complainant Party on the admissibility of the case\u000a\u000a52. In support of his argument, the complainant contends, in his memorandum on admissibility dated 05th\u000aAugust 2003, that the complaint had been deposited with the African Commission five years after the same\u000acomplaint against Cameroon had been brought before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of\u000athis State, and which has, to date, remained without any response.\u000a53. In the memorandum cited earlier, the complainant further contends that the alleged victims of the\u000acomplaint had made several fruitless submissions for an out-of-court settlement to the administrative and\u000apolitical Authorities of the Respondent State. The alleged victims had then brought an appeal for liability\u000aagainst the State of Cameroon before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court on the 13th March\u000a1998. The latter conveyed its statement on defence to the complainants on the 12th August 1998. Since\u000athat date and in spite of the reaction of the complainants (27th August 1998) and the numerous reminders,\u000athe complainants did not receive any more information relating to the case from the Administrative\u000aChamber of the Supreme Court, and this despite the national3 procedural legislation which stipulates that\u000aonce the exchange of arguments is completed, the case files should be closed in the 5 months that follow.\u000a5 years have passed without any reaction from the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.\u000a54. It is for this reason, pleads the complainant, that although local remedies are available, they do not <<\u000aat all respond to the imperative of efficacy which is their raison d'?tre>>. The complainant adds that the\u000aAdministrative Chamber of the Supreme Court is familiar with this type of practices, which is why\u000aCameroon had been condemned by the African Commission 4 (for a case which had remained pending for\u000a12 years before the Yaoundé Court of Appeal) as well as by the United Nations Human Rights\u000aCommission5 (for a case which had remained pending before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme\u000aCourt for more than 4 years).\u000a55. During a hearing at the 34th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the complainant party had\u000areiterated these arguments insisting on the fact that the bringing of this case before the African Commission\u000ahad contributed a lot to the revival of the case by the Cameroon legal Authorities after all these years of\u000ainaction.\u000a56. In its memorandum with supplementary information on admissibility, dated 18th March 2004, the\u000acomplainant recalled that the Respondent State had been condemned by the African Commission and by\u000athe United Nations Human Rights Commission for the slowness of its justice system. These delays, which\u000acannot be attributed to Cameroon's underdevelopment, but rather, according to the complainant, << to the\u000ainefficiency of the Cameroonian national Authorities, both legal and administrative >> are not only contrary\u000ato the African Charter but also to the principles of the right to a fair hearing adopted by the African\u000aCommission.\u000a4\u000a\u000a57. The complainant further reiterates that the violation, according to him, by the Administrative Chamber of\u000athe Supreme Court, of the regulations which stipulate that once the exchanges of memoranda are\u000acompleted, the latter should close the case file within 5 months, as since August 1998, the complainants\u000ahad not received any news from the said Chamber in spite of several reminders and, according to the\u000acomplainants, despite the fact that the Judges of this Court were << perfectly aware of the implications of\u000athis procedure for the complainants >>.\u000a58. The complainant party moreover denounces the attitude of the powers that be, who had made promises\u000awhich never culminated in results, but above all the shortcomings of the Cameroonian Authorities exposed\u000aby the mal-functioning of the Commission responsible for compensating the victims of the violence (placed\u000aunder the Prime Minister's Office), which had been created in the context of the effort to find an amicable\u000asolution to the problem. This Commission, declares the complainant, had been one of the local remedies\u000aopen to the victims. But 12 years after its creation and 11 years after having heard the victims, this\u000aCommission had still not submitted its report. There again, concludes the complainant, the delay is unduly\u000aprolonged. The complainant therefore implores the African Commission to declare the complaint\u000aadmissible.\u000aArguments of the Respondent State on the admissibility of the case\u000a\u000a59. The Respondent State had for its part pleaded, during the hearing before the African Commission at its\u000a34th Ordinary Session, that the delays observed in the administration of justice in Cameroon are due to the\u000aunder developed nature of the country, which does not have the means to provide all the facilities required\u000afor a diligent justice system, and not to a deliberate desire by the Government to hinder the administration\u000aof justice.\u000a60. The Respondent State again reiterated this point during a hearing by the African Commission at its 35th\u000aOrdinary Session. In its memorandum on admissibility submitted on this occasion, the Respondent State\u000apleads that the complaint is still under consideration before one of the highest national Courts which,\u000acertainly has a lot of backlog in its work, but which is aware of the situation and that the Parties require that\u000athe case be concluded by the national legal Authorities. Thus, on the 25th February and the 31st March\u000a2004, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court held two ordinary sessions. The debate on the\u000acase in question, scheduled for the 31st March 2004 had been postponed to the 26th May 2004 on the\u000arequest of the Counsel for the complainants.\u000a61. The Respondent State further pointed out that for these reasons, the Complainant should not speak of\u000aabnormally long delays in the Cameroonian justice system, particularly where the << current delay is not\u000aattributable to the Court in charge of the case but rather to the Complainant Party itself >>.\u000a62. In consequence, the Respondent State requests the African Commission to declare the communication\u000ainadmissible.\u000aAnalysis of the African Commission on the admissibility\u000a\u000a63. The African Commission considers that the complainant party, before appearing before it had started to\u000ause the remedies available at the local level. The procedure before the Administrative Chamber of the\u000aSupreme Court had lasted 5 years without any feedback for the complainants, contrary to the regulations in\u000aforce and in spite of the numerous reminders which had been sent to the said Court. The African\u000aCommission therefore considers that the delay on the part of the Court in the treatment of the case was\u000aunduly prolonged.\u000a64. Pertaining to the Compensation Commission set up under the Prime Minister's Office, its operations\u000awere highly inefficient as 12 years after its creation and 11 years after hearing the victims, it had not\u000apublished its report. There also, the African Commission considers that this ad hoc Commission, whose\u000aestablishment was aimed at achieving an amicable settlement of the case, had registered excessive delays\u000ain its operations.\u000a65. The Respondent State pleads that the legal authorities remain aware of the case at the national level\u000abut the African Commission considers the delays by the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of\u000aCameroon excessive.\u000a66. The African Commission further notes that re-introduction of the proceedings on the case before the\u000aAdministrative Chamber of the Supreme Court in February 2004, namely after a gap of 5 years, only took\u000aplace after the submission of a Complaint (to the African Commission), by the victims in April 2003 and\u000aafter the decision on seizure taken by the Commission on the said complaint in May 2003 (33rd Ordinary\u000a5\u000a\u000aSession), as well as the hearing of the Parties to the case in November 2003 during its 34th Ordinary\u000aSession. This leads the African Commission to presume that the re-introduction of the proceedings was not\u000aaccidental but rather it was due to the action brought by the victims before the African Commission.\u000a67. The African Commission considers that State Parties have an obligation to administer, on their territory,\u000aclear and diligent justice in order to give satisfaction to the complainants in the shortest possible time, in\u000aconformity with the relevant provisions of the African Charter and with the directives and principles of the\u000aright to a fair hearing in Africa.\u000a68. In this particular case, the Commission notes that for 5 years, the Administrative Chamber of the\u000aSupreme Court of the Respondent State had not provided any reaction to the complainants, in spite of\u000aseveral appeals by the latter. The Respondent State has admitted this fact but attributes it to lack of\u000aresources. Consideration of the case has indeed recommenced a short while ago, but one can reasonably\u000aconclude that this consideration was largely due to the seizure of the African Commission by the victims.\u000aWhereas this should not be the case, that is, justice to be administered by State Parties should not wait for\u000athe African Commission to be seized of a matter before it is rendered fully, clearly and diligently. This had\u000anot been the case with the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of the Respondent State.\u000a69. Concerning the Compensation Commission, an ad hoc institution meant to solve the problem amicably\u000aat the national level, has shown its limitations in failing to produce any Report after twelve years of\u000aexistence. The Respondent State does not refute these allegations, which allows one to believe that they\u000aare true. The African Commission therefore considers that this remedy is neither effective nor satisfactory.\u000a70. For these reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible.\u000aThe Merits\u000a71. Pursuant to Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, once a communication\u000awhich is submitted under the terms of Article 55 of the Charter has been declared admissible, the\u000aCommission << examines it in the light of all the information which the complainant and the Respondent\u000aState concerned have submitted in writing, and it renders its observations on the subject >>.\u000a72. It appears from the case file that parties have made their conclusions on the merits of the case since\u000a30th March 2005, and that the information provided by the Parties to the Communication and added to the\u000acase file is sufficient to allow a ruling on the merits of the case.\u000aSubmissions of the complainants on the merit\u000a\u000a73. The complainants are requesting the African Commission to declare the State of Cameroon in violation\u000aof the relevant provisions of the African Charter and in particular of Articles 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the said\u000aCharter and, in consequence, to declare the State of Cameroon bound to pay compensation for the\u000aprejudices sustained by the victims of the post electoral events of 1992.\u000a74. The Commission is consequently obliged to examine the alleged violations on the basis of the facts and\u000athe law.\u000aOn the violation of Article 1 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a75. Under the terms of Article 1 of the African Charter, << the OAU Member States, Parties to the present\u000aCharter, recognize the rights, responsibilities and freedoms enunciated in this Charter and undertake to\u000aadopt legislative and other measures for their application>>.\u000aArguments of the complainants pertaining to the violation of Article 1 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a76. From the point of view of the violation of Article 1, the complainants contend:\u000ai. That the African Charter sets out in its Article 1 a general obligation on the protection of rights. In this\u000acontext, like << the majority of the human rights treaties, besides requiring the States Parties to abstain\u000afrom all violation or unauthorized restriction of the rights it proclaims, compels them to take positive\u000ameasures to guarantee the widest possible protection of the individuals under their jurisdiction >>.\u000aii. That if the recognition referred to by Article 1 of the Charter << bestows them universality6 , to the\u000aguaranteed rights, the taking of appropriate measures allows them to assume real effectiveness >>. That\u000athe Commission has had the opportunity to underscore this aspect during the examination of a case on the\u000a6\u000a\u000aactivities of a petroleum consortium in Southern Nigeria by re-affirming that the African Charter was\u000acreating a certain number of obligations for the States Parties which include, in particular, << the\u000aresponsibility of respecting, protecting, promoting and implementing 7 >> the rights which it sets out before\u000aspecifying that << the Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens, not only by adopting\u000aappropriate legislation and by applying them effectively, but also by protecting the said citizens from\u000aharmful activities which can be perpetrated by private parties. This responsibility requires positive action on\u000atheir part >>.\u000aiii.

That the Commission had to judge that the refusal or the negligence of the\u000a\u2022 Authorities of a State Party to protect journalists and human rights activists against\u000a\u2022 repeated attacks (harassment, arbitrary arrests, assassination, torture) by the security forces and\u000aunidentified groups, constitutes (d) a violation of the said Charter even if this State or its officers are\u000a(were) not the direct perpetrators of this violation>>.\u000a11\u000a\u000av. That the present communication provides the Commission with the opportunity to a. clarify the meaning\u000aand scope of the << positive actions >> that the States are required to carry out in order to conform with the\u000aconditions of the African Charter, and this, by responding to the affirmation made by the Cameroonian\u000aAuthorities and according to which the implementation of << all the legal, technical, human and material\u000ameans at their disposal to control the post-electoral events of Bamenda in 1992 frees them from the\u000aobligation of means which is incumbent upon them >>.\u000avi. That the African Charter really and truly imposes an obligation of result and not one of diligence on the\u000aStates Parties, of guaranteeing to the victims of the October 1992 events the enjoyment and effective\u000aexercise of the rights which it proclaims and the lack of respect for which gives rise to a right to\u000acompensation for the victims or their dependents and implies, for the Cameroonian State, the responsibility\u000ato compensate and the freedom to act against the perpetrator or perpetrators of the violation.\u000avii. That, in effect, where, the Commission has not had numerous opportunities to make a ruling on the\u000aexact content of Articles 1 of the Charter12 , it has nonetheless pointed out that this Article is the basis of\u000athe rights recognized by the African Charter in so far as it confers on it << the legally binding nature which\u000ais generally attributed to international Treaties of this nature and that any violation of one of its provisions\u000awould automatically represent a violation of Article 1>>.13\u000a\u000aPertaining to the violation of Articles 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a77. Concerning the violation of Articles 2, 4, 7 and 14 the complainants appear to link it to the importance\u000athat Article 1 represents in the present case, since according to the complainants, Article 1 is << the only\u000aone which defines the scope of the legal obligations contracted by the States Parties to the Charter,\u000athereby allowing correct interpretation of the obligations contained in the other provisions of the Continental\u000aTreaty >>. Thus, the complainants contend that if taken in isolation, Article 1 of the Charter commits the\u000aState Parties to taking all the necessary legislative measures allowing the effective protection of the rights\u000aand liberties contained in the Charter, that is to say, of averting or at least of minimizing all risks of violating\u000athe exercise or enjoyment of these rights, and in combination with the other relevant provisions of the\u000aCharter, the obligation of averting violations imposes on the States Parties the obligations of:\u000a\u2022 Taking preventive measures;\u000a\u2022 Taking measures so that the enjoyment and exercise of the rights are not hindered by measures of\u000aseizure14 or of expropriation which are not dictated by the satisfaction of a general interest or a\u000apublic necessity or even the looting or the destruction of the property of natural persons or legal\u000aentities;\u000a\u2022 Putting in place legislation which makes it possible to avert, repress and punish violations to life, but\u000aalso << to take preventive measures of a practical nature to protect the individual whose life is\u000athreatened by the actions of another>>.15\u000a\u000a78. Thus, the complainants contend :\u000a8\u000a\u000a1.\u000a2. That the above mentioned articles had been violated by the State of Cameroon since the latter had\u000afailed in its obligation to take adequate preventive measures if not to avert or prevent the events in\u000aquestion, at least to reduce them to zero. To support this reasoning, the complainants emphasize\u000athat the Cameroonian authorities knew that the Bamenda events were going to take place and that\u000aseveral personalities had spoken of threats coming from the Social Democratic Front (SDF) against\u000athe security of people and property in the Province.\u000a3. That the Prime Minister at the time, Mr. Achidi Achu had alluded to the said threats.\u000a4. in the campaign speech he made on the 6th October 199216 in Kumbo in the North-West Province.\u000aThe said threats had been later mentioned by the Minister of Communication and Government\u000aSpokes-person in a press briefing on the political situation of the country during which he had\u000aspoken of the existence of a provisional arsenal of the SDF estimated at 300 pistols and 60 combat\u000a17 weapons. Furthermore, in the interview granted to the national Daily the Cameroon Tribune, the\u000aSecretary General of the ruling CPDM Party, had unveiled << the diabolical plan>> concocted at the\u000abeginning of the month of October by the Opposition to take over power18 . Moreover, direct threats\u000ahaving been made against all those who support the ruling party, several complaints received by the\u000aGovernor of the North West province brought by citizens wishing to obtain Government protection\u000atestify to the fact that the territorial Administrative Authorities had been informed about the SDF's\u000aplans.\u000a5. That despite these early warning signs, the Government of Cameroon, in neglecting to take\u000aadequate measures to prevent the events of October 1992 from taking place, thereby violated, even\u000apassively, the obligation of prevention contained in Article 1 of the African Charter. The State of\u000aCameroon has neither brought the perpetrators of these atrocities to justice, nor paid compensation\u000afor the damages suffered by the victims whose right to an effective remedy has been violated.\u000a6. That in consequence, the Commission should request the Cameroonian Authorities, in conformity\u000awith its own jurisprudence19 , to pay compensation in view of the long delay by the Justice\u000aAdministration in examining the Complainants' case. In conclusion, the Commission is being\u000arequested to reject the arguments of the Cameroonian Government, to take note of the violation of\u000aArticles 1, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter; to request the Government of Cameroon to institute\u000aproceedings against the perpetrators of the atrocities committed between the 23rd and 27th October\u000a1992; to determine, on the basis of the evidence presented, the amount of compensation to be paid\u000ato the victims based on all the damages suffered by the latter. The Complainants further request the\u000aCommission to ask the State of Cameroon to amend the laws which are incompatible with the\u000aprovisions of the African Charter and to fix a deadline for the State of Cameroon relative to the\u000aapplication of any decision that the Commission may take on this matter.\u000a\u000aThe essence of the arguments of the respondent state in relation to the violation of Articles 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African\u000aCharter\u000a\u000a79. The Respondent State for its part, argues that the violations being alluded to by the complainants are\u000acompletely groundless since the State of Cameroon has not, in this particular case, deprived any of the\u000acomplainants of the right to respect for his life and physical integrity nor his right to property. The State of\u000aCameroon took measures to save the life and property of individuals during what can be called the\u000aBamenda events.\u000a80. Furthermore, the Respondent State intimates that this particular case happened in the context of the\u000ayears called democratic agitation during which Cameroon had experienced a certain amount of agitation\u000adue to the return to a multiparty system and to individual liberties. That for this reason, from May 1990 to\u000aDecember 1992, and due to the organization of two major elections, the legislative then the presidential,\u000apublic law and order had been disrupted throughout the country thereby giving rise to a large loss of life,\u000aand important material damage.\u000a9\u000a\u000a81. According to the Respondent State, the specific case of Bamenda, which was of major proportions took\u000aplace between the 23rd and 30th October 1992, and was marked notably by the difficulty of the State to\u000amaintain law and order. The Respondent State further contends that in the case of Bamenda, the\u000aimplementation of the mandate to protect people and property by using the forces of law and order had\u000abeen reinforced after the 23rd October 1992, date on which the results of the presidential elections were\u000aproclaimed. Thus, about 548 men had been deployed in the region of Bamenda with motor vehicles and\u000aother vehicles for the maintenance of law and order and equipment adapted to deal with the situation on\u000athe ground. However, although the post electoral disturbances had taken place in other parts of the\u000aterritory, these incidents had been extraordinarily violent in Bamenda where they took the form of a\u000ageneralized insurrection and had been instigated by the militants of an Opposition Party, the Social\u000aDemocratic Front (SDF).\u000a82. Moreover, the Respondent State contends that::\u000a1.\u000a2. Following the destruction, a joint Gendarmerie-Police-Justice Commission had been set up and\u000agiven the responsibility for carrying out investigations on all suspects who had been arrested.\u000aHowever, the individuals who were given heavy charges and had been brought before the State\u000asecurity Court had later been released on the persistent request of the human rights defender\u000aorganizations.\u000a3. That it happened that the State of Cameroon, having steadfastly implemented the legal, technical,\u000ahuman and material resources at its disposal to contain the post electoral events of Bamenda in\u000a1992, it was thus freed from the obligation of diligence which was its responsibility. The extent of the\u000aevents in question having the character of force majeure was such that they could not be attributed\u000ato the State of Cameroon.\u000a4. That in view of the full compensation being demanded by the complainants, it should be recalled\u000athat the responsibility of the State of Cameroon could not be established in either the unexpected\u000ahappening of the Bamenda events, or in their management. Consequently, it would be extremely\u000adifficult to pay compensation since there is no law which authorizes this sort of payment particularly\u000awhere the State is not the perpetrator in any way.\u000a5. That in relation to the enactment of a law allowing the payment of fair and equitable compensation\u000ato the victims of the human rights violations in Cameroon, following the unexpected happening of\u000athe events in question, the following institutions had been successively put in place:\u000a\u2666\u000a\u2666 An organization for political dialogue at the national level called the Tripartite and comprising\u000athe State, Civil Society and the Political Parties. This Tripartite had made possible the\u000arealization of the constitutional amendments of 18th January 1996.\u000a\u2666 A Committee then a National Human Rights and Liberties Commission;\u000a\u2666 A National Elections Observatory and the strengthening of the National Communications\u000aCouncil.\u000a\u000a6. That taking all these matters into consideration and with all the proper reservations, the African\u000aCommission should declare the present communication baseless.\u000a\u000aAnalysis of the Commission with regard to the nature and scope of the obligation conatained in Article 1 of the African\u000aCharter\u000a\u000a83. It follows from the arguments of the facts and the law presented by the complainant party and\u000aresponded to by the Respondent Party, that the nature and the scope of the obligation contained in Article\u000a1 of the African Charter constitute a matter of special importance in the present communication. Thus,\u000a10\u000a\u000aaccording to the complainant party, Article 1 of the African Charter imposes an obligation on the States\u000aParties to take measures which can produce concrete results. Whereas it can be inferred from the\u000aarguments submitted by the Respondent Party that the provisions of Article 1 of the African Charter impose\u000aan obligation of diligence on the States Parties.\u000a84. It is therefore up to the African Commission to clarify the nature and scope of this article. It is evident\u000athat the legal aspect raised by the argument of the two parties present before the African Commission\u000arelates to the question whether Article 1 of the African Charter imposes an obligation of diligence or an\u000aobligation of result vis-?-vis the States Parties to the said Charter. In other words, did the States Parties to\u000athe African Charter make the commitment of taking measures which should give certain results by virtue of\u000aArticle 1?\u000a85. In view of the importance of this question of law, and the importance which the complainant party\u000aappears to give Article 1, the African Commission should, in the present communication, determine the\u000alegal nature of the obligation which the afore-mentioned Article imposes on States Parties.\u000aThe extent or the scope of the obligation contained in Article 1 of the Charter\u000a\u000a86. Concerning the scope or the extent of the obligation imposed by Article 1 of the African Charter, it is\u000aimportant to point out that it had been clarified sui generis20 , (in a distinctive manner) and that the\u000aCommission's jurisprudence is abundant enough in this area.\u000a87. Thus, according to the Commission's jurisprudence, Article 1 confers on the Charter the legally binding\u000acharacter generally attributed to international Treaties of this nature. The responsibility of the State Party is\u000aestablished by virtue of Article 1 of the Charter in case of the violation of any of the provisions of the\u000aCharter. Article 1 places the States Parties under the obligation of respecting, protecting, promoting and\u000aimplementing the rights.\u000a88. The respect for the rights imposes on the State the negative obligation of doing nothing to violate the\u000asaid rights. The protection targets the positive obligation of the State to guarantee that private individuals\u000ado not violate these rights. In this context, the Commission ruled that the negligence of a State to guarantee\u000athe protection of the rights of the Charter having given rise to a violation of the said rights constitutes a\u000aviolation of the rights of the Charter which would be attributable to this State, even where it is established\u000athat the State itself or its officials are not directly responsible for such violations but have been perpetrated\u000aby private21 individuals.\u000a89. According to the permanent jurisprudence of the Commission, Article 1 imposes restrictions on the\u000aauthority of the State Institutions in relation to the recognized rights. This Article places on the State Parties\u000athe positive obligation of preventing and punishing the violation by private individuals of the rights\u000aprescribed by the Charter. Thus any illegal act carried out by an individual against the rights guaranteed\u000aand not directly attributable to the State can constitute, as had been indicated earlier, a cause of\u000ainternational responsibility of the State, not because it has itself committed the act in question, but because\u000ait has failed to exercise the conscientiousness required to prevent it from happening and for not having\u000abeen able to take the appropriate measures to pay compensation for the prejudice suffered by the victims22\u000a.\u000a90. In this context of prevention, the State should carry out investigations so as to detect the various risks\u000aof violence and take the necessary preventive measures. The problem here does not concern so much the\u000aacts violating the rights but rather of knowing whether the State took the tangible measures to prevent the\u000aimminent risks of perpetration of the said acts. It is not a question of inculpating the State for its lack of\u000aconscientiousness regarding any act perpetrated in relation to the guaranteed rights but of knowing\u000awhether the State, considering the imminent risks of serious violations, used due diligence that was\u000arequired. Under the terms of comparative law, it is the position that was taken by the Inter-American Human\u000aRights Court in the Vélasquez Rodriguez case in the following terms:\u000a91. "an illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to a state (for\u000aexample because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been\u000aidentified) can lead to the international responsibility of State, not because of the act itself, but because of\u000athe absence of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the convention."\u000a92. In the case Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum vrs. Zimbabwe, the Commission had indicated and ruled\u000athat the doctrine of due diligence should be applied on a case by case basis.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000aOn the nature of the obligation contained in Article 1 of the Charter\u000a\u000a93. The scope of the State's general obligation to protect, sanctioned by Article 1 of the Charter having\u000abeen clarified, it is therefore necessary to determine the nature of this obligation. Is it an obligation of\u000adiligence or an obligation of result?\u000a94. Though by their origin, the obligation of diligence and the obligation of result emanate from the\u000adomestic law systems, particularly from continental civil law, this term has also been frequently used in\u000ainternational law since the 20th century23 .\u000a95. The obligation of diligence consists, for a party to a contract, in placing at the disposal of the other party\u000aall the available resources without however guaranteeing the result that the said resources would produce.\u000aThus, in the context of this obligation, the debtor undertakes to deploy all efforts to provide the creditor with\u000aa given requirement, but without being able to guarantee it. It is the case of the doctor who undertakes to\u000aprovide all the necessary care to his patient without however being able to guarantee the recovery of the\u000asaid patient.\u000a96. The assertion of such a responsibility has the effect of compelling the party on whom reposes the\u000aobligation of diligence to pay compensation for the damages it may have caused in the execution of this\u000aobligation. This compensation takes the form of a conviction for the payment of damages with interest, that\u000ais to say an obligation to pay a sum of money. It is in this context that the notion of obligations arises, to\u000awhich the Respondent State alludes in talking about its resources on the one hand and its corollary, the\u000aobligations of result, on the other.\u000a97. On the contrary, the obligation of result pre-supposes the commitment of the debtor to obtain a specific\u000aresult. Thus, in the context of this obligation, the transporter of a traveller undertakes to carry the passenger\u000afrom point A to point B safe and sound.\u000a98. Pertaining to evidence, the evidence of a fault is only required from the complainant in the case of\u000aobligations of diligence since the complainant has to prove that the debtor has not deployed all the required\u000aefforts to obtain the success of the undertaking. On the other hand, the creditor of an obligation of result is\u000aexempted from providing such evidence. In effect, all he has to do is to establish that the promised result\u000ahas not been obtained; the debtor can only obtain release from his responsibility by establishing that the\u000anon-execution is due to circumstances beyond his control which cannot be attributed to him but to force\u000amajeure. The force majeure represents a foreign event which is both unforeseeable and uncontrollable\u000awhich is at the root of an injury24\u000a99. Generally, in international law, the notion of obligation of diligence and that of result emanate from the\u000ainterpretation of Articles 20 and 21 of the draft articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) pertaining\u000ato the responsibilities of States. It must be noted that the comments from these two articles were adopted\u000aby the ILC which caused the latter to make a distinction between the violation of international obligations\u000areferred to as "behaviour" or "diligence" and the violation of obligations otherwise called " result" 25\u000a100. Under Article 20 of the draft Articles of the ILC entitled "Violation of an international obligation requiring\u000athe adoption of a predetermined specific behaviour when the behaviour of the said State is at variance with\u000athe behaviour specified under that obligation".\u000a101. In respect of Article 21 of the draft ILC Articles which is entitled "Violation of an international obligation\u000arequiring the attainment of a specific result, the provision stipulates that: "1) A State is in violation of an\u000aobligation requiting it to choose a determined result if by the behaviour exhibited, the State does not ensure\u000athe realisation of the expected result required from it under the terms of that obligation. 2) If the behaviour\u000aof the State has created a situation that does not conform to the result required from it by the international\u000aobligation, but that it emerges from the obligation that this result or an equivalent result can all the same be\u000aachieved by the subsequent behaviour of the State, then a violation of the obligation occurs only when the\u000aState also fails by its subsequent behaviour to achieve the result expected from her by that obligation".\u000a102. Thus, if the obligation of diligence requires that the State adopts specific behaviours or actions to\u000aattain specific results, then under obligation of result, the State enjoys the freedom of choice and action to\u000aachieve the result required by that obligation.\u000a103. Consequently, in the case Colozza vs Italy 26 , the European Court of Human Rights declared and\u000arendered judgement that " the contracting States (parties) enjoy very wide discretion in terms of the\u000acalculation of the choices and means to ensure that their legal systems are in keeping with the provisions of\u000aArticle 6 paragraph 1 (Art 6-1) in this field. The task of the Court is not to indicate to the States these\u000ameans, but to determine if the result required by the Convention had been achieved".\u000a12\u000a\u000a104. Similarly, in the De Cubber vs Belgium27 , the European Court of Human Rights observed that its task\u000awas to determine if the contracting States achieved the result required by the European Convention and\u000athat its task was not to point out specifically the means used to arrive at that result.\u000a105. Moreover, in the judgement pronounced on January 19th, 2009 in the case relating to the request for\u000ainterpretation of the judgement of March 31st, 2004, in the Avena case and other Mexican citizens (Mexico\u000avs the United States of America28 , the International Court of Justice which had been seized by Mexico for\u000athe interpretation of paragraph 153 of the aforementioned judgement as imposing on the United States of\u000aAmerica an obligation of result, maintained that "It is true that the obligation enunciated in this paragraph is\u000aan obligation of result which should manifestly be enforced unconditionally"29 .\u000a106. Thus, the question that arises generally is to appreciate, on the one hand, the ultimate purpose or\u000aobjective of the rights prescribed by the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and on the other\u000ahand, whether yes or no the obligation prescribed in Article 1 of the Charter seeks to attain a purpose, an\u000aobjective or to achieve a result through the provisions contained therein.\u000a107. In the view of the Commission, the distinction between the obligation of diligence and that of result\u000ashould not make one lose sight of the fact that , all obligations contained in a Treaty, Convention or a\u000aCharter seek to attain an objective, a purpose or a result. The Governments of the States Parties are linked\u000ato the people living on their territory by a social contract consisting of ensuring the security and\u000aguaranteeing the fundamental rights, including the right to life and respect for the physical and material\u000aintegrity of the citizens. Where the rights, responsibilities and freedoms recognized by the States Parties to\u000athe Charter can hardly pose major problems, since these regulations are outlined in the Articles 2 to 29 of\u000athe Charter and their recognition emanates from the will of the States themselves to ratify the Charter,\u000anonetheless this recognition ensues from the commitment made by these States to take tangible measures\u000acapable of implementing the provisions prescribed by the Charter.\u000a108. It is also important to clarify that the signature, acceptance and ratification by the States of the\u000aprovisions contained in the Charter, the preparation or the adoption of legal human rights instruments only\u000aconstitute, in themselves, the beginning of the indispensable exercise of promotion, protection and the\u000areparation of human and peoples' rights. The practical implementation of these legal instruments through\u000athe State Institutions endowed with creditor, material and human resources, is also of considerable\u000aimportance. It is not enough to make do with taking measures, these measures should also be\u000aaccompanied with institutions that produce tangible results. Furthermore, the Periodic Report imposed on\u000athe States Parties in the context of Article 62 of the African Charter is part of the procedure placed at the\u000adisposal of the African Commission to verify the results obtained by the States regarding their commitment\u000aas outlined in Article 1 of the said Charter.\u000a109. Where it is true that the laws guaranteeing the rights and freedoms, those criminalizing the given facts\u000aand providing for penalties against the perpetrators of the said facts, as well as the State institutions which\u000aimplement these instruments use the resources at the disposal of the citizens, it is also true that the\u000adecisions of the Courts and Tribunals made in relation to the violations of these rights and the results of the\u000aexecution of the said decisions, contribute to restoring the rights of the victims.\u000a110. It follows from the above that Article 1 of the African Charter imposes on the States Parties the\u000aobligation of using the necessary diligence to implement the provisions prescribed by the Charter since the\u000asaid diligence has to evolve in relation to the time, space and circumstances, and has to be followed by\u000apractical action on the ground in order to produce concrete results. Thus, in its decision on Communication\u000a74/92, the Commission said that the Governments have the responsibility of protecting their citizens not\u000aonly through appropriate legislation and its effective enforcement but also by protecting them against\u000ainjurious acts which can be perpetrated by third parties.\u000a111. In fact, in the Commission's view, it is an obligation of RESULT that Article 1 of the African Charter\u000aimposes on the States Parties. In effect, each State has the obligation of guaranteeing the protection of the\u000ahuman rights written in the Charter by adopting not only the means that the Charter itself prescribes, in\u000aparticular "all the necessary legislative measures for this purpose but in addition measures of their choice\u000athat the Charter called for by Article 1 and it therefore defined as one of result".\u000a112. In accordance with its traditional commitment to protect the rights guaranteed by the Charter, the State\u000aParty is obliged to ensure the effective protection of human rights through out its territory. If this obligation\u000awere that of an obligation of diligence the guaranteeing of human rights would be the object of legal\u000ainsecurity liable to release the State Parties to the human rights protection instruments from any\u000aresponsibility of effective protection. It is in taking into account the compelling nature of the protection of\u000ahuman rights that the human rights instruments set up control institutions to ensure that the obligations\u000a13\u000a\u000aensuing from these instruments are effectively implemented.\u000aAnalysis of the Commission with regard to the application of the case in point\u000a\u000a113. The legal nature of the obligations outlined in the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter having been\u000aclarified, the specific question raised with regard to its application to the case in point is that of knowing\u000awhether the State of Cameroon was held by an obligation of diligence or an obligation of result and whether\u000athe circumstance of force majeure cited by the Respondent State is fulfilled in order to release the said\u000aState from its obligation.\u000a114. The Complainant contends that the State of Cameroon is bound by an obligation of result and\u000aconsequently is compelled to pay compensation for the injuries suffered by the victims of the 1992\u000apost-electoral events. The State of Cameroon on her part maintains that it was bound by an obligation of\u000adiligence as the 1992 events were of an insurrectional character. They are akin to a situation of force\u000amajeure which the means employed by the Government could not curtail. Consequently, the State of\u000aCameroon avers that it is free from any liability.\u000a115. Pertaining to the case in point, considering the definition of the legal nature indicated above, the\u000aCommission is of the view that the obligations which ensue from Article 1 impose on the State of Cameroon\u000athe need to implement all the measures required to produce the result of protecting the individuals living on\u000aits territory. The use of the legal, technical, human and material resources that the State of Cameroon\u000aclaims to have did not produce the expected result, namely that of guaranteeing the protection of human\u000arights. For the post electoral events which gave rise to serious violations against the lives and property of\u000athe citizens would not have taken place if the State which, through its investigations knew or should have\u000aknown about the planning of the said events, had taken the necessary measures to prevent their\u000ahappening.\u000a116. The events in question having taken place the day after the announcement of the results of the\u000apresidential elections, the Authorities only acted four days after the exploding of the hostilities, which\u000apromoted the magnitude of the violence and the serious violations of human rights and destruction of\u000aproperty. It has been established that, under the circumstances, the Respondent State has failed in its\u000aobligation to protect, considering its lack of diligence and allowed the destruction of lives and property.\u000aFurthermore, by invoking the circumstances of force majeure to free itself from its responsibility, the State\u000aof Cameroon has implicitly shown that it had been held by an obligation of result in this particular case.\u000a117. In principle, the circumstance of force majeure which assumes the characters of unpredictability,\u000airresistibility and imputability can be invoked if the conditions had been fulfilled at the time of the events. In\u000athis case, the said characters of unpredictability, irresistibility and imputability required by a situation of\u000aforce majeure and which the Respondent Party is invoking cannot be applicable for, according to the\u000aRespondent State itself, disturbances of public law and order existed in the country since May 1990 and\u000aspecifically during the holding of the elections, and that moreover, the threats30 of the 11th, 18th, 19th and\u000a22nd October 1992 from the SDF, the Opposition Party and qualified by the Respondent State as << an\u000aatmosphere of political intimidation and counter intimidation... >> , sufficiently prove the existence of early\u000awarning signs of the events in question and consequently the predictability of the events.\u000a118. What is more, the Respondent State had manifested its control of the territory and therefore its ability\u000ato stand up to the perpetrators of the post electoral events, by instituting a state of siege a few days after\u000athe events in question; had this state of siege been instituted earlier, the events in question would have at\u000aleast been reduced in scope if not entirely quelled.\u000a119. The obligations prescribed by the African Charter in its Article 1 impose on the States Parties (the\u000aState of Cameroon included) the need to put in place all measures liable to produce the result of preventing\u000aall violations of the African Charter over their entire territory. These are not only violations which could\u000aemanate from the State machinery itself or those from non State actors. The implementation of the legal ,\u000atechnical, human and material means alluded to by the State of Cameroon should have, in principle,\u000aproduced the result of preventing the events in question since the said events were foreseeable; the said\u000ameans should at least, have served to bring the perpetrators to justice, have them judged and sentenced in\u000aaccordance with the law and restore the rights of the victims or their dependents after the said events had\u000ataken place. This is an ? posteriori result which should have produced results considering the means\u000achosen by the State of Cameroon itself\u000a120. Each State Party to the African Charter is responsible for the security of the people and property living\u000aeverywhere on its territory. Having a character of erga omnes31 , such an obligation constitutes part of\u000a14\u000a\u000athose which cover a particular interest for all the States Parties to the African Charter and for the entire\u000ainternational Community since it is recognized in both domestic and international law. Therefore, as\u000aunderscored by the Respondent State, if it cannot be directly responsible for the events, the State of\u000aCameroon cannot also extricate itself from its responsibility for the actions of others which are a result of its\u000afailure to conform to the provisions prescribed by Article 1 of the African Charter and therefore of its\u000aobligation of RESULT .\u000a121. Consequently, in having failed to prevent the 1992 post electoral violence even though there were\u000aearly warning signs (evidently) of the events in question and not having obtained the intended results\u000amentioned above, the State of Cameroon has failed in its obligation of Result imposed on it by Article 1 of\u000athe African Charter, and that in consequence the Respondent State is hardly in a position to invoke the\u000acircumstances of force majeure. It therefore follows that the victims and their dependents should have their\u000arights restored in full.\u000aAnalysis of the Commission with regard to the violation of Articles 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a122. By invoking the violation of Articles 2 and 7 of the Charter, the Complainants wish to contest the\u000afreezing of the petition by the victims pertaining to responsibility of the issue which has been pending\u000abefore the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court since 1998, in order to obtain full compensation\u000aof the corporal and material damages suffered. For the Complainants this procedure constitutes a violation\u000aof the right to an effective remedy.\u000a123. Article 2 stipulates that: << Every individual has the right to enjoy the rights and freedoms recognized\u000aand guaranteed under the present Charter without distinction of any kind, such as race, ethnic group,\u000acolour, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national or social origin, fortune, birth or other\u000astatus >>.\u000a124. It appears that complainants drew the infringement of the enjoyment of their rights and freedoms\u000ahence the violation of Article 2 of the Charter, from the fact that the respondent State failed to take\u000aadequate measures to prevent the violence which led to the physical harm and material damage suffered\u000aby the victims.\u000a125. The African Commission is of the view that there is no doubt in the present case that the victims of the\u000apost elections violence suffered from damage which infringed the enjoyment of their rights. Respondent\u000aState did not debate the fact of harm being caused to the victims, but rather argued that the post election\u000aevents are act of God and therefore it is beyond the capability of the State of Cameroon which should not\u000abe held liable\u000a126. The African Commission is therefore in the position to hold that the provisions of Article 2 of the\u000aAfrican Charter have been violated because the victims were enjoying their rights and freedoms when they\u000awere attacked. Such attacks which infringed their rights and freedoms were made possible because the\u000aState of Cameroon failed to fulfill its obligation to protect which incumbent upon the State.\u000a127. Article 7 stipulates: << Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This right\u000acomprises: [...] (d) the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial Court or Tribunal >>.\u000a128. The term << remedy >> refers to << any procedure by means of which one submits a constitutive act\u000aof an alleged violation of the [Charter] to an institution qualified in this respect, for the purpose of obtaining,\u000aas the case may be, a cessation of the act, its annulment, its amendment or compensation >>32 . Is\u000aeffective the remedy which not only exists de facto, but also is accessible to the party concerned and is\u000aappropriate. The petition should be appropriate so as to allow the denunciation of the alleged violations and\u000athe payment of appropriate compensation.\u000a129. However, the effectiveness of the remedy is not linked to the expected outcomes. Nonetheless, the\u000aeffects in question should be of a nature to remedy the alleged violation, otherwise the effective character\u000aof the remedy disappears. Finally, there is need to specify that the right to effective remedy sanctions an\u000aobligation of diligence, for what is guaranteed is the existence of an appropriate remedy and not its\u000afavourable result, but an unfavourable jurisprudence renders the remedy useless.\u000a130. Considering all of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the complainants did not benefit\u000afrom the right to an effective remedy, for if it was established that the remedy was available and\u000aassessable, it should be noted that it had not been appropriate since the fact that it was frozen made it\u000aimpossible for the Court to make a ruling. The petition remained pending for more than 5 years before the\u000acomplainants decided to seize the African Commission in 2003.\u000a15\u000a\u000a131. With regard to Articles 4 and 14, the complainants highlight the violations to the physical integrity and\u000ato the material damages suffered by the victims.\u000a132. Under the terms of Article 4, << Human beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to\u000arespect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right >>.\u000a133. Article 14 provides that "The right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in\u000athe interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions\u000aof appropriate laws."\u000a134. In the light of their arguments, it would appear that the Parties seem to agree on the effectiveness of\u000athe violations to the lives of the victims and the considerable material damages which resulted from the\u000aviolence of the post-electoral events. The Government has shown this agreement by setting up a Rescue\u000aCommittee for the Victims, in conformity with the Law of 26th June 1964 which authorizes the State to\u000aprovide << assistance within the limits of the amounts provided for this purpose or constant assistance in\u000aany other form >>. The said Committee had evaluated the amount of damages - interest at five billion, eight\u000ahundred and eight million, three hundred and ten thousand, and eight hundred and eighty francs CFA (5\u000a808 310 880). From all appearances, the victims had not been entirely unprejudiced.\u000a135. The Respondent State observed in its arguments that it was not at all a compensation on its part but a\u000ashow of solidarity, because it is not directly responsible for the prejudices suffered by the victims, and that it\u000awas an act by private individuals that the victims could bring to justice so as to have satisfaction with\u000arespect to their grievances.\u000a136. The Commission is of the view that the responsibility of the Government has been established. It\u000atherefore follows that the Government should pay compensation for the prejudices suffered. Despite the\u000afact that the Government is denying it, it understood that it could not remain insensitive to its obligation to\u000apay fair compensation to the victims, for this reason it set up a Committee to assess the damages suffered\u000aby the Complainants.\u000a\u000aDecision of the Commission\u000a137. Based on the foregoing reasons, the African Commission Decides that:\u000a1. The provisions of Article 1 of the African Charter impose on States Parties an obligation of Result;\u000a2. The State of Cameroon failed in its general obligation as set forth and sanctioned under Article 1 of\u000athe African Charter and consequently the State of Cameroon has an obligation of RESULT;\u000a3. Due to its obvious lack of diligence, the State of Cameroon is held responsible for the violation of\u000aArticles 2, 4, and 14 of the African Charter; and therefore, the State of Cameroon is responsible for\u000athe acts of violence which took place on its territory which gave rise to human rights violations,\u000awhether these acts had been committed by the State of Cameroon itself or by people other33 ; than\u000athe State;\u000a4. The State of Cameroon had moreover violated the provisions of Article 7 of the same Charter;\u000a138. Recommends to the State of Cameroon to:\u000a\u000a1. Take all the necessary measures for guaranteeing the effective protection of human rights at all\u000atimes, and everywhere both in times of peace and in times of war;\u000a2. Pursue its commitment to give fair and equitable compensation to the victims and without delay, to\u000apay fair and equitable compensation for the prejudices suffered by the victims or their beneficiaries;\u000a3.

The Court recalls that the [popup=first sentence of Article 2 § 1]Everyone's right to life shall be\u000aprotected by law.\u000aenjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take\u000aappropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (see the L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom\u000ajudgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1403, § 36\u000a× 36. The applicant complained in addition that the respondent State's failure to warn and advise her\u000aparents or monitor her health prior to her diagnosis with leukaemia in October 1970 had given rise to a\u000aviolation of Article 2 of the Convention. In this connection, the Court considers that the first sentence of\u000aArticle 2 § 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to\u000atake appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (cf. the Court's reasoning in\u000arespect of Article 8 in the Guerra and Others v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 227,\u000a§ 58, and see also the decision of the Commission on the admissibility of application no. 7154/75 of 12 July\u000a1978, Decisions and Reports 14, p. 31). It has not been suggested that the respondent State intentionally\u000asought to deprive the applicant of her life. The Court's task is, therefore, to determine whether, given the\u000acircumstances of the case, the State did all that could have been required of it to prevent the applicant's life\u000afrom being avoidably put at risk.\u000a). This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective\u000acriminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by\u000alaw-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such\u000aprovisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take\u000a17\u000a\u000apreventive operational measures to protect an individual or individuals whose life is at risk from the criminal\u000aacts of another individual (see the Osman judgment cited above, p. 3159, § 115\u000a× 115. The Court notes that the first sentence of Article 2 § 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the\u000aintentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those\u000awithin its jurisdiction (see the L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments\u000aand Decisions 1998-III, p. 1403, § 36). It is common ground that the State's obligation in this respect\u000aextends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law\u000aprovisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement\u000amachinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. It is thus\u000aaccepted by those appearing before the Court that Article 2 of the Convention may also imply in certain\u000awell-defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures\u000ato protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual. The scope of this\u000aobligation is a matter of dispute between the parties.\u000a).\u000a16 Cf Cameroon Tribune No. 5231 dated 7 October 1992, page 16\u000a17 Cf. <> in Cameroun Tribune No. 5246 du 26th October 1992.

It cannot overlook that the restoration of democracy as from April 1974 led Portugal to carry out\u000aan overhaul of its judicial system in troubled circumstances which were without equivalent in most of the\u000aother European countries and which were rendered more difficult by the process of decolonisation as well\u000aas by the economic crisis (see paragraph 21 above).

Nonetheless, the Court must on\u000athis issue concur with the views of the Commission and the applicant. In ratifying the Convention, Portugal\u000aguaranteed to "secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I"\u000a(Article 1) (art. 1). In particular, Portugal undertook the obligation of organising its legal system so as to\u000aensure compliance with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), including that of trial within a\u000a"reasonable time" (see the above-mentioned Zimmermann and Steiner judgment, Series A no. 66, p. 12,\u000apara. 29). The Court would once more draw attention to the extreme importance of this requirement for the\u000aproper administration of justice.\u000a); impartiality is unquestionably one of the foremost of those requirements.

The obligation laid down in that paragraph is indeed an obligation\u000aof result which clearly must be performed unconditionally; non-performance of it constitutes internationally\u000awrongful conduct. However, the Judgment leaves it to the United States to choose the means of\u000aimplementation, not excluding the introduction within a reasonable time of appropriate legislation, if deemed\u000anecessary under domestic constitutional law.

aV275/03 Article 19 / Eritrea\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. On 14th April 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a communication brought by\u000aArticle 19 against the State of Eritrea, a State Party to the African Charter.\u000a2. Article 19 states that it is concerned especially about the continued detention incommunicado without\u000atrial of at least 18 journalists in Eritrea since September 2001.\u000a3. The 18 journalists who are reportedly detained incommunicado are :-\u000a\u000a1. Zemenfes Haile, founder and manager of the private weekly Tsigenay;\u000a2. Ghebrehiwet Keleta, a news writer for Tsigenay;\u000a3. Selamyinghes Beyene, reporter for the weekly Meqaleh;\u000a4. Binyam Haile of Haddas Eritrea;\u000a5. Yosef Mohamed Ali, Chief Editor of Tsigenay;\u000a6. Seyoum Tsehaye, Freelance Editor and photographer and former Director of Eritrean State\u000aTelevision (ETV);\u000a7. Temesgen Gebreyesus, Reporter for Keste Debena;\u000a8. Mattewos Habteab, Editor of Meqaleh;\u000a9. Dawit Habtemicheal, Assistant Chief Editor, Meqaleh;\u000a10. Medhanie Haile, Assistant Chief Editor, Keste Debena;\u000a11. Fessahye Yohannes (or Joshua) Editor-in-Chief of Setit;\u000a12. Said Abdulkadir, Chief Editor of Admas;\u000a13. Amanuel Asrat, Chief Editor of Zemen;\u000a14. Dawit Isaac, contributor to Setit;\u000a15. Hamid Mohammed Said, ETV;\u000a16. Saleh Aljezeeri, Eritrean State Radio; and\u000a17. Simret Seyoum, a writer and general manager for Setit\u000a4. The Complainant alleges that on August 2001, a dozen senior officials and other members of the ruling\u000aelite, known as the G15 signed a public letter criticising President Isaias Afewerki's rule. This letter\u000aallegedly generated a political crisis which involved defections, resignations, the dismissal of top officials,\u000athe imprisonment of government critics and journalists and the cancellation of the general elections that\u000ahad been planned for December 2001.\u000a5. The Complainant further alleges that on 18th and 19th September 2001, 11 former Eritrean government\u000aofficials including former the Vice President Mahmoud Sherifo and the former Foreign Minister Petros\u000aSolomon were arrested in Asmara.\u000a6. Furthermore, on 18th September 2001, the Eritrean government banned the entire private press\u000acomprising of the following newspapers :- Meqaleh, Setit, Tsigenay, Zemen, Wintana, Admas, Keste\u000aDebena and Mana. Subsequently, many journalists were arrested and detained, including the 18 journalists\u000awho are now being held incommunicado. The reasons given by the government for these actions ranged\u000afrom threatening national security to failure to observe licensing requirements.\u000a7. The Complainant asserts that Hadas Eritrea, a government owned daily newspaper, is the only\u000apublication allowed in the country\u000a8. The Complainant states that on 4th October 2002, they sent appeal letters to the President of Eritrea and\u000ato the Chairman of the African Commission urging them to ensure the unconditional release or a fair trial of\u000athe detainees. On 12th November 2002, the Complainant sent a letter to the government requesting\u000ainformation on the detainees and permission to visit the country and the detainees. Article 19 alleges that\u000aall requests sent to the government have been ignored.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a9. Article 19 alleges a violation of the following Articles of the African Charter:- Articles 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13,\u000a18 and 26 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a10. By letter dated 21st April 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the\u000acommunication and informed the Complainant that the matter had been scheduled for consideration at the\u000a33rd Ordinary Session of the African Commission.\u000a11. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\u000aconsidered the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\u000a12. On 10th June 2003, the Secretariat wrote informing the parties to the communication that the African\u000aCommission had been seized with the matter and requested them to forward their submissions on\u000aadmissibility within 3 months.\u000a13. On 27th August 2003, the Secretariat received a Note Verbale from the Respondent State requesting\u000athe African Commission to advise Article 19 to exhaust all domestic remedies.\u000a14. On 10th September 2003, Article 19 forwarded by fax its submissions on admissibility.\u000a15. On 15th September 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the Note\u000aVerbale from the Respondent State and the submissions from the Complainant. The Secretariat of the\u000aAfrican Commission additionally advised the Respondent State to forward its arguments supporting its\u000aassertion that the Complainant had not exhausted domestic remedies. Article 19 was also reminded to\u000aforward a copy of the Decree banning the entire private press.\u000a16. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission examined the communication and decided to defer further consideration on admissibility of the\u000amatter to its 35th Ordinary Session.\u000a17. On 4th December 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to inform the parties of the\u000aAfrican Commission's decision. The Respondent State was furnished with another copy of the\u000aComplainant's written submissions on admissibility and further reminded to forward its written submissions\u000aon admissibility within 2 months.\u000a18. On 23rd February 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received submissions on\u000aadmissibility from the Respondent State. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the said submissions\u000aand transmitted a copy of the same to the Complainants on 3rd March 2004.\u000a19. On 17th March 2004, the Secretariat received submissions from the Complainant in response to the\u000asubmissions from the State of Eritrea. The Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of\u000athe said submissions and transmitted a copy of the same to the Respondent State on 18th March 2004.\u000a20. At its 35th Ordinary Session held from 21st May to 4th June 2004, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission examined the communication and decided to defer further consideration on admissibility of the\u000amatter to its 36th Ordinary Session pending receipt of information from the Complainant on concrete steps\u000ataken to access domestic remedies in Eritrea. The parties to the communication were informed accordingly.\u000a21. By Note Verbale and letter dated 15th June 2004 the Respondent State and the Complainant were\u000arespectively informed of the Commission's decision.\u000a22. By letter dated 15th September 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission reminded the\u000aComplainant to send the information requested by the African Commission during the 35th Ordinary\u000aSession.\u000a23. At its 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 23rd November to 7th December 2004, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and declared it admissible.\u000a24. By Note Verbale of 13th December 2004 and by letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission notified the parties of the African Commission's decision and requested them to submit their\u000aarguments on the merits within three months of the notification.\u000a25. By Note Verbale dated 27th January 2005, the State of Eritrea wrote to the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission requesting the African Commission to dismiss the communication on the grounds that: one of\u000athe subjects of the communication had already been dealt in another communication ( 250/2002) and\u000atherefore would constitute a case of double jeopardy, and that the Complainant had appeared before the\u000aAfrican Commission only once despite repeated requests to 'face and question the accuser - a legal right\u000awhich was denied them' (...) by the African Commission.\u000a2\u000a\u000a26. By Note Verbale dated 23rd February 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged\u000areceipt of the Respondent State's Note Verbale and informed the Respondent State that its request would\u000abe put before the African Commission for consideration during the 37th Ordinary Session.\u000a27. By letter dated 24th February 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the\u000aComplainant that the Respondent State had requested the African Commission to reconsider its decision\u000aon the communication and declare the latter inadmissible.\u000a28. By letter dated 30th March 2005, the Complainant acknowledged receipt of the Secretariat's letter of\u000a24th February 2005. The Complainant indicated that they were of the belief that the African Commission\u000ahad thoroughly examined the communication before arriving at the decision on admissibility and therefore\u000aurged the African Commission to consider the communication on its merits.\u000a29. By letter dated 5th April 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the\u000aComplainant's letter of 30th March 2005 and requested it to submit its arguments on the merits or confirm\u000awhether the arguments contained in its complaint were sufficient.\u000a30. By letter dated 13th April 2005, the Complainant acknowledged receipt of the Secretariat's letter of 5th\u000aApril 2005 and indicated that in their earlier submissions they had addressed themselves on the merits [of]\u000athe communication but further indicated that they were available to make oral submissions on the same.\u000a31. By letter dated 13th April 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's letter and\u000ainformed them that the communication had been scheduled for consideration at the 37th Ordinary Session\u000aof the African Commission.\u000a32. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission deferred further\u000aconsideration of the communication due to the absence of the rapporteur of the communication.\u000a33. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 10th June 2005, the Respondent State and the Complainant were\u000arespectively notified of the African Commission's decision.\u000a34. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the Respondent State's request that the communication be dismissed but\u000adecided to confirm its decision on admissibility.\u000a35. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 15th December 2005, the Respondent State and the Complainant\u000awere respectively notified of the African Commission's decision and requested the parties to submit their\u000aarguments on the merits of the communication.\u000a36. On 6th March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the parties reminding them to\u000asubmit their arguments on the merits before the end of March 2006.\u000a37. By electronic mail dated 3rd May 2006, the Complainant re-submitted its arguments on the merits of the\u000acommunication, which was immediately communicated to the Respondent State for its comments.\u000a38. By Note Verbale dated 19th May 2006, the Respondent State submitted its arguments on the merits of\u000athe communication.\u000a39. At its 39th Ordinary Session held from 11th to 25th May 2006, the African Commission decided to defer\u000aconsideration of the merits to the 40th Ordinary Session, in order to allow the Secretariat to consider the\u000aparties' arguments and draft an opinion on the merits.\u000a40. By Note Verbale and letter dated 31st May 2006, the Respondent State and the Complainant were\u000arespectively notified of the African Commission's decision.\u000a41. By letter dated 17th October 2006 and Note Verbale dated 18th October 2006, the Complainant and the\u000aRespondent State respectively were reminded that the African Commission would consider the merits of\u000athe communication at its 40th Ordinary Session.\u000a42. By Note Verbale and letter dated 10th February 2007, the Respondent State and the Complainant were\u000arespectively notified that the African Commission had deferred the communication, as it was unable to\u000aconsider the said communication at its 40th Ordinary Session because of lack of time. Both the\u000aComplainant and the Respondent State were informed that the communication would be considered at the\u000a41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a43. The current communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55, of the African Charter which allows the\u000aAfrican Commission to receive and consider communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of\u000athe African Charter provides that the admissibility of a communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is\u000a3\u000a\u000asubject to seven conditions.1 The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in Article\u000a56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is absent, the communication will be declared\u000ainadmissible.2\u000a44. The parties to the present communication seem to agree that six of the conditions set out in Article 56\u000ahave been met. They are however in dispute over the application of one of the conditions - Article 56.5,\u000awhich provides that communications relating to human and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55, received\u000aby the African Commission shall be considered if they "are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies, if\u000aany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a45. The exhaustion of local remedies rule is a principle under international law of permitting States to solve\u000atheir internal problems in accordance with their own constitutional procedures before accepted international\u000amechanisms can be invoked. The particular State is thus enabled to have an opportunity to redress the\u000awrong that has occurred there within its own legal order. It is a well established rule of customary\u000ainternational law that before international proceedings are instituted, the various remedies provided by the\u000aState should have been exhausted.\u000a46. The African Commission has held in previous communications that for local remedies to be exhausted,\u000athey must be available, effective and sufficient. In communication Nos 147/95 and 149/96, the African\u000aCommission held that a remedy is considered available if the Complainant can pursue it without\u000aimpediment, it is deemed effective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found sufficient if it is capable\u000aof redressing the complaint.3\u000a47. In terms of Article 56(5), therefore, the law on exhaustion of domestic remedies presupposes:\u000a1. the existence of domestic procedures for dealing with the claim;\u000a2. the justiciability or otherwise, domestically, of the subject-matter of the complaint;\u000a3. the existence under the municipal legal order of provisions for redress of the type of wrong being\u000acomplained of; and\u000a4. available effective local remedies, that is, remedies sufficient or capable of redressing the wrong\u000acomplained of.\u000a48. The second part of Article 56(5) which is the subject of contention between the parties provides that a\u000acommunication shall be considered if they are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies "...if any, unless it\u000ais obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged". It follows therefore that the local remedies rule is not\u000arigid. It does not apply if:\u000a1. local remedies are inexistent;\u000a2. local remedies are unduly and unreasonably prolonged;\u000a3. recourse to local remedies is made impossible;\u000a4. from the face of the complaint there is no justice or there are no local remedies to exhaust, for\u000aexample, where the judiciary is under the control of the executive organ responsible for the illegal\u000aact; and\u000a5. ]>\u000a\u000aIssues before the African Commission\u000a\u000a49. The parties to the present case are in dispute over the question of the exhaustion of domestic remedies\u000ain Eritrea and it is therefore for the African Commission to make a determination on the matter.\u000a50. On the one hand, the State argues that the stipulated requirement in Article 56(5) has not been fulfilled\u000aby the Complainant and that none of the above-mentioned exceptions should therefore apply. On the other\u000ahand, the Complainant alleges that the exception rule in Article 56(5) should apply.\u000a51. Whenever a State alleges the failure by the Complainant to exhaust domestic remedies, it has the\u000aburden of showing that the remedies that have not been exhausted are available, effective and sufficient to\u000acure the violation alleged, i.e. that the function of those remedies within the domestic legal system is\u000asuitable to address an infringement of a legal right and are effective.4 When a State does this, the burden of\u000aresponsibility then shifts to the Complainant who must demonstrate that the remedies in question were\u000aexhausted or that the exception provided for in Article 56(5) of the African Charter is applicable.\u000a4\u000a\u000aSubmissions by the Complainant\u000a\u000a52. The Complainant in the present communication argues that domestic remedies are not available and\u000anotes that the fact that the victims have been held for over three years (since September 2001)\u000aincommunicado "is a manifestation of the fact that the administration of justice in Eritrea is extremely\u000aabnormal".\u000a53. The Complainant further points to the fact that Section 17 of the Eritrean Constitution provides\u000asafeguards against the arbitrary arrest and detention of persons, and the Government of Eritrea has failed\u000ato abide by these safeguards. 5 The Complainant claims that the "deliberate failure of the government to\u000aabide by its own Constitutional obligation shows that it is hopeless and impractical or unreasonable for the\u000adetainees to seize the domestic courts by way of habeas corpus".\u000a54. The Complainant further argues that the Executive Branch of Government in Eritrea interferes in the\u000aaffairs of the Judiciary thus rendering the latter's independence and effectiveness suspect. They cite the\u000aremoval of the Chief Justice by the President of the Republic when the former allegedly requested the\u000aExecutive not to interfere in the Judiciary. The Complainant noted that "if the Chief Justice could be\u000aremoved from office for merely asking the Executive Branch of Government not to interfere with the\u000aindependence of the Judiciary, what will happen to any judge who dares to order the release of the\u000adetainees marked out as 'traitors' and 'State enemies' by the highest authority, the President"?\u000a55. The Complainant notes further that the human rights violations complained of are serious and massive\u000aand in terms of the jurisprudence of the African Commission, such violations do not necessitate the\u000aexhaustion of local remedies.\u000a56. The Complainant concludes by stating that in fact, they had sent a writ of habeas corpus to the Minister\u000aof Justice requesting that the victims be brought to court but received no response from the Minister, and\u000athat they had requested to visit the victims but were not granted permission by the Responding State.\u000aSubmissions by the State\u000a\u000a57. The Respondent State in its submission maintains that the Eritrean Judiciary is independent and that\u000athe Complainant should have exhausted local remedies either directly or through local legal\u000arepresentatives. The Respondent State submits that it informed the Complainant that they should take the\u000ainitiative to approach the courts directly in order to seek justice for the detainees but no such efforts were\u000amade by the Complainant.\u000a58. The Respondent State further submits that the claims by the Complainant that there is an "information\u000ablackout" and that the Eritrean Judiciary lacks independence are unfounded as they are not substantiated\u000aby concrete examples indicating that there has been no interference in the actual work of the judges and in\u000athe dispensation of justice in the country. With respect to the dismissal of the Chief Justice, the Respondent\u000aState argues that in Eritrea the President appoints the Chief Justice and therefore has the power to dismiss\u000ahim.6\u000a59. Article 52 of the Eritrean Constitution provides for the removal and suspension of judges. Sub-Article 1\u000aprovides that a judge may be removed from office before the expiry of his tenure of office by the President\u000aonly, acting on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, pursuant to the provisions of\u000asub-Article 2 of this Article for physical or mental incapacity, violation of the law or [J]udicial [C]ode of\u000a[E]thics. Sub-Article 2 provides that the Judicial Service Commission shall investigate whether or not a\u000ajudge should be removed from office on grounds of those enumerated in sub-Article 1 of this Article. In\u000acase the Judicial Service Commission decides that a judge should be removed from office, it shall present\u000aits recommendation to the President. And sub-Article 3 provides that the President may, on the\u000arecommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, suspend from office a judge who is under\u000ainvestigation. The State did not indicate whether these procedural safeguards had been followed but simply\u000aintimated that the Chief Justice is appointed by the President and can be dismissed by the President.\u000a60. In his oral submission during the 35th Ordinary Session, the representative of the Respondent State\u000areiterated that the allegations made by the Complainant were false and unfounded as they had been made\u000awithout any serious attempts by the Complainants to ascertain the facts before bringing the matter before\u000athe African Commission. Furthermore, the Complainants had not submitted themselves to the courts in\u000aEritrea and as such it is the responsibility of the Complainant to find ways and means of utilising the\u000adomestic courts prior to bringing the matter before the African Commission. He reminded the African\u000aCommission that all conditions of Article 56 must be met in order for a matter to be admitted and if any one\u000a5\u000a\u000aof the conditions is not met, the communication must be declared inadmissible.\u000a61. The representative of the Respondent State informed the African Commission that the incarcerated\u000ajournalists had been arrested by the police and were being held by executive authorities. However,\u000afollowing investigation, an administrative decision was reached to release two of the journalists and that the\u000adecision with respect to the remaining incarcerated journalists would be forthcoming.\u000a62. He conceded that the detainees on whose behalf this communication is brought have not been brought\u000abefore a court of law because of the nature of the criminal justice system in Eritrea. He stated that the\u000acriminal justice system in Eritrea does not have the institutional capacity to handle cases expeditiously and\u000aas such there is huge backlog of cases in all the courts in the country.\u000a63. The Respondent State further stated that contrary to the claims by the Complainant that they were not\u000aable to visit Eritrea in order to assist the victims, everyone who was involved in the matter relating to the\u000adetained journalists and the political detainees was invited to Eritrea including the Complainant who chose\u000anot to visit the country.\u000aDecision of the African Commission on admissibility\u000a\u000a64. To determine the question of admissibility of this communication, the African Commission will have to\u000aanswer, among others, the following questions -:\u000a\u2022 who is required under the African Charter to exhaust local remedies - the author of the\u000acommunication or the victim of the alleged human rights violations?;\u000a\u2022 does the removal of a Chief Justice render domestic remedies unavailable and insufficient?;\u000a\u2022 does the fact that a State has failed to abide by its own laws render domestic remedies [\u000a65. As regards who is required to exhaust local remedies, the African Charter is clear. It indicates in Article\u000a56(1) that the authors of the communication must indicate their identity even if they claim anonymity. This\u000apresupposes that domestic remedies are to be exhausted but by the authors. In the consideration of\u000acommunications, the African Commission has adopted an actio popularis approach where the author of a\u000acommunication need not know or have any relationship with the victim. This is to enable poor victims of\u000ahuman rights violations on the continent to receive assistance from NGOs and individuals far removed from\u000atheir locality. All the author needs to do is to comply with the requirements of Article 56. The African\u000aCommission has thus allowed many communications from authors acting on behalf of victims of human\u000arights violations. Thus, having decided to act on behalf of the victims, it is incumbent on the author of a\u000acommunication to take concrete steps to comply with the provisions of Article 56 or to show cause why it is\u000aimpracticable to do so.\u000a66. As regards the removal of the Chief Justice, the Complainant fails to demonstrate sufficiently how this\u000aremoval prevented them from approaching the domestic remedies or how it rendered such domestic\u000aremedies unavailable, ineffective, "hopeless, impractical and unreasonable?" The independence of the\u000ajudiciary is a crucial element of the rule of law. Article 1 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of\u000athe Judiciary7 states that "the independence of the Judiciary shall be guaranteed by the State and\u000aenshrined in the Constitution or the law of the country. It is the duty of all governmental and other\u000ainstitutions to respect and observe the independence of judiciary." Article 11 of the same Principles states\u000athat "the term of office of judges, their independence, security ... shall be adequately secured by law."\u000aArticle 18 provides that "Judges shall be subject to suspension or removal only for reasons of incapacity or\u000abehaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties." Article 30 of the International Bar Association\u000a(IBA)'s Minimum Standards of Judicial Independence8 also guarantees that "A Judge shall not be subject\u000ato removal unless, by reason of a criminal act or through gross or repeated neglect or physical or mental\u000aincapacity, he has shown himself manifestly unfit to hold the position of judge" and Article 1(b) states that\u000a"Personal independence means that the terms and conditions of judicial service are adequately secured so\u000aas to ensure that individual judges are not subject to executive control." Article 52 (1)\u000a× (1) A judge may be removed from office before the expiry of his tenure of office by the President only,\u000aacting on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, pursuant to the provisions of Sub-Article\u000a2 of this Article for physical or mental incapacity, violation of the law or judicial code of ethics.\u000aof the Eritrean Constitution provides an almost similar provision.\u000a67. The issue however is, does the removal of a Chief Justice in a manner inconsistent with international\u000astandards render the judiciary in a State unavailable and ineffective? The Complainant was simply casting\u000a6\u000a\u000adoubts about the effectiveness of the domestic remedies. The African Commission is of the view that it is\u000aincumbent on the Complainant to take all necessary steps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of\u000alocal remedies. It is not enough for the Complainant to cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic\u000aremedies of the State due to isolated incidences. In this regard, the African Commission would like to refer\u000ato the decision of the Human Rights Committee in A v Australia 9 in which the Committee held that "mere\u000adoubts about the effectiveness of local remedies or prospect of financial costs involved did not absolve the\u000aauthor from pursuing such remedies." 10 The African Commission can therefore not declare the\u000acommunication admissible based on this argument.\u000a68. As regards the Complainant's argument that the Government has failed to abide by its own\u000aconstitutional obligations as provided for in Article 17\u000a× (1) No person may be arrested or detained save pursuant to due process of law. (2) No person shall be\u000atried or convicted for any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was\u000acommitted. (3) Every person arrested or detained shall be informed of the grounds for his arrest or\u000adetention and the rights he has in connection with his arrest or detention in a language he understands. (4)\u000aEvery person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be brought before the court within forty-eight\u000a(48) hours of his arrest, and if this is not reasonably possible, as soon as possible thereafter, and no such\u000aperson shall be detained in custody beyond such period without the authority of the court. (5) Every person\u000ashall have the right to petition the court for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. Where the arresting officer fails to\u000abring him before the court of law and provide the reason for their arrest, the court shall accept the petition\u000aand order the release of the prisoner. (6) Every person charged with an offence shall be entitled to a fair\u000aand public hearing by a court of law; provided, however, that such a court may exclude the press and/or the\u000apublic from all or any part of the trial for reasons of morals, the public order or national security, as is\u000anecessary in a just and democratic society. (7) A person charged with an offence shall be presumed to be\u000ainnocent, and shall not be punished, unless he is found guilty by a court. (8) Where an accused is\u000aconvicted, he shall have the right to appeal. No person shall be liable to be tried again for any criminal\u000aoffence on which judgment has been rendered.\u000aof the Constitution. The African Commission is of the view that the whole essence why human rights\u000aviolations occur is because governments fail to abide by their domestic as well as international obligations.\u000aWhen this happens, individuals whose rights have been, are being or are likely to be violated seize the\u000alocal courts to invoke their rights in order to compel governments to abide by these obligations. The\u000aEritrean Constitution provides ample safeguards against persons who are arrested and detained without\u000acharge or trial. Apart from sub-Articles 1, 3, and 4 of Article 17, sub-Article 5 of the same article is very\u000ainstructive. It provides that "every person shall have the right to petition the court for a Writ of Habeas\u000aCorpus. Where the arresting officer fails to bring him before the court of law and provide the reason for their\u000aarrest, the court shall accept the petition and order the release of the prisoner".\u000a69. In the instant case therefore, the Complainant could, at the very least, have seized the local courts by\u000away of a writ of habeas corpus to draw the court's attention to the constitutional provision they claim the\u000agovernment has breached. Lawyers often seek the release of detainees by filing a petition for a writ of\u000ahabeas corpus. A writ of habeas corpus is a judicial mandate to an arresting officer ordering that an inmate\u000abe brought to the court so it can be determined whether or not that person is imprisoned lawfully and\u000awhether or not he should be released from custody. A habeas corpus petition is a petition filed with a court\u000aby a person who objects to his own or another's detention or imprisonment. The writ of habeas corpus has\u000abeen described as "the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and\u000alawless state action."11 It serves as an important check on the manner in which the courts pay respect to\u000aconstitutional rights.\u000a70. The Complainant in their submissions does acknowledge that they did send a writ of habeas corpus to\u000athe Minister of Justice. The African Commission is of the view that even though it expected the Minister to\u000aadvise the Complainant on the proper procedure to follow, the failure to do so does not constitute a breach\u000aof the law. The Ministry of Justice is the same arm of Government that has failed to "abide by its own\u000aconstitutional obligations..." and it is only the courts that can order it to do so. By sending the writ to the\u000aMinister of Justice, the Complainant cannot claim they were attempting the exhaustion of domestic\u000aremedies as Article 56(5) requires the exhaustion of legal remedies and not administrative remedies.\u000a71. As regards the argument that the communication reveals serious and massive violations of human\u000arights, the African Commission would like to reiterate its earlier decisions in communication Nos. 16/8812 ,\u000a25/89, 47/90, 56/91, 100/9313 and 27/89, 46/91, 49/91, 99/9314 that\u000a\u000a7\u000a\u000ait [...] cannot hold the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies to apply literally in cases where it is\u000aimpractical or undesirable for the Complainant to seize the domestic courts in respect of each individual\u000acomplaint. This is the case where there are a large number of victims. Due to the seriousness of the human\u000arights situation and the large number of people involved, such remedies as might theoretically exist in the\u000adomestic courts are as a practical matter unavailable ..."\u000a72. However, as regards the continuous incommunicado detention of the detainees, the African\u000aCommission would like to note the State Party's acknowledgement that the victims are still being held in\u000adetention because of the poor state of the criminal justice system in the country. With respect to this\u000aargument by the State Party, the African Commission notes that whenever there is a crime that can be\u000ainvestigated and prosecuted by the State on its own initiative, the State has the obligation to move the\u000acriminal process forward to its ultimate conclusion. In such cases, one cannot demand that the\u000aComplainants, or the victims or their family members assume the task of exhausting domestic remedies\u000awhen it is up to the State to investigate the facts and bring the accused persons to court in accordance with\u000aboth domestic and international fair trial standards.\u000a73. The African Commission would also like to note that the State party has made a general refutation of\u000athe claims alleged and has insisted that domestic remedies do exist and that the Complainant did not\u000aattempt to exhaust them. The African Commission notes however, that the State party has merely listed in\u000aabstracto the existence of remedies without relating them to the circumstances of the case, and without\u000ashowing how they might provide effective redress in the circumstances of the case. 15\u000a74. In the instant communication therefore, the fact that the Complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated\u000athat they have exhausted domestic remedies does not mean such remedies are available, effective and\u000asufficient. The African Commission can infer from the circumstances surrounding the case and determine\u000awhether such remedies are in fact available, and if they are, whether they are effective and sufficient.\u000a75. The invocation of the exception to the rule requiring that remedies under domestic law should be\u000aexhausted provided for in Article 56(5) must invariably be linked to the determination of possible violations\u000aof certain rights enshrined in the African Charter, such as the right to a fair trial enshrined under Article 7 of\u000athe African Charter.16 The exception to the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies would therefore\u000aapply where the domestic situation of the State does not afford due process of law for the protection of the\u000aright or rights that have allegedly been violated. In the present communication, this seems to be the case.\u000a76. Holding the victims incommunicado for over three years demonstrates a prima facie violation of due\u000aprocess of the law and in particular, Article 7 of the African Charter. By not taking any action to remedy the\u000asituation more than twelve months after the African Commission had been seized of the communication\u000agoes to demonstrate that the State has equally failed to demonstrate that domestic remedies are available\u000aand effective.\u000a77. Another rationale for the exhaustion requirement is that a government should have notice of a human\u000arights violation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation, before being called to account by\u000aan international tribunal. The African Commission is of the view that the State has had ample time and\u000anotice of the alleged violation to at least charge the detainees and grant them access to legal\u000arepresentation. However, if it is shown that the State has had ample notice and time within which to remedy\u000athe situation, even if not within the context of the domestic remedies of the State, as is the case with the\u000apresent communication, the State may still be said to have been properly inform[ed] and is expected to\u000ahave taken appropriate steps to remedy the violation alleged. The fact that the State of Eritrea has not\u000ataken any action means that domestic remedies are either not available or if they are, not effective or\u000asufficient to redress the violations alleged.\u000a78. The African Commission would like in this regard to refer to its decision in Communication 18/8817\u000awhich concerned the detention and torture of the Complainant for more than seven years without charge or\u000atrial, the denial of food for long periods, the blocking of his bank account, and the use of his money without\u000ahis permission. The African Commission held that in such circumstances it is clear that the State has had\u000aample notice of the violations and should have taken steps to remedy them. The African Commission would\u000aalso like to restate the position taken in communication 250/2002.18 . In that communication, the African\u000aCommission was of the view that the situation as presented by the Respondent State does not afford due\u000aprocess of law for protection of the rights that have been alleged to be violated; the detainees have been\u000adenied access to the remedies under domestic law and have thus been prevented from exhausting them.\u000aFurthermore, there has been unwarranted delay in bringing these detainees to justice.\u000a79. The situation as presented by the Respondent State does not afford due process of law for protection of\u000athe rights that have been alleged to be violated; the detainees have been denied access to the remedies\u000a8\u000a\u000aunder domestic law and have thus been prevented from exhausting them. Furthermore, there has been\u000aunwarranted delay in bringing these detainees to justice.\u000a80. In the Albert Mukong case, the Human Rights Committee held that "a State party to the Covenant,\u000aregardless of its level of development, must meet certain minimum standards regarding conditions of\u000adetention".19 This reasoning of the Human Rights Committee can also include the fact that a State party to\u000athe African Charter "regardless of its level of development must meet certain minimum standards regarding\u000afair trial or due process conditions". The Committee concluded that "the legitimate objective of safeguarding\u000aand indeed strengthening national unity under difficult political circumstances cannot be achieved by\u000aattempting to muzzle ... democratic tenets and human rights".20\u000a81. The continuous incommunicado detention of the victims without charge bars them from any legal\u000arepresentation and makes it difficult for the Complainant or any person interested in assisting them from\u000aattempting whatever domestic remedies might be available. To leave the detainees to languish in detention\u000aforever because of the inadequacy of the State's criminal justice system or because there is no one to\u000aaccess the domestic courts on their behalf would be grossly unjust, if not unfair.\u000a82. In the absence of any concrete steps on the part of the State to bring the victims to court, or to allow\u000athem access to their legal representatives three years after their arrest and detention, and more than one\u000ayear after being seized of the matter, the African Commission is persuaded to conclude that domestic\u000aremedies, even if available, are not effective and/or sufficient.\u000aFor this reason, the African Commission declares the communication admissible.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission on request by the Respondent State to dismiss the communication\u000a\u000a83. The present communication was declared admissible at the 36th Ordinary Session of the African\u000aCommission's held in Dakar, Senegal from 23rd November to 7th December 2004. In response to the\u000aAfrican Commission's request for written submissions on the merits, the Respondent State in a Note\u000aVerbale dated 27th January 2005 wrote requesting the African Commission to dismiss the communication.\u000aThe Respondent State's grounds for such dismissal were that:\u2022 One of the 18 journalists in this matter had been the subject of another communication communication 250/2002 which the African Commission had already disposed of. The Respondent\u000aState therefore argued that dealing with that person in this matter constitutes double jeopardy;\u000a\u2022 The Complainant had appeared before the African Commission only once despite repeated\u000arequests to 'face and question the accuser - a legal right which was denied them'...by the African\u000aCommission.\u000a84. In dealing with the Respondent State's request that the communication be dismissed the African\u000aCommission noted that Article 118(2) stipulate that:\u000aIf the Commission has declared a communication inadmissible under the Charter, it may reconsider this\u000adecision at a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration...\u000a85. No provision is made therein for the African Commission to dismiss a matter after having declared it\u000aadmissible. In any case, the victims who are the subject of this communication are still being held in\u000aincommunicado detention by the Respondent State and are accordingly unable to access domestic\u000aremedies whether on their own or through legal representatives. It is for these reasons that the African\u000aCommission has decided not to dismiss the communication and will therefore consider it on the merits.\u000aDecision on the Merits\u000a86. The African Commission will not deal with any issue already decided upon in communication 250/2002\u000a.\u000a87. Eritrea submits that the acts alleged were undertaken "against a backdrop of war when the very\u000aexistence of the nation was threatened" and that, as a result, the Government was "duty bound to take\u000anecessary precautionary measures (and even suspend certain rights)." However, unlike other human rights\u000a9\u000a\u000ainstruments, 21 and as emphasised in communication 74/9222 , the African Charter does not allow States\u000aParties to derogate from it in times of war or other emergency. The existence of war, international or civil, or\u000aother emergency situation within the territory of a State party cannot therefore be used to justify violation of\u000aany of the rights set out in the Charter, and Eritrea's actions must be judged according to the Charter\u000anorms, regardless of any turmoil within the State at the time.\u000a88. The Complainant alleges, and Eritrea does not deny, that 11 political dissidents and 18 journalists have\u000abeen detained, incommunicado and without trial, since September 2001. It is also alleged by the\u000aComplainant, and admitted by the Respondent State, that private newspapers were banned from\u000aSeptember 2001. Although Eritrea maintains that this ban was temporary, it is not clear from the\u000ainformation available whether or when the ban was lifted.\u000a89. The basic facts are not therefore in dispute. However, the versions of the parties vary as regards the\u000amotivation for the detention of the individuals concerned and the ban on the press. According to the\u000aComplainant the arrests were due to the detainees having expressed their opinions and spoken out against\u000athe Government; the Respondent State on the other hand claims that the 11 political opponents were\u000aarrested for breaching Articles 259 (attacks on the independence of the State), 260 (impairment of the\u000adefence powers of the State) and 261 (high treason) of the Transitional Penal Code of Eritrea. As regards\u000athe ban on the press and the detention of the 18 journalists, the Respondent State claims that these\u000aoccurred because, "the stated newspapers and the leading editors were recruited into the illegal network\u000aorganised for the purpose of ousting the Government through illegal and unconstitutional means."\u000a90. Eritrea's argument, then, is that its actions were justified by the circumstances prevailing within its\u000aterritory during the relevant period, and permissible under its domestic law. Reference is made to Articles 6\u000aand 9 of the African Charter, the relevant sections of which provide respectively that:\u000aNo-one may be deprived of his freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by law; and\u000aEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law. [Emphasis\u000aadded]\u000a91. Such provisions of the Charter are sometimes referred to as "claw-back clauses," because if "law" is\u000ainterpreted to mean any domestic law regardless of its effect, States Parties to the Charter would be able to\u000anegate the rights conferred upon individuals by the Charter.\u000a92. However, the Commission's jurisprudence has interpreted the so-called claw-back clauses as\u000aconstituting a reference to international law, meaning that only restrictions on rights which are consistent\u000awith the Charter and with States Parties' international obligations should be enacted by the relevant\u000anational authorities.23 The lawfulness of Eritrea's actions must therefore be considered against the Charter\u000aand other norms of international law, rather than by reference to its own domestic laws alone. 24\u000a93. The arrest and detention of the journalists and political opponents is claimed by the Complainant to\u000abreach Articles 6 and 7 of the Charter. Article 6 provides that "no-one shall be arbitrarily arrested or\u000adetained." The concept of arbitrary detention is one which both the [African] Commission and other\u000ainternational human rights bodies have previously expounded upon. In the Albert Mukong Case,25 the\u000aUnited Nations Human Rights Committee stated that, Arbitrariness is not to be equated with 'against the\u000alaw' but must be interpreted more broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice, lack of\u000apredictability and due process of law...remand in custody pursuant to lawful arrest must not only be lawful\u000abut reasonable in all the circumstances...remand in custody must also be necessary in all the\u000acircumstances.\u000aFrom this case it can be inferred that an arrest or detention may be legal according to the letter of domestic\u000alaw, but arbitrary and therefore illegal by reason of its inappropriate, unjust or unpredictable nature.\u000a94. The Eritrean detainees have not been charged, or brought to trial. This in itself constitutes arbitrariness,\u000aas the [African] Commission has previously stated. In communication 102/93,26 the [African] Commission\u000aheld that, "where individuals have been detained without charges being brought...this constitutes an\u000aarbitrary deprivation of their liberty and thus violates Article 6 ."\u000a95. Furthermore, the length of time for which the detainees have been kept in custody must be considered.\u000aBoth parties agreed that the arrests occurred in September 2001. The journalists and political opponents\u000ahave therefore been detained, without charge or trial, for a period of over 5 years.\u000a96. Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter provides that all individuals shall have, "the right to be tried within a\u000areasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal." The Commission has exp[ou]nded upon this provision in\u000aits Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial, which states that, "Persons arrested or detained\u000ashall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and\u000a10\u000a\u000ashall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or be released."27\u000a97. The question of what is reasonable cannot be expressed in terms of a blanket time limit which will apply\u000ain all cases, but rather must depend on the circumstances. This approach has also been espoused by the\u000aEuropean Court of Human Rights, which has held that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings is\u000ato be assessed in accordance with all the circumstances of a case. The European Court will look in\u000aparticular at the complexity of the case, and the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities.28\u000a98. Eritrea contends that the delay in bringing these particular detainees to trial is due to the complexity and\u000agravity of the offences committed, and to the "precarious war situation" existing within the state. However,\u000aas already stated, it must be borne in mind that States Parties cannot derogate from the Charter in times of\u000awar or any other emergency situation. Even if it is assumed that the restriction placed by the Charter on the\u000aability to derogate goes against international principles, there are certain rights such as the right to life, the\u000aright to a fair trial, and the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, that\u000acannot be derogated from for any reason, in whatever circumstances.\u000a99. The existence of war in Eritrea cannot therefore be used to justify excessive delay in bringing the\u000adetainees to trial. Furthermore, a backlog of cases awaiting trial cannot excuse unreasonable delays, as\u000athe European Court of Human Rights has held.29 Further, in the case of Albert Mukong, referred to above,\u000athe Human Rights Committee stated that States Parties to the ICCPR must observe certain minimum\u000astandards as regards the condition of detention, regardless of their state of development. The Commission\u000aconsiders that the same principle applies to the length of detention before trial, and that states parties to the\u000aCharter cannot rely on the political situation existing within their territory or a large number of cases\u000apending before the courts to justify excessive delay.\u000a100. Moreover, the detainees are being held incommunicado, and have never been brought before a judge\u000ato face charges. In these circumstances, the Commission finds that Eritrea has breached the requirement\u000aof trial within a reasonable time set out in Article 7(1)(d). This is consonant with its previous decisions, such\u000aas communication 102/9330 , in which 3 years detention was found to be unacceptable, and\u000acommunication 103/9331 , in which the Commission stated that 7 years detention without trial, "clearly\u000aviolates the 'reasonable time' standard stipulated in the Charter."\u000a101. The fact that the detainees are being held incommunicado also merits further consideration in terms of\u000ainternational human rights law. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has directed32 that States\u000ashould make provisions against incommunicado detention, which can amount to a violation of Article 7\u000a× No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In\u000aparticular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.\u000a(torture and cruel treatment and punishment) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to\u000awhich Eritrea has acceded. Furthermore, the [African] Commission itself has stated that, "holding an\u000aindividual without permitting him or her to have contact with his or her family, and refusing to inform the\u000afamily if and where the individual is being held, is inhuman treatment of both the detainee and the family\u000aconcerned."33\u000a102. Eritrea has not denied the Complainant's contention that the detainees are being held\u000aincommunicado, with no access to legal representation or contact with their families, and as the [African]\u000aCommission has enunciated in many of its previous decisions, where allegations are not disputed by the\u000aState involved, the Commission may take the facts as provided by the Complainant as a given34 Nor does\u000athe political situation described by Eritrea excuse its actions, as Article 5, permits no restrictions or\u000alimitations on the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment.\u000aThe Commission thus finds that Eritrea has violated Article 5, by holding the journalists and political\u000adissidents incommunicado without allowing them access to their families.\u000a103. In keeping with its earlier decisions on similar cases35 , the Commission also finds that such treatment\u000aamounts to a breach of Article 18, as it constitutes violation of the rights of both the detainees and their\u000afamilies to protection of family life. Finally, the Commission holds that there has been a violation of Article\u000a7(1)(c), since the detainees have been allowed no access to legal representation, contrary to the right to be\u000adefended by counsel which is protected by that provision of the Charter.\u000a104. The [African] Commission turns its attention now to the question of whether there has been a violation\u000aof the detainees' rights to express and disseminate their opinions, as alleged by the Complainant. The\u000aevents which give rise to this allegation are the ban by the Eritrean government of the private press, and\u000athe arrest and detention of the 18 journalists. The Respondent State argues that these actions were\u000ajustified by the activities of the journalists and the newspapers in question, which it considered were aimed\u000aat overthrowing the government. Further, the Eritrean government claims that its actions did not constitute\u000a11\u000a\u000aa breach of the Charter, as Article 9 only protects the expression and dissemination of opinions within the\u000alaw.\u000a105. As explained above, permitting State Parties to construe Charter provisions so that they could be\u000alimited or even negated by domestic laws would render the Charter meaningless. Any law enacted by the\u000aEritrean Government which permits a wholesale ban on the press and the imprisonment of those whose\u000aviews contradict those of the Government's is contrary to both the spirit and the purpose of Article 9. The\u000aCommission reiterates its own statement in communications 105/93, 128/94, 130/94 and 152/96:36\u000a[A]ccording to Article 9.2 of the Charter, dissemination of opinions may be restricted by law. This does not\u000amean that national law can set aside the right to express and disseminate one's opinions; this would make\u000athe protection of the right to express one's opinions ineffective. To allow national law to have precedence\u000aover the international law of the Charter would defeat the purpose of the rights and freedoms enshrined in\u000athe Charter. International human rights standards must always prevail over contradictory national law. Any\u000alimitation on the rights of the Charter must be in conformity with the provisions of the Charter.\u000a106. By applying norms of international human rights law, the Commission has previously found, and finds\u000ain this case, that the imprisonment of journalists "deprives not only the journalists of their rights to freely\u000aexpress and disseminate their opinions, but also the public, of the right to information. This action is a\u000abreach of the provisions of Article 9 of the Charter."37\u000a107. Moreover, banning the entire private press on the grounds that it constitutes a threat to the incumbent\u000agovernment is a violation of the right to freedom of expression, and is the type of action that Article 9 is\u000aintended to proscribe. A free press is one of the tenets of a democratic society, and a valuable check on\u000apotential excesses by government.\u000a108. No political situation justifies the wholesale violation of human rights; indeed general restrictions on\u000arights such as the right to free expression and to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention serve only to\u000aundermine public confidence in the rule of law and will often increase, rather than prevent, agitation within a\u000aState. The Commission draws on the findings of the UN Human Rights Committee:\u000aThe legitimate objective of safeguarding and indeed strengthening national unity under difficult political\u000acircumstances cannot be achieved by attempting to muzzle advocacy of multi-party democracy, democratic\u000atenets and human rights. 38\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor the reasons given above the Commission:\u000aHolds a violation of Articles 1, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, and 18 by the State of Eritrea;\u000aUrges the government of Eritrea to release or to bring to a speedy and fair trial the 18 journalists detained\u000asince September 2001, and to lift the ban on the press;\u000aRecommends that the detainees be granted immediate access to their families and legal representatives;\u000aand\u000aRecommends that the government of Eritrea takes appropriate measures to ensure payment of\u000acompensation to the detainees.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 See Article 56 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\u000a2 See African Commission Information Sheet No. 3 Communication Procedure.\u000a3 Communication Nos. 147/95 and 149/96 Sir Dawda K Jawara/The Gambia, African Commission on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights.\u000a4 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Case of Velásquez Rodríguez, Judgment of July 29, 1988, para.\u000a63.\u000a5 See Article 17 (1): "No person may be arrested or detained save pursuant to due process of law.

Preliminary Exceptions [sic][/url], cit., para. 91\u000a× 1. The rule of prior exhaustion of domestic remedies under the international law of human rights has\u000acertain implications that are present in the Convention. Under the Convention, States Parties have an\u000aobligation to provide effective judicial remedies to victims of human rights violations ( Art. 25 ), remedies\u000athat must be substantiated in accordance with the rules of due process of law ( Art. 8(1) ), all in keeping\u000awith the general obligation of such States to guarantee the free and full exercise of the rights recognized by\u000athe Convention to all persons subject to their jurisdiction ( Art. 1 ). Thus, when certain exceptions to the rule\u000aof non-exhaustion of domestic remedies are invoked, such as the ineffectiveness of such remedies or the\u000alack of due process of law, not only is it contended that the victim is under no obligation to pursue such\u000aremedies, but, indirectly, the State in question is also charged with a new violation of the obligations\u000a13\u000a\u000aassumed under the Convention. Thus, the question of domestic remedies is closely tied to the merits of the\u000acase.\u000a.

aV276/03 Centre for Minority Rights Development\u000a(Kenya) and Minority Rights Group (on behalf of\u000aEndorois Welfare Council) / Kenya\u000aSummary of Alleged Facts\u000a1. The complaint is filed by the Centre for Minority Rights Development (CEMIRIDE) with the assistance of\u000aMinority Rights Group International (MRG) and the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE which submitted an amicus curiae brief) on behalf of the Endorois community. The Complainants allege\u000aviolations resulting from the displacement of the Endorois community, an indigenous community, from their\u000aancestral lands, the failure to adequately compensate them for the loss of their property, the disruption of\u000athe community's pastoral enterprise and violations of the right to practise their religion and culture, as well\u000aas the overall process of development of the Endorois people.\u000a2. The Complainants allege that the Government of Kenya in violation of the African Charter on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights (hereinafter the African Charter), the Constitution of Kenya and international law, forcibly\u000aremoved the Endorois from their ancestral lands around the Lake Bogoria area of the Baringo and Koibatek\u000aAdministrative Districts, as well as in the Nakuru and Laikipia Administrative Districts within the Rift Valley\u000aProvince in Kenya, without proper prior consultations, adequate and effective compensation.\u000a3. The Complainants state that the Endorois are a community of approximately 60,000 people1 who, for\u000acenturies, have lived in the Lake Bogoria area. They claim that prior to the dispossession of Endorois land\u000athrough the creation of the Lake Hannington Game Reserve in 1973, and a subsequent re-gazetting of the\u000aLake Bogoria Game Reserve in 1978 by the Government of Kenya, the Endorois had established, and, for\u000acenturies, practised a sustainable way of life which was inextricably linked to their ancestral land. The\u000aComplainants allege that since 1978 the Endorois have been denied access to their land.\u000a4. The Complainants state that apart from a confrontation with the Masai over the Lake Bogoria region\u000aapproximately three hundred years ago, the Endorois have been accepted by all neighbouring tribes as\u000abona fide owners of the land and that they continued to occupy and enjoy undisturbed use of the land\u000aunder the British colonial administration, although the British claimed title to the land in the name of the\u000aBritish Crown.\u000a5. The Complainants state that at independence in 1963, the British Crown's claim to Endorois land was\u000apassed on to the respective county councils. However, under Section 115 of the Kenyan Constitution, the\u000acountry councils held this land in trust, on behalf of the Endorois community, who remained on the land and\u000acontinued to hold, use and enjoy it. The Endorois' customary rights over the Lake Bogoria region were not\u000achallenged until the 1973 gazetting of the land by the Government of Kenya. The Complainants state that\u000athe act of gazetting and, therefore, dispossession of the land is central to the present communication.\u000a6. The Complainants state that the area surrounding Lake Bogoria is fertile land, providing green pasture\u000aand medicinal salt licks, which help raise healthy cattle. The Complainants state that Lake Bogoria is\u000acentral to the Endorois religious and traditional practices. They state that the community's historical prayer\u000asites, places for circumcision rituals, and other cultural ceremonies are around Lake Bogoria. These sites\u000awere used on a weekly or monthly basis for smaller local ceremonies, and on an annual basis for cultural\u000afestivities involving Endorois from the whole region. The Complainants claim that the Endorois believe that\u000athe spirits of all Endorois, no matter where they are buried, live on in the lake, with annual festivals taking\u000aplace at the Lake. The Complainants further claim that the Endorois believe that the Monchongoi forest is\u000aconsidered the birthplace of the Endorois and the settlement of the first Endorois community.\u000a7. The Complainants state that despite the lack of understanding of the Endorois community regarding\u000awhat had been decided by the Respondent State, the Kenyan Wildlife Service (hereinafter KWS) informed\u000acertain Endorois elders shortly after the creation of the game reserve that 400 Endorois families would be\u000acompensated with plots of "fertile land." The undertaking also specified, according to the Complainants,\u000athat the community would receive 25% of the tourist revenue from the game reserve and 85% of the\u000aemployment generated, and that cattle dips and fresh water dams would be constructed by the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a8. The Complainants allege that after several meetings to determine financial compensation for the\u000arelocation of the 400 families, the KWS stated it would provide 3,150 Kenya Shillings per family. The\u000a1\u000a\u000aComplainants allege that none of these terms have been implemented and that only 170 out of the 400\u000afamilies were eventually given some money in 1986, years after the agreements were concluded. The\u000aComplainants state that the money given to the 170 families was always understood to be a means of\u000afacilitating relocation rather than compensation for the Endorois' loss.\u000a9. The Complainants state that to reclaim their ancestral land and to safeguard their pastoralist way of life,\u000athe Endorois petitioned to meet with President Daniel Arap Moi, who was their local Member of Parliament.\u000aA meeting was held on 28th December 1994 at his Lake Bogoria Hotel.\u000a10. The Complainants state that as a result of this meeting, the President directed the local authority to\u000arespect the 1973 agreement on compensation and directed that 25% of annual income towards community\u000aprojects be given to the Endorois. In November of the following year, upon being notified by the Endorois\u000acommunity that nothing had been implemented, the Complainants state that President Moi again ordered\u000athat his directives be followed.\u000a11. The Complainants state that following the non-implementation of the directives of President Moi, the\u000aEndorois began legal action against Baringo and Koibatek county councils. Judgment was given on 19th\u000aApril 2002 dismissing the application.2 Although the High Court recognised that Lake Bogoria had been\u000aTrust Land for the Endorois, it stated that the Endorois had effectively lost any legal claim as a result of the\u000adesignation of the land as a game reserve in 1973 and in 1974. It concluded that the money given in 1986\u000ato 170 families for the cost of relocating represented the fulfilment of any duty owed by the authorities\u000atowards the Endorois for the loss of their ancestral land.\u000a12. The Complainants state that the High Court also stated clearly that it could not address the issue of a\u000acommunity's collective right to property, referring throughout to "individuals" affected and stating that "there\u000ais no proper identity of the people who were affected by the setting aside of the land ... that has been\u000ashown to the Court". The Complainants also claim that the High Court stated that it did not believe Kenyan\u000alaw should address any special protection to a people's land based on historical occupation and cultural\u000arights.\u000a13. The Complainants allege that since the Kenyan High Court case in 2000, the Endorois community has\u000abecome aware that parts of their ancestral land have been demarcated and sold by the Respondent State3\u000ato third parties.\u000a14. The Complainants further allege that concessions for ruby mining on Endorois traditional land were\u000agranted in 2002 to a private company. This included the construction of a road in order to facilitate access\u000afor heavy mining machinery. The Complainants claim that these activities incur a high risk of polluting the\u000awaterways used by the Endorois community, both for their own personal consumption and for use by their\u000alivestock. Both mining operations and the demarcation and sale of land have continued despite the request\u000aby the African Commission to the President of Kenya to suspend these activities pending the outcome of\u000athe present communication.\u000a15. The Complainants state that following the commencement of legal action on behalf of the community,\u000asome improvements were made to the community members' access to the Lake. For example, they are no\u000alonger required to pay game reserve entrance fees. The Complainants, nevertheless, allege that this\u000aaccess is subject to the game reserve authority's discretion. They claim that the Endorois still have limited\u000aaccess to Lake Bogoria for grazing their cattle, for religious purposes, and for collecting traditional herbs.\u000aThey also state that the lack of legal certainty surrounding access rights and rights of usage renders the\u000aEndorois completely dependent on the game reserve authority's discretion to grant these rights on an ad\u000ahoc basis.\u000a16. The Complainants claim that land for the Endorois is held in very high esteem, since tribal land, in\u000aaddition to securing subsistence and livelihood, is seen as sacred, being inextricably linked to the cultural\u000aintegrity of the community and its traditional way of life. Land, they claim, belongs to the community and not\u000athe individual and is essential to the preservation and survival as a traditional people. The Complainants\u000aclaim that the Endorois health, livelihood, religion and culture are all intimately connected with their\u000atraditional land, as grazing lands, sacred religious sites and plants used for traditional medicine are all\u000asituated around the shores of Lake Bogoria.\u000a17. The Complainants claim that at present the Endorois live in a number of locations on the periphery of\u000athe reserve - that the Endorois are not only being forced from fertile lands to semi-arid areas, but have also\u000abeen divided as a community and displaced from their traditional and ancestral lands. The Complainants\u000aclaim that for the Endorois, access to the Lake Bogoria region, is a right for the community and the\u000aGovernment of Kenya continues to deny the community effective participation in decisions affecting their\u000aown land, in violation of their right to development.\u000a2\u000a\u000a18. The Complainants further allege that the right to legal representation for the Endorois is limited, in that\u000aJuma Kiplenge, the lawyer and human rights defender who was representing the 20,000 Endorois nomadic\u000apastoralists, was arrested in August 1996 and accused of "belonging to an unlawful society". They claim\u000athat he has also received death threats.\u000a19. The Complainants allege that the Government's decision to gazette Endorois traditional land as a game\u000areserve, which in turn denies the Endorois access to the area, has jeopardized the community's pastoral\u000aenterprise and imperilled its cultural integrity. The Complainants also claim that 30 years after the evictions\u000abegan, the Endorois still do not have full and fair compensation for the loss of their land and their rights on\u000ato it. They further allege that the process of evicting them from their traditional land not only violates\u000aEndorois community property rights, but spiritual, cultural and economic ties to the land are severed.\u000a20. The Complainants allege that the Endorois have no say in the management of their ancestral land. The\u000aEndorois Welfare Committee, which is the representative body of the Endorois community, has been\u000arefused registration, thus denying the right of the Endorois to fair and legitimate consultation. This failure to\u000aregister the Endorois Welfare Committee, according to the Complainants, has often led to illegitimate\u000aconsultations taking place, with the authorities selecting particular individuals to lend their consent 'on\u000abehalf' of the community. The Complainants further submit that the denial of domestic legal title to their\u000atraditional land, the removal of the community from their ancestral home and the severe restrictions placed\u000aon access to the Lake Bogoria region today, together with a lack of adequate compensation, amount to a\u000aserious violation of the African Charter. The Complainants state that the Endorois community claims these\u000aviolations both for themselves as a people and on behalf of all the individuals affected.\u000a21. The Complainants allege that in the creation of the game reserve, the Respondent State disregarded\u000anational law, Kenyan Constitutional provisions and, most importantly, numerous articles of the African\u000aCharter, including the right to property, the right to free disposition of natural resources, the right to religion,\u000athe right to cultural life and the right to development.\u000a\u000aArticles Alleged to Have Been Violated\u000a22. The Complainants seek a declaration that the Republic of Kenya is in violation of Articles 8, 14, 17, 21\u000aand 22 of the African Charter. The Complainants are also seeking:\u000a\u2022 Restitution of their land, with legal title and clear demarcation.\u000a\u2022 Compensation to the community for all the loss they have suffered through the loss of their\u000aproperty, development and natural resources, but also freedom to practice their religion and culture.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a23. On 22nd May 2003, the Centre for Minority Rights and Development (CEMIRIDE) forwarded to the\u000aSecretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Secretariat) a formal letter of\u000aintent regarding the forthcoming submission of a communication on behalf of the Endorois community.\u000a24. On 9th June 2003, the Secretariat wrote a letter to the Centre for Minority Rights and Development,\u000aacknowledging receipt of the same.\u000a25. On 23rd June 2003, the Secretariat wrote a letter to Cynthia Morel of Minority Rights Group\u000aInternational, who is assisting the Centre for Minority Rights Development, acknowledging her\u000acommunication and informed her that the complaint would be presented to the upcoming 34th Ordinary\u000aSession of the African Commission.\u000a26. A copy of the complaint, dated 28th August 2003, was sent to the Secretariat on 29th August 2003.\u000a27. At its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 6th to 20th November 2003, the African\u000aCommission examined the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a28. On 10th December 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the parties informing them of this decision and further\u000arequesting them to forward their written submissions on admissibility before the 35th Ordinary Session.\u000a29. As the Complainants had already sent their submissions, when the communication was being sent to\u000athe Secretariat, the Secretariat wrote a reminder to the Respondent State to forward its written submissions\u000aon admissibility.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a30. By a letter of 14th April 2004, the Complainants requested the African Commission on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights (the African Commission) to be allowed to present their oral submissions on the matter at\u000athe Session.\u000a31. On 29th April 2004, the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to forward its written\u000asubmissions on admissibility of the communication.\u000a32. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21st May to 4th June 2004, the African\u000aCommission examined the complaint and decided to defer its decision on admissibility to the next session.\u000aThe African Commission also decided to issue an Urgent Appeal to the Government of the Republic of\u000aKenya, requesting it to stay any action or measure by the State in respect of the subject matter of this\u000acommunication, pending the decision of the African Commission, which was forwarded on 9th August 2004.\u000a33. At the same Session, a copy of the complaint was handed over to the delegation of the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a34. On 17th June 2004, the Secretariat wrote to both parties informing them of this decision and requesting\u000athe Respondent State to forward its submissions on admissibility before the 36th Ordinary Session.\u000a35. A copy of the same communication was forwarded to the Respondent State's High Commission in\u000aAddis Ababa, Ethiopia on 22 June 2004.\u000a36. On 24th June 2004, the Kenyan High Commission in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, informed the Secretariat\u000athat it had conveyed the African Commission's communication to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kenya.\u000a37. The Secretariat sent a similar reminder to the Respondent State on 7th September 2004, requesting it\u000ato forward its written submissions on the admissibility of the communication before the 36th Ordinary\u000aSession.\u000a38. During the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal, from 23rd November to 7th December 2004,\u000athe Secretariat received a hand-written request from the Respondent State for a postponement of the\u000amatter to the next Session. At the same Session, the African Commission deferred the case to the next\u000asession to allow the Respondent State more time to forward its submissions on admissibility.\u000a39. On 23rd December 2004, the Secretariat wrote to the Respondent State informing it of this decision and\u000arequesting it to forward its submissions on admissibility as soon as possible.\u000a40. Similar reminders were sent out to the Respondent State on 2nd February and 4th April 2005.\u000a41. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 27th April to 11th May 2005, the African\u000aCommission considered this communication and declared it admissible after the Respondent State had\u000afailed to cooperate with the African Commission on the admissibility procedure despite numerous letters\u000aand reminders of its obligations under the Charter.\u000a42. On 7th May 2005, the Secretariat wrote to the parties to inform them of this decision and requested\u000athem to forward their arguments on the merits.\u000a43. On 21st May 2005, the Chairperson of the African Commission addressed an urgent appeal to the\u000aPresident of the Republic of Kenya on reports received alleging the harassment of the Chairperson of the\u000aEndorois Assistance Council who is involved in this communication.\u000a44. On 11th and 19th July 2005, the Secretariat received the Complainants' submissions on the merits,\u000awhich were forwarded to the Respondent State.\u000a45. On 12th September 2005, the Secretariat wrote a reminder to the Respondent State.\u000a46. On 10th November 2005, the Secretariat received an amicus curiae brief on the case from COHRE.\u000a47. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and deferred its decision on the merits to the 39th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a48. On 30th January 2006, the Secretariat informed the Complainants of this decision.\u000a49. By a Note Verbale of 5th February 2006, which was delivered by hand to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u000aof the Republic of Kenya through a member of staff of the Secretariat who travelled to the country in March\u000a2006, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of this decision by the African Commission. Copies of\u000aall the submissions by the Complainants since the opening of this file were enclosed thereto.\u000a50. By an email of 4th May 2006, the Senior Principal State Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General of\u000athe Respondent State requested the African Commission to defer the consideration of this communication\u000aon the basis that the Respondent State was still preparing a response to the matter which it claimed to be\u000aquite protracted and involved many departments.\u000a51. By a Note Verbale of 4th May 2006, which was received by the Secretariat on the same day, the\u000aSolicitor General of the Respondent State formally requested the African Commission to defer the matter to\u000athe next Session noting mainly that due to the wide range of issues contained in the communication, its\u000a4\u000a\u000aresponse would not be ready for submission before the 39th Ordinary Session.\u000a52. At its 39th Ordinary Session held from 11th to 25th May 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and deferred its consideration of the same to its 40th Ordinary\u000aSession to await the outcome of amicable settlement negotiations underway between the Complainants\u000aand the Respondent State.\u000a53. The Secretariat of the African Commission notified the parties of this decision accordingly.\u000a54. On 31st October 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the\u000aComplainants reporting that the parties had had constructive exchanges on the matter and that the matter\u000ashould be heard on the merits in November 2006 by the African Commission. The Complainants also\u000aapplied for leave to have an expert witness heard during the 40th Ordinary Session.\u000a55. At the 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission deferred its decision on the merits of the\u000acommunication after having heard the expert witness called in by the Complainant. The Respondent State\u000aalso made presentations. Further documents were submitted at the session and, later on, during the\u000aintersession; more documentation was received from both parties before the 41st Ordinary Session.\u000a56. During the 41st Ordinary Session, the Complainants submitted their final comments on the last\u000asubmission by the Respondent State.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a57. The Respondent State has been given ample opportunity to forward its submissions on admissibility on\u000athe matter. Its delegates at the previous two Ordinary Sessions of the African Commission were supplied\u000awith hard copies of the complaint. There was no response from the Respondent State. The African\u000aCommission has no option but to proceed with considering the admissibility of the communication based on\u000athe information at its disposal.\u000a58. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\u000aby the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This article lays down seven (7) conditions,\u000awhich generally must be fulfilled by a complainant for a communication to be admissible.\u000a59. In the present communication, the complaint indicates its authors (Article 56(1)), is compatible with the\u000aOrganisation of African Unity /African Union Charters and that of the African Charter on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights (Article 56(2)), and it is not written in disparaging language (Article 56(3)). Due to lack of\u000ainformation that the Respondent State should have supplied, if any, the African Commission is not in a\u000aposition to question whether the complaint is exclusively based on news disseminated through the mass\u000amedia (Article 56(4)), has exhausted local remedies (Article 56(5)), and has been settled elsewhere per\u000a(Article 56(7)) of the African Charter. With respect to the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies, in\u000aparticular, the Complainants approached the High Court in Nakuru, Kenya, in November 1998. The matter\u000awas struck out on procedural grounds. A similar claim was made before the same court in 2000 as a\u000aconstitutional reference case, in which order was sought as in the previous case. The matter was, however,\u000adismissed on the grounds that it lacked merits and held that the Complainants had been properly consulted\u000aand compensated for their loss. The Complainants thus claim that as constitutional reference cases could\u000anot be appealed, all possible domestic remedies have been exhausted.\u000a60. The African Commission notes that there was a lack of cooperation from the Respondent State to\u000asubmit arguments on the admissibility of the communication despite numerous reminders. In the absence\u000aof such a submission, given the face value of the Complainants' submission, the African Commission holds\u000athat the complaint complies with Article 56 of the African Charter and hence declares the communication\u000aadmissible.\u000a61. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State requested the African Commission to review its\u000adecision on admissibility. It argued that even though the African Commission had gone ahead to admit the\u000acommunication, it would nevertheless, proceed to submit arguments why the African Commission should\u000anot be precluded from re-examining the admissibility of the communication, after the oral testimony of the\u000aRespondent State, and dismissing the communication.\u000a62. In arguing that the African Commission should not be a tribunal of first instance, the Respondent State\u000aargues that the remedies sought by the Complainants in the High Court of Kenya could not be the same as\u000athose sought from the African Commission.\u000a\u000a5\u000a\u000a63. For the benefit of the African Commission, the Respondent State outlined the issues put before the\u000aCourt in Misc, Civil Case No: 183 of 2002:\u000a1. A Declaration that the land around Lake Baringo is the property of the Endorois community, held in\u000atrust for its benefit by the County Council of Baringo and the County Council of Koibatek, under\u000aSections 114 and 115 of the Constitution of Kenya.\u000a2. A Declaration that the County Council of Baringo and the County Council of Koibatek are in breach\u000aof fiduciary duty of trust to the Endorois community, because of their failure to utilise benefits\u000aaccruing from the game reserve to the benefit of the community contrary to Sections 114 and 115 of\u000athe Constitution of Kenya.\u000a3. A Declaration that the Complainants and the Endorois community are entitled to all the benefits\u000agenerated through the game reserve exclusively and / or in the alternative the land under the game\u000areserve should revert to the community under the management of trustees appointed by the\u000acommunity to receive and invest the benefits in the interest of the community under Section 117 of\u000athe Constitution of Kenya.\u000a4. An award of exemplary damages arising from the breach of the applicants' constitutional rights\u000aunder Section 115 of the Constitution of Kenya.\u000a64. The Respondent State informs the African Commission that the Court held that procedures governing\u000athe setting apart of the game reserve were followed. The Respondent State further states that it went\u000afurther to advise the Complainants that they should have exercised their right of appeal under Sections 10,\u000a11 and 12 of the Trust Land Act, Chapter 288, Laws of Kenya, in the event that they felt that the award of\u000acompensation was not fairly handled. None of the applicants had appealed, and the High Court was of the\u000aview that it was too late to complain.\u000a65. The Respondent State also states that the Court opined that the application did not fall under Section\u000a84 (Enforcement of Constitutional Rights) since the application did not plead any violations or likelihood of\u000aviolations of their rights under Sections 70 - 83 of the Constitution.\u000a66. It further argues that the communication irregularly came before the African Commission as the\u000aapplicants did not exhaust local remedies regarding the alleged violations. This is because:\u000a1. The Complainants did not plead that their rights had been contravened or likely to be contravened\u000aby the High Court Misc. Civil Case 183 of 2002. It states that the issue of alleged violations of any of\u000athe rights claimed under the present communication has, therefore, not been addressed by the local\u000acourts. This means that the African Commission will be acting as a court of first instance. The\u000aRespondent State argues that the applicants should, therefore, be asked to exhaust local remedies\u000abefore approaching the African Commission.\u000a2. The Complainants did not pursue other administrative remedies available to them. The Respondent\u000aState argues that the allegations that the Kenyan legal system has no adequate remedies to\u000aaddress the case of the Endorois are untrue and unsubstantiated. It argues that in matters of human\u000arights the Kenya High Court has been willing to apply international human rights instruments to\u000aprotect the rights of the individual.\u000a67. The Respondent State further says that the Kenyan legal system has a very comprehensive description\u000aof property rights, and provides for the protection of all forms of property in the Constitution. It argues that\u000awhile various international human rights instruments, including the African Charter, recognise the right to\u000aproperty, these instruments have a minimalist approach and do not satisfy the kind of property protected.\u000aThe Respondent State asserts that the Kenyan legal system goes further than provided for in international\u000ahuman rights instruments.\u000a68. The Respondent State further states that land as property is recognised under the Kenyan legal system\u000aand various methods of ownership are recognised and protected. These include private ownership (for\u000anatural and artificial persons), communal ownership either through the Land (Group Representatives) Act\u000afor adjudicated land, which is also called the Group Ranches or the Trust Lands managed by the County\u000aCouncil, within whose area of jurisdiction it is situated for the benefit of the persons ordinarily resident on\u000athat land. The State avers that the Land Group Act gives effect to such right of ownership, interests or other\u000abenefits of the land as may be available, under African customary law.\u000a\u000a6\u000a\u000a69. The Respondent State concludes that Trust Lands are established under the Constitution of Kenya and\u000aadministered under an Act of Parliament and that the Constitution provides that Trust Land may be\u000aalienated through:\u000a\u2022 Registration to another person other than the County Council;\u000a\u2022 An Act of Parliament providing for the County Council to set apart an area of Trust Land.\u000a70. Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure states that: If the Commission has\u000adeclared a communication inadmissible under the Charter, it may reconsider this decision at a later date if it\u000areceives a request for reconsideration.\u000aThe African Commission notes the arguments advanced by the Respondent State to reopen its decision on\u000aadmissibility. However, after careful consideration of the Respondent State's arguments, the African\u000aCommission is not convinced that it should reopen arguments on the admissibility of the communication. It\u000atherefore declines the Respondent State's request.\u000aMerits\u000aComplainants' Submission on the Merits\u000a\u000a71. The arguments below are the submissions of the Complainants, taking also into consideration their oral\u000atestimony at the 40th Ordinary Session, all their written submissions, including letters and supporting\u000aaffidavits.\u000a72. The Complainants argue that the Endorois have always been the bona fide owners of the land around\u000aLake Bogoria.4 They argue that the Endorois' concept of land did not conceive the loss of land without\u000aconquest. They argue that as a pastoralist community, the Endorois' concept of "ownership" of their land\u000ahas not been one of ownership by paper. The Complainants state that the Endorois community have\u000aalways understood the land in question to be "Endorois" land, belonging to the community as a whole and\u000aused by it for habitation, cattle, beekeeping, and religious and cultural practices. Other communities would,\u000afor instance, ask permission to bring their animals to the area.5\u000a73. They also argue that the Endorois have always considered themselves to be a distinct community.\u000aThey argue that historically the Endorois are a pastoral community, almost solely dependent on livestock.\u000aTheir practice of pastoralism has consisted of grazing their animals (cattle, goats, sheep) in the lowlands\u000aaround Lake Bogoria in the rainy season, and turning to the Monchongoi Forest during the dry season.\u000aThey claim that the Endorois have traditionally relied on beekeeping for honey and that the area\u000asurrounding Lake Bogoria is fertile land, providing green pasture and medicinal salt licks, which help raise\u000ahealthy cattle. They argue that Lake Bogoria is also the centre of the community's religious and traditional\u000apractices: around the lake are found the community's historical prayer sites, the places for circumcision\u000arituals, and other cultural ceremonies. These sites were used on a weekly or monthly basis for smaller local\u000aceremonies, and on an annual basis for cultural festivities involving Endorois from the whole region.\u000a74. The Complainants argue that the Endorois believe that spirits of all former Endorois, no matter where\u000athey are buried, live on in the Lake. Annual festivals at the lake took place with the participation of Endorois\u000afrom the whole region. They say that Monchongoi forest is considered the birthplace of the Endorois people\u000aand the settlement of the first Endorois community. They also state that the Endorois community's\u000aleadership is traditionally based on elders. Though under the British colonial administration, chiefs were\u000aappointed, this did not continue after Kenyan independence. They state that more recently, the community\u000aformed the Endorois Welfare Committee (EWC) to represent its interests. However, the local authorities\u000ahave refused to register the EWC despite two separate efforts to do so since its creation in 1996.\u000a75. The Complainants argue that the Endorois are a 'people', a status that entitles them to benefit from\u000aprovisions of the African Charter that protect collective rights. The Complainants argue that the African\u000aCommission has affirmed the rights of "peoples'' to bring claims under the African Charter in the case of\u000aSocial and Economic Rights Action Center and Center for Economic and Social Rights v. Nigeria (the\u000aOgoni Case) stating: "The African Charter in Articles 20 through 24 clearly provides for peoples' to retain\u000arights as peoples', that is, as collectives. The importance of community and collective identity in African\u000aculture is recognised throughout the African Charter." 6 They further argue that the African Commission\u000anoted that when there is a large number of individual victims, it may be impractical for each individual\u000aComplainant to go before domestic courts. In such situations, as was with the Ogoni case, the African\u000aCommission can adjudicate the rights of a people as a collective. They therefore argue that the Endorois,\u000a7\u000a\u000aas a people, are entitled to bring their claims collectively under those relevant provisions of the African\u000aCharter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 8- The Right to Practice Religion\u000a\u000aArticle 8 of the African Charter states:\u000aFreedom of conscience, the profession and free practice of religion shall be guaranteed. No one may,\u000asubject to law and order, be submitted to measures restricting the exercise of these freedoms.\u000a76. The Complainants allege violation to practice their religion. They claim that the Kenyan Authorities'\u000acontinual refusal to give the community a right of access to religious sites to worship freely amounts to a\u000aviolation of Article 8.\u000a77. The Complainants argue that the African Commission has embraced the broad discretion required by\u000ainternational law in defining and protecting religion. In the case of 25/89-47/90-56/91-100/93 Free Legal\u000aAssistance Group and Others v. Zaire, they argue that the African Commission held that the practices of\u000athe Jehovah's Witnesses were protected under Article 8. 7 In the present communication, the Complainants\u000astate that the Endorois' religion and beliefs are protected by Article 8 of the African Charter and constitute a\u000areligion under international law. The Endorois believe that the Great Ancestor, Dorios, came from the\u000aHeavens and settled in the Mochongoi Forest. After a period of excess and luxury, the Endorois believe\u000athat God became angry and, as punishment, sank the ground one night, forming Lake Bogoria. The\u000aEndorois believe themselves to be descendants of the families who survived that event.\u000a78. They state that each season the water of the lake turns red and the hot springs emit a strong odour. At\u000athis time, the community performs traditional ceremonies to appease the ancestors who drowned with the\u000aformation of the lake. The Endorois regard both Mochongoi Forest and Lake Bogoria as sacred grounds,\u000aand have always used these locations for key cultural and religious ceremonies, such as weddings,\u000afunerals, circumcisions, and traditional initiations.8\u000a79. The Complainants argue that the Endorois, as an indigenous group whose religion is intimately tied to\u000athe land, require special protection. Lake Bogoria, they argue, is of fundamental religious significance to all\u000aEndorois. The religious sites of the Endorois people are situated around the lake, where the Endorois pray,\u000aand religious ceremonies are regularly connected with the Lake. Ancestors are buried near the lake, and as\u000astated above, they claim that Lake Bogoria is considered the spiritual home of all Endorois, living and dead.\u000aThe lake, the Complainants argue, is therefore essential to the religious practices and beliefs of the\u000aEndorois.\u000a80. The Complainants argue that by evicting the Endorois from their land, and by refusing the Endorois\u000acommunity access to the Lake and other surrounding religious sites, the Kenyan Authorities have interfered\u000awith the Endorois' ability to practice and worship as their faith dictates. In violation of Article 8 of the African\u000aCharter, the Complainants argue that religious sites within the game reserve have not been properly\u000ademarcated and protected. They further argue that since their eviction from the Lake Bogoria area, the\u000aEndorois have not been able to freely practice their religion. Access as of right for religious rituals - such as\u000acircumcisions, marital rituals, and initiation rights - has been denied the community. Similarly, the Endorois\u000ahave not been able to hold or participate in their most significant annual religious ritual, which occurs when\u000athe Lake undergoes seasonal changes.\u000a81. Citing the African Commission's jurisprudence in 48.90-50.91-52.91-89.93-Amnesty-International-v.-S,\u000athe Complainants argue that the African Commission recognised the centrality of practice to religious\u000afreedom, noting that the State Party violated the authors' right to practice religion because non-Muslims did\u000anot have the right to preach or build their churches and were subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, and\u000aexpulsion.9 In addition, they argue, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples gives\u000aindigenous peoples the right "to maintain, protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural\u000asites..." 10 They state that only through unfettered access will the Endorois be able to protect, maintain, and\u000ause their sacred sites in accordance with their religious beliefs.\u000a82. Citing the case of Loren Laroye Riebe Star,11 the Complainants argue that the Inter-American\u000aCommission on Human Rights (IAcmHR) has determined that expulsion from lands central to the practice\u000aof religion constitutes a violation of religious freedoms. In the above case, the Complainants argue that the\u000aIACmHR held that the expulsion of priests from the Chiapas area was a violation of the right to associate\u000a8\u000a\u000afreely for religious purposes. They further state that the IACmHR came to a similar conclusion in Dianna\u000aOrtiz v. Guatemala. This was a case concerning a Catholic nun who fled Guatemala after State actions\u000aprevented her from freely exercising her religion.12 Here, the IACmHR decided that her right to freely\u000apractice her religion had been violated, because she was denied access to the lands most significant to\u000aher.13\u000a83. The Complainants argue that the current management of the game reserve has failed both to fully\u000ademarcate the sacred sites within the Reserve and to maintain sites that are known to be sacred to the\u000aEndorois.14 They argue that the Kenyan authorities' failure to demarcate and protect religious sites within\u000athe game reserve constitutes a severe and permanent interference with the Endorois' right to practice their\u000areligion. Without proper care, sites that are of immense religious and cultural significance have been\u000adamaged, degraded, or destroyed. They cite "The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples"\u000awhich state in part that: "States shall take effective measures, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples\u000aconcerned, to ensure that indigenous sacred places, including burial sites, be preserved, respected and\u000aprotected."15\u000a84. The Complainants also accuse the Kenyan authorities of interfering with the Endorois' right to freely\u000apractice their religion by evicting them from their land, and then refusing to grant them free access to their\u000asacred sites. This separation from their land, they argue, prevents the Endorois from carrying out sacred\u000apractices central to their religion.\u000a85. They argue that even though Article 8 provides that states may interfere with religious practices "subject\u000ato law and order", the Endorois religious practices are not a threat to law and order, and thus there is no\u000ajustification for the interference. They argue that the limitations placed on the state's duties to protect rights\u000ashould be viewed in light of the underlying sentiments of the African Charter. In Amnesty International v.\u000aZambia, the Complainants argue that the African Commission noted that it was "of the view that the\u000a'claw-back' clauses must not be interpreted against the principles of the Charter... Recourse to these\u000ashould not be used as a means of giving credence to violations of the express provisions of the Charter." 16\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 14- The Right to Property\u000a\u000aArticle 14 of the African Charter states:\u000aThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\u000ain the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\u000a86. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community has a right to property with regard to their\u000aancestral land, the possessions attached to it, and their cattle. They argue that these property rights are\u000aderived both from Kenyan law and the African Charter, which recognise indigenous peoples' property rights\u000aover their ancestral land. The Complainants argue that the Endorois' property rights have been violated by\u000athe continuing dispossession of the Lake Bogoria land area. They argue that the impact on the community\u000ahas been disproportionate to any public need or general community interest.\u000a87. Presenting arguments that Article 14 of the Charter has been violated, the Complainants argue that for\u000acenturies the Endorois have constructed homes, cultivated the land, enjoyed unchallenged rights to\u000apasture, grazing, and forest land, and relied on the land to sustain their livelihoods around the lake. They\u000aargue that in doing so, the Endorois exercised an indigenous form of tenure, holding the land through a\u000acollective form of ownership. Such behaviour indicated traditional African land ownership, which was rarely\u000awritten down as a codification of rights or title, but was, nevertheless, understood through mutual\u000arecognition and respect between landholders. 'Land transactions' would take place only by way of conquest\u000aof land.\u000a88. The Complainants argue that even under colonial rule when the British Crown claimed formal\u000apossession of Endorois land, the colonial authorities recognised the Endorois' right to occupy and use the\u000aland and its resources. They argue that in law, the land was recognised as the "Endorois Location" and in\u000apractice the Endorois were left largely undisturbed during colonial rule. They aver that the Endorois\u000acommunity continued to hold such traditional rights, interests and benefits in the land surrounding Lake\u000aBogoria even upon the creation of the independent Republic of Kenya in 1963. They state that on 1st May\u000a1963, the Endorois land became 'Trust Land' under Section 115(2) of the Kenyan Constitution, which\u000astates:\u000a9\u000a\u000aEach County Council shall hold the Trust Land vested in it for the benefit of the persons ordinarily resident\u000aon that land and shall give effect to such rights, interests or other benefits in respect of the land as may,\u000aunder the African customary law for the time being in force and applicable thereto, be vested in any tribe,\u000agroup, family or individual.\u000a89. They argue that through centuries of living and working on the land, the Endorois were "ordinarily\u000aresident on [the] land" , and their traditional form of collective ownership of the land qualifies as a "right,\u000ainterest or other benefit... under African customary law" vested in "any tribe, group [or] family" for the\u000apurposes of Section 115(2). They, therefore, argue that as a result, under Kenyan law, the Baringo and\u000aKoibatek County Councils were - and indeed still are - obligated to give effect to the rights and interests of\u000athe Endorois as concerns the land.\u000a\u000aProperty Rights and Indigenous Communities\u000a\u000a90. The Complainants argue that both international and domestic courts have recognised that indigenous\u000agroups have a specific form of land tenure that creates a particular set of problems, which include the lack\u000aof "formal" title recognition of their historic territories, the failure of domestic legal systems to acknowledge\u000acommunal property rights, and the claiming of formal legal title to indigenous land by the colonial\u000aauthorities. They state that this situation has led to many cases of displacement from a people's historic\u000aterritory, both by the colonial authorities and post-colonial states relying on the legal title they inherited from\u000athe colonial authorities.\u000a91. In pursuing that line of reasoning, the Complainants argue that the African Commission itself has\u000arecognised the problems faced by traditional communities in the case of dispossession of their land in a\u000aReport of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities, where it states: [...] their customary\u000alaws and regulations are not recognised or respected and as national legislation in many cases does not\u000aprovide for collective titling of land. Collective tenure is fundamental to most indigenous pastoralist and\u000ahunter-gatherer communities and one of the major requests of indigenous communities is therefore the\u000arecognition and protection of collective forms of land tenure. 17\u000a92. They argue that the jurisprudence of the African Commission notes that Article 14 includes the right to\u000aproperty both individually and collectively.\u000a93. Quoting the case of The Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v Nicaragua,18 they argue that indigenous\u000aproperty rights have been legally recognised as being communal property rights, where the Inter-American\u000aCourt of Human Rights (IACtHR) recognised that the Inter-American Convention protected property rights\u000a"in a sense which includes, among others, the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the\u000aframework of communal property."19\u000a94. The Complainants further argue that the courts have addressed violations of indigenous property rights\u000astemming from colonial seizure of land, such as when modern states rely on domestic legal title inherited\u000afrom colonial authorities. They state that national courts have recognised that right. Such decisions were\u000amade by the United Kingdom Privy Council as far back as 1921,20 the Canadian Supreme Court21 and the\u000aHigh Court of Australia.22 Quoting the Richtersveld case, they argue that the South African Constitutional\u000aCourt held that the rights of a particular community survived the annexation of the land by the British Crown\u000aand could be held against the current occupiers of their land.23\u000a95. They argue that the protection accorded by Article 14 of the African Charter includes indigenous\u000aproperty rights, particularly to their ancestral lands. The Endorois' right, they argue, to the historic lands\u000aaround Lake Bogoria are therefore protected by Article 14. They aver that property rights protected go\u000abeyond those envisaged under Kenyan law and include a collective right to property.\u000a96. They argue that as a result of the actions of the Kenyan authorities, the Endorois' property has been\u000aencroached upon, in particular by the expropriation, and in turn, the effective denial of ownership of their\u000aland. They also state that the Kenyan justice system has not provided any protection of the Endorois'\u000aproperty rights. Referring to the High Court of Kenya, they argue that it stated that it could not address the\u000aissue of a community's right to property.24\u000a97. The Complainants argue that the judgment of the Kenyan High Court also stated in effect that the\u000aEndorois had lost any rights under the trust, without the need for compensation beyond the minimal\u000aamounts actually granted as costs of resettlement for 170 families. They argue that the judgment also\u000a10\u000a\u000adenies that the Endorois have rights under the trust, despite being "ordinarily resident" on the land. The\u000aCourt, they claimed, stated:\u000aWhat is in issue is a national natural resource. The law does not allow individuals to benefit from such a\u000aresource simply because they happen to be born close to the natural resource.\u000a98. They argue that in doing so, the High Court dismissed those arguments based not just on the trust, but\u000aalso on the Endorois' rights to the land as a 'people' and as a result of their historic occupation of Lake\u000aBogoria.\u000a99. The Complainants cite a number of encroachments, they claim, that go to the core of the community's\u000aidentity as a 'people', including:\u000a\u2022 the failure to provide adequate recognition and protection in domestic law of the community's rights\u000aover the land, in particular the failure of Kenyan law to acknowledge collective ownership of land;\u000a\u2022 the declaration of the game reserve in 1973/74, which purported to remove the community's\u000aremaining property rights over the land, including its rights as beneficiary of a trust under Kenyan\u000alaw;\u000a\u2022 the lack of and full compensation to the Endorois community for the loss of their ability to use and\u000abenefit from their property in the years after 1974;\u000a\u2022 the eviction of the Endorois from their land, both in the physical removal of Endorois families living\u000aon the land and the denial of the land to the rest of the Endorois community, and the resulting loss\u000aof their non-movable possessions on the land, including dwellings, religious and cultural sites and\u000abeehives;\u000a\u2022 the significant loss by the Endorois of cattle as a result of the eviction;\u000a\u2022 the denial of benefit, use of and interests in their traditional land since eviction, including the denial\u000aof any financial benefit from the lands resources, such as that generated by tourism;\u000a\u2022 the awarding of land to title to private individuals and the awarding of mining concessions on the\u000adisputed land.\u000a100. The Complainants argue that an encroachment upon property will constitute a violation of Article 14,\u000aunless it is shown that it is in the general or public interest of the community and in accordance with the\u000aprovisions of appropriate laws. They further argue that the test laid out in Article 14 of the Charter is\u000aconjunctive, that is, in order for an encroachment not to be in violation of Article 14, it must be proven that\u000athe encroachment was in the interest of the public need/general interest of the community and was carried\u000aout in accordance with appropriate laws and must be proportional. Quoting the Commission's own case\u000alaw, the Complainants argue that: 'The justification of limitations must be strictly proportionate with and\u000aabsolutely necessary for the advantages which follow.25 They argue that both the European Court of\u000aHuman Rights26 and the IACmHR have held that limitations on rights must be "proportionate and\u000areasonable." 27\u000a101. They argue that in the present communication, in the name of creating a game reserve, the Kenyan\u000aauthorities have removed the Endorois from their land, and destroyed their possessions, including houses,\u000areligious constructions, and beehives. They argue that the upheaval and displacement of an entire\u000acommunity and denial of their property rights over their ancestral lands are disproportionate to any public\u000aneed served by the game reserve. They state that even assuming that the creation of the game reserve\u000awas a legitimate aim and served a public need, it could have been accomplished by alternative means\u000aproportionate to the need.\u000a102. They further argue that the encroachment on to Endorois property rights must be carried out in\u000aaccordance with "appropriate laws" in order to avoid a violation of Article 14, and that this provision must, at\u000athe minimum mean that both Kenyan law and the relevant provisions of international law were respected.\u000aThey argue that the violation of the Endorois' rights failed to respect Kenyan law on at least three levels: (i)\u000athere was no power to expel them from the land; (ii) the trust in their favour was never legally extinguished,\u000abut simply ignored; and (iii) adequate compensation was never paid.\u000a103. The Complainants state that the traditional land of the Endorois is classified as Trust Land under\u000aSection 115 of the Constitution, and that this obliges the County Council to give effect to "such rights,\u000ainterests or other benefits in respect of the land as may under the African customary law, for the time being\u000ain force." They argue that it created a beneficial right for the Endorois over their ancestral land.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000a104. They further argue that the Kenyan Authorities created the Lake Hannington Game Reserve, including\u000athe Endorois indigenous land, on 9th November 1973, but changed the name to Lake Bogoria Game\u000aReserve in a Second Notice in 1974.28 The 1974 'Notice' was made by the Kenyan Minister for Tourism\u000aand Wildlife under the Wild Animals Protection Act (WAPA).29 WAPA, the Complainants informs the African\u000aCommission, applied to Trust Land as it did to any other land, and did not require that the land be taken out\u000aof the Trust before a game reserve could be declared over that land. They argue that the relevant\u000alegislation did not give authority for the removal of any individual or group occupying the land in a game\u000areserve. Instead, WAPA merely prohibited the hunting, killing or capturing of animals within the game\u000areserve.30 Yet, the Complainants argue, despite a lack of legal justification, the Endorois Community were\u000ainformed from 1973 onwards that they would have to leave their ancestral lands.\u000a105. Moreover, they argue, the declaration of the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve by way of the 1974 notice\u000adid not affect the status of the Endorois' land as Trust Land. The obligation of Baringo and Koibatek County\u000aCouncils to give effect to the rights and interests of the Endorois community continued. They state that the\u000aonly way under Kenyan law in which the Endorois benefits under the trust could have been dissolved is\u000athrough the County Council or the President of Kenya having to "set apart" the land. However, the Trust\u000aLand Act required that to be legal, such setting apart of the land must be published in the Kenyan\u000aGazette.31\u000a106. The Complainants argue that as far as the community is aware, no such notice was published. Until\u000athis is done, they argue, Trust Land encompassing Lake Bogoria cannot have been set apart and the\u000aAfrican customary law rights of the Endorois people continue under Kenyan law.32 They state that the\u000aKenyan High Court failed to protect the Endorois' rights under the Trust to a beneficial property right, and\u000athe instruction given to the Endorois to leave their ancestral lands was also not authorised by Kenyan law.\u000a107. They conclude that as a result, the Kenyan authorities have acted in breach of trust and not in\u000a'accordance with the provisions of the law' for the purposes of Article 14 of the Charter.\u000a108. They further argue that even if Endorois land had been set apart, Kenyan law still requires the\u000acompensation of residents of lands that are set apart; that the Kenyan Constitution states that where Trust\u000aLand is set apart, the government must ensure:\u000a[T]he prompt payment of full compensation to any resident of the land set apart who - (a) under the African\u000acustomary law for the time being in force and applicable to the land, has a right to occupy any part of the\u000aland.33\u000a109. Citing Kenyan law, the Complainants argue that the Kenyan Land Acquisition Act outlines factors that\u000ashould be considered in determining the compensation to be paid,34 starting with the basic principle that\u000acompensation should be based on the market value of the land at the time of the acquisition. Other\u000aconsiderations include: damages to the interested person caused by the removal from the land and other\u000adamages including lost earnings, relocation expenses and any diminution of profits of the land. The Land\u000aAcquisition Act provides for an additional 15% of the market value to be added to compensate for\u000adisturbances. Under Kenyan law if a court finds the amount of compensation to be insufficient, 6% interest\u000aper year must be paid on the difference owed to the interested parties.35\u000a110. They state that only 170 families of at least 400 families forced to leave Endorois traditional land by\u000athe Kenyan Authorities have received some form of monetary assistance. In 1986, 170 families evicted in\u000alate 1973 from their homes within the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve, each received around 3,150 Kshs. At\u000athe time, this was equivalent to approximately ?30.\u000a111. They state that further amounts in compensation for the value of the land lost, together with revenue\u000aand employment opportunities from the game reserve, were promised by the Kenyan authorities, but these\u000ahave never been received by the community.\u000a112. They argue that the Respondent State has itself recognised that the payment of 3,150 Kshs per family\u000aamounted only to 'relocation assistance', and did not constitute full compensation for loss of land. The\u000aComplainants argue that international law also lays down strict requirements for compensation in the case\u000aof expropriation of property.36 They argue that the fact that such payment was made some 13 years after\u000athe first eviction, and that it does not represent the market value of the land gazetted as Lake Bogoria\u000aGame Reserve, means that the Respondent State would not have paid "prompt, full compensation" as\u000arequired by the Constitution on the setting apart of the Trust Land. Therefore Kenyan law has not been\u000acomplied with. Moreover, the Complainants argue, the fact that members of the Endorois community\u000aaccepted the very limited monetary compensation does not mean that they accepted this as full\u000acompensation, or indeed that they accepted the loss of their land. They state that even if the Respondent\u000a12\u000a\u000aState had formally set apart the Trust Land by way of Gazette Notice, the test of "in accordance with the\u000aprovisions of law" required by Article 14 of the Charter would not have been satisfied, due to the payment of\u000ainadequate compensation.\u000a113. The Complainants argue that the requirement that any encroachment on property rights be in\u000aaccordance with the "appropriate laws" must also include relevant international laws. They argue that the\u000aRespondent State, including the courts, has failed to apply international law on the protection of indigenous\u000aland rights, which includes the need to recognise the collective nature of land rights, to recognise historic\u000aassociation, and to prioritise the cultural and spiritual and other links of the people to a particular territory.\u000aInstead, Kenyan law gives only limited acknowledgement to African customary law. The Trust Land system\u000ain Kenya provides in reality only minimal rights, as a trust (and therefore African customary law rights, such\u000aas those of the Endorois) can be extinguished by a simple decision of the executive. They argue that the\u000acrucial issue of recognition of the collective ownership of land by the Endorois is not acknowledged at all in\u000aKenyan law, as is clearly shown by the High Court judgment. Encroachment on the Endorois' property did\u000anot therefore comply with the appropriate international laws on indigenous peoples' rights. They state that\u000athe Endorois have also suffered significant property loss as a result of their displacement as detailed\u000aabove, including the loss of cattle, and that the only "compensation" received was the eventual provision of\u000atwo cattle dips, which does not compensate for the loss of the salt licks around the Lake or the substantial\u000aloss of traditional lands.\u000a114. They conclude that the fact that international standards on indigenous land rights and compensation\u000awere not met, as well as that provisions of Kenyan law were ignored, means that the encroachment upon\u000athe property of the Endorois community was not in accordance with the "appropriate laws" for the purposes\u000aof Article 14 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged Violations of Articles 17(2) and (3)- The Right to Culture\u000a\u000aArticles 17(2) and (3) states that: (2) Every individual may freely take part in the cultural life of his\u000acommunity. (3) The promotion and protection of morals and traditional values recognised by the community\u000ashall be the duty of the State.\u000a115. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community's cultural rights have been violated as a result\u000aof the creation of a game reserve. By restricting access to Lake Bogoria, the Kenyan authorities have\u000adenied the community access to a central element of Endorois cultural practice. After defining culture to\u000amean the sum total of the material and spiritual activities and products of a given social group that\u000adistinguishes it from other similar groups,37 they argue that the protection of Article 17 can be invoked by\u000aany group that identifies with a particular culture within a State. But they argue that it does more than that.\u000aThey argue that Article 17 extends to the protection of indigenous cultures and ways of life.\u000a116. They argue that the Endorois have suffered violations of their cultural rights on two counts. In the first\u000ainstance, the community has faced systematic restrictions on access to sites, such as the banks of Lake\u000aBogoria, which are of central significance for cultural rites and celebrations. The community's attempts to\u000aaccess their historic land for these purposes was described as "trespassing" and met with intimidation and\u000adetention. Secondly, and separately, the cultural rights of the community have been violated by the serious\u000adamage caused by the Kenyan Authorities to their pastoralist way of life.\u000a117. With mining concessions now underway in proximity to Lake Bogoria, the Complainants argue that\u000afurther threat is posed to the cultural and spiritual integrity of the ancestral land of the Endorois.\u000a118. They also argue that unlike Articles 8 and 14 of the African Charter, Article 17 does not have an\u000aexpress clause allowing restrictions on the right under certain circumstances. They state that the absence\u000aof such a clause is a strong indication that the drafters of the Charter envisaged few, if any, circumstances\u000ain which it would be appropriate to limit a people's right to culture. However, if there is any restriction, the\u000arestriction must be proportionate to a legitimate aim and in line with principles of international law on human\u000aand peoples' rights. The Complainants argue that the principle of proportionality requires that limitations be\u000athe least restrictive possible to meet the legitimate aim.\u000a119. The Complainants thus argue that even if the creation of the game reserve constitutes a legitimate\u000aaim, the Respondent State's failure to secure access by right for the celebration of the cultural festival and\u000arituals cannot be deemed proportionate to that aim.\u000a\u000a13\u000a\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 21- Rights to Free Disposition of Natural Resources\u000a\u000aArticle 21 of the Charter states that: 1) All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural\u000aresources. This right shall be exercised in the exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be\u000adeprived of it. 2) In case of spoliation the dispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of\u000aits property as well as to an adequate compensation.\u000a120. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community are unable to access the vital resources in the\u000aLake Bogoria region since their eviction from the game reserve. The medicinal salt licks and fertile soil that\u000akept the community's cattle healthy are now out of the community's reach. Mining concessions to Endorois\u000aland have been granted without giving the Endorois a share in these resources. Consequently, the\u000aEndorois suffer a violation of Article 21: Right to Natural Resources.\u000a121. They argue that in the Ogoni Case (2001), paras 56-58 the right to natural resources contained within\u000atheir traditional land was vested in the indigenous people and that a people inhabiting a specific region\u000awithin a State can claim the protection of Article 21.38 They argue that the right to freely dispose of natural\u000aresources is of crucial importance to indigenous peoples and their way of life. They quote from the report of\u000athe African Commission's Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities which states:\u000aDispossession of land and natural resources is a major human rights problem for indigenous peoples ...\u000a.The establishment of protected areas and national parks has impoverished indigenous pastoralist and\u000ahunter-gatherer communities, made them vulnerable and unable to cope with environmental uncertainty\u000aand, in many cases, even displaced them ... This [the loss of fundamental natural resources] is a serious\u000aviolation of the African Charter (Article 21(1) and (2)), which states clearly that all peoples have the right to\u000anatural resources, wealth and property.39\u000a122. Citing the African Charter, the Complainants argue that the Charter creates two distinct rights to both\u000aproperty (Article 14) and the free disposal of wealth and natural resources (Article 21). They argue that in\u000athe context of traditional land, the two rights are very closely linked and violated in similar ways. They state\u000athat Article 21 of the African Charter is, however, wider in its scope than Article 14, and requires respect for\u000aa people's right to use natural resources, even where a people does not have title to the land.\u000a123. The Complainants point out that the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.10 states that: "Particular\u000aattention should be given to the rights of indigenous peoples to use and develop the lands that they occupy,\u000ato be protected against illegal intruders, and to have access to natural resources (such as forests, wildlife,\u000aand water) vital to their subsistence and reproduction." 40\u000a124. They state that the Endorois as a people enjoy the protection of Article 21 with respect to Lake\u000aBogoria and the wealth and natural resources arising from it. They argue that for the Endorois, the natural\u000aresources include traditional medicines made from herbs found around the lake and the resources, such as\u000asalt licks and fertile soil, which provided support for their cattle and therefore their pastoralist way of life.\u000aThese, the Complainants argue, were natural resources from which the community benefited before their\u000aeviction from their traditional land. In addition, Article 21 also protects the right of the community to the\u000apotential wealth of their land, including tourism, rubies, and other possible resources. They state that since\u000atheir eviction from Lake Bogoria, the Endorois, in violation of Article 21, have been denied unhindered\u000aaccess to the land and its natural resources, as they can no longer benefit from the natural resources and\u000apotential wealth, including that generated by recent exploitation of the land, such as the revenues and\u000aemployment created by the game reserve and the product of mining operations.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 22- The Right to Development\u000a\u000aArticle 22 of the African Charter states that: All peoples shall have the right to their economic, social and\u000acultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the\u000acommon heritage of mankind.\u000a125. On the issue of the right to development, the Complainants argue that the Endorois' right to\u000adevelopment has been violated as a result of the Respondent State's failure to adequately involve the\u000aEndorois in the development process and the failure to ensure the continued improvement of the Endorois\u000acommunity's well-being.\u000a\u000a14\u000a\u000a126. The Complainants argue that the Endorois have seen the set of choices and capabilities open to them\u000ashrink since their eviction from the game reserve. They argue that due to the lack of access to the lake, the\u000asalt licks and their usual pasture, the cattle of the Endorois died in large numbers. Consequently, they were\u000anot able to pay their taxes and, as a result, the Kenyan Authorities took away more cattle.\u000a127. They stress the point that the Endorois had no choice but to leave the lake. They argue that this lack\u000aof choice for the community directly contradicts the guarantees of the right to development. They state that\u000aif the Kenyan authorities had been providing the right to development as promised by the African Charter,\u000athe development of the game reserve would have increased the capabilities of the Endorois.\u000a128. Citing the Ogoni Case, para. 46, the Complainants argue that the African Commission has noted the\u000aimportance of choice to well-being. They state that the African Commission noted that the state must\u000arespect rights holders and the "liberty of their action."41 They argue that the liberty recognised by the\u000aCommission is tantamount to the choice embodied in the right to development. By recognising such liberty,\u000athey argue, the African Commission has started to embrace the right to development as a choice.\u000aElaborating further on the right to development, they argue that the same 'liberty of action' principle can be\u000aapplied to the Endorois community in the instant communication.\u000a129. They argue that choice and self-determination also include the ability to dispose of natural resources\u000aas a community wishes, thereby requiring a measure of control over the land. They further argue that for\u000athe Endorois, the ability to use the salt licks, water, and soil of the Lake Bogoria area has been eliminated,\u000aundermining this partner (the Endorois community) of self-determination. In that regard, the Complainants\u000aargue, it is clear that development should be understood as an increase in peoples' well-being, as\u000ameasured by capacities and choices available. The realisation of the right to development, they say,\u000arequires the improvement and increase in capacities and choices. They argue that the Endorois have\u000asuffered a loss of well-being through the limitations on their choice and capacities, including effective and\u000ameaningful participation in projects that will affect them.\u000a130. Citing the Human Rights Committee (HRC), they argue that the Committee addressed the\u000aeffectiveness of consultation procedures in Mazurka v. New Zealand.42 The Complainants argue that the\u000aHRC found that the broad consultation process undertaken by New Zealand had effectively provided for the\u000aparticipation of the Maori people in determining fishing rights. The New Zealand authorities had negotiated\u000awith Maori representatives and then allowed the resulting Memorandum of Understanding to be debated\u000aextensively by Maoris throughout the country.43 The Complainants argue that the Committee specifically\u000anoted that the consultation procedure addressed the cultural and religious significance of fishing to the\u000aMaori people, and that the Maori representatives were able to affect the terms of the final settlement.\u000a131. The inadequacy of the consultations undertaken by the Kenyan authorities, the Complainants argue, is\u000aunderscored by Endorois actions after the creation of the game reserve. The Complainants inform the\u000aAfrican Commission that the Endorois believed, and continue to believe even after their eviction, that the\u000agame reserve and their pastoralist way of life would not be mutually exclusive and that they would have a\u000aright of re-entry into their land. They assert that in failing to understand the reasons for their permanent\u000aeviction, many families did not leave the location until 1986.\u000a132. They argue that the course of action left the Endorois feeling disenfranchised from a process of utmost\u000aimportance to their life as a people. Resentment of the unfairness with which they had been treated\u000ainspired some members of the community to try to reclaim Mochongoi Forest in 1974 and 1984, meet with\u000athe President to discuss the matter in 1994 and 1995, and protest the actions in peaceful demonstrations.\u000aThey state that if consultations had been conducted in a manner that effectively involved the Endorois,\u000athere would have been no ensuing confusion as to their rights or resentment that their consent had been\u000awrongfully gained.\u000a133. They further say that the requirement of prior, informed consent has also been delineated in the case\u000alaw of the IACmHR. Referring the African Commission to the case of Mary and Carrie Dan v. USA, they\u000aargue that the IACmHR noted that convening meetings with the community 14 years after title\u000aextinguishment proceedings began constituted neither prior nor effective participation.44 They state that to\u000ahave a process of consent that is fully informed "requires at a minimum that all of the members of the\u000acommunity are fully and accurately informed of the nature and consequences of the process and provided\u000awith an effective opportunity to participate individually or as collectives."45\u000a134. The Complainants are also of the view that the Respondent State violated the Endorois' right to\u000adevelopment by engaging in coercive and intimidating activity that has abrogated the community's right to\u000ameaningful participation and freely given consent. They state that such coercion has continued to the\u000apresent day. The Complainants say that Mr Charles Kamuren, the Chair of the Endorois Welfare Council,\u000a15\u000a\u000ahad informed the African Commission of details of threats and harassment he and his family and other\u000amembers of the community have received, especially when they objected to the issue of the granting of\u000amining concessions.\u000a135. The Complainants further argue that the Endorois have been excluded from participating or sharing in\u000athe benefits of development. They argue that the Respondent State did not embrace a rights-based\u000aapproach to economic growth, which insists on development in a manner consistent with, and instrumental\u000ato, the realisation of human rights and the right to development through adequate and prior consultation.\u000aThey assert that the Endorois' development as a people has suffered economically, socially and culturally.\u000aThey further conclude that the Endorois community suffered a violation of Article 22 of the Charter.\u000aRespondent State Submissions on Merits\u000a\u000a136. In response to the brief submitted by the Complainants on the Merits including the amicus curiae Brief\u000aby COHRE, the Respondent State, the Republic of Kenya, submitted its reply on the merits of the\u000acommunication to the African Commission.\u000a137. The arguments below are the submissions of the Respondent State, taking into consideration their\u000aoral testimony at the 40th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, all their written submissions,\u000aincluding letters, supporting affidavits, video evidence and the 'Respondents Submissions and Further\u000aClarifications Arising Out of the Questions by the Commissioners During the Merits Hearing of the\u000aCommunication'.\u000a138. The Respondent State argues that most of the tribes do not reside in their ancestral lands owing to\u000amovements made due to a number of factors, including search for pastures for their livestock; search for\u000aarable land to carry out agriculture; relocation by government to facilitate development; creation of irrigation\u000aschemes, national parks, game reserves, forests and extraction of natural resources, such as minerals.\u000a139. The Respondent State argues that it has instituted a programme for universal free primary education\u000aand an agricultural recovery programme, which aims at increasing the household income of the rural poor,\u000aincluding the Endorois. It states that it has not only initiated programmes for the equitable distribution of\u000abudgetary resources, but has also formulated an economic recovery strategy for wealth and employment\u000acreation, which seeks to eradicate poverty and secure the economic and social rights of the poor and the\u000amarginalised, including the Endorois.\u000a140. The Respondent State argues that the land around the Lake Bogoria area is occupied by the Tugen\u000atribe, which comprises four clans:\u000a141. The Endorois - who have settled around Mangot, Mochongoi and Tangulmbei; The Lebus - who have\u000asettled around Koibatek District; The Somor - who live around Maringati, Sacho, Tenges and Kakarnet;\u000aand, The Alor - living around Kaborchayo, Paratapwa, Kipsalalar and Buluwesa.\u000a142. The Respondent State argues that all the clans co-exist in one geographical area. It states that it is\u000anoteworthy that they all share the same language and names, which means that they have a lot in\u000acommon. The Respondent State disputes that the Endorois are indeed a community / sub-tribe or clan on\u000atheir own, and it argues that it is incumbent on the Complainants to prove that the Endorois are distinct\u000afrom the other Tugen sub-tribe or indeed the larger Kalenjin tribe before they can proceed to make a case\u000abefore the African Commission.\u000a143. The Respondent State maintains that following the Declaration of the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve,\u000athe government embarked on a re-settlement exercise, culminating in the resettlement of the majority of the\u000aEndorois in the Mochongoi settlement scheme. It argues that this was over and above the compensation\u000apaid to the Endorois after their ancestral land around lake was gazetted. It further states that there is no\u000asuch thing as Mochongoi Forest in Kenya and the only forest in the area is Ol Arabel Forest.\u000aDecision on Merits\u000a\u000a144. The present communication alleges that the Respondent State has violated the human rights of the\u000aEndorois community, an indigenous people, by forcibly removing them from their ancestral land, the failure\u000ato adequately compensate them for the loss of their property, the disruption of the community's pastoral\u000aenterprise and violations of the right to practice their religion and culture, as well as the overall process of\u000adevelopment of the Endorois people.\u000a145. Before addressing the articles alleged to have been violated, the Respondent State has requested the\u000aAfrican Commission to determine whether the Endorois can be recognised as a 'community'/sub-tribe or\u000aclan on their own. The Respondent State disputes that the Endorois are a distinct community in need of\u000a16\u000a\u000aspecial protection. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants need to prove this distinction from\u000athe Tugen sub-tribe or indeed the larger Kalenjin tribe. The immediate questions that the African\u000aCommission needs to address itself to are:\u000a146. Are the Endorois a distinct community? Are they indigenous peoples and thereby needing special\u000aprotection? If they are a distinct community, what makes them different from the Tugen sub-tribe or indeed\u000athe larger Kalenjin tribe?\u000a147. Before responding to the above questions, the African Commission notes that the concepts of\u000a"peoples" and "indigenous peoples/communities" are contested terms.46 As far as "indigenous peoples"are\u000aconcerned, there is no universal and unambiguous definition of the concept, since no single accepted\u000adefinition captures the diversity of indigenous cultures, histories and current circumstances. The\u000arelationships between indigenous peoples and dominant or mainstream groups in society vary from country\u000ato country. The same is true of the concept of "peoples." The African Commission is thus aware of the\u000apolitical connotation that these concepts carry. Those controversies led the drafters of the African Charter\u000ato deliberately refrain from proposing any definitions for the notion of "people(s)."]>47 In its Report of the\u000aWorking Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities,48 the African Commission describes its\u000adilemma of defining the concept of "peoples" in the following terms:\u000aDespite its mandate to interpret all provisions of the African Charter as per Article 45(3), the African\u000aCommission initially shied away from interpreting the concept of 'peoples'. The African Charter itself does\u000anot define the concept. Initially the African Commission did not feel at ease in developing rights where there\u000awas little concrete international jurisprudence. The ICCPR and the ICESR do not define 'peoples.' It is\u000aevident that the drafters of the African Charter intended to distinguish between the traditional individual\u000arights where the sections preceding Article 17 make reference to "every individual." Article 18 serves as a\u000abreak by referring to the family. Articles 19 to 24 make specific reference to "all peoples."\u000a148. The African Commission, nevertheless, notes that while the terms 'peoples' and 'indigenous\u000acommunity' arouse emotive debates, some marginalised and vulnerable groups in Africa are suffering from\u000aparticular problems. It is aware that many of these groups have not been accommodated by dominating\u000adevelopment paradigms and in many cases they are being victimised by mainstream development policies\u000aand thinking and their basic human rights violated. The African Commission is also aware that indigenous\u000apeoples have, due to past and ongoing processes, become marginalised in their own country and they\u000aneed recognition and protection of their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u000a149. The African Commission also notes that normatively, the African Charter is an innovative and unique\u000ahuman rights document compared to other regional human rights instruments, in placing special emphasis\u000aon the rights of "peoples."49 It substantially departs from the narrow formulations of other regional and\u000auniversal human rights instruments by weaving a tapestry which includes the three "generations" of rights:\u000acivil and political rights; economic, social, and cultural rights; and group and peoples' rights. In that regard,\u000athe African Commission notes its own observation that the term "indigenous" is also not intended to create\u000aa special class of citizens, but rather to address historical and present-day injustices and inequalities. This\u000ais the sense in which the term has been applied in the African context by the Working Group on Indigenous\u000aPopulations/Communities of the African Commission.50 In the context of the African Charter, the Working\u000aGroup notes that the notion of "peoples" is closely related to collective rights.51\u000a150. The African Commission also notes that the African Charter, in Articles 20 through 24, provides for\u000apeoples to retain rights as peoples, that is, as collectives. 52 The African Commission through its Working\u000aGroup of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities has set out four criteria for identifying indigenous\u000apeoples. 53 These are: the occupation and use of a specific territory; the voluntary perpetuation of cultural\u000adistinctiveness; self-identification as a distinct collectivity, as well as recognition by other groups; an\u000aexperience of subjugation, marginalisation, dispossession, exclusion or discrimination. The Working Group\u000aalso demarcated some of the shared characteristics of African indigenous groups:\u000a... first and foremost (but not exclusively) different groups of hunter-gatherers or former hunter-gatherers\u000aand certain groups of pastoralists... ??? A key characteristic for most of them is that the survival of their\u000aparticular way of life depends on access and rights to their traditional land and the natural resources\u000athereon. 54\u000a151. The African Commission is thus aware that there is an emerging consensus on some objective\u000afeatures that a collective of individuals should manifest to be considered as "peoples", viz: a common\u000ahistorical tradition, racial or ethnic identity, cultural homogeneity, linguistic unity, religious and ideological\u000a17\u000a\u000aaffinities, territorial connection, and a common economic life or other bonds, identities and affinities they\u000acollectively enjoy - especially rights enumerated under Articles 19 to 24 of the African Charter - or suffer\u000acollectively from the deprivation of such rights. What is clear is that all attempts to define the concept of\u000aindigenous peoples recognise the linkages between peoples, their land, and culture and that such a group\u000aexpresses its desire to be identified as a people or have the consciousness that they are a people.55\u000a152. As far as the present matter is concerned, the African Commission is also enjoined under Article 61 of\u000athe African Charter to be inspired by other subsidiary sources of international law or general principles in\u000adetermining rights under the African Charter.56 It takes note of the working definition proposed by the UN\u000aWorking Group on Indigenous Populations:\u000a... that indigenous peoples are ...those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and\u000apre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of\u000athe societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant\u000asectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their\u000aancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in\u000aaccordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.57\u000a153. But this working definition should be read in conjunction with the 2003 Report of the African\u000aCommission's Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities, which is the basis of its\u000a'definition' of indigenous populations.58 Similarly it notes that the International Labour Organisation has\u000aproffered a definition of indigenous peoples in Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal\u000aPeoples in Independent Countries:59\u000aPeoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the\u000apopulations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time\u000aof conquest or colonization or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their\u000alegal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.60\u000a154. The African Commission is also aware that though some indigenous populations might be first\u000ainhabitants, validation of rights is not automatically afforded to such pre-invasion and pre-colonial claims. In\u000aterms of ILO Convention 169, even though many African countries have not signed and ratified the said\u000aConvention, and like the UN Working Groups' conceptualisation of the term, the African Commission notes\u000athat there is a common thread that runs through all the various criteria that attempts to describe indigenous\u000apeoples - that indigenous peoples have an unambiguous relationship to a distinct territory and that all\u000aattempts to define the concept recognise the linkages between people, their land, and culture. In that\u000aregard, the African Commission notes the observation of the UN Special Rapporteur, where he states that\u000ain Kenya indigenous populations/communities include pastoralist communities such as the Endorois,61\u000aBorana, Gabra, Maasai, Pokot, Samburu, Turkana, and Somali, and hunter-gatherer communities whose\u000alivelihoods remain connected to the forest, such as the Awer (Boni), Ogiek, Sengwer, or Yaaku. The UN\u000aSpecial Rapporteur further observed that the Endorois community have lived for centuries in their traditional\u000aterritory around Lake Bogoria, which was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1973.62\u000a155. In the present communication the African Commission wishes to emphasise that the Charter\u000arecognises the rights of peoples.63 The Complainants argue that the Endorois are a people, a status that\u000aentitles them to benefit from provisions of the African Charter that protect collective rights. The Respondent\u000aState disagrees.64 The African Commission notes that the Constitution of Kenya, though incorporating the\u000aprinciple of non-discrimination and guaranteeing civil and political rights, does not recognise economic,\u000asocial and cultural rights as such, as well as group rights. It further notes that the rights of indigenous\u000apastoralist and hunter-gatherer communities are not recognised as such in Kenya's constitutional and legal\u000aframework, and no policies or governmental institutions deal directly with indigenous issues. It also notes\u000athat while Kenya has ratified most international human rights treaties and conventions, it has not ratified\u000aILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, and it has withheld its\u000aapproval of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of the General Assembly.\u000a156. After studying all the submissions of the Complainants and the Respondent State, the African\u000aCommission is of the view that Endorois culture, religion, and traditional way of life are intimately\u000aintertwined with their ancestral lands - Lake Bogoria and the surrounding area. It agrees that Lake Bogoria\u000aand the Monchongoi Forest are central to the Endorois' way of life and without access to their ancestral\u000aland, the Endorois are unable to fully exercise their cultural and religious rights, and feel disconnected from\u000atheir land and ancestors.\u000a18\u000a\u000a157. In addition to a sacred relationship to their land, self-identification is another important criterion for\u000adetermining indigenous peoples.65 The UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\u000aof Indigenous People also supports self-identification as a key criterion for determining who is indeed\u000aindigenous.66 The African Commission is aware that today many indigenous peoples are still excluded from\u000asociety and often even deprived of their rights as equal citizens of a state. Nevertheless, many of these\u000acommunities are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral\u000aterritories and their ethnic identity. It accepts the arguments that the continued existence of indigenous\u000acommunities as 'peoples' is closely connected to the possibility of them influencing their own fate and to\u000aliving in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and religious systems.67 The African\u000aCommission further notes that the Report of the African Commission's Working Group of Experts on\u000aIndigenous Populations/Communities (WGIP) emphasises that peoples' self-identification is an important\u000aingredient to the concept of peoples' rights as laid out in the Charter. It agrees that the alleged violations of\u000athe African Charter by the Respondent State are those that go to the heart of indigenous rights - the right to\u000apreserve one's identity through identification with ancestral lands, cultural patterns, social institutions and\u000areligious systems. The African Commission, therefore, accepts that self-identification for Endorois as\u000aindigenous individuals and acceptance as such by the group is an essential component of their sense of\u000aidentity.68\u000a158. Furthermore, in drawing inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights, the African\u000aCommission notes that the IACtHR has dealt with cases of self-identification where Afro-descendent\u000acommunities were living in a collective manner, and had, for over 2-3 centuries, developed an ancestral link\u000ato their land. Moreover, the way of life of these communities depended heavily on the traditional use of their\u000aland, as did their cultural and spiritual survival due to the existence of ancestral graves on these lands.69\u000a159. The African Commission notes that while it has already accepted the existence of indigenous peoples\u000ain Africa through its WGIP reports, and through the adoption of its Advisory Opinion on the UN Declaration\u000aon the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it notes the fact that the Inter-American Court has not hesitated in\u000agranting the collective rights protection to groups beyond the "narrow/aboriginal/pre-Colombian"\u000aunderstanding of indigenous peoples traditionally adopted in the Americas. In that regard, the African\u000aCommission notes two relevant decisions from the IACtHR: Moiwana v Suriname70 and Saramaka v\u000aSuriname. The Saramaka case is of particular relevance to the Endorois case, given the views expressed\u000aby the Respondent State during the oral hearings on the Merits.71\u000a160. In the Saramaka case, according to the evidence submitted by the Complainants, the Saramaka\u000apeople are one of six distinct Maroon groups in Suriname whose ancestors were African slaves forcibly\u000ataken to Suriname during the European colonisation in the 17th century. The IACtHR considered that the\u000aSaramaka people make up a tribal community whose social, cultural and economic characteristics are\u000adifferent from other sections of the national community, particularly because of their special relationship\u000awith their ancestral territories, and because they regulate themselves, at least partially, by their own norms,\u000acustoms, and/or traditions.\u000a161. Like the State of Suriname, the Respondent State (Kenya) in the instant communication is arguing that\u000athe inclusion of the Endorois in 'modern society' has affected their cultural distinctiveness, such that it\u000awould be difficult to define them as a distinct group that is very different from the Tugen sub-tribe or indeed\u000athe larger Kalenjin tribe, that is, the Respondent State is questioning whether the Endorois can be defined\u000ain a way that takes into account the different degrees to which various members of the Endorois community\u000aadhere to traditional laws, customs, and economy, particularly those living within the Lake Bogoria area. In\u000athe Saramaka case, the IACtHR disagreed with the State of Suriname that the Saramaka could not be\u000aconsidered a distinct group of people just because a few members do not identify with the larger group. In\u000athe instant case, the African Commission, from all the evidence submitted to it, is satisfied that the Endorois\u000acan be defined as a distinct tribal group whose members enjoy and exercise certain rights, such as the right\u000ato property, in a distinctly collective manner from the Tugen sub-tribe or indeed the larger Kalenjin tribe.\u000a162. The IACtHR also noted that the fact that some individual members of the Saramaka community may\u000alive outside of the traditional Saramaka territory and in a way that may differ from other Saramakas who live\u000awithin the traditional territory and in accordance with Saramaka customs does not affect the distinctiveness\u000aof this tribal group, nor its communal use and enjoyment of their property. In the case of the Endorois, the\u000aAfrican Commission is of the view that the question of whether certain members of the community may\u000aassert certain communal rights on behalf of the group is a question that must be resolved by the Endorois\u000athemselves in accordance with their own traditional customs and norms and not by the State. The Endorois\u000acannot be denied a right to juridical personality just because there is a lack of individual identification with\u000a19\u000a\u000athe traditions and laws of the Endorois by some members of the community.\u000aFrom all the evidence (both oral and written and video testimony) submitted to the African Commission, the\u000aAfrican Commission agrees that the Endorois are an indigenous community and that they fulfil the criterion\u000aof 'distinctiveness.' The African Commission agrees that the Endorois consider themselves to be a distinct\u000apeople, sharing a common history, culture and religion. The African Commission is satisfied that the\u000aEndorois are a "people", a status that entitles them to benefit from provisions of the African Charter that\u000aprotect collective rights. The African Commission is of the view that the alleged violations of the African\u000aCharter are those that go to the heart of indigenous rights - the right to preserve one's identity through\u000aidentification with ancestral lands.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 8\u000a\u000a163. The Complainants allege that Endorois' right to freely practice their religion has been violated by the\u000aRespondent State's action of evicting the Endorois from their land, and refusing them access to Lake\u000aBogoria and other surrounding religious sites. They further allege that the Respondent State's has\u000ainterfered with the Endorois' ability to practice and worship as their faith dictates; that religious sites within\u000athe game reserve have not been properly demarcated and protected and since their eviction from the Lake\u000aBogoria area, the Endorois have not been able to freely practice their religion. They claim that access as of\u000aright for religious rituals - such as circumcisions, marital rituals, and initiation rights - has been denied the\u000acommunity. Similarly, they state that the Endorois have not been able to hold or participate in their most\u000asignificant annual religious ritual, which occurs when the lake undergoes seasonal changes.\u000a164. The Complainants further argue that the Endorois have neither been able to practice the prayers and\u000aceremonies that are intimately connected to the lake, nor have they been able to freely visit the spiritual\u000ahome of all Endorois, living and dead. They argue that the Endorois' spiritual beliefs and ceremonial\u000apractices constitute a religion under international law. They point out that the term "religion" in international\u000ahuman rights instruments covers various religious and spiritual beliefs and should be broadly interpreted.\u000aThey argue that the HRC states that the right to freedom of religion in the International Covenant on Civil\u000aand Political Rights (ICCPR):\u000aprotects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.\u000aThe terms 'belief' and 'religion' are to be broadly construed. Article 18 is not limited in its application to\u000atraditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics or practices analogous to\u000athose of traditional religions.72\u000aTo rebut the allegation of a violation of Article 8 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\u000athe Complainants have failed to show that the action of the government to gazette the game reserve for\u000apurposes of conserving the environment and wildlife and to a great extent the Complainants' cultural\u000agrounds fails the test of the Constitution of reasonableness and justifiability. It argues that through the\u000agazetting of various areas as protected areas, National Parks or Game Reserves or falling under the\u000aNational Museums, it has been possible to conserve some of the areas which are threatened by\u000aencroachment due to modernisation. The Respondent State argues that some of these areas include\u000a'Kayas' (forests used as religious ritual grounds by communities from the coast province of Kenya) which\u000ahas been highly effective while the communities have continued to access these grounds without fear of\u000aencroachment.\u000a165. Before deciding whether the Respondent State has indeed violated Article 8 of the Charter, the\u000aCommission wishes to establish whether the Endorois' spiritual beliefs and ceremonial practices constitute\u000aa religion under the African Charter and international law. In that regard, the African Commission notes the\u000aobservation of the HRC in paragraph 164 (above). It is of the view that freedom of conscience and religion\u000ashould, among other things, mean the right to worship, engage in rituals, observe days of rest, and wear\u000areligious garb.73 The African Commission notes its own observation in Free Legal Assistance Group v.\u000aZaire, that it has held that the right to freedom of conscience allows for individuals or groups to worship or\u000aassemble in connection with a religion or belief, and to establish and maintain places for these purposes,\u000aas well as to celebrate ceremonies in accordance with the precepts of one's religion or belief.74\u000a166. This Commission is aware that religion is often linked to land, cultural beliefs and practices, and that\u000afreedom to worship and engage in such ceremonial acts is at the centre of the freedom of religion. The\u000aEndorois' cultural and religious practices are centred around Lake Bogoria and are of prime significance to\u000a20\u000a\u000aall Endorois. During oral testimony, and indeed in the Complainants' written submission, this Commission's\u000aattention was drawn to the fact that religious sites are situated around Lake Bogoria, where the Endorois\u000apray and where religious ceremonies regularly take place. It takes into cognisance that Endorois' ancestors\u000aare buried near the lake, and has already above, Lake Bogoria is considered the spiritual home of all\u000aEndorois, living and dead.\u000a167. It further notes that one of the beliefs of the Endorois is that their Great Ancestor, Dorios, came from\u000athe Heavens and settled in the Mochongoi Forest.75 It notes the Complainants' arguments, which have not\u000abeen contested by the Respondent State that the Endorois believe that each season the water of the Lake\u000aturns red and the hot springs emit a strong odour, signalling a time that the community performs traditional\u000aceremonies to appease the ancestors who drowned with the formation of the Lake.\u000a168. From the above analysis, the African Commission is of the view that the Endorois spiritual beliefs and\u000aceremonial practices constitute a religion under the African Charter.\u000a169. The African Commission will now determine whether the Respondent State by its actions or inactions\u000ahave interfered with the Endorois' right to religious freedom.\u000a170. The Respondent State has not denied that the Endorois' have been removed from their ancestral land\u000athey call home. The Respondent State has merely advanced reasons why the Endorois can no longer stay\u000awithin the Lake Bogoria area. The Complainants argue that the Endorois' inability to practice their religion is\u000aa direct result of their expulsion from their land and that since their eviction the Endorois have not been\u000aable to freely practice their religion, as access for religious rituals has been denied the community.\u000a171. It is worth noting that in Amnesty International v. Sudan, the African Commission recognised the\u000acentrality of practice to religious freedom.76 The African Commission noted that the State Party violated the\u000aauthors' right to practice their religion, because non-Muslims did not have the right to preach or build their\u000achurches and were subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, and expulsion. The African Commission also\u000anotes the case of Loren Laroye Riebe Star from the IACmHR, which determined that expulsion from lands\u000acentral to the practice of religion constitutes a violation of religious freedoms. It notes that the Court held\u000athat the expulsion of priests from the Chiapas area was a violation of the right to associate freely for\u000areligious purposes.77\u000a172. The African Commission agrees that in some situations it may be necessary to place some form of\u000alimited restrictions on a right protected by the African Charter. But such a restriction must be established by\u000alaw and must not be applied in a manner that would completely vitiate the right. It notes the\u000arecommendation of the HRC that limitations may be applied only for those purposes for which they were\u000aprescribed and must be directly related and proportionate to the specific need on which they are\u000apredicated.78 The raison d'?tre for a particularly harsh limitation on the right to practice religion, such as that\u000aexperienced by the Endorois, must be based on exceptionally good reasons, and it is for the Respondent\u000aState to prove that such interference is not only proportionate to the specific need on which they are\u000apredicated, but is also reasonable. In the case of Amnesty International v. Sudan, the African Commission\u000astated that a wide-ranging ban on Christian associations was "disproportionate to the measures required by\u000athe government to maintain public order, security, and safety." The African Commission further went on to\u000astate that any restrictions placed on the rights to practice one's religion should be negligible. In the above\u000amentioned case, the African Commission decided that complete and total expulsion from the land for\u000areligious ceremonies is not minimal.79\u000a173. The African Commission is of the view that denying the Endorois access to the Lake is a restriction on\u000atheir freedom to practice their religion, a restriction not necessitated by any significant public security\u000ainterest or other justification. The African Commission is also not convinced that removing the Endorois\u000afrom their ancestral land was a lawful action in pursuit of economic development or ecological protection.\u000aThe African Commission is of the view that allowing the Endorois to use the land to practice their religion\u000awould not detract from the goal of conservation or developing the area for economic reasons.\u000aThe African Commission therefore finds against the Respondent State a violation of Article 8 of the African\u000aCharter. The African Commission is of the view that the Endorois' forced eviction from their ancestral lands\u000aby the Respondent State interfered with the Endorois' right to religious freedom and removed them from the\u000asacred grounds essential to the practice of their religion, and rendered it virtually impossible for the\u000acommunity to maintain religious practices central to their culture and religion. The African Commission is of\u000athe view that the limitations placed on the State's duties to protect rights should be viewed in light of the\u000aunderlying sentiments of the African Charter. This was the view of the Commission, in Amnesty\u000aInternational v. Zambia, where it noted that the 'claw-back' clauses must not be interpreted against the\u000a21\u000a\u000aprinciples of the Charter ... and that recourse to these should not be used as a means of giving credence to\u000aviolations of the express provisions of the Charter."80\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 14\u000a\u000a174. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community have a right to property with regard to their\u000aancestral land, the possessions attached to it, and their cattle. The Respondent State denies the allegation.\u000a175. The Respondent State further argues that the land in question fell under the definition of Trust Land\u000aand was administered by the Baringo County Council for the benefit of all the people who were ordinarily\u000aresident in their jurisdiction which comprised mainly the four Tugen tribes. It argues that Trust Land is not\u000aonly established under the Constitution of Kenya and administered under an act of Parliament, but that the\u000aConstitution of Kenya provides that Trust Land may be alienated through registration to another person\u000aother than the County Council; an Act of Parliament providing for the County Council to set apart an area of\u000aTrust Land vested in it for use and occupation of public body or authority for public purposes; person or\u000apersons or purposes which, in the opinion of the Council, is likely to benefit the persons ordinarily resident\u000ain that area; by the President in consultation with the Council. It argues that Trust Land may be set apart as\u000agovernment land for government purposes or private land.\u000a176. The Respondent State argues that when Trust Land is set apart for whatever purpose, the interest or\u000aother benefits in respect of that land that was previously vested in any tribe, group, family or individual\u000aunder African customary law are extinguished. It, however, states that the Constitution and the Trust Land\u000aAct provide for adequate and prompt compensation for all residents. The Respondent State, in both its oral\u000aand written submissions, is arguing that the Trust Land Act provides a comprehensive procedure for\u000aassessment of compensation where the Endorois should have applied to the District Commissioner and\u000alodged an appeal if they were dissatisfied. The Respondent State further argues that the Endorois have a\u000aright of access to the High Court of Kenya by the Constitution to determine whether their rights have been\u000aviolated.\u000a177. According to the Respondent State, with the creation of more local authorities, the land in question\u000anow comprises parts of Baringo and Koibatek County Councils, and through Gazette Notice No 239 of\u000a1973, the land was first set apart as Lake Hannington Game Reserve, which was later revoked by Gazette\u000aNotice No 270 of 1974, where the Game Reserve was renamed Lake Baringo Game Reserve, and the\u000aboundaries and purpose of setting apart this area specified in the Gazette Notices as required by the Trust\u000aLand Act. It argues that the Government offered adequate and prompt compensation to the affected\u000apeople, "a fact which the Applicants agree with."81\u000a178. In its oral and written testimonies, the Respondent State argues that the gazettement of a game\u000areserve under the wildlife laws of Kenya is with the objective of ensuring that wildlife is managed and\u000aconserved to yield to the nation in general and to individual areas in particular optimum returns in terms of\u000acultural, aesthetic and scientific gains as well as economic gains as are incidental to proper wildlife\u000amanagement and conservation. The Respondent State also argues that national reserves unlike national\u000aparks, where the act expressly excludes human interference save for instances where one has got\u000aauthorisation, are subject to agreements as to restrictions or conditions relating to the provisions of the area\u000acovered by the reserve. It also states that communities living around the national reserves have in some\u000ainstances been allowed to drive their cattle to the reserve for the purposes of grazing, so long as they do\u000anot cause harm to the environment and the natural habitats of the wild animals. It states that with the\u000aestablishment of a national reserve particularly from Trust Land, it is apparent that the community's right of\u000aaccess is not extinguished, but rather its propriety right as recognised under the law (that is, the right to\u000adeal with property as it pleases) is the one which is minimised and hence the requirement to compensate\u000athe affected people.\u000a179. Rebutting the claim of the Complainants that the Kenyan authorities prevented them from occupying\u000atheir other ancestral land, Muchongoi Forest, the Respondent State argued that the land in question was\u000agazetted as a forest in 1941, by the name of Ol Arabel Forest, which means that the land ceased being\u000acommunal land by virtue of the gazettement. It states that some excisions have been made from the Ol\u000aArablel Forest to create the Muchongoi Settlement Scheme to settle members of the four Tungen tribes of\u000athe Baringo district, one of which is the Endorois.\u000a180. The Respondent State also argues that it has also gone a step further to formulate "Rules", namely\u000athe "The Forests (Tugen-Kamasia) Rules" to enable the inhabitants of the Baringo Duistrict, including the\u000aEndorois to enjoy some privileges through access to the Ol Arabel Forest for some purposes. The Rules, it\u000a22\u000a\u000astates, allow the community to collect dead wood for firewood, pick wild berries and fruits, take or collect\u000athe bark of dead trees for thatching beehives, cut and remove creepers and lianes for building purposes,\u000atake stock, including goats, to such watering places within the Central Forests as may be approved by the\u000aDistrict Commissioner in consultation with the Forest Officer, enter the Forest for the purpose of holding\u000acustomary ceremonies and rites, but no damage shall be done to any tree, graze sheep within the Forest,\u000agraze cattle for specified periods during the dry season with the written permission of the District\u000aCommissioner or the Forest Officer and to retain or construct huts within the Forest by approved forest\u000acultivators among others.\u000a181. The Respondent State argues further that the above Rules ensure that the livelihoods of the\u000acommunity are not compromised by the gazettement, in the sense that the people could obtain food and\u000abuilding materials, as well as run some economic activities such as beekeeping and grazing livestock in the\u000aForest. They also say they were at liberty to practice their religion and culture. Further, it states that the due\u000aprocess of law regarding compensation was followed at the time of the said gazettement.\u000a182. Regarding the issue of dispossession of ancestral land in the alleged Mochongoi Forest, the\u000aRespondent State did not address it, as it argues that it was not part of the matters addressed by the High\u000aCourt case, and therefore the African Commission would be acting as a tribunal of first instance if it did so.\u000a183. The Respondent State does not dispute that the Lake Bogoria area of the Baringo and Koibatek\u000aAdministrative Districts is the Endorois' ancestral land. One of the issues the Respondent State is disputing\u000ais whether the Endorois are indeed a distinct Community. That question has already been answered supra.\u000aIn para 1.1.6 of the Respondent State Mmerits brief, the State said: "Following the Declaration of the Lake\u000aBogoria Game Reserve, the Government embarked on a resettlement exercise, culminating in the\u000aresettlement of the majority of the Endorois in the Mochongoi settlement scheme. This was over and above\u000athe compensation paid to the Endorois after their ancestral land around lake was gazetted.82\u000a184. It is thus clear that the land surrounding Lake Bogoria is the traditional land of the Endorois people. In\u000apara 1 of the Merits brief, submitted by the Complainants, they write: "The Endorois are a community of\u000aapproximately 60, 000 people who, from time immemorial, have lived in the Lake Bogoria area of the\u000aBaringo and Koibatek Administrative Districts." 83 In para 47, the Complainants also state that: "For\u000acenturies the Endorois have constructed homes on the land, cultivated the land, enjoyed unchallenged\u000arights to pasture, grazing, and forest land, and relied on the land to sustain their livelihoods." The\u000aComplainants argue that apart from a confrontation with the Masai over the Lake Bogoria region three\u000ahundred years ago, the Endorois have been accepted by all neighbouring tribes, including the British\u000aCrown, as bona fide owners of their land. The Respondent State does not challenge those statements of\u000athe Complainants. The only conclusion that could be reached is that the Endorois community has a right to\u000aproperty with regard to its ancestral land, the possessions attached to it, and their animals.\u000a185. Two issues that should be disposed of before going into the more substantive questions of whether\u000athe Respondent State has violated Article 14 are a determination of what is a 'property right' (within the\u000acontext of indigenous populations) that accords with African and international law, and whether special\u000ameasures are needed to protect such rights, if they exist and whether Endorois' land has been encroached\u000aupon by the Respondent State. The Complainants argue that "property rights" have an autonomous\u000ameaning under international human rights law, which supersedes national legal definitions. They state that\u000aboth the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and IACtHR have examined the specific facts of\u000aindividual situations to determine what should be classified as 'property rights', particularly for displaced\u000apersons, instead of limiting themselves to formal requirements in national law.84\u000a186. To determine that question, the African Commission will look, first, at its own jurisprudence and then at\u000ainternational case law. In Malawi African Association and Others v. Mauritania, land was considered\u000a'property' for the purposes of Article 14 of the Charter.85 The African Commission in the Ogoni case also\u000afound that the 'right to property' includes not only the right to have access to one's property and not to have\u000aone's property invaded or encroached upon,86 but also the right to undisturbed possession, use and control\u000aof such property however the owner(s) deem fit.87 The African Commission also notes that the ECHR have\u000arecognised that 'property rights' could also include the economic resources and rights over the common\u000aland of the applicants. 88\u000a187. The Complainants argue that both international and domestic courts have recognised that indigenous\u000agroups have a specific form of land tenure that creates a particular set of problems. Common problems\u000afaced by indigenous groups include the lack of "formal" title recognition of their historic territories, the failure\u000aof domestic legal systems to acknowledge communal property rights, and the claiming of formal legal title\u000a23\u000a\u000ato indigenous land by the colonial authorities. This, they argue, has led to many cases of displacement from\u000aa people's historic territory, both by colonial authorities and post-colonial states relying on the legal title they\u000ainherited from the colonial authorities. The African Commission notes that its Working Group on Indigenous\u000aPopulations/Communities has recognised that some African minorities do face dispossession of their lands\u000aand that special measures are necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions\u000aand customs.89 The African Commission is of the view that the first step in the protection of traditional\u000aAfrican communities is the acknowledgement that the rights, interests and benefits of such communities in\u000atheir traditional lands constitute 'property' under the Charter and that special measures may have to be\u000ataken to secure such 'property rights'.\u000a188. The case of Dogan and others v Turkey90 is instructive in the instant communication. Although the\u000aapplicants were unable to demonstrate registered title of lands from which they had been forcibly evicted by\u000athe Turkish authorities, the European Court of Human Rights observed that:\u000a[T]he notion 'possessions' in Article 1 has an autonomous meaning which is certainly not limited to\u000aownership of physical goods: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as\u000a'property rights', and thus as 'possessions' for the purposes of this provision.91\u000a189. Although they did not have registered property, they either had their own houses constructed on the\u000aland of their ascendants or lived in the houses owned by their fathers and cultivate the land belonging to\u000athe latter. The Court further noted that the applicants had unchallenged rights over the common land in the\u000avillage, such as the pasture, grazing and the forest land, and that they earned their living from\u000astockbreeding and tree-felling.\u000a190. The African Commission also notes the observation of the IActHR in the seminal case of The\u000aMayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v Nicaragua,92 that the Inter-American Convention protected property rights\u000ain a sense which include the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the framework of\u000acommunal property and argued that possession of the land should suffice for indigenous communities\u000alacking real title to obtain official recognition of that property.\u000a191. In the opinion of the African Commission, the Respondent State has an obligation under Article 14 of\u000athe African Charter not only to respect the 'right to property', but also to protect that right. In 'the Mauritania\u000aCases',93 the African Commission concluded that the confiscation and pillaging of the property of black\u000aMauritanians and the expropriation or destruction of their land and houses before forcing them to go abroad\u000aconstituted a violation of the right to property as guaranteed in Article 14. Similarly, in The Ogoni case\u000a200194 the African Commission addressed factual situations involving removal of people from their homes.\u000aThe African Commission held that the removal of people from their homes violated Article 14 of the African\u000aCharter, as well as the right to adequate housing which, although not explicitly expressed in the African\u000aCharter, is also guaranteed by Article 14.95\u000a192. The Saramaka case also sets out how the failure to recognise an indigenous/tribal group becomes a\u000aviolation of the 'right to property.'96 In its analysis of whether the State of Suriname had adopted an\u000aappropriate framework to give domestic legal effect to the 'right to property', the IACtHR addressed the\u000afollowing issues:\u000aThis controversy over who actually represents the Saramaka people is precisely a natural consequence of\u000athe lack of recognition of their juridical personality.97\u000a193. In the Saramaka case, the State of Suriname did not recognise that the Saramaka people can enjoy\u000aand exercise property rights as a community. The Court observed that other communities in Suriname have\u000abeen denied the right to seek judicial protection against alleged violations of their collective property rights\u000aprecisely because a judge considered they did not have the legal capacity necessary to request such\u000aprotection. This, the Court opined, placed the Saramaka people in a vulnerable situation where individual\u000a'property rights' may trump their rights over communal property, and where the Saramaka people may not\u000aseek, as a juridical personality, judicial protection against violations of their 'property rights' recognised\u000aunder Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a24\u000a\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention.\u000a194. As is in the instant case before the African Commission, the State of Suriname acknowledged that its\u000adomestic legal framework did not recognise the right of the members of the Saramaka people to the use\u000aand enjoyment of property in accordance with their system of communal property, but rather a privilege to\u000ause land. It also went on to provide reasons, as to why it should not be held accountable for giving effect to\u000athe Saramaka claims to a right to property, for example because the land tenure system of the Saramaka\u000apeople, particularly regarding who owns the land, presents a practical problem for state recognition of their\u000aright to communal property. The IACtHR rejected all of the State's arguments. In the present\u000acommunication, the High Court of Kenya similarly dismissed any claims based on historic occupation and\u000acultural rights.98\u000a195. The IACtHR went further to say that, in any case, the alleged lack of clarity as to the land tenure\u000asystem of the Saramakas should not present an insurmountable obstacle for the State, which has the duty\u000ato consult with the members of the Saramaka people and seek clarification of this issue, in order to comply\u000awith its obligations under Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention.\u000a196. In the present communication, the Respondent State (the Kenyan Government) during the oral\u000ahearings argued that legislation or special treatment in favour of the Endorois might be perceived as being\u000adiscriminatory. The African Commission rejects that view. The African Commission is of the view that the\u000aRespondent State cannot abstain from complying with its international obligations under the African Charter\u000amerely because it might be perceived to be discriminatory to do so. It is of the view that in certain cases,\u000apositive discrimination or affirmative action helps to redress imbalance. The African Commission shares the\u000aRespondent State's concern over the difficulty involved; nevertheless, the State still has a duty to recognise\u000athe right to property of members of the Endorois community, within the framework of a communal property\u000asystem, and establish the mechanisms necessary to give domestic legal effect to such right recognised in\u000athe Charter and international law. Besides, it is a well established principle of international law that unequal\u000atreatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\u000adiscrimination.99 Legislation that recognises said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory.\u000a197. Again drawing on the Saramaka v Suriname case, which confirms earlier jurisprudence of the\u000aMoiwana v Suriname, Yakye Axa v Paraguay100 , Sawhoyamaxa v Paraguay101 , and Mayagna Awas\u000aTingni v Nicaragua;102 the Saramaka case has held that Special measures of protection are owed to\u000amembers of the tribal community to guarantee the full exercise of their rights. The IACtHR stated that\u000abased on Article 1(1)\u000a× The States Parties to this Convention undertake to respect the rights and freedoms recognized herein\u000aand to ensure to all persons subject to their jurisdiction the free and full exercise of those rights and\u000afreedoms, without any discrimination for reasons of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other\u000aopinion, national or social origin, economic status, birth, or any other social condition.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention, members of indigenous and tribal communities require special measures that guarantee\u000athe full exercise of their rights, particularly with regard to their enjoyment of 'property rights' in order to\u000asafeguard their physical and cultural survival.\u000a198. Other sources of international law have similarly declared that such special measures are necessary.\u000aIn the Moiwana case, the IACtHR determined that another Maroon community living in Suriname was also\u000anot indigenous to the region, but rather constituted a tribal community that settled in Suriname in the 17th\u000aand 18th century, and that this tribal community had "a profound and all-encompassing relationship to their\u000a25\u000a\u000aancestral lands" that was centred, not "on the individual, but rather on the community as a whole." This\u000aspecial relationship to land, as well as their communal concept of ownership, prompted the Court to apply\u000ato the tribal Moiwana community its jurisprudence regarding indigenous peoples and their right to\u000acommunal property under Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention.\u000a199. The African Commission is of the view that even though the Constitution of Kenya provides that Trust\u000aLand may be alienated and that the Trust Land Act provides comprehensive procedure for the assessment\u000aof compensation, the Endorois property rights have been encroached upon, in particular by the\u000aexpropriation and the effective denial of ownership of their land. It agrees with the Complainants that the\u000aEndorois were never given the full title to the land they had in practice before the British colonial\u000aadministration. Their land was instead made subject to a trust, which gave them beneficial title, but denied\u000athem actual title. The African Commission further agrees that though for a decade they were able to\u000aexercise their traditional rights without restriction, the trust land system has proved inadequate to protect\u000atheir rights.\u000a200. The African Commission also notes the views expressed by the Committee on Economic, Social and\u000aCultural Rights which has provided a legal test for forced removal from lands which is traditionally claimed\u000aby a group of people as their property. In its 'General Comment No. 4' it states that "instances of forced\u000aeviction are prima facie incompatible with the requirements of the Covenant and can only be justified in the\u000amost exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with the relevant principles of international law."103\u000aThis view has also been reaffirmed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which states that\u000aforced evictions are a gross violations of human rights, and in particular the right to adequate housing.104\u000aThe African Commission also notes General Comment No. 7 requiring States Parties, prior to carrying out\u000aany evictions, to explore all feasible alternatives in consultation with affected persons, with a view to\u000aavoiding, or at least minimizing, the need to use force.105\u000a201. The African Commission is also inspired by the European Commission of Human Rights. Article 1 of\u000aProtocol 1 to the European Convention\u000a× http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/009.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000astates:\u000aEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his [or her] possessions. No one shall\u000abe deprived of his [or her] possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided\u000afor by law and by the general principles of international law.106\u000a202. The African Commission also refers to Akdivar and Others v. Turkey. The European Court held that\u000aforced evictions constitute a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention. Akdivar and\u000aOthers involved the destruction of housing in the context of the ongoing conflict between the Government of\u000aTurkey and Kurdish separatist forces. The petitioners were forcibly evicted from their properties, which\u000awere subsequently set on fire and destroyed. It was unclear which party to the conflict was responsible.\u000aNonetheless, the European Court held that the Government of Turkey violated both Article 8 of the\u000aEuropean Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention because it has a duty to both\u000arespect and protect the rights enshrined in the European Convention and its Protocols.\u000a203. In the instant case, the Respondent State sets out the conditions when Trust Land is set apart for\u000awhatever purpose.107\u000a204. The African Commission notes that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, officially\u000asanctioned by the African Commission through its 2007 Advisory Opinion, deals extensively with land\u000arights. The jurisprudence under international law bestows the right of ownership rather than mere access.\u000aThe African Commission notes that if international law were to grant access only, indigenous peoples would\u000aremain vulnerable to further violations/dispossession by the State or third parties. Ownership ensures that\u000a26\u000a\u000aindigenous peoples can engage with the state and third parties as active stakeholders rather than as\u000apassive beneficiaries.108\u000a205. The Inter-American Court jurisprudence also makes it clear that mere access or de facto ownership of\u000aland is not compatible with principles of international law. Only de jure ownership can guarantee indigenous\u000apeoples' effective protection.109\u000a206. In the Saramaka case, the Court held that the State's legal framework merely grants the members of\u000athe Saramaka people a privilege to use land, which does not guarantee the right to effectively control their\u000aterritory without outside interference. The Court held that, rather than a privilege to use the land, which can\u000abe taken away by the State or trumped by real property rights of third parties, members of indigenous and\u000atribal peoples must obtain title to their territory in order to guarantee its permanent use and enjoyment. This\u000atitle must be recognised and respected not only in practice but also in law in order to ensure its legal\u000acertainty. In order to obtain such title, the territory traditionally used and occupied by the members of the\u000aSaramaka people must first be delimited and demarcated, in consultation with such people and other\u000aneighbouring peoples. The situation of the Endorois is not different. The Respondent State simply wants to\u000agrant them privileges such as restricted access to ceremonial sites. This, in the opinion of the Commission,\u000afalls below internationally recognised norms. The Respondent State must grant title to their territory in order\u000ato guarantee its permanent use and enjoyment.\u000a207. The African Commission notes that that Articles 26\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have\u000atraditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.\u000a\u2022 Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and\u000aresources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or\u000ause, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired.\u000a\u2022 States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories and resources. Such\u000arecognition shall be conducted with due respect to the customs, traditions and land tenure systems\u000aof the indigenous peoples concerned.\u000ahttp://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement and 27\u000a× "States shall establish and implement, in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned, a fair,\u000aindependent, impartial, open and transparent process, giving due recognition to indigenous peoples' laws,\u000atraditions, customs and land tenure systems, to recognize and adjudicate the rights of indigenous peoples\u000apertaining to their lands, territories and resources, including those which were traditionally owned or\u000aotherwise occupied or used. Indigenous peoples shall have the right to participate in this\u000aprocess."http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement\u000aaccessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples use the term "occupied or otherwise used." This is to stress\u000athat indigenous peoples have a recognised claim to ownership to ancestral land under international law,\u000aeven in the absence of official title deeds. This was made clear in the judgment of Awas Tingni v Nicaragua\u000a. In the current leading international case on this issue, The Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v Nicaragua ,110\u000athe IActHR recognised that the Inter-American Convention protected property rights "in a sense which\u000aincludes, among others, the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the framework of\u000acommunal property."111 It stated that possession of the land should suffice for indigenous communities\u000alacking real title to obtain official recognition of that property.112\u000a208. The African Commission also notes that in the case of Sawhoyamaxa v Paraguay, the IActHR, acting\u000awithin the scope of its adjudicatory jurisdiction, decided on indigenous land possession in three different\u000asituations, viz: in the Case of the Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community, the Court pointed out that\u000apossession of the land should suffice for indigenous communities lacking real title to property of the land to\u000aobtain official recognition of that property, and for consequent registration;113 in the Case of the Moiwana\u000aCommunity, the Court considered that the members of the N'djuka people were the "legitimate owners of\u000atheir traditional lands", although they did not have possession thereof, because they left them as a result of\u000athe acts of violence perpetrated against them, though in this case, the traditional lands were not occupied\u000aby third parties.114 Finally, in the Case of the Indigenous Community Yakye Axa , the Court considered that\u000athe members of the community were empowered, even under domestic law, to file claims for traditional\u000a27\u000a\u000alands and ordered the State, as measure of reparation, to individualise those lands and transfer them on a\u000ano consideration basis.115\u000a209. In the view of the African Commission, the following conclusions could be drawn: (1) traditional\u000apossession of land by indigenous people has the equivalent effect as that of a state-granted full property\u000atitle; (2) traditional possession entitles indigenous people to demand official recognition and registration of\u000aproperty title; (3) the members of indigenous peoples who have unwillingly left their traditional lands, or lost\u000apossession thereof, maintain property rights thereto, even though they lack legal title, unless the lands have\u000abeen lawfully transferred to third parties in good faith; and (4) the members of indigenous peoples who\u000ahave unwillingly lost possession of their lands, when those lands have been lawfully transferred to innocent\u000athird parties, are entitled to restitution thereof or to obtain other lands of equal extension and quality.\u000aConsequently, possession is not a requisite condition for the existence of indigenous land restitution rights.\u000aThe instant case of the Endorois is categorised under this last conclusion. The African Commission thus\u000aagrees that the land of the Endorois has been encroached upon.\u000a210. That such encroachment has taken place could be seen by the Endorois' inability, after being evicted\u000afrom their ancestral land, to have free access to religious sites and their traditional land to graze their cattle.\u000aThe African Commission is aware that access roads, gates, game lodges and a hotel have all been built on\u000athe ancestral land of the Endorois community around Lake Bogoria and imminent mining operations also\u000athreatens to cause irreparable damage to the land. The African Commission has also been notified that the\u000aRespondent State is engaged in the demarcation and sale of parts of Endorois historic lands to third\u000aparties.\u000a211. The African Commission is aware that encroachment in itself is not a violation of Article 14 of the\u000aCharter, as long as it is done in accordance with the law. Article 14 of the African Charter indicates a\u000atwo-pronged test, where that encroachment can only be conducted - 'in the interest of public need or in the\u000ageneral interest of the community' and 'in accordance with appropriate laws'. The African Commission will\u000anow assess whether an encroachment 'in the interest of public need' is indeed proportionate to the point of\u000aoverriding the rights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands. The African Commission agrees with\u000athe Complainants that the test laid out in Article 14 of the Charter is conjunctive, that is, in order for an\u000aencroachment not to be in violation of Article 14, it must be proven that the encroachment was in the\u000ainterest of the public need/general interest of the community and was carried out in accordance with\u000aappropriate laws.\u000a212. The 'public interest' test is met with a much higher threshold in the case of encroachment of\u000aindigenous land rather than individual private property. In this sense, the test is much more stringent when\u000aapplied to ancestral land rights of indigenous peoples. In 2005, this point was stressed by the Special\u000aRapporteur of the United Nations Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights who\u000apublished the following statement:\u000aLimitations, if any, on the right to indigenous peoples to their natural resources must flow only from the\u000amost urgent and compelling interest of the state. Few, if any, limitations on indigenous resource rights are\u000aappropriate, because the indigenous ownership of the resources is associated with the most important and\u000afundamental human rights, including the right to life, food, the right to self-determination, to shelter, and the\u000aright to exist as a people.116\u000a213. Limitations on rights, such as the limitation allowed in 14, must be reviewed under the principle of\u000aproportionality. The Commission notes its own conclusions that "... the justification of limitations must be\u000astrictly proportionate with and absolutely necessary for the advantages which follow.117 The African\u000aCommission also notes the decisive case of Handyside v. United Kingdom, where the ECHR stated that\u000aany condition or restriction imposed upon a right must be "proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."118\u000a214. The African Commission is of the view that any limitations on rights must be proportionate to a\u000alegitimate need, and should be the least restrictive measures possible. In the present communication, the\u000aAfrican Commission holds the view that in the pursuit of creating a game reserve, the Respondent State\u000ahas unlawfully evicted the Endorois from their ancestral land and destroyed their possessions. It is of the\u000aview that the upheaval and displacement of the Endorois from the land they call home and the denial of\u000atheir property rights over their ancestral land is disproportionate to any public need served by the game\u000areserve.\u000a215. It is also of the view that even if the game reserve was a legitimate aim and served a public need, it\u000acould have been accomplished by alternative means proportionate to the need. From the evidence\u000asubmitted both orally and in writing, it is clear that the community was willing to work with the Government\u000a28\u000a\u000ain a way that respected their property rights, even if a game reserve was being created. In that regard, the\u000aAfrican Commission notes its own conclusion in the Constitutional Rights Project Case, where it says that\u000a"a limitation may not erode a right such that the right itself becomes illusory."119 At the point where such a\u000aright becomes illusory, the limitation cannot be considered proportionate - the limitation becomes a violation\u000aof the right. The African Commission agrees that the Respondent State has not only denied the Endorois\u000acommunity all legal rights in their ancestral land, rendering their property rights essentially illusory, but in\u000athe name of creating a game reserve and the subsequent eviction of the Endorois community from their\u000aown land, the Respondent State has violated the very essence of the right itself, and cannot justify such an\u000ainterference with reference to "the general interest of the community" or a >\u000a216. The African Commission notes that the link to the right to life, in paragraph 219 above, is particularly\u000anotable, as it is a non-derogable right under international law. Incorporating the right to life into the\u000athreshold of the 'public interest test' is further confirmed by jurisprudence of the IActHR. In Yakye Axa v\u000aParaguay the Court found that the fallout from forcibly dispossessing indigenous peoples from their\u000aancestral land could amount to an Article 4 violation (right to life) if the living conditions of the community\u000aare incompatible with the principles of human dignity.\u000a217. The IActHR held that one of the obligations that the State must inescapably undertake as guarantor to\u000aprotect and ensure the right to life is that of generating minimum living conditions that are compatible with\u000athe dignity of the human person and of not creating conditions that hinder or impede it. In this regard, the\u000aState has the duty to take positive, concrete measures geared towards fulfilment of the right to a decent\u000alife, especially in the case of persons who are vulnerable and at risk, whose care becomes a high priority.\u000a218. The African Commission also notes that the 'disproportionate' nature of an encroachment on\u000aindigenous lands - therefore falling short of the test set out by the provisions of Article 14 of the African\u000aCharter - is to be considered an even greater violation of Article 14, when the displacement at hand was\u000aundertaken by force. Forced evictions, by their very definition, cannot be deemed to satisfy Article 14 of the\u000aCharter's test of being done 'in accordance with the law'. This provision must mean, at the minimum, that\u000aboth Kenyan law and the relevant provisions of international law were respected. The grave nature of\u000aforced evictions could amount to a gross violation of human rights. Indeed, the United Nations Commission\u000aon Human Rights, in Resolutions 1993/77 and 2004/28, has reaffirmed that forced evictions amount to a\u000agross violations of human rights and in particular the right to adequate housing."120 Where such removal\u000awas forced, this would in itself suggest that the 'proportionality' test has not been satisfied.\u000a219. With respect to the 'in accordance with the law' test, the Respondent State should also be able to\u000ashow that the removal of the Endorois was not only in the public interest, but their removal satisfied both\u000aKenyan and international law. If it is settled that there was a trust in favour of the Endorois, was it legally\u000aextinguished? If it was, how was it satisfied? Was the community adequately compensated? Also, did the\u000arelevant legislation creating the game reserve, expressly required the removal of the Endorois from their\u000aland?\u000a220. The African Commission notes that the Respondent State does not contest the claim that the\u000atraditional lands of the Endorois people are classified as Trust Land. In fact S. 115 of the Kenyan\u000aConstitution gives effect to that claim. In the opinion of the African Commission it created a beneficial right\u000afor the Endorois over their ancestral land. This should have meant that the County Council should give\u000aeffect to such rights, interest or other benefits in respect of the land.\u000a221. The Complainants argue that the Respondent State created the Lake Hannington Game Reserve,\u000aincluding the Endorois indigenous lands, on 9 November 1973. The name was changed to Lake Bogoria\u000aGame Reserve in a second notice in 1974.121 The 1974 notice was made by the Kenyan Minister for\u000aTourism and Wildlife under the Wild Animals Protection Act (WAPA).122 The Complainants argue that\u000aWAPA applied to Trust Land as it did to any other land, and did not require that the land be taken out of the\u000aTrust before a game reserve could be declared over that land.\u000a222. They further argue that the relevant legislation did not give authority for the removal of any individual\u000aor group occupying the land in a game reserve. Instead, WAPA merely prohibited the hunting, killing or\u000acapturing of animals within the game reserve.123 The Complainants argue that despite no clear legal order\u000aasking them to relocate to another land, the Endorois community was informed from 1973 onwards that\u000athey would have to leave their ancestral lands.\u000a223. In rebuttal, the Respondent State argues that the Constitution of Kenya provides that Trust Land may\u000abe alienated. It also states that the "Government offered adequate and prompt compensation to the\u000aaffected people... "124 As regards the Complainants' claim that the Respondent State prevented the\u000aEndorois community from accessing their other ancestral lands, Muchongoi forest, the Respondent State\u000a29\u000a\u000aargues that the land in question was gazetted in 1941 by the name of Ol Arabel Forest with the implication\u000athat the land ceased being communal by virtue of the gazettement.\u000a224. The African Commission agrees that WAPA merely prohibited the hunting, killing or capturing of\u000aanimals within the Game Reserve.125 Additionally, the Respondent State has not been able to prove\u000awithout doubt that the eviction of the Endorois community satisfied both Kenyan and international law. The\u000aAfrican Commission is not convinced that the whole process of removing the Endorois from their ancestral\u000aland satisfied the very stringent international law provisions. Furthermore, the mere gazetting of Trust Land\u000ais not sufficient to legally extinguish the trust. WAPA should have required that the land be taken out of the\u000aTrust before a game reserve could be declared over that land. This means that the declaration of the Lake\u000aBogoria Game Reserve by way of the 1974 notice did not affect the status of the Endorois land as Trust\u000aLand. The obligation of Baringo and Koibatek County Councils to give effect to the rights and interests of\u000athe Endorois people continued. That also has to be read in conjunction with the concept of adequate\u000acompensation. The African Commission is in agreement with the Complainants that the only way under\u000aKenyan law in which Endorois benefit under the trust could have been dissolved is if the County Council or\u000athe President of Kenya had "set apart" the land. However, the Trust Land Act required that to be legal, such\u000asetting apart of the land must be published in the Kenyan Gazette.126\u000a225. Two further elements of the 'in accordance with the law' test relate to the requirements of consultation\u000aand compensation.\u000a226. In terms of consultation, the threshold is especially stringent in favour of indigenous peoples, as it also\u000arequires that consent be accorded. Failure to observe the obligations to consult and to seek consent - or to\u000acompensate - ultimately results in a violation of the right to property.\u000a227. In the Saramaka case, in order to guarantee that restrictions to the property rights of the members of\u000athe Saramaka people by the issuance of concessions within their territory do not amount to a denial of their\u000asurvival as a tribal people, the Court stated that the State must abide by the following three safeguards:\u000afirst, ensure the effective participation of the members of the Saramaka people, in conformity with their\u000acustoms and traditions, regarding any development, investment, exploration or extraction plan within\u000aSaramaka territory; second, guarantee that the Saramakas will receive a reasonable benefit from any such\u000aplan within their territory; third, ensure that no concession will be issued within Saramaka territory unless\u000aand until independent and technically capable entities, with the State's supervision, perform a prior\u000aenvironmental and social impact assessment. These safeguards are intended to preserve, protect and\u000aguarantee the special relationship that the members of the Saramaka community have with their territory,\u000awhich in turn ensures their survival as a tribal people.\u000a228. In the instant case, the African Commission is of the view that no effective participation was allowed\u000afor the Endorois, nor has there been any reasonable benefit enjoyed by the community. Moreover, a prior\u000aenvironment and social impact assessment was not carried out. The absence of these three elements of\u000athe 'test' is tantamount to a violation of Article 14, the right to property, under the Charter. The failure to\u000aguarantee effective participation and to guarantee a reasonable share in the profits of the game reserve (or\u000aother adequate forms of compensation) also extends to a violation of the right to development.\u000a229. On the issue of compensation, the Respondent State in rebutting the Complainants' allegations that\u000ainadequate compensation was paid, argues that the Complainants do not contest that a form of\u000acompensation was done, but that they have only pleaded that about 170 families were compensated. It\u000afurther argues that, if at all the compensations paid was not adequate, the Trust Land Act provides for a\u000aprocedure for appeal, for the amount and the people who feel that they are denied compensation over their\u000ainterest.\u000a230. The Respondent State does not deny the Complainants' allegations that in 1986, of the 170 families\u000aevicted in late 1973, from their homes within the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve, each receiving around 3,150\u000aKshs (at the time, this was equivalent to approximately ?30). Such payment was made some 13 years after\u000athe first eviction. It does not also deny the allegation that ?30 did not represent the market value of the land\u000agazetted as Lake Bogoria Game Reserve. It also does not deny that the Kenyan authorities have\u000athemselves recognised that the payment of 3,150 Kshs per family amounted only to 'relocation assistance',\u000aand does not constitute full compensation for loss of land.\u000a231. The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State did not pay the prompt, full\u000acompensation as required by the Constitution. It is of the view that Kenyan law has not been complied with\u000aand that though some members of the Endorois community accepted limited monetary compensation that\u000adid not mean that they accepted it as full compensation, or indeed that they accepted the loss of their land.\u000a\u000a30\u000a\u000a232. The African Commission notes the observations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of\u000aIndigenous Peoples, which, amongst other provisions for restitutions and compensations, states:\u000aIndigenous peoples have the right to restitution of the lands, territories and resources which they have\u000atraditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used; and which have been confiscated, occupied, used or\u000adamaged without their free and informed consent. Where this is not possible, they have the right to just and\u000afair compensation. Unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall\u000atake the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status.127\u000a233. In the case of Yakye Axa v Paraguay the Court established that any violation of an international\u000aobligation that has caused damage entails the duty to provide appropriate reparations.128 To this end,\u000aArticle 63(1) of the American Convention\u000a×\u000ahttp://treaties.un.org/untc//Pages//doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201144/volume-1144-I-17955-English.pdf\u000aaccessed 26.10.2010\u000aestablishes that:\u000aif the Court finds that there has been a violation of a right or freedom protected by th[e] Convention, the\u000aCourt shall rule that the injured party be ensured the enjoyment of his right or freedom that was violated. It\u000ashall also rule, if appropriate, that the consequences of the measure or situation that constituted the breach\u000aof such right or freedom be remedied and that fair compensation be paid to the injured party.\u000a234. The Court said that once it has been proved that land restitution rights are still current, the State must\u000atake the necessary actions to return them to the members of the indigenous people claiming them.\u000aHowever, as the Court has pointed out, when a State is unable, on objective and reasonable grounds, to\u000aadopt measures aimed at returning traditional lands and communal resources to indigenous populations, it\u000amust surrender alternative lands of equal extension and quality, which will be chosen by agreement with\u000athe members of the indigenous peoples, according to their own consultation and decision procedures.129\u000aThis was not the case in respect of the Endorois. The land given them is not of equal quality.\u000a235. The reasons of the government in the instant communication are questionable for several reasons\u000aincluding:\u000a(a) the contested land is the site of a conservation area, and the Endorois - as the ancestral guardians of\u000athat land - are best equipped to maintain its delicate ecosystems;\u000a(b) the Endorois are prepared to continue the conservation work begun by the Government;\u000a(c) no other community have settled on the land in question, and even if that is the case, the Respondent\u000aState is obliged to rectify that situation,130\u000a(d) the land has not been spoliated and is thus inhabitable;\u000a(e) continued dispossession and alienation from their ancestral land continues to threaten the cultural\u000asurvival of the Endorois' way of life, a consequence which clearly tips the proportionality argument on the\u000aside of indigenous peoples under international law.\u000a236. It seems also to the African Commission that the amount of ?30 as compensation for one's ancestral\u000ahome land flies in the face of common sense and fairness.\u000a237. The African Commission notes the detailed recommendations regarding compensation payable to\u000adisplaced or evicted persons developed by the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of\u000aDiscrimination and Protection of Minorities.131 These recommendations, which have been considered and\u000aapplied by the European Court of Human Rights,132 set out the following principles for compensation on\u000aloss of land: Displaced persons should be\u000a(i) compensated for their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move;\u000a(ii) assisted with the move and supported during the transition period in the resettlement site; and\u000a(iii) assisted in their efforts to improve upon their former living standards, income earning capacity and\u000a31\u000a\u000aproduction levels, or at least to restore them. These recommendations could be followed if the Respondent\u000aState is interested in giving a fair compensation to the Endorois.\u000a238. Taking all the submissions of both parties, the African Commission agrees with the Complainants that\u000athe Property of the Endorois people has been severely encroached upon and continues to be so\u000aencroached upon. The encroachment is not proportionate to any public need and is not in accordance with\u000anational and international law. Accordingly, the African Commission finds for the Complainants that the\u000aEndorois as a distinct people have suffered a violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 17(2) and 17(3)\u000a\u000a239. The Complainants allege that the Endorois' cultural rights have been violated on two counts: first, the\u000acommunity has faced systematic restrictions on access to cultural sites and, second, that the cultural rights\u000aof the community have been violated by the serious damage caused by the Kenyan authorities to their\u000apastoralist way of life.\u000a240. The Respondent State denies the allegation claiming that access to the forest areas was always\u000apermitted, subject to administrative procedures. The Respondent State also submits that in some instances\u000asome communities have allowed political issues to be disguised as cultural practices and in the process\u000athey endanger the peaceful coexistence with other communities. The Respondent State does not\u000asubstantiate who these "communities" or what these "political issues to be disguised as cultural practices"\u000aare.\u000a241. The African Commission is of the view that protecting human rights goes beyond the duty not to\u000adestroy or deliberately weaken minority groups, but requires respect for, and protection of, their religious\u000aand cultural heritage essential to their group identity, including buildings and sites such as libraries,\u000achurches, mosques, temples and synagogues. Both the Complainants and the Respondent State seem to\u000aagree on that. It notes that Article 17 of the Charter is of a dual dimension in both its individual and\u000acollective nature, protecting, on the one hand, individuals' participation in the cultural life of their community\u000aand, on the other hand, obliging the state to promote and protect traditional values recognised by a\u000acommunity. It thus understands culture to mean that complex whole which includes a spiritual and physical\u000aassociation with one's ancestral land, knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, customs, and any other\u000acapabilities and habits acquired by humankind as a member of society - the sum total of the material and\u000aspiritual activities and products of a given social group that distinguish it from other similar groups. It has\u000aalso understood cultural identity to encompass a group's religion, language, and other defining\u000acharacteristics.133\u000a242. The African Commission notes that the preamble of the African Charter acknowledges that "civil and\u000apolitical rights cannot be dissociated from economic, social and cultural rights ... social, cultural rights are a\u000aguarantee for the enjoyment of civil and political rights", ideas which influenced the 1976 African Cultural\u000aCharter which in its preamble highlights >134 Article 3 of the same Charter states that culture is a source of\u000amutual enrichment for various communities.135\u000a243. This Commission also notes the views of the Human Rights Committee with regard to the exercise of\u000athe cultural rights protected under Article 27\u000a× of the [popup=UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and\u000aLinguistic Minorities] http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r135.htmaccessed 26.10.2010\u000a. The Committee observes that [quote]"culture manifests itself in many forms, including a particular way of\u000alife associated with the use of land resources, especially in the case of indigenous peoples. That right may\u000ainclude such traditional activities as fishing or hunting and the right to live in reserves protected by law. The\u000aenjoyment of those rights may require positive legal measures of protection and measures to ensure the\u000aeffective participation of members of minority communities in decisions which affect them."136\u000a244. The African Commission notes that a common theme that usually runs through the debate about\u000aculture and its violation is the association with one's ancestral land. It notes that its own Working Group on\u000aIndigenous Populations/Communities has observed that dispossession of land and its resources is "a major\u000ahuman rights problem for indigenous peoples."137 It further notes that a Report from the Working Group has\u000aalso emphasised that dispossession "threatens the economic, social and cultural survival of indigenous\u000apastoralist and hunter-gatherer communities."138\u000a245. In the case of indigenous communities in Kenya, the African Commission notes the critical 'Report of\u000athe Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous\u000aPeople in Kenya' that "their livelihoods and cultures have been traditionally discriminated against and their\u000a32\u000a\u000alack of legal recognition and empowerment reflects their social, political and economic marginalization." 139\u000aHe also said that the principal human rights issues they face "relate to the loss and environmental\u000adegradation of their land, traditional forests and natural resources, as a result of dispossession in colonial\u000atimes and in the post-independence period. In recent decades, inappropriate development and\u000aconservationist policies have aggravated the violation of their economic, social and cultural rights."140\u000a246. The African Commission is of the view that in its interpretation of the African Charter, it has recognised\u000athe duty of the state to tolerate diversity and to introduce measures that protect identity groups different\u000afrom those of the majority/dominant group. It has thus interpreted Article 17(2) as requiring governments to\u000atake measures "aimed at the conservation, development and diffusion of culture," such as promoting\u000a"cultural identity as a factor of mutual appreciation among individuals, groups, nations and regions; . . .\u000apromoting awareness and enjoyment of cultural heritage of national ethnic groups and minorities and of\u000aindigenous sectors of the population."141\u000a247. The African Commission's WGIP has further highlighted the importance of creating spaces for\u000adominant and indigenous cultures to co-exist. The WGIP notes with concern that: Indigenous communities\u000ahave in so many cases been pushed out of their traditional areas to give way for the economic interests of\u000aother more dominant groups and to large scale development initiatives that tend to destroy their lives and\u000acultures rather than improve their situation.142\u000a248. The African Commission is of the opinion that the Respondent State has a higher duty in terms of\u000ataking positive steps to protect groups and communities like the Endorois,143 but also to promote cultural\u000arights including the creation of opportunities, policies, institutions, or other mechanisms that allow for\u000adifferent cultures and ways of life to exist, develop in view of the challenges facing indigenous communities.\u000aThese challenges include exclusion, exploitation, discrimination and extreme poverty; displacement from\u000atheir traditional territories and deprivation of their means of subsistence; lack of participation in decisions\u000aaffecting the lives of the communities; forced assimilation and negative social statistics among other issues\u000aand, at times, indigenous communities suffer from direct violence and persecution, while some even face\u000athe danger of extinction.144\u000a249. In its analysis of Article 17 of the African Charter, the African Commission is aware that unlike Articles\u000a8 and 14, Article 17 has no claw-back clause. The absence of a claw-back clause is an indication that the\u000adrafters of the Charter envisaged few, if any, circumstances in which it would be appropriate to limit a\u000apeople's right to culture. It further notes that even if the Respondent State were to put some limitation on\u000athe exercise of such a right, the restriction must be proportionate to a legitimate aim that does not interfere\u000aadversely on the exercise of a community's cultural rights. Thus, even if the creation of the game reserve\u000aconstitutes a legitimate aim, the Respondent State's failure to secure access, as of right, for the celebration\u000aof the cultural festival and rituals cannot be deemed proportionate to that aim. The Commission is of the\u000aview that the cultural activities of the Endorois community pose no harm to the ecosystem of the game\u000areserve and the restriction of cultural rights could not be justified, especially as no suitable alternative was\u000agiven to the community.\u000a250. It is the opinion of the African Commission that the Respondent State has overlooked that the\u000auniversal appeal of great culture lies in its particulars and that imposing burdensome laws or rules on\u000aculture undermines its enduring aspects. The Respondent State has not taken into consideration the fact\u000athat by restricting access to Lake Bogoria, it has denied the community access to an integrated system of\u000abeliefs, values, norms, mores, traditions and artifacts closely linked to access to the Lake.\u000a251. By forcing the community to live on semi-arid lands without access to medicinal salt licks and other\u000avital resources for the health of their livestock, the Respondent State have created a major threat to the\u000aEndorois pastoralist way of life. It is of the view that the very essence of the Endorois' right to culture has\u000abeen denied, rendering the right, to all intents and purposes, illusory. Accordingly, the Respondent State is\u000afound to have violated Article 17(2) and 17(3) of the Charter.\u000a\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 21\u000a\u000a252. The Complainants allege that the Endorois community has been unable to access the vital resources\u000ain the Lake Bogoria region since their eviction from the game reserve.\u000a253. The Respondent State denies the allegation. It argues that it is of the view that the Complainants have\u000aimmensely benefited from the tourism and mineral prospecting activities , noting for example:\u000a33\u000a\u000aa) Proceeds from the game reserve have been utilised to finance a number of projects in the area, such as\u000aschools, health facilities, wells and roads.\u000ab) Since the discovery of ruby minerals in the Weseges area near Lake Bogoria, three companies have\u000abeen issued with prospecting licences, noting that two out of three companies belong to the community,\u000aincluding the Endorois. In addition, the company which does not consist of the locals, namely Corby Ltd,\u000aentered into an agreement with the community, binding itself to deliver some benefits to the latter in terms\u000aof supporting community projects. It states that it is evident (from the minutes of a meeting of the\u000acommunity and the company) that the company is ready to undertake a project in the form of an access\u000aroad to the prospecting site for the community's and prospecting company's use.\u000ac) The Respondent State also argues that the mineral prospecting activities are taking place outside the\u000aLake Bogoria Game Reserve, which means that the land is not the subject matter of the Applicants'\u000acomplaint.\u000a254. The Respondent State also argue that the community has been holding consultations with Corby Ltd.,\u000aas evidence by the agreement between them is a clear manifestation of the extent to which the former\u000aparticipants in the decisions touch on the exploitation of the natural resources and the sharing of the\u000abenefits emanating therefrom.\u000a255. The African Commission notes that in The Ogoni case the right to natural resources contained within\u000atheir traditional lands is also vested in the indigenous people, making it clear that a people inhabiting a\u000aspecific region within a state could also claim under Article 21 of the African Charter. 145 The Respondent\u000aState does not give enough evidence to substantiate the claim that the Complainants have immensely\u000abenefited from the tourism and mineral prospecting activities.\u000a256. The African Commission notes that proceeds from the game reserve have been used to finance a lot\u000aof useful projects, 'a fact' that the Complainants do not contest. The African Commission, however, refers to\u000acases in the Inter-American Human Rights system to understand this area of the law. The American\u000aConvention does not have an equivalent of the African Charter's Article 21 on the Right to Natural\u000aResources. It therefore reads the right to natural resources into the right to property (Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the American Convention), and in turn applies similar limitation rights on the issue of natural resources\u000aas it does on limitations of the right to property. The "test" in both cases makes for a much higher threshold\u000awhen potential spoliation or development of the land is affecting indigenous land.\u000a257. In the Saramaka case and Inter-American case law, an issue that flows from the IActHR assertion that\u000athe members of the Saramaka people have a right to use and enjoy their territory in accordance with their\u000atraditions and customs is the issue of the right to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources that lie on\u000aand within the land, including subsoil natural resources. In the Saramaka case both the State and the\u000amembers of the Saramaka people claim a right to these natural resources. The Saramakas claim that their\u000aright to use and enjoy all such natural resources is a necessary condition for the enjoyment of their right to\u000aproperty under Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000a34\u000a\u000aof the Convention. The State argued that all rights to land, particularly its subsoil natural resources, are\u000avested in the State, which it can freely dispose of these resources through concessions to third parties.\u000a258. The IActHR addressed this complex issue in the following order: first, the right of the members of the\u000aSaramaka people to use and enjoy the natural resources that lie on and within their traditionally owned\u000aterritory; second, the State's grant of concessions for the exploration and extraction of natural resources,\u000aincluding subsoil resources found within Saramaka territory; and finally, the fulfilment of international law\u000aguarantees regarding the exploration extraction concessions already issued by the State.\u000a259. First, the IActHR analysed whether and to what extent the members of the Saramaka people have a\u000aright to use and enjoy the natural resources that lie on and within their traditionally owned territory. The\u000aState did not contest that the Saramakas have traditionally used and occupied certain lands for centuries,\u000aor that the Saramakas have an "interest" in the territory they have traditionally used in accordance with their\u000acustoms. The controversy was the nature and scope of the said interest. In accordance with Suriname's\u000alegal and constitutional framework, the Saramakas do not have property rights per se, but rather merely a\u000aprivilege or permission to use and occupy the land in question. According to Article 41 of the Constitution of\u000aSuriname, and Article 2 of its 1986 Mining Decree, ownership rights of all natural resources are vested in\u000athe State. For this reason, the State claimed to have an inalienable right to the exploration and exploitation\u000aof those resources. On the other hand, the customary laws of the Saramaka people give them a right over\u000aall natural resources within its traditional territory.\u000a260. The IActHR held that the cultural and economic survival of indigenous and tribal peoples and their\u000amembers depends on their access and use of the natural resources in their territory that are related to their\u000aculture and are found therein, and that Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Inter-American Convention protects their right to such natural resources. The Court further said that\u000ain accordance with their previous jurisprudence as stated in the Yakye Axa and Sawhoyamaxa cases,\u000amembers of tribal and indigenous communities have the right to own the natural resources they have\u000atraditionally used within their territory for the same reasons that they have a right to own the land they have\u000atraditionally used and occupied for centuries. Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\u000apeoples is at stake; 146 hence, the Court opined, the need to protect the lands and resources they have\u000atraditionally used to prevent their extinction as a people. It said that the aim and purpose of special\u000ameasures required on behalf of members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they\u000amay continue living their traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure,\u000aeconomic system, customs, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by states.\u000a261. But the Court further said that the natural resources found on and within indigenous and tribal people's\u000aterritories that are protected under Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000a(of the American Convention) are those natural resources traditionally used and necessary for the very\u000asurvival, development and continuation of such people's way of life.147\u000a262. In the Saramaka case, the Court had to determine which natural resources found on and within the\u000aSaramaka people's territory are essential for the survival of their way of life, and are thus protected under\u000aArticle 21\u000a35\u000a\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention. This has direct relevance to the matter in front of the African Commission, given the ruby\u000amining concessions which were taking place on lands, both ancestral and adjacent to Endorois ancestral\u000aland, and which the Complainants allege poisoned the only remaining water source to which the Endorois\u000ahad access.\u000a263. The African Commission notes the opinion of the IActHR in the Saramaka case as regards the issue\u000aof permissible limitations. The State of Suriname had argued that, should the Court recognise a right of the\u000amembers of the Saramaka people to the natural resources found within traditionally owned lands, this right\u000amust be limited to those resources traditionally used for their subsistence, cultural and religious activities.\u000aAccording to the State, the alleged land rights of the Saramakas would not include any interests on forests\u000aor minerals beyond what the tribe traditionally possesses and uses for subsistence (agriculture, hunting,\u000afishing etc), and the religious and cultural needs of its people.\u000a264. The Court opined that while it is true that all exploration and extraction activity in the Saramaka\u000aterritory could affect, to a greater or lesser degree, the use and enjoyment of some natural resource\u000atraditionally used for the subsistence of the Saramakas, it is also true that Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention should not be interpreted in a way that prevents the State from granting any type of\u000aconcession for the exploration and extraction of natural resources within Saramaka territory. The Court\u000aobserved that this natural resource is likely to be affected by extraction activities related to other natural\u000aresources that are not traditionally used by or essential for the survival of the Saramaka community and,\u000aconsequently, their members. That is, the extraction of one natural resource is most likely to affect the use\u000aand enjoyment of other natural resources that are necessary for the survival of the Saramakas.\u000a265. Nevertheless, the Court said that protection of the right to property under Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention is not absolute and therefore does not allow for such a strict interpretation. The Court\u000aalso recognised the interconnectedness between the right of members of indigenous and tribal peoples to\u000athe use and enjoyment of their lands and their right to those resources necessary for their survival but that\u000athese property rights, like many other rights recognised in the Convention, are subject to certain limitations\u000aand restrictions. In this sense, Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u000a36\u000a\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention states that the "law may subordinate [the] use and enjoyment [of property] to the interest\u000aof society." But the Court also said that it had previously held that, in accordance with Article 21\u000a×\u000a\u2022 Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\u000aand enjoyment to the interest of society.\u000a\u2022 No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\u000apublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\u000a\u2022 Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\u000ahttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the Convention, a State may restrict the use and enjoyment of the right to property where the restrictions\u000aare: a) previously established by law; b) necessary; c) proportional, and d) with the aim of achieving a\u000alegitimate objective in a democratic society. 148\u000a266. The Saramaka case is analogous to the instant case with respect to ruby mining. The IActHR\u000aanalysed whether gold-mining concessions within traditional Saramaka territory have affected natural\u000aresources that have been traditionally used and are necessary for the survival of the members of the\u000aSaramaka community. According to the evidence submitted before the Court, the Saramaka community,\u000atraditionally, did not use gold as part of their cultural identity or economic system. Despite possible\u000aindividual exceptions, the Saramaka community do not identify themselves with gold nor have\u000ademonstrated a particular relationship with this natural resource, other than claiming a general right to "own\u000aeverything, from the very top of the trees to the very deepest place that you could go under the ground."\u000aNevertheless, the Court stated that, because any gold mining activity within Saramaka territory will\u000anecessarily affect other natural resources necessary for the survival of the Saramakas, such as waterways,\u000athe State has a duty to consult with them, in conformity with their traditions and customs, regarding any\u000aproposed mining concession within Saramaka territory, as well as allow the members of the community to\u000areasonably participate in the benefits derived from any such possible concession, and perform or supervise\u000aan assessment on the environmental and social impact prior to the commencement of the project. The\u000asame analysis would apply regarding concessions in the instant case of the Endorois.\u000a267. In the instant case of the Endorois, the Respondent State has a duty to evaluate whether a restriction\u000aof these private property rights is necessary to preserve the survival of the Endorois community. The\u000aAfrican Commission is aware that the Endoroids do not have an attachment to ruby. Nevertheless, it is\u000ainstructive to note that the African Commission decided in The Ogoni case that the right to natural\u000aresources contained within their traditional lands vested in the indigenous people. This decision made clear\u000athat a people inhabiting a specific region within a state can claim the protection of Article 21.149 Article 14 of\u000athe African Charter indicates that the two-pronged test of 'in the interest of public need or in the general\u000ainterest of the community' and 'in accordance with appropriate laws' should be satisfied.\u000a268. As far as the African Commission is aware, that has not been done by the Respondent State. The\u000aAfrican Commission is of the view the Endorois have the right to freely dispose of their wealth and natural\u000aresources in consultation with the Respondent State. Article 21(2) also concerns the obligations of a State\u000aParty to the African Charter in cases of a violation by spoliation, through provision for restitution and\u000acompensation. The Endorois have never received adequate compensation or restitution of their land.\u000aAccordingly, the Respondent State is found to have violated Article 21 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 22\u000a\u000a269. The Complainants allege that the Endorois' right to development have been violated as a result of the\u000aRespondent State's creation of a game reserve and the Respondent State's failure to adequately involve\u000athe Endorois in the development process.\u000a37\u000a\u000a270. In rebutting the Complainants' allegations, the Respondent State argues that the task of communities\u000awithin a participatory democracy is to contribute to the well-being of society at large and not only to care\u000aselfishly for one's own community at the risk of others. It argues that the Baringo and Koibatek Country\u000aCouncils are not only representing the Endorois, but other clans of the Tugen tribe, of which the Endorois\u000aare only a clan. However, to avoid the temptation of one community domineering the other, the Kenyan\u000apolitical system embraces the principle of a participatory model of community through regular competitive\u000aelection for representatives in those councils. It states that elections are by adult suffrage and are free and\u000afair.\u000a271. The Respondent State also submits it has instituted an ambitious programme for universal free\u000aprimary education and an agricultural recovery programme which is aimed at increasing the household\u000aincomes of the rural poor, including the Endorois; and initiated programmes for the equitable distribution of\u000abudgetary resources through the Constituency Development Fund, Constituency Bursary Funds,\u000aConstituency Aids Committees and District Roads Board.\u000a272. It adds that for a long time, tourism in Kenya has been on the decline. This, it argues, has been\u000aoccasioned primarily by the ethnic disturbance in the Coast and the Rift Valley provinces which are the\u000amajor tourist circuits in Kenya, of which the Complainants land falls and therefore it is expected that the\u000aCountry Councils of Baringo and Koibatek were affected by the economic down turn.\u000a273. Further rebutting the allegations of the Complainants, the Respondent State argues that the\u000aComplainants state in paragraph 239 of their merits brief that due to lack of access to the salts licks and\u000atheir usual pasture, their cattle died in large numbers, thereby making them unable to pay their taxes and\u000athat, consequently, the government took away more cattle in tax; and that they were also unable to pay for\u000aprimary and secondary education for their children is utterly erroneous as tax is charged on income.\u000aAccording to the Respondent State it argues that if the Endorois were not able to raise income which\u000aamounts to the taxable brackets from their animal husbandly, they were obviously not taxed. The\u000aRespondent State adds that this allegation is false and intended to portray the Government in bad light.\u000a274. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants allege that the consultations that took place were\u000anot in 'good faith' or with the objective of achieving agreement or consent, and furthermore that the\u000aRespondent State failed to honour the promises made to the Endorois community with respect to revenue\u000asharing from the game reserve, having a certain percentage of jobs, relocation to fertile land and\u000acompensation. The Respondent State accuses the Complainants of attempting to mislead the African\u000aCommission because the County Council collects all the revenues in the case of game reserves and such\u000arevenues are ploughed back to the communities within the jurisdictions of the County Council through\u000adevelopment projects carried out by the County Council.\u000a275. Responding to the allegation that the game reserve made it particularly difficult for the Endorois to\u000aaccess basic herbal medicine necessary for maintaining a healthy life, the Respondent State argues that\u000athe prime purpose of gazetting the national reserve is conservation. Also responding to the claim that the\u000aRespondent State has granted several mining and logging concessions to third parties, and from which the\u000aEndorois have not benefited, the Respondent State asserts that the community has been well informed of\u000athose prospecting for minerals in the area. It further states that the community's mining committee had\u000aentered into an agreement with the Kenyan company prospecting for minerals, implying that the Endorois\u000aare fully involved in all community decisions.\u000a276. The Respondent State also argues that the community is represented in the Country Council by its\u000aelected councillors, therefore presenting the community the opportunity to always be represented in the\u000aforum where decisions are made pertaining to development. The Respondent State argues that all the\u000adecisions complained about have had to be decided upon by a full council meeting.\u000a277. The African Commission is of the view that the right to development is a two-pronged test, that it is\u000aboth constitutive and instrumental, or useful as both a means and an end. A violation of either the\u000aprocedural or substantive element constitutes a violation of the right to development. Fulfilling only one of\u000athe two prongs will not satisfy the right to development. The African Commission notes the Complainants'\u000aarguments that recognising the right to development requires fulfilling five main criteria: it must be\u000aequitable, non-discriminatory, participatory, accountable, and transparent, with equity and choice as\u000aimportant, over-arching themes in the right to development.150\u000a278. In that regard it takes note of the report of the UN Independent Expert who said that development is\u000anot simply the state providing, for example, housing for particular individuals or peoples; development is\u000ainstead about providing people with the ability to choose where to live. He states "... the state or any other\u000aauthority cannot decide arbitrarily where an individual should live just because the supplies of such housing\u000a38\u000a\u000aare made available". Freedom of choice must be present as a part of the right to development.151\u000a279. The Endorois believe that they had no choice but to leave the Lake and when some of them tried to\u000areoccupy their former land and houses they were met with violence and forced relocations. The\u000aComplainants argue this lack of choice directly contradicts the guarantees of the right to development. The\u000aAfrican Commission also notes a Report produced for the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations\u000arequiring that "indigenous peoples are not coerced, pressured or intimidated in their choices of\u000adevelopment."152 Had the Respondent State allowed conditions to facilitate the right to development as in\u000athe African Charter, the development of the Game Reserve would have increased the capabilities of the\u000aEndorois, as they would have had a possibility to benefit from the game reserve. However, the forced\u000aevictions eliminated any choice as to where they would live.\u000a280. The African Commission notes the Respondent State's submissions that the community is well\u000arepresented in the decision making structure, but this is disputed by the Complainants. In paragraph 27 of\u000athe Complainants Merits brief, they allege that the Endorois have no say in the management of their\u000aancestral land. The EWC, the representative body of the Endorois community, have been refused\u000aregistration, thus denying the right of the Endorois to fair and legitimate consultation. The Complainants\u000afurther allege that the failure to register the EWC has often led to illegitimate consultations taking place,\u000awith the authorities selecting particular individuals to lend their consent 'on behalf' of the community.\u000a281. The African Commission notes that its own standards state that a government must consult with\u000arespect to indigenous peoples especially when dealing with sensitive issues as land.153 The African\u000aCommission agrees with the Complainants that the consultations that the Respondent State did undertake\u000awith the community were inadequate and cannot be considered effective participation. The conditions of the\u000aconsultation failed to fulfil the African Commission's standard of consultations in a form appropriate to the\u000acircumstances. It is convinced that community members were informed of the impending project as a fait\u000aaccompli, and not given an opportunity to shape the policies or their role in the game reserve.\u000a282. Furthermore, the community representatives were in an unequal bargaining position, an accusation\u000anot denied or argued by the Respondent State, being both illiterate and having a far different understanding\u000aof property use and ownership than that of the Kenyan Authorities. The African Commission agrees that it\u000awas incumbent upon the Respondent State to conduct the consultation process in such a manner that\u000aallowed the representatives to be fully informed of the agreement, and participate in developing parts\u000acrucial to the life of the community. It also agrees with the Complainants that the inadequacy of the\u000aconsultation undertaken by the Respondent State is underscored by Endorois' actions after the creation of\u000athe game reserve. The Endorois believed, and continued to believe even after their eviction, that the game\u000areserve and their pastoralist way of life would not be mutually exclusive and that they would have a right of\u000are-entry on to their land. In failing to understand their permanent eviction, many families did not leave the\u000alocation until 1986.\u000a283. The African Commission wishes to draw the attention of the Respondent State that Article 2(3)\u000a× States have the right and the duty to formulate appropriate national development policies that aim at the\u000aconstant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis of their\u000aactive, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of the benefits resulting\u000atherefrom. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/rtd.htm accessed 26.10.2010\u000aof the UN Declaration on Development notes that the right to development includes "active, free and\u000ameaningful participation in development".154 The result of development should be empowerment of the\u000aEndorois community. It is not sufficient for the Kenyan authorities merely to give food aid to the Endorois.\u000aThe capabilities and choices of the Endorois must improve in order for the right to development to be\u000arealised.\u000a284. The case of the Yakye Axa is instructive. The Inter-American Court found that the members of the\u000aYakye Axa community live in extremely destitute conditions as a consequence of lack of land and access to\u000anatural resources, caused by the facts that were the subject matter of proceedings in front of the Court as\u000awell as the precariousness of the temporary settlement where they have had to remain, waiting for a\u000asolution to their land claim.\u000a285. The IActHR noted that, according to statements from members of the Yakye Axa community during\u000athe public hearing, the members of that community might have been able to obtain part of the means\u000anecessary for their subsistence if they had been in possession of their traditional lands. Displacement of the\u000amembers of the community from those lands has caused special and grave difficulties to obtain food,\u000aprimarily because the area where their temporary settlement is located does not have appropriate\u000aconditions for cultivation or to practice their traditional subsistence activities, such as hunting, fishing, and\u000a39\u000a\u000agathering. Furthermore, in this settlement the members of the Yakye Axa Community do not have access\u000ato appropriate housing with the basic minimum services, such as clean water and toilets.\u000a286. The precariousness of the Endorois' post-dispossession settlement has had similar effects. No\u000acollective land of equal value was ever accorded (thus failing the test of 'in accordance with the law', as the\u000alaw requires adequate compensation). The Endorois were relegated to semi-arid land, which proved\u000aunsustainable for pastoralism, especially in view of the strict prohibition on access to the Lake area's\u000amedicinal salt licks or traditional water sources. Few Endorois got individual titles in the Mochongoi Forest,\u000athough the majority live on the arid land on the outskirts of the Reserve.155\u000a287. In the case of the Yakye Axa community, the Court established that the State did not guarantee the\u000aright of the members of the Yakye Axa community to communal property. The Court deemed that this had a\u000anegative effect on the right of the members of the community to a decent life, because it deprived them of\u000athe possibility of access to their traditional means of subsistence, as well as to the use and enjoyment of\u000athe natural resources necessary to obtain clean water and to practice traditional medicine to prevent and\u000acure illnesses.\u000a288. In the instant communication in front of the African Commission, video evidence from the\u000aComplainants shows that access to clean drinking water was severely undermined as a result of loss of\u000atheir ancestral land (Lake Bogoria) which has ample fresh water sources. Similarly, their traditional means\u000aof subsistence - through grazing their animals - has been curtailed due to lack of access to the green\u000apastures of their traditional land. Elders commonly cite having lost more than half of their cattle since the\u000adisplacement.156 The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State has done very little to\u000aprovide necessary assistance in these respects.\u000a289. Closely allied with the right to development is the issue of participation. The IActHR has stated that in\u000aensuring the effective participation of the Saramaka people in development or investment plans within their\u000aterritory, the State has a duty to actively consult with the said community according to their customs and\u000atraditions. This duty requires the State to both accept and disseminate information, and entails constant\u000acommunication between the parties. These consultations must be in good faith, through culturally\u000aappropriate procedures and with the objective of reaching an agreement.\u000a290. In the instant communication, even though the Respondent State says that it has consulted with the\u000aEndorois community, the African Commission is of the view that this consultation was not sufficient. It is\u000aconvinced that the Respondent State did not obtain the prior, informed consent of all the Endorois before\u000adesignating their land as a Game Reserve and commencing their eviction. The Respondent State did not\u000aimpress upon the Endorois any understanding that they would be denied all rights of return to their land,\u000aincluding unfettered access to grazing land and the medicinal salt licks for their cattle. The African\u000aCommission agrees that the Complainants had a legitimate expectation that even after their initial eviction,\u000athey would be allowed access to their land for religious ceremonies and medicinal purposes - the reason, in\u000afact why they are in front of the African Commission.\u000a291. Additionally, the African Commission is of the view that any development or investment projects that\u000awould have a major impact within the Endorois territory, the State has a duty not only to consult with the\u000acommunity, but also to obtain their free, prior, and informed consent, according to their customs and\u000atraditions.\u000a292. From the oral testimony and even the written brief submitted by the Complainants, the African\u000aCommission is informed that the Endorois representatives who represented the community in discussions\u000awith the Respondent State were illiterates, impairing their ability to understand the documents produced by\u000athe Respondent State. The Respondent State did not contest that statement. The African Commission\u000aagrees with the Complainants that the Respondent State did not ensure that the Endorois were accurately\u000ainformed of the nature and consequences of the process, a minimum requirement set out by the\u000aInter-American Commission in the Dann case.157\u000a293. In this sense, it is important to note that the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights\u000aand Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People observed that: "[w]herever [large-scale projects] occur in\u000aareas occupied by indigenous peoples it is likely that their communities will undergo profound social and\u000aeconomic changes that are frequently not well understood, much less foreseen, by the authorities in charge\u000aof promoting them. [...] The principal human rights effects of these projects for indigenous peoples relate to\u000aloss of traditional territories and land, eviction, migration and eventual resettlement, depletion of resources\u000anecessary for physical and cultural survival, destruction and pollution of the traditional environment, social\u000aand community disorganization, long-term negative health and nutritional impacts as well as, in some\u000acases, harassment and violence." Consequently, the U.N. Special Rapporteur determined that "[f]ree, prior\u000a40\u000a\u000aand informed consent is essential for the [protection of] human rights of indigenous peoples in relation to\u000amajor development projects."159\u000a294. In relation to benefit sharing, the IActHR in the Saramaka case said that benefit sharing is vital both in\u000arelation to the right to development and by extension the right to own property. The right to development\u000awill be violated when the development in question decreases the well-being of the community. The African\u000aCommission similarly notes that the concept of benefit-sharing also serves as an important indicator of\u000acompliance for property rights; failure to duly compensate (even if the other criteria of legitimate aim and\u000aproportionality are satisfied) result in a violation of the right to property.\u000a295. The African Commission further notes that in the 1990 'African Charter on Popular Participation in\u000aDevelopment and Transformation' benefit sharing is key to the development process. In the present context\u000aof the Endorois, the right to obtain "just compensation" in the spirit of the African Charter translates into a\u000aright of the members of the Endorois community to reasonably share in the benefits made as a result of a\u000arestriction or deprivation of their right to the use and enjoyment of their traditional lands and of those natural\u000aresources necessary for their survival.\u000a296. In this sense, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has recommended not only\u000athat the prior informed consent of communities must be sought when major exploitation activities are\u000aplanned in indigenous territories but also "that the equitable sharing of benefits to be derived from such\u000aexploitation be ensured." In the instant case, the Respondent State should ensure mutually acceptable\u000abenefit sharing. In this context, pursuant to the spirit of the African Charter benefit sharing may be\u000aunderstood as a form of reasonable equitable compensation resulting from the exploitation of traditionally\u000aowned lands and of those natural resources necessary for the survival of the Endorois community.\u000a297. The African Commission is convinced that the inadequacy of the consultations left the Endorois feeling\u000adisenfranchised from a process of utmost importance to their life as a people. Resentment of the unfairness\u000awith which they had been treated inspired some members of the community to try to reclaim the Mochongoi\u000aForest in 1974 and 1984, meet with the President to discuss the matter in 1994 and 1995, and protest the\u000aactions in peaceful demonstrations. The African Commission agrees that if consultations had been\u000aconducted in a manner that effectively involved the Endorois, there would have been no ensuing confusion\u000aas to their rights or resentment that their consent had been wrongfully gained. It is also convinced that they\u000ahave faced substantive losses - the actual loss in well-being and the denial of benefits accruing from the\u000agame reserve. Furthermore, the Endorois have faced a significant loss in choice since their eviction from\u000athe land. It agrees that the Endorois, as beneficiaries of the development process, were entitled to an\u000aequitable distribution of the benefits derived from the game reserve.\u000a298. The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State bears the burden for creating\u000aconditions favourable to a people's development.160 It is certainly not the responsibility of the Endorois\u000athemselves to find alternate places to graze their cattle or partake in religious ceremonies. The Respondent\u000aState, instead, is obligated to ensure that the Endorois are not left out of the development process or\u000abenefits. The African Commission agrees that the failure to provide adequate compensation and benefits,\u000aor provide suitable land for grazing indicates that the Respondent State did not adequately provide for the\u000aEndorois in the development process. It finds against the Respondent State that the Endorois community\u000ahas suffered a violation of Article 22 of the Charter.\u000a\u000aRecommendations of the African Commission\u000aIn view of the above, the African Commission finds that the Respondent State is in violation of Articles 1, 8,\u000a14, 17, 21 and 22 of the African Charter. The African Commission recommends that the Respondent State:\u000a\u000a(a) Recognise rights of ownership to the Endorois and Restitute Endorois ancestral land.\u000a(b) Ensure that the Endorois community has unrestricted access to Lake Bogoria and surrounding sites for\u000areligious and cultural rites and for grazing their cattle.\u000a(c) Pay adequate compensation to the community for all the loss suffered. (d) Pay royalties to the Endorois\u000afrom existing economic activities and ensure that they benefit from employment possibilities within the\u000areserve.\u000a41\u000a\u000a(e) Grant registration to the Endorois Welfare Committee.\u000a(f) Engage in dialogue with the complainants for the effective implementation of these recommendations.\u000a(g) Report on the implementation of these recommendations within three months from the date of\u000anotification.\u000a2. The African Commission avails its good offices to assist the parties in the implementation of these\u000arecommendations.\u000aDone in Banjul, The Gambia at the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights held from 11th - 25th November 2009.\u000a\u000a42\u000a\u000a

aV277/03 Spilg and Mack & DITSHWANELO (on behalf of\u000aLehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi) v. Botswana\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The Communication is submitted by Brain Spilg an advocate in South Africa and Unoda Mack, an\u000aAttorney with Mack Bahuma & Moncho based in Botswana. The authors of the Communication are\u000aappointed pro deo 1 representatives for Mr. Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi (hereinafter Kobedi), now\u000adeceased.\u000a2. The Complainants allege that on the 14 October 1998, Kobedi was convicted and sentenced to death by\u000athe High Court of Botswana for murder of a Sergeant of the Police force of Botswana - Sgt. Kebotsetswe\u000aGoepamang on 22 May 1993.\u000a3. According to the Complainants, it is alleged that Sgt. Kebotsetswe Goepamang died as a result of a\u000abullet wound, received during the course of a police manhunt on the 22 May 1993 from Kobedi who had\u000aescaped from custody. The Complainants however maintained that the shot had been fired by another\u000apoliceman and not by Kobedi. They claim that he had been wrongly charged with the murder of Sgt.\u000aKebotsetswe Goepamang.\u000a4. The Complainants submit that Sgt. Goepamang had been shot by a high velocity firearm, AK 47, a type\u000aused by the police force and not a low velocity firearm such as found in possession of the accused/victim\u000awhich was a Kalashnikov 9mm. It is further submitted by the Complainants that were it not for gross\u000amedical mismanagement by the hospitals and medical staff treating sergeant Goepamang, he would not\u000ahave died from injuries. The Complainants state that during the trial, crucial ballistic analysis and expert\u000amedical evidence was adduced which revealed a contradiction in the initial ballistic analysis relied upon by\u000athe Court to convict Kobedi. They claim that there was gross medical negligence towards Sgt.Goepamang\u000aduring his time in hospital.\u000a5. However, the Complainants allege that the Court refused to receive or test the said objective, material\u000aand compelling evidence thereby violating Articles 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights (hereinafter the African Charter). They claimed that this evidence was critical to proving the\u000ainnocence of Kobedi and to addressing the question whether the death sentence was the most appropriate\u000apunishment.\u000a6. The Complainants also submit that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation for Court to\u000aimpose a death sentence for murder where no extenuating circumstances are shown violates Articles 2, 3,\u000a4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\u000a7. Furthermore, the Complainants submit that Kobedi was living under fear of the imposition of the death\u000asentence for over a decade since he was first arrested and was on death row since September 1998. The\u000acomplainants allege that the long delay in trying Kobedi also exposed him to unnecessary cruel, inhuman\u000aand degrading treatment for the reason that he had lived for an unconscionable amount of time awaiting the\u000aimposition of a death sentence.\u000a8. It is also allege by the Complainants that Kobedi was likely to suffer unnecessary inhuman treatment and\u000apunishment not only because the execution will be carried out by the cruel method of death by hanging, but\u000aalso because he was aware that his medical ailment would have caused him greater and more prolonged\u000aagony during the execution than if he were medically fit.\u000a9. Kobedi was executed before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (hereinafter the\u000aAfrican Commission or the Commission) could initiate an appeal for Provisional Measures.\u000a10. From the foregoing, the Complainants request the African Commission to:\u000a\u2022 Hold that there has been a violation of Articles 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the African Charter by the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a\u2022 Urge the Respondent State not to impose the death sentence on the victim and not to carry out the\u000adeath sentence by the method of hanging.\u000a\u2022 Adopt such further or other recommendations and procedures as to protect the victim's rights under\u000athe African Charter.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a11. The Complainants alleges a violation of Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a12. The Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 18 July 2003.\u000a13. On 21 July 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainants acknowledging\u000areceipt of the Communication and requesting information as to the veracity of the information received at\u000athe Secretariat of the African Commission that Kobedi had been executed on the 18 July 2003. There was\u000ano response from the Complainants in this regard.\u000a14. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6 to 20 November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission decided to be seized of the matter.\u000a15. On 7 November 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the\u000aComplainants in response to its letter of 21 July 2003 which tried to confirm the execution of Kobedi.\u000a16. On 14 November 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the\u000aComplainants indicating that DITSHWANELO, a human right NGO based in Botswana was an interested\u000aparty in this Communication and is therefore authorized to access any information relating to the\u000aCommunication.\u000a17. On 4 December 2003, the parties to the Communication were informed accordingly and requested to\u000aforward their written submissions on Admissibility of the Communication within 3 months.\u000a18. By Email dated 4 March 2004, the Complainants forwarded a copy of their submissions on Admissibility\u000aof the Communication. Annexes to the submissions were transmitted by fax on the same day.\u000a19. On 8 March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the Complainants\u000asubmissions and forwarded a copy of the said submissions to the Responsible State by DHL courier\u000aservice.\u000a20. By Note Verbale dated 25 May 2004, the Secretariat received a preliminary response from the\u000aRespondent State on the Admissibility of the Communication. It also requested the African Commission to\u000adefer consideration of the Communication to the next Session in order to enable it to submit supplementary\u000aarguments after obtaining the original Complaint submitted by the Complainants.\u000a21. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 21 May to 4 June 2004, the African\u000aCommission considered the request for deferment from the Respondent State and decided to defer\u000aconsideration of the Communication on the Admissibility to the 36th Ordinary Session so as to allow the\u000aRespondent State to forward exhaustive written submissions on Admissibility.\u000a22. By Note Verbale dated 15 June 2004, the Respondent State was notified of the African Commission's\u000adecision and a copy of the Communication as well as the Complainants' submissions on Admissibility were\u000aalso transmitted to the Respondent State.\u000a23. By letter dated 15 June 2004, the Complainants were also notified of the decision of the African\u000aCommission.\u000a24. By Note Verbale of 16 September 2004 the Secretariat of the African Commission reminded the\u000aRespondent State to submit all its arguments on Admissibility.\u000a25. At the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 23 November to 7 December 2004, the\u000aAfrican Commission heard oral submissions from the Respondent State only and deferred its decision on\u000athe matter pending a response from the Complainants on the observations made by the Respondent State\u000aregarding the issue of the Complainants' locus standi.\u000a26. By Note Verbale dated 13 December 2004, the Respondent state was notified of the decision of the\u000aAfrican Commission. By letter of same date the Secretariat of the African Commission by DHL courier\u000aservice forwarded the preliminary submission of the State on the question of locus standi and its decision to\u000adefer consideration on Admissibility pending the Complainants' response on the Respondent State's\u000asubmissions on locus standi.\u000a27. On the 12 January 2005, the Complainants acknowledged receipt of the Secretariat's letter of 13\u000aDecember 2004 and indicated that a proper response would be sent in due course.\u000a28. By the letter dated 28 February 2005, the Secretariat reminded the Complainants to submit their\u000aobservations on the question of locus standi before 13 March 2005 and informed them that the African\u000a2\u000a\u000aCommission would consider the Admissibility of the Communication at its 37th Ordinary Session.\u000a29. On 29 April 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the Complainants' response to\u000athe Respondent State's observation on locus standi.\u000a30. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul from 27 April to 11 May 2005, the African Commission\u000adeferred consideration of the Communication pending the finalization of a study on the question of locus\u000astandi and legal interest within the context of its Communication Procedure.\u000a31. By Note Verbale dated 10 June 2005, the Respondent State was notified of the decision of the African\u000aCommission and by the letter of the same date the Complainants were also notified of the African\u000aCommission's decision.\u000a32. During the 38th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication in light of the\u000aobjections raised by the Respondent State regarding the issue of locus standi of the Complainants and\u000adecided to declare the Communication Admissible.\u000a33. By Note Verbale and letter dated 15 December 2006, the Respondent State and the Complainants\u000awere notified of the African Commission's decision.\u000a34. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in May 2006, the African Commission considered the Communication,\u000aand decided to defer further consideration thereon to its 40th Ordinary Session.\u000a35. At its 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission further considered the Communication and\u000adeferred further consideration to its 41st Ordinary Session.\u000a36. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 9 February 2007, the parties were reminded of the African\u000aCommission's decision on Admissibility and were requested to submit their arguments on the Merits by 8\u000aApril 2007, for the African Commission's consideration at its 41st Ordinary Session.\u000a37. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 27 April 2007, the African Commission reminded the parties of its\u000arequest for their arguments on the Merits and requested them to make their submissions latest by 10 May\u000a2007.\u000a38. At its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred\u000afurther consideration to its 42nd Ordinary Session to allow both parties submit on the Merits.\u000a39. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 10 July 2007, both parties were notified of the African Commission's\u000adecision.\u000a40. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 11 September 2007, the African Commission reminded both parties\u000ato submit their arguments on the Merits.\u000a41. By Email of 3 October 2007, the Secretariat received the submissions on the Merits from the\u000aComplainants.\u000a42. By Note Verbale dated 17 October 2007, the African Commission forwarded the Complainants'\u000asubmissions to the Respondent State and by a letter of the same date acknowledged receipt of the\u000aComplainant's submission on the Merits.\u000a43. By Note Verbale of 22 October 2007, the Respondent State acknowledged receipt of the Complainants'\u000asubmissions on the Merits, but informed the African Commission that the submissions were received after\u000athe deadline had passed and requested that the Communication be deferred to the 43rd Ordinary Session\u000ato give it time to submit its own arguments on the Merits.\u000a44. By Note Verbale of 29 October 2007, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt\u000aof the Respondent State's Note Verbale and informed the Respondent State that a decision on its request\u000awill be made by the African Commission during its 42nd Ordinary Session.\u000a45. At its 42nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred its\u000adecision to the 43rd Ordinary Session to allow the Respondent State to submit its arguments on the Merits.\u000a46. On 13 May 2008, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the Respondent State's\u000asubmissions on the Merits.\u000a47. At its 43rd Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\u000adefer further considerations to the 44th Ordinary Session to allow the Complainants to be served with the\u000aRespondent State's submissions on the Merits.\u000a48. By a letter dated 17 June 2008, the Complainants were notified and served with a copy of the\u000aRespondent State's submission on the Merits.\u000a49. At its 44th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\u000adefer further consideration of same to its 45th Ordinary Session to allow the Complainants to respond to the\u000aRespondent State's submissions on the Merits.\u000a50. By Note Verbale and a letter dated the 5 January 2009, both parties were informed of this decision and\u000athe Complainants were requested to send their response before 5 March 2009.\u000a3\u000a\u000a51. At its 45th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred\u000afurther consideration, thereon, to its 46th Ordinary Session to allow the African Commission to prepare a\u000adecision on the Merits.\u000a52. At its 46th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and again\u000adeferred its decision on the Merits to its 47th Ordinary Session.\u000a53. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 14 December 2009, the Secretariat of the African Commission\u000anotified both parties of its decision.\u000a54. At its 47th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\u000adefer its decision on the Merits to its 48th Ordinary Session.\u000a55. At its 48th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\u000adefer its decision on the Merits to its 49th Ordinary Session.\u000a56. At its 49th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\u000adefer decision on the merit to the 50th Ordinary Session, and by a note verbale and a letter dated 16 August\u000a2011, both the Complainant and the Respondents were informed of the Commission's decision.\u000a57. At its 50th Ordinary Session, the African commission considered the decision on the merits and made\u000acomments. The Commission requested the Secretariat to incorporate its comments on the Communication\u000aand present it to the 10th Extra- ordinary Session for revision and adoption.\u000a58. At its 10th Extra-ordinary Session held from 12 to 16 December 2011, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered and adopted the Communication on Merit.\u000aSubmissions on Locus Standi\u000aRespondent State's Submissions on Locus Standi\u000a\u000a59. The African Commission was seized of this Communication at its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul,\u000aThe Gambia from 6 to 20 November 2003.\u000a60. In its preliminary submissions, the Respondents State argues that the Communication should be\u000adeclared inadmissible on the ground that the authors lacked locus standii to submit or assume authorship\u000aof the Communication. The Respondent State argues that both Unoda Mack, a national of Botswana, and\u000aBrain Spilg SC, a national of South Africa were briefed as pro deo to argue the appeal of Kobedi before the\u000aBotswana Court of Appeal at the instance of the Registrar of the High Court of Botswana. The Respondent\u000aState argues that though Kobedi accepted to have them as his legal representatives, they were not, as it\u000awere, the personal choice of Mr. Kobedi.\u000a61. The Respondent State submits that the Communication dated 11 July 2003 and addressed to the\u000aAfrican Commission was signed by Kobedi. However, it argues that paragraph 15 of the Complainants\u000awritten submissions on Admissibility sent by Email on 4 March 2004 lists the two lawyers as the authors of\u000athe Communication. The Respondents State assert that the said written submissions, do not, indicate to the\u000aAfrican Commission the legal interest that Messrs Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack, jointly and severally,\u000ahave in the Communication such that they should assume authorship of it, and the basis and source of that\u000alegal interest. The Respondent State argues that, instead, what Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack attempt to\u000ado in paragraph 3-14 of the submissions on Admissibility is to make a case for the African Commission to\u000ahear a matter originated by the deceased.\u000a62. The Respondent State adds that Brain Spilg SC is a national of a foreign country, and as such, the only\u000aconnection he has with Botswana is in relation to the privilege accorded him by Botswana to appear before\u000aher Courts. The Respondent State therefore questions whether Brain Spilg SC has any legitimate legal\u000ainterest in the affairs of the country?\u000a63. The Respondent State further argues that neither the laws of Botswana nor international laws\u000aincorporate the actio popularis doctrine. Consequently, Messrs Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack must\u000ademonstrate a sufficient legal interest in the Communication for them to possess locus standi to author it.\u000aThe Respondent State contends that in adhering to the African Charter, it did not understand that it was\u000agiving strangers the carte blanche to occupy Botswana and utilize its resources in dealing with\u000aCommunications of this nature.\u000a64. Accordingly, the Respondent State submits that although the Communication was originally and\u000aproperly before the African Commission, it does not have an author to pursue it, as Brain Spilg SC and\u000aUnoda Mack do not have the competency to pursue the matter on behalf of Kobedi who is now deceased.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000aComplainants' Submissions on Locus Standi\u000a\u000a65. In response to the Respondent State's submissions, the Complainants confirmed they were appointed\u000aby the Registrar of the High Court of Botswana to represent Kobedi during the proceedings before the\u000aBotswana Courts. They argue that Brain Spilg SC has practiced Law in Botswana since 1982, and in spite\u000aof the changes in the law affecting practice by non-resident practitioners, Brain Spilg SC had continued to\u000areceive instructions from the Government of Botswana and its parastatal bodies, ordinary corporations and\u000aindividuals. The Complainants said the facts that advocate Brain Spilg SC is not a citizen of Botswana is\u000airrelevant to the authorship of this Communication because it is not a requirement under the African\u000aCommission's Communication procedure. Indeed the Complainants states that the Victim (Kobedi), as well\u000aas other accused persons whose capital cases have not been finally disposed of, are non-citizens of\u000aBotswana.\u000a66. On the question of lack of interest, the Complainants aver that the information on the Communication\u000aProcedures prepared by the Secretariat of the African Commission does not require the author to indicate\u000atheir legal interest when submitting a Communication. They argue that by requiring Complainants to\u000aindicate their legal interest, the Respondent State challenges the very purpose and function for which the\u000aAfrican Commission was established.\u000a67. Additionally, the Complainants argue that Article 56 of the African Charter which governs the\u000aAdmissibility of a Communication lists only seven Admissibility requirements, and that ,,legal interest" or\u000a,,citizenship of the Complainant" are not included in that list. They argue further that Article 56 provides a\u000aminimum threshold requirement, which is intended to encourage, rather than stifle the submission of\u000aallegations of human rights violations before the African Commission. Furthermore, stated that Article 56\u000aassist the African Commission to ensure that vexatious Communications are sifted out, and allow\u000aissue-driven Communications to be entertained by it,.\u000a68. Regarding the Respondent State's argument that actio popularis is not part of their domestic law, the\u000aComplainants submit that this assertion is irrelevant because the Respondent State did not sign a domestic\u000adocument, but sign an international human rights document, which by its very nature is intended to have\u000aremedial consequences. This requires signatory States to submit themselves to scrutiny by the African\u000aCommission in respect of the alleged violations of human and peoples' rights.\u000a69. In conclusion, the Complainants assert that by requiring the Complainants to demonstrate direct legal\u000ainterest in a Communication would be restrictive and ,,impermissibly narrow which will fail to have regard to\u000athe accepted constitutional norms and the express provisions of the African Charter". Furthermore, the\u000aComplainants submit that such an approach would also fail to take into account the function and purpose of\u000athe African Commission. Consequently, it is the Complainants' prayers that a generous and purposive\u000aconstruction be given to Article 56 in order to give effect to the spirit of the African Charter.\u000a70. The thrust of the Respondent State's submissions is that though originally properly before the African\u000aCommission, the Communication is now without an author to pursue it as a result of Kobedi's execution.\u000aAccordingly, the Communication should be declared Inadmissible because the present authors pursuing\u000athe matter are without a mandate cum locus standi.\u000a71. The objection raised by the Respondent State raises the issue of whether or not the Complainants in\u000athis Communication have locus standi before the African Commission, that is, whether Messrs Brain Spilg\u000aSC and Unoda Mack have any legal interest in the matter so as to assume authorship of it on Kobedi's\u000abehalf. This issue also interrogates the principle of actio popularis within the context of the African Charter.\u000aAfrican Commission's Ruling on the Preliminary Determination on Locus Standi\u000a\u000a72. Having looked at the Admissibility requirement under Article 56 and bearing in mind the objections\u000araised by the Respondent State on the locus standi of the Complainants, the African Commission decides\u000aas follows:\u000a73. The African Commission notes that neither the African Charter nor its Rules of Procedure makes\u000aprovisions on the locus standii of parties before it. In fact, the only Charter provision that could bear any\u000arelevance to the issue of locus standi is Article 56(1) of the African Charter. This provision relates to\u000aauthors of a Communication submitted before the African Commission and provides: "Communications\u000arelating to Human and Peoples' Rights referred to in Article 55 received by the Commission shall be\u000aconsidered if they: (1) indicate their authors even if the later request anonymity; .... "\u000a74. It is very clear that Article 56(1) simply requires that the Communication indicate its author(s), even if\u000athey would like to remain anonymous. This provision does not specify which parties have standings before\u000a5\u000a\u000athe African Commission. Indeed nowhere is it stated within the African Charter or African Commission's\u000aRules that there should be a link between the author of a Communication and the victim of a human rights\u000aviolation.\u000a75. In fact, the African Commission has interpreted the relevant Article 56(1) of the African Charter, and\u000aalso addressed the question of locus standi before it in the Consolidated case of Communication 54/91,\u000a61/91, 98/93, 164/97, to 196/97, 210/98. 2 In this case, the African Commission held that: "Article 56(1) of\u000athe Charter demands that anyone submitting Communications to the Commission relating to human and\u000apeoples' rights must reveal their identity. They do not necessarily have to be victims of such violations or\u000amembers of their families. This characteristic of the African Charter reflects ,,sensitivity to the practical\u000adifficulties that individuals can face in countries where human rights are violated. The national or\u000ainternationals channels of remedy may not be accessible to the victims themselves or may be dangerous to\u000apursue." 3 There is therefore no requirement of legal interest for the authorship of a Communication. 4\u000a76. Consequently, the African Commission has, through its practice and jurisprudence, adopted a generous\u000aaccess to its Complaint Procedure. It has adopted the actio popularis principle, allowing everyone the legal\u000ainterest and capacity to file a Communication, for its consideration. For this purpose, non- victim individuals,\u000agroups and NGOs constantly submit Communications to the African Commission. More so, the African\u000aCommission, has, through its Guidelines on the Submission of Communications5 , encouraged the\u000asubmission of Communications on behalf of victims of human rights violations, especially those who are\u000aunable to represent themselves.\u000a77. In Communication 155/966 , for example, the African Commission endorsed the actio popularis\u000adoctrine when it "thank(ed) the two human rights NGOs who brought the matter under its purview: the\u000aSocial and Economic Rights Action Center (Nigeria) and the Center for Economic and Social Rights (USA).\u000aSuch is the demonstration of the usefulness to the African Commission and individuals of actio popularis,\u000awhich is wisely allowed under the African Charter." The actio popularis doctrine allows persons interested in\u000athe protection of human rights in Africa to seize the African Commission on behalf of persons who for one\u000areason or the other, cannot do so on their own.\u000a78. The rationale for this broad approach to locus standi is in view of the fact that the African Commission,\u000amandated to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in Africa7 , bears in mind the fact that in some\u000ainstances, individuals in Africa whose rights are violated, may be faced with practical difficulties that may\u000apreclude them from pursuing national or international legal remedies on their own behalf. The African\u000aCommission has therefore adopted the practice of entertaining Communications from persons who are\u000ainterested in protecting human rights on the continent. These may be the victims themselves or civil society\u000aorganizations acting on behalf of victims of the alleged violations.8 This actio popularis principle has been\u000aconfirmed in various subsequent decisions of the Africa Commission.9\u000a79. Also in relation to the requirement of citizenship, the African Commission has made it clear through its\u000ajurisprudence that the person or NGO filing the Communication need not be a national or be registered in\u000athe territory of the Respondent State. An endless list of examples of this would include the many cases\u000asubmitted to the African Commission by individuals and NGOs of non- African origin.10\u000a80. The African Commission, therefore, notes that the foregoing was its approach to locus standi when it\u000abecame seized of the present Communication, and is still its current approach to the issue. Accordingly, the\u000aAfrican Commission would address this Communication in light of its broad approach to locus standi at the\u000atime it became seized of this Communication.\u000a81. The African Commission further disagrees with the Respondent State's assertion that neither the laws\u000aof Botswana nor international law incorporates the actio popularis doctrine, and notes that this is a common\u000apractice within regional and international human rights systems which is aimed at conferring legal standing\u000ato certain groups who will not be required to have a sufficient interest in a case or to maintain the\u000aimpairment of a right. To this effect, different bodies had setup different criteria with regards to accessibility\u000ato their complaint mechanisms. The African Commission notes that, the European human rights system11\u000aand the UN Human Rights Committee,12 generally requires that the person submitting a case to be a victim\u000aof the violation. But there are exceptions to this rule, where non-victims may bring a complaint on behalf of\u000athe victim(s).13 On the other hand, the American Convention of Human Rights permits any person or group\u000aof persons, or any non-governmental entity legally recognized in one or more Member States of the\u000aOrganization to submit a matter before the Inter-American Commission.14 The practice of the African\u000aCommission though somewhat similar to the actio popularis position under the Inter-American system, is\u000aeven wider as it places no restriction as to who can bring a Communication before it. As long as the\u000a6\u000a\u000aconditions under Article 56 of the African Charter are met by the person standing before it, the African\u000aCommission will enter the Communication. The rationale for the Commission's comparative broader\u000aapproach to the issue of locus standi has been associated with the peculiarity of the African situation, and\u000athe perceived generous intent of the African Charter.15\u000a82. From the foregoing, the African Commission will entertain the Communication brought by Messrs Brain\u000aSpilg SC and Unoda Mack, being non- victims, with no legal interest, because its jurisprudence makes it\u000aclear that there is no requirement of ,,legal interest" for authorship of a Communication.16\u000a83. The African Commission holds the fact that Mr. Brain Spilg SC is not a Citizen of Botswana as argued\u000aby the Respondents will have bearing on this Communication. It is simply not a requirement for authorship\u000aof a Communication. Any interested individual can bring a Communication on behalf of a victim and such\u000aindividuals need not be citizens of States Parties to the African Charter. The fact that Mr. Brain Spilg SC is\u000aa national of another country is immaterial. As long as he satisfies the conditions set out in Article 56 of the\u000aAfrican Charter, the African Commission will entertain the Communication as it has done, in several other\u000acases where Communications have been instituted by non-nationals of States against whom the\u000aCommunication is being instituted.17\u000a84. The African Commission is therefore unable to agree with the Respondent State's argument which\u000aseems to infer that citizenship of the authors of the Communication is a criterion within the provision of\u000aArticle 56(1) of the African Charter. This would not only be tantamount to reading new criteria into the\u000aprovision, but would also restrict the open-ended spirit found therein. Consequently, the Respondents\u000aState's argument that the Communication is now without an author to pursue it as a result of Kobedi's\u000aexecution is also unsustainable as the present Communication is properly before the African Commission\u000ain terms of Article 56(1) of the African Charter.\u000a85. The African Commission hereby concludes that the Complainants in this matter possess locus standi\u000abefore it, and will however proceed to examine the Communication in view of the other Admissibility\u000arequirements.\u000aThe Law on Admissibility\u000aComplainants' Submissions on Admissibility\u000a\u000a86. The Complainants submit that they have fulfilled all the requirements of Article 56 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a87. The Complainants submit that the Communication is jointly presented by Advocate Brain Spilg SC\u000aassisted by Attorney Unoda Mack and Ms Alica Mogwe (on behalf of Ditshwanelo). By detailing their\u000acontact email addresses as spilg@law.co.za for Brain Spilg SC and legal.ditshwanelo@info.bw for\u000aDitshwanelo, the Complainants argue that they complied with Article 56(1) of the African Charter.\u000a88. With regards to Article 56(2) of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that not only have they\u000aoutlined the Charter provisions which are allegedly violated by the Respondent State to include Articles 1,\u000a2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter, but that they have also made submissions in support of the\u000aalleged violations. The Complainants submit that the Communication, therefore, satisfies the requirements\u000aof Article 56(2) of the African Charter.\u000a89. With regards to the requirement of decorum, the Complainants submit that the tone of language used in\u000athe Communication meets the requirement of Article 56(3) of the African Charter.\u000a90. Concerning the requirement of evidential weight envisaged under Article 56(4) of the African Charter,\u000athe Complainants aver that the Communication is based on primary evidence that has been either verified\u000aunder oath or is within the personal knowledge of the authors. While conceding that there is a single\u000areference to a media article, the Complainants argued that not only is that information tangential, but also\u000athat the source of the article is verified under oath by the newspaper's editors and forms part of the records\u000aof the Botswana Court of Appeal. The Complainants submit that the provisions of Article 56(4) have been\u000aadequately met.\u000a91. On the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the\u000aComplainants aver that they have exhausted all available local remedies with respect to Kobedi's case. In\u000aparticular, aver the Complainants, the highest Court in Botswana, the Court of Appeal, has determined the\u000acase. They therefore submit that the Communication satisfies the requirements of Article 56(5) of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a92. With regards to the reasonable time factor under Article 56(6) of the African Charter, the Complainants\u000a7\u000a\u000aargue that the Communication was submitted within a period of four months since the Kobedi's stay of\u000aexecution appeal was disposed of by the Botswana Court of Appeal. The Communication, argues the\u000aComplainants, also meets the requirements of Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\u000a93. With regards to Article 56(7) of the African Charter, the Complainants submit that the instant case has\u000anot previously been determined by the African Commission and there are no other international avenues\u000athat are being explored by the Complainants as far as this matter is concerned. The Communication,\u000acontends the Complainants, satisfies the provision of Article 56(7) of the African Charter.\u000aRespondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\u000a\u000a94. In its written submission dated 25 May 2004 the Respondent State asserted that it did not concede the\u000aother grounds upon which the Complainants rely for the Admissibility of the Communication.\u000a95. However, in its oral submission made at the African Commission's 36th Ordinary Session held from 23\u000aNovember to 7 December 2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the Respondent State opted not to furnish further\u000asubmissions apart from those on locus standi. The Respondent State stated that in the event that the\u000aAfrican Commission rules in favor of the Complainants on the issue of locus standi, they would not contest\u000athe Admissibility of the Communication.\u000aCommission's Decision on Admissibility\u000a\u000aThe Admissibility of the Communications submitted before the African Commission is governed by the\u000aseven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter.\u000a96. The current Communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter which allows the\u000aAfrican Commission to receive and consider Communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of\u000athe African Charter provides that the admissibility of a Communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is\u000asubject to seven conditions.18 The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in Article\u000a56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is not satisfied, the Communication will be declared\u000ainadmissible.\u000a97. Article 56(1) of the African Charter requires that a Communication received under Article 55 of the\u000aAfrican Charter shall be considered if it "indicates their authors even if the latter requests anonymity".\u000aArticle 56(1) of the African Charter will, therefore, be satisfied if the Communication discloses the identity\u000aand details of the authors thereof.19 The purport and intent of Article 56(1) of the African Charter is to\u000aensure that the African Commission is in communication with the author. It is only through this medium of\u000acommunication that the African Commission will be assured of the author's continued interest in the case,\u000aor to request, as provided for under Rule 104 of the Rules of procedure, supplementary information if the\u000acase so requires.20\u000a98. In the instant Communication, the Complainants have disclosed that it is jointly presented by Advocate\u000aBrain Spilg SC assisted by Attorney Unoda Mack and Ms Alica Mogwe (on behalf of Ditshwanelo). The\u000aCommunication also discloses the contact Email addresses of the Complainants as spilg@law.co.za for\u000aBrain Spilg SC and legal.ditshwanelo@info.bw for Ditshwanelo. The African Commission is, therefore,\u000aholds that the Complainants have complied with Article 56(1) of the African Charter.\u000a99. Article 56(2) of the African Charter requires that the Communication must be compatible with the\u000aConstitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. With respect to the Constitutive Act, the\u000aAfrican Commission will not receive any Communication brought before it, which seeks a prayer a remedy\u000aof which will contravene any provision of the said Constitutive Act. Thus, in Katangese's Peoples'\u000aCongress V. Zaire,21 a redress which infringed on the doctrine of Uti Possidetis Juris22 enshrined in Article\u000a3 of the OAU Charter and now in Article 4 (b) of the Constitutive Act, was rejected and the case declared\u000aInadmissible.\u000a100. In Kevin Mgwanga Ngumne et al V. Cameroon,23 the African Commission, drawing inspiration from\u000aits previous decisions affirmed that, the condition relating to compatibility with the Charter, basically\u000arequires that: (a) the Communication should be brought against a State party to the African Charter;24 (b)\u000athe Communication must allege prima facie violations of rights protected by the African Charter;25 (c) the\u000aCommunication should be brought in respect of violations that occurred after ratification of the African\u000aCharter or where violations that began before the State Party ratified the African Charter have continued\u000aeven after such ratification.26 To be in conformity with the African Charter also requires the petition to\u000a8\u000a\u000acontain a certain degree of specificity, and that the allegations are not vague.27\u000a101. A careful consideration of the facts and submissions from both parties to the present Communication\u000ado not show that the instant Communication is at variance with any part of the Constitutive Act of the\u000aAfrican Union or the African Charter. The Commission is therefore of the view that the present\u000aCommunication satisfies the provision of Article 56 (2) of the Charter.\u000a102. Article 56(3) of the African Charter requires that the Communication should be presented with a\u000acertain degree of decorum. This Article prohibits the use of disparaging and/or insulting language in\u000apresenting a Communication. Although Article 56(3) does not define what constitutes disparaging or\u000ainsulting language, the African Commission in the case of IIesanmi v. Nigeria28 the Commission held inter\u000aalia, that, to be insulting, the language must be aimed at undermining the integrity and status of the\u000ainstitution (Respondent State) and bring it into disrepute.29 In this case, the African Commission held the\u000aComplainant's averments that, "the police and customs officials are corrupt, that they deal with drug\u000asmugglers, that they extort money from motorists and that the President himself was corrupt and had been\u000abribed by the drug smugglers" as an insulting language. In Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme\u000av. Cameroon,30 the African Commission also held that averments such as "Paul Biya must respond to\u000acrimes against humanity", "30 years of the criminal neo-colonial regime incarnated by the duo Ahidjo/Biya",\u000a"regime of torturers", and "government barbarisms"31 as insulting language.\u000a103. However, in Bakweri Land Claims Committee v. Cameroon32 the African Commission held that the\u000ause of strong language such as "no judge... will risk his/her career, not to mention his/her life, to handle this\u000apolitically sensitive matter..." per se will not amount to disparaging and insulting language.33\u000a104. After a careful examination of the tone of the language used in presenting the Communication, the\u000aAfrican Commission is satisfied that the Complainants have met the requirements under Article 56(3) of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a105. Article 56(4) of the African Charter requires that any Communication brought pursuant to Article 55 of\u000athe African Charter will be considered if the facts are not based exclusively on information from the mass\u000amedia. This requires that the Complainants must proof that, the evidence of the facts constituting the\u000aalleged violations, are not based exclusively on information from the mass media. While conceding that\u000athere is a single reference to news obtained from the mass media, the Complainants have argued that this\u000aCommunication is based on primary evidence within the knowledge of the Complainants.\u000a106. In the case of Sir Dawda K Jawara v. Gambia34 the African Commission held that while it will be\u000adangerous to rely exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media, it would be equally damaging\u000aif the African Commission were to reject a Communication because some aspects of it are based on news\u000adisseminated through the mass media. For this reason, the African Commission believes that the present\u000aCommunication meets Complainants the requirements of Article 56(4) of the African Charter.\u000a107. Article 56(5) of the African Charter on its part requires that Communications brought under Article 55\u000aof the African Charter shall be considered only if they "are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies, if\u000aany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged". The relevance of Article 56 (5) of the\u000aAfrican Charter is to ensure that international mechanisms are not substitutes for domestic implementation\u000aof human rights, but should be seen as tools to assist the domestic authorities to develop a sufficient\u000aprotection of human rights in their territories.\u000a108. The African Commission notes that the submissions of the Complainants that Kobedi's case has been\u000adealt with by the Botswana Court of Appeal, the apex court in the Respondent State, are relevant to the\u000aissue of exhaustion of local remedies. The African Commission is, therefore, satisfied that the\u000aCommunication has not contravened the provision of Article 56(5) of the African Charter.\u000a109. According to Article 56(6) of the African Charter, Article 55 Communications will be considered if\u000asubmitted to the African Commission within a reasonable time after the exhaustion of local remedies. While\u000athe African Charter is silent as to what amounts to a reasonable time, it is important to note here that, the\u000aissue of reasonable time is determined on a case to case bases taking into consideration all the relevant\u000afacts. The present Communication was submitted within four months following the decision of the Botswana\u000aCourt of Appeal. The period of four months in the circumstances of this case is reasonable. The African\u000aCommission, therefore, holds that the Complainants have satisfied Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\u000a110. By virtue of Article 56(7) of the African Charter, Article 55 Communication will be considered if the\u000aCommunication does not deal with cases that have already been settled by African Commission or another\u000ainternational settlement body. The requirement under Article 56(7) of the African Charter is founded on the\u000anon bis in idem rule35 which ensures that no State may be sued or condemned more than once for the\u000asame alleged human rights violations. The rule also seeks to uphold and recognize the res judicata36 status\u000a9\u000a\u000aof decisions issued by international and regional tribunals and/or bodies such as the African Commission.\u000aAccordingly, the African Commission will not entertain any Communication with the same facts and\u000aparties37 as that, which has been settled by another international body.\u000a111. In Bob Ngozi Njoku v. Egypt38 the African Commission noted that Article 56(7) of the African Charter\u000a"...talks about cases which have been settled..."39 and not cases which are still pending before other\u000ainternational mechanisms.\u000a112. The African Commission is satisfied that the Complainants, in their written submissions, have\u000aexhaustively addressed the seven Admissibility requirements under Article 56 of the African Charter and\u000ahereby declares the Communication Admissible under Article 56 of the African Charter.\u000aSubmissions on the merits\u000aComplainants' Submissions on the Merits\u000a\u000a113. The Complainants submit that the compulsory requirement under Botswana law for the Courts to\u000aimpose the death penalty for murder, where no extenuating circumstances are shown; the adoption of the\u000adoctrine of "functus officio" by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State with regards to the trial of\u000aKobedi; the clemency petition process and the use of hanging as a method of execution of Kobedi violates\u000aArticles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3 (Right not to be Discriminated and Right to Equality before the\u000alaw)\u000a114. The Complainants argue that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation that a Court\u000amust impose the death penalty for murder, absent only extenuating circumstance limits the factors that can\u000abe taken into consideration in respect of sentencing. They submit that the exclusion of considerations such\u000aas rehabilitation or such other factors personal to the victim violates Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter.\u000aThey submit that the distinction between taking into account extenuating circumstances and not taking into\u000aaccount mitigating factors is both arbitrary and discriminative.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\u000a115. The Complainants argue that because the imposition of the death penalty is qualitatively different from\u000aany other sentence or sanction that may be imposed by a Court of Law, there is a corresponding difference\u000ain the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\u000aThe Complainants rely on the decision of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Downer &\u000aTracey v. Jamaica to argue the fact that the death penalty is an exceptional form of punishment which\u000amust also be considered in interpreting Article 4 of the African Charter.\u000a116. The Complainants refer the African Commission to the of case of Maauwe & Motswetla concluded in\u000a2006 by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State to buttress the point that the criminal justice system in\u000athe Respondent State is not infallible. They argue that, because the criminal justice system is capable of\u000abeing fallible, the Courts should not ignore subsequent cogent evidence which if admitted could lead to the\u000aimposition of a lesser sentence other than the death penalty. It is forcefully submitted by the Complainants\u000athat Article 4 of the African Charter will be violated where a State Party through its judiciary imposes the\u000adeath penalty pursuant to an institutionalized process that can result in an innocent person, or a person not\u000adeserving of the death penalty, being executed because material facts revealed post-appeal cannot be\u000aconsidered by the Court.\u000a117. The Complainants further submit that the reception of such evidence seeks to ensure that only a\u000aperson, who remains, up to the time of his execution, guilty beyond all reasonable doubts of the crime and\u000ais deserving of no penalty other than the death sentenced, should be hanged. They argue that if it should\u000aarise prior to the date of his hanging that the certainty of the conviction or appropriateness of the sentence\u000ais cast into doubt by right thinking people, then such evidence must be investigated and tested, otherwise,\u000athey submit, the execution will violate Article 4 of the African Charter.\u000a118. It is argued by the Complainants that, if before his execution, it can be demonstrated by credible and\u000acogent evidence that there was an incorrect conviction or that the condemned man is deserving of a lesser\u000asentence than the death penalty, then the right to life protected under Article 4 of the African Charter can\u000aonly have content if such evidence can be tested. It is contended by the Complainants that the application\u000aof the doctrine of functus officio to exclude fresh, credible and cogent evidence that could have the effect of\u000a10\u000a\u000aa lesser sentence violates Article 4 of the African Charter.\u000a119. It is averred further by the Complainants that as far as the trial of Kobedi is concerned, this fresh\u000aevidence includes, crucial ballistic analyses that Sgt. Goepamang was struck by a high velocity firearm, AK\u000a47, a type used by the police force and not a low velocity firearm, Kalashnikov 9mm, found in possession of\u000athe Victim; vital ballistic analyses that Sgt. Goepamang was shot from the side and not from the front as\u000acontained in the High Court judgment; and expert medical evidence of gross medical negligence towards\u000aSgt. Goepamang during his time in hospital.\u000a120. In arguing that the death penalty cannot be imposed for attempted murder in the Respondent State,\u000athe Complainants make the point that even if the culprit/victim with premeditated intent, wished to kill his\u000avictim, but the victim was saved by the skills of brilliant doctors, the Court has no power to sentence the\u000aculprit to death. In the case of Kobedi, they argue that during his trial, crucial expert medical evidence was\u000aadduced revealing gross medical negligence towards Sgt. Goepamang during his time in hospital and that\u000awere it not for gross medical mismanagement by the hospitals and medical staff treating Sgt. Goepamang,\u000ahe would not have died from the injuries he sustained.\u000a121. The Complainants further argue that the imposition of the death penalty on Kobedi without recourse to\u000aany meaningful post-conviction enquiry as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed by the Courts in the\u000aRespondent State also offends Article 4 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment)\u000a122. The Complainants contend that Kobedi, according to his Medical Report suffers from a weak heart\u000acondition. They also state that the Medical Report proves that Kobedi does not only have an A-V shunt but\u000aalso needs surgery. They inform the African Commission that the Medical Report presents the following\u000aconditions of Kobedi: left subclavian arteriovenous shunt with no present evidence of heart failure or\u000aarrhythmia; irritable bowel syndrome; and mild degenerative osteoarthritis of the spine. It is\u000asubmitted by the Complainants that Kobedi was a sick man whose health condition ought to have been\u000ataken into consideration in deciding the method to be adopted for his execution.\u000a123. The Complainants further submit that the adoption of hanging as a method of executing the death\u000apenalty, and the failure of the Courts in the Respondent State to have regard to the medical condition of\u000aKobedi violates Article 5 of the African Charter, not so much because he is aware that his medical ailment\u000awill cause him greater and more prolonged agony during the execution than if he were medically fit, but\u000aalso because execution by hanging exposes the condemned man to a higher likelihood of unnecessarily\u000apainful and torturous death through strangulation.\u000a124. The Complainants aver that the post-appeal process dealing with Clemency Petitions also constitutes\u000aa violation of Article 5 of the African Charter in that the victim, his lawyers and family members were not\u000ainformed of the unsuccessful outcome of the Clemency Petition, thus, depriving the convict and his family\u000amembers the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last farewells.\u000a125. It is submitted by Complainants that the victim had been under the fear of the death penalty for over a\u000adecade since he was first arrested and that this prolonged delay constitutes cruel, unusual or degrading\u000apunishment or treatment for the reason that he lived for an unconscionable amount of time awaiting the\u000apotential imposition of a death sentence, rendering the victim's execution a violation of Article 5 of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 7 (Right to Fair Trial)\u000a126. The Complainants argue that the death penalty cannot be imposed for attempted murder in the\u000aRespondent State, and that even if the culprit with premeditated intent, wished to kill his victim, but the\u000avictim was saved by the skills of brilliant doctors, the Court has no power to sentence the culprit to death in\u000aterms of the criminal code of the Respondent State. In further emphasizing that during Kobedi's trial, crucial\u000aexpert medical evidence was adduced revealing gross medical negligence towards Sgt. Goepamang during\u000ahis time in hospital and that were it not for gross medical negligence Sgt. Goepamang, would not have\u000adied, the Complainants submit that the lawyer who initially represented Mr. Kobedi, not only failed to\u000aconsider the above aspects, but that he did not also have access to the medical records of the deceased\u000aand lacked the resources to engage forensic experts.\u000a127. The Complainants submit that the above situation could only be made possible by one of two reasons;\u000athat counsel dealing with the matter at that initial stage did not have the necessary skills and competence\u000arequired in defending a death penalty case; or the evidence could not be expected to have been acquired\u000aby the lawyer at that stage and therefore amounts to new evidence discovered after the appeal. They\u000a11\u000a\u000afurther argue that this lack of competence on the part of counsel vitiated the entire proceedings and\u000aamounted to a breach of the fair trial procedure provided for in Article 7 of the African Charter.\u000a128. The Complainants also submitted that this fresh evidence was not only critical to the determination of\u000aKobedi's guilt, and the question whether the death sentence was the most appropriate sentence in the\u000acircumstance, but that the refusal by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State to receive or test the said\u000aobjective, material and compelling evidence also violated Kobedi's fair trial rights guaranteed under Article\u000a7 of the African Charter.\u000a129. The Complainants submit that the test adopted by the Botswana Court of Appeal which required the\u000avictim to prove beyond all reasonable doubt on affidavit that the new evidence would upset the conviction,\u000ainstead of the balance of probability test is overly broad. It is further submitted by the Complainants that\u000aunder the due process guarantees, the State ought to present evidence in rebuttal of the expert testimony\u000apresented in favor of Kobedi and that if the State had even presented such contrary expert evidence, there\u000awould still have been a need for an expert conference to determine if the experts can resolve points of\u000adeparture, failing which the evidence should be tested. It is further argued by the Complainants that the\u000anon-compliance with this procedure amounted to a violation of the fair trial rights of the victim protected\u000aunder Article 7 of the African Charter.\u000a130. The Complainants contends that by relying on the evidence of an unqualified forensic expert and by\u000arefusing to receive and test the evidence of a qualified forensic expert to determine the source and direction\u000aof the bullet which struck Sgt. Goepamang, amounts to a fundamental miscarriage of justice and thus a\u000aviolation of Article 7 of the African Charter.\u000aRespondent State's Submissions on the Merits\u000a\u000a131. The Respondent State submits as a preliminary issue, that the procedure adopted by the African\u000aCommission in dealing with the post-admissibility processes in this Communication contravenes Rule\u000a119(2) (3) of the African Commission. It contends that by virtue of Rule 119 (2), once the African\u000aCommission decides on the Admissibility of a Communication, the Respondent State shall file its\u000asubmissions without any further reference to the Complainants and the Complainants should only be\u000aallowed to reply to the State's submission in terms of Rule 119 (3).\u000a132. It is further contended by the Respondent State that by virtue of the above, the Complainants are\u000arequired to disclose the full particulars of their Complaint at the very initial stage. In submitting that the\u000aAfrican Commission erred when it simultaneously asked both the Complainants and the Respondent State,\u000ato make their submissions on the Merits, the Respondent State prays the African Commission to purge and\u000aexpunge from its records any submissions made by the Complainants in this regard.\u000a133. With regards to the substantive matter, the Respondent State argues that the compulsory requirement\u000aunder Botswana law for the Courts to impose the death penalty for murder, where no extenuating\u000acircumstances are shown; the adoption of the doctrine of "functus officio" by the Court of Appeal of the\u000aRespondent State with regards to the trial of Kobedi and the use of hanging as a method of execution of\u000aKobedi does not in anyway contravene Articles 2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\u000aOn the Alleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3 (Right not to be Discriminated and Right to Equality\u000abefore the law)\u000a134. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that\u000athis Article deals with the issue of discrimination, and argued further that the legislation in the Respondent\u000aState did not in any way discriminate against the victim as the death penalty would be imposed on anyone\u000afound guilty of murder without any extenuating circumstance.\u000a135. In reply to the alleged violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, while noting\u000athat this Article deals with the twin concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,\u000asubmitted that the victim's right to be treated equally before the law was not interfered with in anyway by\u000athe Respondent State throughout the trial process.\u000a136. Concerning the allegation that the victim was not afforded equal protection of the law, the Respondent\u000aState contends that Mr. Kobedi was at all times during the trial process provided with high quality legal\u000arepresentation and was not treated unequally vis-?-vis any other person in a similar situation. These,\u000aargues the Respondent State, shows that the allegations of the Complainants with regards to the allege\u000aviolations of Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter are baseless.\u000a\u000a12\u000a\u000aOn the Alleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\u000a137. In response to the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, it is submitted by the\u000aRespondent State, that not only is the imposition of the death penalty reasonable in the circumstance, but\u000aalso that the procedures followed before the death sentence was carried out on Kobedi did not amount to\u000athe arbitrary taking of his life. The Respondent State further contends that the trial of Kobedi went through\u000athe proper judicial process of the Courts in Botswana and did not at anytime derogate from the procedures\u000awhatsoever.\u000a138. The Respondent State avers that the jurisprudence of the African Commission did not regard the\u000adeath penalty as inherently contrary to the African Charter, but rather that such penalty should only be\u000aimposed with necessary due process safeguards being in place. In referring the Commission to the\u000aThirteenth Activity Report of the Commission,40 the Respondent State argues that the African Commission\u000adid not declare the imposition of the death penalty a contravention of Charter Rights, but urged States that\u000astill had the death penalty to among other things limit its imposition only to crimes of the most serious\u000anature as well as to consider establishing a moratorium on executions.\u000a139. The Respondent State argues that because due process was followed and safeguarded by the judicial\u000asystem of Botswana in the trial of Kobedi, his execution cannot amount to a contravention of Article 4 of the\u000aAfrican Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\u000aOn the Alleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment)\u000a140. In view of the alleged violation of Article 5 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, whilst\u000areferring the African Commission to Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\u000aargues that, the death penalty is expressly recognized and not prohibited under international human rights\u000alaw. It is averred by the Respondent State that since the African Charter41 provides that the African\u000aCommission shall draw inspiration from international law and human rights, including international\u000ainstruments in interpreting Charter Rights, the African Commission should not read Article 5 of the African\u000aCharter as prohibitive of the death penalty.\u000a141. It is submitted by the Respondent State that, because the African Charter and other international\u000ainstruments recognizes the death penalty as a form of punishment, its application cannot amount to\u000ainhuman or degrading treatment prohibited by Article 5 of the African Charter if it is administered according\u000ato the law.\u000a142. It is also argued by the Respondent State that, the Communication does not reveal facts of any\u000ainhuman conditions or treatment whilst the victim was in prison custody. It submits that even if fear, despair\u000aand mental anguish are the inevitable concomitants of the sentence of death, the Complainants have not\u000ademonstrated that in all circumstances of the case, the delay since the passing of the death penalty\u000asentence on the victim goes beyond what is constitutionally permissible. In referring the African\u000aCommission to Supreme Court decision in Zimbabwe42 it is further argued by the Respondent State that an\u000aelement of delay between the lawful imposition of a sentence of death and the exhaustion of available\u000aremedies is inherent in the review of the sentence; thus, even prolonged periods of detention under a\u000asevere custodial regime on death row cannot generally be considered to constitute cruel, inhuman or\u000adegrading treatment if the convicted person is merely availing himself of appellate remedies. Thus, it is\u000acontended that Article 5 of the African Charter has not been violated in any way.\u000aOn the Alleged Violation of Article 7 (Right to Fair Trial)\u000a143. In conceding that there was indeed a long delay in the trial of Kobedi, the Respondent State argues\u000athat, such delays were occasioned by the defence and not by the State. For example, the Respondent\u000aState submits that there was a delay of up to six (6) months between July and December 2001 when Mr.\u000aBrain Spilg SC was appointed pro deo to represent the victim because the victim rejected several pro deo\u000acounsels including Mr. Joina and insisted on having Mr. Brain Spilg SC appointed pro deo to represent him.\u000aAgain, it argues that there was another delay of up to sixteen (16) months between November 1999 and\u000aJuly 2001 in the trial because no opposing affidavits were filed on behalf of the victim. It is contended by the\u000aRespondent State that because these delays were due in part by the indolent acts of Kobedi and his\u000alawyers, they cannot amount to a contravention of the fair trial rights guaranteed under Article 7(1) (d) of\u000athe African Charter.\u000a144. The Respondent State contends that, in refusing the new evidence from the Complainants the Court\u000awas using tried and tested principles of law and was more than sure that this new evidence would not\u000achange the out come of the case if a retrial was ordered. In arguing that the trial judge properly exercised\u000a13\u000a\u000ahis discretion in refusing to order a retrial, the Respondent State submits that the due process rights of the\u000avictim protected under Article 7 of the African Charter was therefore not violated in anyway.\u000aThe Commission's Decision on the Merits\u000a\u000a145. The Respondent State had raised as a preliminary issue challenging any consideration by the African\u000aCommission of any further submissions filed by the Complainants in terms of Rule 119(2) and Rule 119(3)\u000aof the African Commission's Rules of Procedure. They argue that by virtue of Rule 119(2) , only the\u000aRespondent State is required to make submissions after the African Commission's decision on admissibility\u000aand the Complainants are only accorded a right to reply pursuant to Rule 119(3) . In requesting that the\u000asubmissions made by the Complainants in this direction should be expunged, it contends that by requesting\u000aboth parties to submit their arguments on the Merits, the African Commission did not properly apply Rule\u000a119(2)& (3) of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u000a146. The Complainants on their part did not address the African Commission on this.\u000aDecision of the African Commission on Alleged Procedural Irregularity\u000a\u000a147. In dealing with this issue, the African Commission will refer itself to Rule 119 of the Rules of\u000aProcedure (1995) of the African Commission which provides:\u000a[i][quote]\u000a1. If the Commission decides that a Communication is Admissible under the Charter, its decision and text of\u000athe relevant documents shall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned, through the\u000aSecretary. The author of the Communication shall also be informed of the Commission's decision through\u000athe Secretary.\u000a2. The State Party to the Charter concerned shall, within the 3 ensuing months, submit in writing to the\u000aCommission, explanations or statements elucidating the issue under consideration and indicating, if\u000apossible, measures it was able to take to remedy the situation.\u000a3. All explanations or statements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be\u000acommunicated, through the Secretary, to the author of the Communication who may submit in writing\u000aadditional information and observations within a time limit fixed by the Commission.\u000a4. States Parties from whom explanations or statements are sought within specified times shall be informed\u000athat if they fail to comply within those times the Commission will act on the evidence before it.[/quote][/i]\u000a148. The African Commission notes that while the afore cited Rule 119(2) only makes reference to the\u000aState Party, and Rule 119 (3) limits the choice of the Complainants to a reply only, it is important to point\u000aout here that, the Communication Procedure under the African Charter is dealt with in three distinct phases\u000a- [b]Seizure, Admissibility and Merits/b]. There are different requirements to be satisfied at each of these\u000aphases. As such, the African Commission has adopted a practice that does not require the Complainants to\u000amake a full submission in their initial address to the African Commission. This is one reason why the\u000aAfrican Commission will not expunge the submissions on the Merits made by the Complainants.\u000a149. Furthermore, the African Commission believes that it will only insist on the mechanical application of\u000aits rules where to do otherwise would occasion substantial injustice to one or both of the parties. The\u000aRespondent State has not shown that the non-compliance with Rules 119(2)& (3) as it were, has caused a\u000atravesty of justice in this case or has in any other way adversely affected their rights. The African\u000aCommission maintains that the primary duty of all adjudicatory bodies whether national or international, is\u000ato ensure that substantial justice and not technical justice, is done to all the parties in a case. The African\u000aCommission will therefore not allow technicalities based on perceived procedural irregularities to stand on\u000athe course of justice.\u000a150. In view of the above, the African Commission holds that the preliminary issue raised by the\u000aRespondent State lacks merits in the circumstances of this case and will therefore discountenance the\u000asame.\u000aDecision of the African Commission on the Substantive Claim\u000a\u000a151. By this Communication, the African Commission has been invited to determine whether or not the\u000acompulsory requirement under Botswana law for the courts to impose the death penalty for murder, where\u000ano extenuating circumstances are shown; the adoption of the doctrine of "functus officio "43 by the Court of\u000a14\u000a\u000aAppeal of the Respondent State with regards to the trial of Kobedi; and the use of hanging as a method of\u000aexecution of Kobedi, constitutes a violation of Articles 2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3\u000a152. Article 2 of the African Charter provides: "Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the\u000arights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such\u000aas race, ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin,\u000afortune, birth or other status"\u000aArticle 3\u000a1. Every individual shall be equal before the law.\u000a2. Every individual shall be entitled to equal protection of the law.\u000a153. Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter, basically forms the anti-discriminatory and equal protection\u000aprovisions of the African Charter. Whilst Article 2 lays down a principle that is necessary for eradicating\u000adiscrimination in all its guises, Article 3 is important because it guarantees fair and just treatment of\u000aindividuals within the legal system of a given country.\u000a154. The Complainants argue that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation that a Court\u000amust impose the death penalty for murder, absent only extenuating circumstance limits the factors that can\u000abe taken into consideration in respect of sentencing. They submit that the exclusion of considerations such\u000aas rehabilitation or such other factors personal to the victim violates Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter.\u000aIn this regard, they argue that the distinction between taking into account extenuating circumstances and\u000anot taking into account mitigating factors is both arbitrary and discriminative.\u000a155. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that\u000athis Article deals with the issue of discrimination, and argued that the legislation in the Respondent State\u000adid not in anyway discriminate against the victim as the death penalty would be imposed on anyone found\u000aguilty of murder without any extenuating circumstance.\u000a156. In reply to the alleged violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, while noting\u000athat this Article deals with the twin concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,\u000asubmitted that the victim's right to be treated equally before the law was not interfered with in anyway by\u000athe Respondent State throughout the trial process.\u000a157. Concerning the allegation that the victim was not afforded equal protection of the law, the Respondent\u000aState contends that Kobedi was at all times during the trial process provided with high quality legal\u000arepresentation and was not treated unequally vis-?-vis any other person in a similar situation. These,\u000aargues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants with regards to the alleged\u000aviolation of Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter are baseless.\u000a158. The African Commission maintains that Article 2 of the African Charter is a guarantee that every\u000aindividual is entitled to enjoy all the rights provided for under the African Charter and that no person shall be\u000adeprived of the enjoyment of any of the Charter rights based on his/her race, ethnic group, color, sex,\u000alanguage, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.\u000aTherefore, for there to be a violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, it must be shown that the victim of\u000athe alleged violation has been deprived of the enjoyment of a Charter Right on the basis of his/her race,\u000aethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune,\u000abirth or other status.\u000a159. The African Commission further believes that the right to equal protection of the law envisaged under\u000aArticle 3 of the African Charter consists of the right of all persons to have the same access to the law and\u000aCourts, and to be treated equally by the law and Courts, both in procedures and in the substance of the\u000alaw. While it is akin to the right to due process of law, it applies particularly to equal treatment as an\u000aelement of fundamental fairness.44 It is a guarantee that no person or class of persons shall be denied the\u000asame protection of the laws that is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in like circumstances in their\u000alives, liberty and property.\u000a160. The African Commission, therefore, believes that for there to be a violation of Article 3 of the African\u000aCharter, it must be demonstrated that the victim of the alleged violation was not accorded the same\u000aprotection or treatment that is usually accorded to other persons in like circumstances.\u000a161. In the present Communication it has not been shown how the victim was denied the enjoyment of any\u000aof the Charter Rights based on his ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion,\u000anational and social origin, fortune, birth or other status. It has not also been shown how the victim was\u000a15\u000a\u000aaccorded differential treatment or how the victim was discriminated against by the Respondent State in\u000aanyway. Apart from making general conclusions, the Complainants did not sufficiently present facts and\u000aevidence that would convince the African Commission of any violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the African\u000aCharter. The African Commission therefore finds that there was no violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 5\u000a162. According to Article 5 of the African Charter "every individual shall have the right to the respect of the\u000adignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and\u000adegradation of man particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\u000atreatment shall be prohibited".\u000a163. Although the African Charter fails to provide any definition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading\u000atreatment, the African Commission in its jurisprudence45 has found that the prohibition of torture, cruel,\u000ainhuman or degrading treatment includes "actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering\u000a(or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his or her will or conscience".\u000a164. While it is accepted that there is no rule of international law which prescribes the circumstances under\u000awhich the death penalty may be imposed, the African Commission has cautioned that the death penalty\u000ashould only be imposed after a full consideration of not only the circumstances of the individual offence, but\u000aalso the circumstances of the individual offender.46\u000a165. The Complainants have made reference to the fact that the adoption of hanging as a method of\u000aexecuting the death penalty, and the failure of the Courts in the Respondent State to have regard to the\u000amedical condition of Kobedi violates Article 5 of the African Charter.\u000a166. By invoking Article 60 of the African Charter, the African Commission will rely on the jurisprudence of\u000athe UN Human Rights Committee47 to hold that where a death sentence has been imposed, it must be\u000acarried out in such a way as to cause the least possible physical and mental suffering. This approach was\u000aapplied in Ng v. Canada48 wherein the UN Committee found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation\u000aamounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\u000a167. The African Commission, therefore, believes that, the carrying out of a death sentence using a\u000aparticular method of execution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the\u000asuffering caused in execution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that is strictly necessary.\u000a168. The African Commission holds that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or\u000aill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 thereof "to adopt\u000alegislative or other measures to give effect" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such\u000asafeguards has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben Island Guidelines.49\u000a169. The African Commission is of the view that the execution of a death sentence by hanging may not be\u000acompatible with respect for the inherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary\u000asuffering, because it is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without appropriate\u000aattention to the weight of the person condemned because hanging can result either in slow and painful\u000astrangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the\u000aseparation of the head from the body.\u000a170. However, the Complainants have not demonstrated that the execution would be, or was, carried out\u000awithout due attention to the weight of the condemned. In the circumstance, the African Commission holds\u000athat these submissions are speculative and cannot in the circumstance violate Article 5 of the African\u000aCharter. It is for this reason that the African Commission finds that there has been no violation of Article 5\u000aof the African Charter in this regard.\u000a171. It was also contended by the Complainants that because the victim had been under the fear of the\u000adeath penalty for over a decade since he was first arrested, this prolonged delay constitute cruel, unusual\u000aor degrading punishment or treatment for the reason that he lived for an unconscionable amount of time\u000aawaiting the potential imposition of a death sentence, rendering the victim's execution a violation of Article\u000a5 of the African Charter.\u000a172. Whilst the above definition is useful, it fails to outline those categories of actions that would constitute\u000aa violation under Article 5 of the African Charter. To resolve this issue, the African Commission will in terms\u000aof Article 60 of the African Charter rely on the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee which has\u000aover the years, made a determination on whether the length of detention on death row amounted to a\u000aviolation of the prohibition against 'torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'.50 In\u000aRandolph Barrett and Clyde (sic!) v. Jamaica,51 the Human Rights Committee held that in the review of\u000a16\u000a\u000acriminal convictions and sentences, an element of delay between the lawful imposition of a sentence of\u000adeath and the exhaustion of available remedies is inherent in the review of the sentence; thus, even\u000aprolonged periods of detention under a severe custodial regime on death row cannot generally be\u000aconsidered to constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment if the convicted person is merely availing\u000ahimself of appellate remedies.\u000a173. The African Commission is of the view that the computation of time as far as the delays in executing\u000athe sentence is concern, will only start to run from the time the High Court passed the death sentence and\u000anot from when the victim was first arrested in 1993. The evidence before the African Commission indicates\u000athat the ensuing delay in carrying out the death sentence was because the victim had petitioned the Court\u000aof Appeal. The victim was partly responsible for these delays and was exercising his rights to appeal. For\u000athis reasons the African Commission finds that there is no violation of Article 5 in this regard.\u000a174. It was submitted by the Complainants that failure to publish the unsuccessful outcome of the clemency\u000apetition and failure to give notice of the date and time of execution amounts to cruel, inhuman and\u000adegrading punishment and treatment in breach of Article 5 of the African Charter as thus, depriving the\u000aconvict and his family members of the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last\u000afarewells.\u000a175. The Respondent State, failed to challenge the allegation that no reasonable notice or any notice at all\u000awas given of the date and time of execution of the victim. The African Commission has in many of its\u000adecisions52 held that facts uncontested by the Respondent State shall be considered as established. In\u000aview of the foregoing, the African Commission will therefore hold this fact as established.\u000a176. In Communication 240/01 Interights et al. (on behalf of Bosch) v. Botswana53 , the African\u000aCommission observed that a justice system must have a human face in matters of execution of death\u000asentences by affording a condemned person an opportunity to arrange his affairs, to be visited by members\u000aof his intimate family before he dies, and to receive spiritual advice and comfort to enable him to compose\u000ahimself, as best as he can, to face his ultimate ordeal.\u000a177. The African Commission is, therefore, inclined to hold the fact that the victim and his family members\u000awere never given the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last farewells as\u000ainhuman treatment. Since the Respondent State did not give any justifications, the African Commission\u000afinds that the failure to give notice of the date and time of execution of the victim amounts to cruel, inhuman\u000aand degrading punishment and treatment and therefore a violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 7\u000a178. The Complainants contend that the fair trial rights of the victim were violated in that; (a) the Court of\u000aAppeal misdirected itself by wrongfully invoking the doctrine of functus officio and refusing to order a retrial\u000ain Kobedi's case in the face of strong, compelling and new contrary expert reports and instead relied on the\u000atestimony of an unqualified forensic expert; (b) the right to counsel was not fully respected; (c) there were\u000ainordinate delays in the trial process; (d) the Court placed a higher standard of proof - beyond reasonable\u000adoubts on the victim .\u000a179. From the arguments and analysis of both the Complainants and the Respondent State, the essential\u000aquestion that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Kobedi complied with the provisions of Article 7\u000aof the African Charter.\u000a180. Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights provides that: "Every individual shall\u000ahave the right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\u000a1. The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\u000arecognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\u000a2. The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\u000a3. The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\u000a4. The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\u000a]>\u000a\u000a17\u000a\u000a

aV281/03 Marcel Wetsh'okonda Koso and others / DRC\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. On 23rd September 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights\u000areceived from Barrister Marcel Wetsh' Okonda Koso, solicitor of the Kinshasa-Gombe Bench and of the\u000aNGO Campagne pour les Droits de l'Homme au Congo1 , from Barrister Izua Kembo, solicitor of the\u000aKinshasa-Gombe Bench and member of the NGO Comité des Observateurs des Droits de l'Homme.2 , and\u000afrom Barrister Odette Disu, solicitor and member of the Kinshasa-Gombe Bench, and of the NGO\u000a"ASMEBOKEN"3 a communication, introduced on behalf of 5 persons as follows:\u000a1. Ngimbi Nkiama Gaby, Contractor, born on 19.04.1958 in Kinshasa;\u000a2. Bukasa Musenga, Trade Inspector, born on 25.09.1967 in Kinshasa;\u000a3. Duza Kade Willy, Soldier, born on 30.10.1963 in Lisala;\u000a4. Issa Yaba, Femala Soldier, born on 10.04.1958 in Irebu; and\u000a5. Musalinsa Manoy, Soldier, born on 10.05.1958.\u000a2. The communication is introduced against the Democratic Republic of Congo, (State [party]4 to the\u000aAfrican Charter, and hereinafter referred to as DRC, in accordance with Article 55 of the African Charter on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter).\u000a3. The Complainants allege that, on 23.07.1999, the said Ngimbo [sic] Nkiama placed an order for the\u000asupply of 3.5 cubic metres of petrol at ELF (a petroleum company) which he was supposed to collect on\u000a26.06.1999 at SEP/Congo. But the said Ngimbi Nkiama was arrested by policemen who are said to have\u000adiscovered a supply of 6 drums in surplus following his collection of 40 drums of fuel instead of the 34\u000adrums of fuel he initially ordered for.\u000a4. Besides, the Complainants maintain that on 04.08.1999 the said Ngimbi Nkiama was arrested and sent\u000ato the Conseil National de Sécurité quarters together with four jointly accused persons, Bukasa Musenga,\u000aDuza Kade Willy, Issa Yaba, and Muzaliwa Manoy.\u000a5. According to the Complainants, on the 11.09.1999, the said Ngimbi Nkiama and the jointly accused\u000apersons were arraigned before the Military Court of DRC for "partaking, during war time, in the committing\u000aof acts of sabotage by the diversion of 70 drums of gas-oil and of 40 drums of gas-oil belonging to the\u000aCongolese Armed Forces".\u000a6. And that the Military Court comprising 5 judges [sic] (among whom would be only one trained jurist) tried\u000athe said Ngimbi Nkiama and his jointly accused [sic] accomplices for the evidence adduced against and\u000asentenced them to a capital punishment, a "decree on a ground without the least justification [sic] " and the\u000aright to file an appeal against the decree [sic]; the decisions of the Military Court being not [subject] either\u000afor a review or for an appeal (Decree No.019 of 23.08.1997 establishing the Military Court of DRC).\u000a\u000aThe Complaint\u000a7. The Complainants allege that the above-mentioned facts constitute a violation by the DRC of Articles 7\u000a(a) [sic] and Article 26 of the African Charter and of paragraph 3 of the Provision for the right to the means\u000aof an appeal and of a fair trial [sic]5 , adopted by the African Commission during its 11th Ordinary Session\u000aheld in Tunis, Tunisia from 2 to 9 March 1992.\u000a8. Furthermore, the Complainants maintain that the aforementioned facts constitute a violation by the DRC\u000aof the Article 14(1)\u000a× All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge\u000aagainst him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public\u000ahearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public\u000amay be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national\u000asecurity in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the\u000aextent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice\u000athe interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made\u000apublic except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern\u000amatrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.\u000a1\u000a\u000aof International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u000a9. Consequently, the Complainants request the African Commission to:\u000a\u2022 Declare Decree No. 019 of 23.08.1997, establishing a court for military order and its Article 5,\u000acontrary to the international commitments of the DRC as far as fair trial is concerned as stipulated in\u000athe African Charter [sic];\u000a\u2022 Declare that the sole fact of submitting a dispute case to a Court the majority of whose members\u000ahave no legal qualification whatsoever, constitutes a flagrant violation of Article 26 of the African\u000aCharter;\u000a\u2022 Declare that the judicial decisions on a simple ground without the least justification grossly breach\u000athe right and liberties acknowledged by the African Charter and violate the provisions of Article 7 of\u000athis latter;\u000a\u2022 Direct the immediate release of the sentenced persons and the reparation for all the prejudices they\u000ahave suffered;\u000a\u2022 Request the DRC to harmonise all her legislation with the commitments this state subscribed to at\u000ainternational level and namely the African Charter and to initiate reforms so as to prevent further\u000ahuman right violations.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a10. On 21.10.2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of this communication\u000ato the Complainants through a letter with reference No. ACHPR/COMM 281/2003.\u000a11. During its 34th Ordinary Session held from the 6th to 19th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission examined this communication and approved its seizure.\u000a12. On the 14/12/2003, the African Commission notified the Respondent State of this decision by DHL, and\u000aat the same time conveyed to it a copy of the complaint. The African Commission also requested the\u000aDemocratic Republic of Congo to provide it, in two months, with its [arguments] on this complaint to enable\u000ait take a decision on its admissibility during its 35th Ordinary Session.\u000a13. On the 12th February 2004 and in the absence of any reaction from the Respondent State, the African\u000aCommission sent a copy of the complaint in question with an acknowledgement of receipt to the Ministry of\u000aForeign Affairs, requesting its reaction as early as possible.\u000a14. At its 35th Ordinary Session which was held from the 21st May to 4th June 2004 in Banjul, The Gambia,\u000athe African Commission considered the communication and deferred its decision on the admissibility of the\u000acase since the delegation of the Respondent State that participated at the session declared, contrary to all\u000aexpectations, that the complaint had not reached the DRC.\u000a15. The Secretariat of the Commission prepared a complete dossier of all the pending communications\u000aagainst the DRC, including Communication 281/2003, which it delivered in exchange for a receipt, to the\u000aDRC delegation.\u000a16. By letter dated 21st June 2004, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the parties to the\u000acommunication of the deferment of its decision on the admissibility of the complaint to its 36th Session and\u000arequested them, once again, to provide it with their comments in this regard so as to allow the African\u000aCommission to rule on the admissibility during its 36th Session.\u000a17. On the 16/09/2004, the Respondent State sent its comments on the admissibility of the communication\u000ato the Secretariat of the Commission.\u000a18. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of it on the 11/10/2004, and sent the said comments to the\u000aComplainant requesting his reaction thereon as early as possible.\u000a19. During the 36th Ordinary Session of the African Commission which was held in November/December\u000a2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the Respondent State submitted its memorandum on the admissibility of the\u000aComplaint to the Secretariat of the African Commission.\u000a20. On the 4th December 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of this\u000amemorandum and informed the Respondent State that the African Commission would take its decision on\u000aadmissibility of the complaint at its 37th Ordinary Session and the arguments raised would be taken into\u000aaccount.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a21. On the 23rd December 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission conveyed the submission of the\u000aRespondent State on admissibility to the Complainant, and requested his reaction to the arguments\u000asubmitted therein and further informed him that the African Commission would take its decision on the\u000aadmissibility during its 37th Ordinary Session.\u000a22. At its 37th Ordinary Session which took place from the 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The\u000aGambia, the African Commission heard the Complainant on the condition of the exhaustion of local\u000aremedies.\u000a23. During this same session, the African Commission declared the communication admissible.\u000a24. On the 6th June 2005, the Secretariat informed the parties of this decision and requested them to\u000atransmit their arguments on the merits of the case.\u000a25. On the 6th September 2005, the Complainant submitted his arguments on the merits of the complaint.\u000a26. The Secretariat conveyed these observations to the Respondent State on the 8th November 2005 at the\u000asame time requesting its own memorandum as early as possible.\u000a27. During its 38th Ordinary Session, which was held from 21 November to 5 December 2005 in Banjul, The\u000aGambia, the African Commission considered the complaint and, in the absence of the arguments of the\u000aRespondent State on the merits of the case, decided to differ [sic] its decision at this stage to its 39th\u000aOrdinary Session.\u000a28. On 10/01/2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of this decision and\u000arequested the Respondent State to forward its arguments on the merits of the communication.\u000a29. In the absence of reaction from the Respondent State, the Secretariat sent a reminder on 28/03/2006.\u000aA copy of the submission of the Complainant on merits of the case was enclosed.\u000a30. In a Note Verbale dated July 12, 2006, the Secretariat urged DRC to provide with its observations on\u000athe merits by no later than 30th August 2006. The Secretariat further reminded DRC of previous notes\u000averbale sent respectively on June 06, 2005, November 08, 2005 and January 10, 2006 all of which still with\u000ano reaction from Respondent State.\u000a31. At its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, the Gambia from 15 to 29 November 2006, the Commission\u000adeferred its decision on the merits to its 41st Ordinary Session scheduled to be held in Ghana from 16 to 30\u000aMay 2007 owing to the absence of arguments on the merits from the Respondent State.\u000a32. On 15 January 2007, the Secretariat informed DRC of the decision of the Commission to differ [sic] the\u000acomplaint to its 41st Ordinary Session and reminded DRC of previous notes verbale in which DRC was\u000ainvited to send its observations on the merits. However, DRC was given the last chance to formulate and\u000asend its observations on the merits before the end of February 2007, failing to do so would result in the\u000aCommission having to act in accordance with Article 119(4) of its rules of procedure.\u000a33. On 16 January 2007, the Secretariat informed the Complainants of the postponement of its decision on\u000athe merits to the 41st Ordinary Session scheduled to be held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Ghana. The\u000aSecretariat informed also the Complainants that DRC was given a last chance to provide the Commission\u000awith its arguments on the merits failing of which, the Commission would be obliged to act in accordance\u000awith Article 119(4) of its rules of procedure.\u000a34. In a Note Verbale dated June 14 2007, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the Defendant State\u000athat the communication was deferred to the 42nd Ordinary [Session] scheduled from 14 to 28 November\u000a2007 in Brazzaville, Congo. The State was also reminded of previous note verbales in which it was urged to\u000asubmit it arguments as regard to the merit of the communication and that failing to do so may result in the\u000aapplication of Rule 119(4) of the rule of procedure. The Respondent State is still yet to respond to these\u000aNotes Verbale.\u000a35. A letter dated June 15, 2007 the Secretariat informed the Complainant of the deferment of the\u000acommunication to the 42nd Ordinary Session scheduled from 14 to 28 November 2007 in Brazzaville,\u000aCongo\u000a36. In a Note Verbale dated 17 September 2007 and a letter dated 17 September 2007 the Secretariat of\u000athe African Commission also sent a reminder both to the Complainant and the Defendant State.\u000a37. By Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and a letter dated 19 December 2007 respectively, the parties\u000awere informed of the deferment of the communication to the 43rd Ordinary Session scheduled in Ezulwini,\u000aSwaziland from 7th to 22nd May 2008 for the Commission to take into consideration in its decision on the\u000amerits, the conclusions submitted by the DRC on the merits.\u000a38. In a Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and a letter dated 19 March 2008, reminders were sent to the\u000aparties to inform them of the deferment of the communication to the 43rd Ordinary Session.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a39. All attempts at getting responses from the Respondent State have been futile (or unsuccessful).\u000aTherefore, the Commission decided to consider the communication on the merits.\u000a40. During its 5th Extra Ordinary Session, which took place in Banjul, The Gambia from 21 to 29 July 2008,\u000athe African Commission considered the communication and finalised its decision on the merits.\u000a\u000aThe Law\u000aAdmissibility\u000aOn the exhaustion of local remedies\u000a\u000a41. The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights stipulates in its Article 56 that the communications\u000areferred to in Article 55 should, if they are to be considered, necessarily be sent after exhaustion of local\u000aremedies, if they exist, unless the procedure of exhaustion of local remedies is unduly prolonged.\u000a42. In its memorandum on admissibility, the Respondent State contends that as far as it is concerned the\u000acommunication should be declared inadmissible. In support of this position the Respondent State affirms\u000athat the Complainant "does not provide evidence of having lodged an appeal against the ruling in dispute,\u000awhereas this means of recourse remains open, in conformity with Article 150, paragraph 3 of the\u000aTransitional Constitution in the Democratic Republic of Congo".\u000a43. According to the Respondent State, it was possible for the Complainants to lodge an appeal before the\u000aSupreme Court of Justice against all rulings by the Military Tribunal which are in dispute, and that, by not\u000ausing this remedy, the Complainant has not exhausted the available remedies and therefore, it requests the\u000aAfrican Commission to declare the communication inadmissible for non exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a44. In a memorandum conveyed to the Secretariat of the African Commission on the 17th April 2005, the\u000aComplainant insisted on the non existence of remedies at the time when the facts occurred. They contend\u000athat the sentences passed by the Military Tribunal with regard to them cannot be subjected to any\u000aremedies. In effect Article 5 of Decree 019 of the 23rd August 1997 establishing the Military Tribunal\u000astipulates that its rulings "can neither be opposed nor appealed".\u000a45. They contend that an eventual recourse to cancellation of the judgment in question, although provided\u000afor by Article 272 of the Law of 23rd August 1972 instituting the Code of Military Justice, cannot be\u000aimplemented due lack of "jurisdictional competence" ; insofar as they could have brought an appeal before\u000athe Supreme Court if the facts, which date back to 1999 were not prior to the Transitional Constitution\u000awhich was adopted on 4th April 2003 and made it possible for citizens to appeal against the rulings of the\u000aMilitary Tribunal.\u000a46. The Complainant contends that the Transitional Constitution Decree of the 9th April 1994 (in force at the\u000atime of the events - 1999) stipulates in its Article 102 that: "The Supreme Court of Justice\u000aknows......appeals lodged against rulings passed in the final jurisdiction by the Courts and Tribunals" does\u000anot take into consideration the decisions of the Military Tribunal.\u000a47. The Complainant considers therefore that local remedies were not available by the time the facts\u000aoccurred.\u000a48. At the 37th Ordinary Session of the African Commission which was held from the 27th April to 11th May\u000a2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the Complainant made an oral presentation before the African Commission in\u000areiteration of these arguments.\u000aPosition of the African Commission\u000a\u000a49. The main question regarding the admissibility of the case under consideration is whether local remedies\u000awere in existence at the time when the facts occurred and, if yes, whether they have been exhausted\u000apursuant to Article 56(6)) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\u000a50. In effect, Article 56(6) provides that communications "are submitted within a reasonable period from the\u000atime local remedies are exhausted or from the date the Commission is seized with the matter".\u000a51. The African Commission is of the view that if such important facts are within the jurisdiction of an\u000aexceptional jurisdiction all legal guarantees shall be given to the accused persons for their defence in order\u000ato avoid any miscarriage of justice. That is the rationale for having remedies in all procedures, especially in\u000acriminal procedure. All the ordinary remedies shall be available to them.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000a52. An analysis of Article 150, paragraph 3 of the Transitional Constitution of 4th April 2003 on which the\u000aRespondent State relies shows that the Transitional Constitution was passed after the facts and also after\u000athe decision sentencing the complainants. In such circumstances, the Commission is of the view that\u000aapplying such a law of a general scope would violate the principle of non-retrospectiveness of the law,\u000aespecially as the new Transitional Constitution Decree does not expressly provide for such remedy.\u000a53. In the present communication, it is the State that alleges that local remedies have not been exhausted\u000aand as such the burden is on it to show that local remedies exist. It observes that such remedy is available\u000aunder Decree 019 of 23 August 1997 establishing the Military Tribunal; Article 5 of the Decree expressly\u000aprovides that the rulings of the latter "can neither be opposed nor appealed." Thus, it appears that the\u000aDecree includes a derogatory [sic] clause which precludes any opposition or appeal against the rulings of\u000abodies such as the Military Tribunal. In other terms, the applicable law at the time the facts occurred does\u000anot provide any remedy. In a similar situation, the African Commission, drawing inspiration from its own\u000awell-established jurisprudence, already held, in Communications 102/93 Constitutional Rights\u000aProject/Nigeria, 129/94 Civil Liberties Organisation c/Nigeria and other communications6 , that "it is\u000areasonable to assume that the local remedies would not only be prolonged, but they will produce any\u000aresult" [sic] .\u000a54. Moreover, the same analysis can apply to the other common remedy, namely the lodging of an appeal\u000awith the Supreme Court. In terms of the Transitional Constitution Decree of 9th April 1994 (in force at the\u000atime the facts occurred - 1999), Article 102 of which provides that "the Supreme Court of Justice could only\u000aknow of appeals lodged against rulings passed in final jurisdiction by the Courts and Tribunals" is only\u000aavailable in common offences.\u000a55. In consequence, the African Commission rules that local remedies were not available to the\u000aComplainants. It will apply its jurisprudence on exhaustion of local remedies7 without it necessarily seeking\u000ato establish the effectiveness of local remedies; the Commission is of the view that it was absolutely\u000aimpossible for the victims to exhaust effective local remedies.\u000a56. On these grounds, the African Commission declares the communication admissible.\u000aMerits\u000a57. In accordance with Rule 120of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, where a\u000acommunication submitted in accordance with Article 55 of the Charter has been declared admissible, the\u000aCommission "shall consider the communication in the light of all the information that the individual and the\u000aState party concerned have submitted in writing, it shall make known its observation on this issue."\u000a58. In the present case, the conclusions brought to the dossier by the two parties both in terms of the\u000aprocedure and on the merits of the case enable the Commission to make pronouncements through the\u000apresentation and analysis of the arguments of the parties to the suit.\u000aArguments of the Complainants\u000a\u000a59. The Complainants submit the violation of the African Charter in its Articles 7.a, 7.b, 7.d and 26. The\u000aComplainants contest the legal basis, the competence, and the procedure of the Military Court which\u000acontravenes the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights to which the Respondent State is a party.\u000a60. The Complainant avers that the establishment of the Military Court contravenes Article 96 (1) of the\u000aTransitional Constitution which stipulates that "courts, tribunals and war councils shall only be established\u000aby the Law. No special commissions or tribunals shall be set up in any form whatsoever."\u000a61. The Complainant contends the incompetence of the said court due to its membership whose partiality\u000awas manifested by the inclusion of members of the military corps, what with their legendary regimentation\u000aand discipline, exacerbated by the fact that the later lacked the qualities of a magistrate. To support these\u000aassertions, the Complainant recalled the decision of Communication 218/988 in which the African\u000aCommission decided that the "Military tribunal" should be bound by the norms of equity, transparency,\u000ajustice, independent rules and respect for the legal process of other courts."\u000a62. The Complainant also avers that the procedural situation was exacerbated by the excessive powers of\u000athe members of the court who purportedly, followed a very arbitrary procedure in violation of Article 137 of\u000athe Military Code of Justice, dated 25 September, according to which, "the procedure before military\u000ajurisdictions shall be that in force before the common law jurisdictions, in conformity with the provisions of\u000athe normal Criminal Code which are not incompatible with those of the present code."\u000a5\u000a\u000a63. According to the Complainants, there is no possible redress allowing them to contest the decision of the\u000acourt which sentenced the plaintiffs to death: according to Article 5 of the decree-law establishing the said\u000acourt, neither can the decisions be appealed against nor opposed. The Complainants contend that the\u000asentencing of the plaintiffs to death without the possibility of appeal constitutes a violation of Article 6 of the\u000aGuarantees for the Protection of Persons Sentenced to Death. Article 6 stipulates that "any individual\u000asentenced to death is entitled to file an appeal with a higher court, and measures should be taken to ensure\u000athat the appeals are mandatory."\u000a64. The Complainants also recalled the ruling of the Human Rights Committee in the case of Arutynyam\u000avs Uzbekistan which states "sentencing to death following a trial during which the provisions of the\u000aConvention were not respected constitutes a violation of Article 6 of the Convention where no further\u000aappeal can be brought against the verdict" 9\u000a65. The Complainant further avers that the said ruling of the court was not reasoned considering that the\u000aauthorities refused to convey to the plaintiffs the ruling pronouncing their sentence despite all the attempts\u000ato that effect.\u000a66. Consequently, the Complainants call for the immediate release of the plaintiffs and prays the African\u000aCommission to call on the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to grant each victim the sum\u000aof 10, 000, 000 Congolese Francs as damages and to urge it to harmonise its legislation with its\u000ainternational commitments.\u000aArguments of the Respondent State\u000a\u000a67. The State refutes all the allegations of the Complainants. The State submits that all the said allegations\u000aare unfounded.\u000a68. Pertaining to the establishment of the Military Court whose impartiality, independence and competence\u000aare being challenged by the Complainant, the DRC State responded that the decision to establish a Military\u000aCourt was in conformity with Article 156 (2) of the Constitution which empowers the Head of State to\u000asuspend Common Law Courts in the some or all parts of the territory, and to replace them by Military\u000aCourts in times of war. As the Congolese state was engaged in an armed conflict situation following the\u000aarmed aggression led by its neighbours, the State was merely implementing the said provisions of the\u000aConstitution.\u000a69. The Respondent State observes that it is under these special circumstances that the plaintiffs were\u000atried and sentenced in all legality and avers that the latter have not adduced any proof of their assertion\u000athat the ruling as passed was not reasoned.\u000a70. Regarding the complaint brought by the Complainants pertaining to Article 5 of the decree-law\u000aestablishing the Military Court, the Respondent State alleges that the Complainants could have lodged an\u000aappeal to bring to the fore their allegations, in accordance with Article 150 of the Transitional Constitution,\u000awhich recognises the competence of the Supreme Court to sit on decisions made by the lowest and highest\u000acourts.\u000a71. The Respondent State concludes that there is no room for compensation as the plaintiffs were found\u000aguilty, and eventually released from custody.\u000a72. The Congolese State further alleges that it has subsequently harmonised its laws with its international\u000acommitments.\u000aObservations of the Commission\u000a\u000a73. In the light of the observations of the parties, it transpires that the main issue here relates to the\u000aguarantee mechanism, as provided for under Articles 7(1) and 26 of the Charter.\u000a74. In terms of Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights: "Every individual shall have\u000athe right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\u000aa) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\u000arecognised and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\u000ab) The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\u000ac) The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\u000ad) The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal."\u000a75. Article 26 provides that: "State Parties to the present charter shall have the duty to guarantee the\u000aindependence of the Courts and allow the establishment and improvement of appropriate national\u000ainstitutions entrusted with the promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the\u000a6\u000a\u000apresent Charter.">\u000a76. The general content of the guarantee of sound justice which is the subject of Articles 7 and 26 brings\u000atwo sorts of obligations to bear. The obligation of having an accessible and appropriate court and the\u000aobligation of a fair trial (the right to have one's cause heard fairly). The right to a fair trial is a corollary of the\u000aconcept of access to an appropriate court. The right to a fair trial requires that one's cause be held by\u000aefficient and impartial courts.\u000a77. In a similar case relating to Communication 151/96 Civil Liberties Organisation v. Nigeria, the\u000aCommission already read Articles 7 and 26, together and held that Article 7 deals with the right to be heard\u000aby impartial courts, and Article 26 insists on the independence of courts; the Commission notes that States\u000ahave the duty to put in place credible institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. Article\u000a26 being the necessary appendix of Article 7, one can expect a fair trial only before impartial courts.\u000a78. In the present case, the establishment of the exceptional tribunal is a violation of the provisions of the\u000aCharter, as already decided by the African Commission in the above-mentioned similar cases.\u000a79. According to the African Commission, the independence of a court refers to the independence of the\u000acourt vis-?-vis the Executive. This implies the consideration of the mode of designation of its members, the\u000aduration of their mandate, the existence of protection against external pressures and the issue of real or\u000aperceived independence: as the saying goes "justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done"10 .\u000a80. The obligation to be independent is one and the same as the obligation to be impartial.11 Impartiality\u000amay be perceived in a subjective and objective manner. In a subjective manner, the impartiality of a judge\u000ais gauged by his internal inclinations. Since it is impossible to infer from this inclination objectively, it was\u000asimpler to conclude that subjective impartiality be assumed until proven otherwise 12 .\u000a81. However, appearances cannot be ignored while gauging the impartiality of a jurisdiction13 .\u000a82. The obligation of having a jurisdiction established by law, capable of passing a judgement cannot be\u000aclearly disassociated from the above. The ability of a court to rule depends on the competence of the court\u000ato hear a case, and also depends on the calibre of its members. In the case of Amnesty International\u000aVersus Sudan, the Commission decided "that the definition of the word,"competence" is particularly\u000asensitive since ................ depriving courts of qualified staff to guarantee their impartiality, infringes\u000aon the right to have one's cause heard by competent organs ........... constitutes a violation of\u000aArticles 7.1.d and 26 of the Charter". The requirement of a fair trial presupposes that the parties to the\u000asuit are able to present their respective cases without prejudice to either party. The flaws of a trial can be\u000adetected where a certain number of elements combined together have not been respected viz. the right to\u000aequality of means and the need for dissenting views. The requirements of a fair trial also presupposes that\u000athe courts are able to allow persons subject to trial to review the ruling passed. The principle of a two-tier\u000acourt system is recognised by all. In the present case, there is a discriminatory justice system in the same\u000athat Article 5 applies differently depending on the persons concerned.\u000a83. In the present case, the Military Court was established by a decree-law in accordance with Article\u000a156(2) of the Constitution of Congo which authorises the President of the Republic to suspend the\u000aCommon Law courts and replace them with Military Tribunals, in times of war. Its competence includes\u000aknowing of the deeds of civilians.\u000a84. Regarding such situations, the Commission already stated several times its Resolution No\u000aACHPR/Res.41(XXVI)99 on the right to a fair trial. In the Forum of Conscience v. Sierra Leone case, for\u000ainstance, the Commission quoted the preceding Resolution as follows: "In many African countries, Military\u000aTribunals and Special Courts co-exist with ordinary legal institutions. The objective of the military tribunals\u000ais to adjudicate on offences of a purely military nature perpetrated by military personnel. In the dispatch of\u000athese duties, the military tribunals should abide by the norms governing a fair trial".\u000a85. Consequently, in this particular case, the fact that civilians and soldiers accused of civilian offences are\u000atried by a Military Court presided over by military officers for the theft of drums of gas oil is a flagrant\u000aviolation of the above-mentioned requirements of good justice.\u000a86. Furthermore, in its ruling on the Media Rights Agenda v Nigeria case, the Commission decided as\u000afollows: [quote]"the appearance, sentencing and conviction of Malaolu, a civilian, by a special\u000amilitary court, presided over by military officers in active duty is nothing short of a violation of the\u000afundamental tenets of free trial as stipulated under Article 7 of the Charter."[quote]\u000a87. Consequently, in the present case, the trial of both civilian and militaries [sic] by a military tribunal\u000apresided over by a military officer on matters of a civilian nature constitutes an infringement of the\u000arequirements of fair justice as mentioned earlier.14\u000a\u000a7\u000a\u000a88. The Respondent State does not challenge these arguments in its statement of defence. In the absence\u000aof any facts to the contrary, the Commission cannot invalidate the submission by the Complainants\u000aregarding the inexistence of a fair justice system.\u000a89. The Commission therefore finds that the verdict of the Military Court which consisted solely of Army\u000aOfficers with no qualities of a Magistrate, did not offer the guarantees of independence, impartiality and\u000aequity and constitutes a violation of its Resolution No ACHPR/Res.41(XXVI)99 on the Right to a Fair Trial\u000aand Legal Aid in Africa.\u000a90. The Complainants allege that the verdict of the military court against the plaintiffs was not reasoned and\u000athat to compound matters, the authorities refused to serve them with a copy of the judgement. The\u000aRespondent State begs to differ and avers that the Complainant has no proof to back this allegation. In this\u000acase, the burden of proof is on the Defendant to show that the allegations of the Complainants are\u000aunfounded by providing the Commission with the said judgement, which proof is yet to be provided. The\u000aCommission has always deplored lack or inadequacy of motives for legal decisions as a violation of the\u000aright to a fair trial. In the judgement on the Pinkey v Canada case, the Human Rights Committee ruled:\u000a"the exercise of an appellant's right of appeal had been prejudiced because the transcript of the lower\u000acourt's proceedings had taken two-and-a-half years to be produced."\u000a91. It is important to note that the Complainants skew the doctrinal meaning of the expression "effective\u000aredress". This expression "effective redress" is clearly referred to in Article 13\u000a× Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective\u000aremedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting\u000ain an official capacity.\u000aof the European Convention on Human Rights. "Redress" should not be considered as "the process\u000awhereby a new decision is obtained in a dispute where an authority has already given a ruling. The word\u000aredress shall comprise of all processes through which a constitutive act or an alleged violation of the\u000aConvention is brought before a qualified body to seek, as the case maybe, suspension of the act, its\u000aannulment, amendment or compensation".15 It is the case in the present communication, even though it is\u000ahappening at the African regional level.\u000a92. In addition, the Complainants recall that they could not exhaust adequate local remedies as already\u000adealt with at the admissibility stage.\u000a93. Regarding Article 14 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which stipulates that\u000a"any person found guilty of an offence shall have the right to have the verdict examined by a higher court,\u000ain accordance with the law", the Commission could refer to it in terms of Article 60 of the African Charter on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights. However, nothing in the dossier shows that the Respondent State adopted\u000aand ratified the Covenant. The Commission can therefore not examine the request.\u000a57. [sic] Finally, there is no evidence that the victims were released from prison; in the same vein, there is\u000ano evidence that the Respondent State has already harmonised its legislation with its international\u000acommitments. However, the fact that the mere fact of recognising that its legislation is not in line with its\u000ainternational commitments is a confession of its culpability.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aOn these grounds, the Commission,\u000a94. Consequently, declares, the Democratic Republic of Congo has violated the relevant provisions of the\u000aAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, namely Articles 7(a), 7(b), 7(d) and 26.\u000a95. Finds that the establishment of a Military Court, albeit legally, whose competence extends to hearing\u000acivil acts perpetrated by civilians is a flagrant ignorance of the Article 7 of the African Charter on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights.\u000a96. Recommends that the Government of the Republic of Congo guarantees the independence of the\u000atribunals and improves on the appropriate national institutions charged with the promotion and protection of\u000athe rights and freedoms enshrined in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\u000a97. Urges the Government of the DRC to grant the victims a fair and equitable amount as compensation for\u000athe moral wrong suffered.\u000a\u000a8\u000a\u000a98. Recommends to the Government of the DRC to harmonise its legislation with its international\u000acommitments, if that has not yet been done.\u000a\u000aDone in Abuja, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on 24th November 2008.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 CDHC- Asbl, 18 Avenue Basoko, commune of Ngaliema, Telephone: 00243 98186937.\u000a2 [sic] African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights since October, 2001 (30th Ordinary Session).\u000aCODHO, Kinshasa-Gombe, commune of Kalamu, Telephone: 00243 9947822.\u000a3 Association Benjamin Moloise and Ken Saro Wiwa for the Defence of Human Rights and the\u000aDevelopment of Africa, 4251, Avenue Kabasele Tshamala- Kinshasa Barumbu Telephone 0024398212201;\u000aEmail: groupestrategique@yahoo.co, disuodette@yahoo.fr\u000a4 The DRC ratified the African Charter on 20/07/1984).\u000a5 Editor's note: The document being referred to is inferred to be Resolution on the Right to Recourse and\u000aFair Trial (1992) ACHPR /Res.4(XI)92\u000a6 102/93 Constitutional Rights Project, 129/94 Civil Liberties Organisation/Nigeria\u000a7 Civil Liberties Organisation, Legal Defence Center and Assistance Project v.

aV283/03 B / Kenya\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The communication is submitted by a Complainant who requests anonymity and presents the facts of the\u000acase as follows:\u000a2. The Complainant alleges that on 30th September 2003, the Anti-Corruption Committee presented a\u000areport on corruption in the judiciary to the Chief Justice of Kenya in the presence of the press. The Report\u000aalso known as the Ringera Report reveals shocking and endemic corruption in the judiciary and further lists\u000athe names of the judges alleged to have been involved in corrupt and unethical practices in the course of\u000aperforming their duties.\u000a3. On 4th October 2003 during a press conference, the Chief Justice without naming the judges is alleged to\u000ahave given the said judges a two-week ultimatum to resign or face trial. Two days later, the Constitutional\u000aAffairs Assistant Minister is reported to have reiterated the deadline issued by the Chief Justice and warned\u000athat judges who ignore the deadline would face tribunals and prosecution for crimes committed.\u000a4. The Complainant states that the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association was quoted in the press as\u000asaying "we urge the judicial administration to inform those affected so that they can decide on their next\u000acourse of action not forgetting the need for confidentiality" However, the Complainant claims that over the\u000afollowing several days none of the judges named in the report were informed of their presence on the list\u000anor of the allegations leveled against them.\u000a5. The Complainant avers that on 14th October 2003 it was reported through a six o'clock news broadcast\u000athat the President had appointed two tribunals to investigate the twenty-three (23) judges whose names\u000awere announced during the broadcast as well as their suspension. The Complainant asserts that this is the\u000afirst time that the judges learnt of their presence on the list and of their immediate suspension. The\u000aannouncement however did not contain details of the allegations made against each judge. It is however\u000areported in the Daily Nation Newspaper on 18th October 2003 that the police would question some of the\u000ajudges before they appear before the tribunals and it is only during those interrogations they will be\u000ainformed of the accusations against them and their statements taken.\u000a6. The Complainant alleges that as of 17th October 2003, the judges had still not received details of the\u000aallegations made against them despite continued press coverage of the matter. Although maintaining their\u000ainnocence, some of the named judges tendered their resignations or sought retirement.\u000a7. The Complainant further submits that the Chair of the Law Society of Kenya on 18th October 2003\u000aannounced through the press that the Society would in two weeks' time release its report containing a list of\u000ajudges other than those named in the Ringer[a] Report.\u000a8. The Complainant on the whole submits that failure to advise the judges mentioned in the Ringera Report\u000aof the allegations against them and to give them an opportunity to accept or dispute the allegations coupled\u000awith varied threats and warnings amounts to harassment and hounding of judges thereby undermining the\u000aprinciples of security of tenure and the independence of the judiciary.\u000a9. Furthermore, the Complainant claims that the manner in which the whole matter was dealt with violates\u000aArticles 7 and 26 of the African Charter as well as other international human rights instruments namely the\u000aUN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the International Covenant on Civil and Political\u000aRights and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a10. The Complainant alleges a violation of 7 and 26 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a11. The communication was faxed and received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 21st\u000aOctober 2003. The Complainant also requested the African Commission to take provisional Measures\u000aunder Rule 111 of the Rules of the African Commission to ensure that the process of removal of judges\u000adoes not interfere with independence of the judiciary and the right to a fair hearing.\u000a12. The Secretariat of the African Commission on 24th October 2003 forwarded a copy of the\u000acommunication as well as a draft Appeal Letter to the Chair of the African Commission and requested him\u000a1\u000a\u000ato take necessary action.\u000a13. By email dated 28th October 2003, the Chair of the African Commission wrote advising the Secretariat\u000athat since the matter would be handled as a communication at the African Commission's forthcoming 34th\u000aSession, an Appeal Letter should not be sent to the government of Kenya until after the African\u000aCommission had examined the matter and determined what course of action to take.\u000a14. On 31st October 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant\u000aacknowledging receipt of the communication.\u000a15. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission examined the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\u000a16. On 4th December 2003, the parties to the communication were informed accordingly and requested to\u000aforward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication within 3 months.\u000a17. On 15th March 2004, the parties to the communication were reminded to forward their written\u000asubmissions on admissibility to the Secretariat.\u000a18. By email dated 16th March 2004, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant withdrawing the\u000amatter as she believed that the matter was now being addressed by the Respondent State.\u000a19. On 25th March 2004, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility and\u000aacknowledged receipt of the same on 26th March 2004.\u000a20. By letter dated 26th March 2004, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's letter\u000awithdrawing the communication and also forwarded a copy of the Respondent State's submissions on\u000aadmissibility.\u000a21. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission considered this\u000acommunication and decided to close the file.\u000aRespondent State's submissions on admissibility\u000a\u000a22. The Respondent State provides a background against which it undertook the judicial reforms which\u000ahave in part given rise to this communication. They argue that a well functioning judicial system is crucial to\u000aimproving governance, combating corruption and consolidating the democratic order, thereby fostering\u000aeconomically sustainable development. Therefore, a judicial system with integrity should be free from\u000apolitical and external interference. Furthermore, judicial independence must be balanced by accountability\u000ain order to facilitate transparency within the system and control of corruption.\u000a23. It is submitted by the Respondent State that the tendency towards corruption and abuse of power\u000aamong certain members of the judiciary in Kenya has been lamented over time. As such, one of the key\u000aobjectives of the Kenyan government has been to undertake judicial reform in order to develop an impartial,\u000aindependent, accountable and effective judiciary that is able to improve governance and advance\u000adevelopment in the country.\u000a24. The Respondent State contends that the communication does not meet the requirements in Articles\u000a56(2), (4) and (5) of the African Charter.\u000a25. It is submitted that the communication is substantially based on newspaper reports and is therefore not\u000afounded on factual realities of the case contrary to Article 56(4) of the African Charter.\u000a26. The Respondent State further submits that the Complainant did not even attempt to exhaust local\u000aremedies in their case as required by Article 56(5) of the African Charter. In this regard, the Respondent\u000aState argues that the national legal framework in Kenya is adequate to address the concerns raised by the\u000aComplainant and should have therefore been utilised. For instance, the concerns raised by the\u000aComplainant could have been addressed through, the constitutional provisions or national statutes like the\u000aPublic Officer Ethics Act 2003, the Anti Corruption and Economic Crimes Act 2003. Furthermore, local\u000ajudicial action and remedy is available to the judges, should any of the procedures adopted be deemed\u000aillegal or in any case ultra vires.\u000a27. The Respondent State reports that the judges are not on trial as understood but that special\u000ainvestigative tribunals were set up to determine issues touching upon the behaviour and ability of the\u000ajudges implicated to perform the functions of their office. [Twenty-three] (23) judges from both the Court of\u000aAppeal and High Court of Kenya were involved and were investigated within 14 days of the presentation of\u000athe Ringera Report. The Tribunals started sitting on 9th and 16th February 2004.\u000a28. Confidentiality was assured for the affected judges in the initial stages and at all crucial times. Only\u000abroad categories of alleged offences were highlighted in the media. The Respondent State argues that it\u000awas therefore possible for a judge to privately and conscientiously place him/herself into any of the\u000a2\u000a\u000acategories and make a personal decision to resign or appear before the tribunals. Consequently, [the]\u000amajority of the judges mentioned opted for early retirement with full benefits as a result.\u000a29. In any case, the Respondent State argues, that the judges had the option within the laws to challenge\u000athe process before the High Court should they be aggrieved by it but none of the said judges opted for the\u000ajudicial remedy.\u000a30. The Respondent State maintains that the domestic legislation of Kenya is in consonance with both the\u000aletter and spirit of international law including the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary\u000aand asks the African Commission to declare the communication inadmissible.\u000aReasons given by the Complainant for withdrawing the communication\u000a\u000a31. The Complainant wrote to inform the African Commission that they received information that the\u000aRegistrar and Chief Justice did not authorise the leaking of the names of the implicated judges to the press\u000aand that this particular matter was now being investigated by the Judiciary. Furthermore, the issue of a fair\u000atrial in light of the publicity created prior to the suspension of the judges had been raised before the\u000atribunals and that the matter was being handled and could end up with the constitutional court of Kenya\u000a[sic].\u000a32. It is for this reason that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the communication.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aThe African Commission takes note of the withdrawal of the communication by the Complainant\u000aand for this reason decides to close the file.\u000aDone at the 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21st May to 4th June 2004.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a

aV283/03 B / Kenya\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The communication is submitted by a Complainant who requests anonymity and presents the facts of the\u000acase as follows:\u000a2. The Complainant alleges that on 30th September 2003, the Anti-Corruption Committee presented a\u000areport on corruption in the judiciary to the Chief Justice of Kenya in the presence of the press. The Report\u000aalso known as the Ringera Report reveals shocking and endemic corruption in the judiciary and further lists\u000athe names of the judges alleged to have been involved in corrupt and unethical practices in the course of\u000aperforming their duties.\u000a3. On 4th October 2003 during a press conference, the Chief Justice without naming the judges is alleged to\u000ahave given the said judges a two-week ultimatum to resign or face trial. Two days later, the Constitutional\u000aAffairs Assistant Minister is reported to have reiterated the deadline issued by the Chief Justice and warned\u000athat judges who ignore the deadline would face tribunals and prosecution for crimes committed.\u000a4. The Complainant states that the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association was quoted in the press as\u000asaying "we urge the judicial administration to inform those affected so that they can decide on their next\u000acourse of action not forgetting the need for confidentiality" However, the Complainant claims that over the\u000afollowing several days none of the judges named in the report were informed of their presence on the list\u000anor of the allegations leveled against them.\u000a5. The Complainant avers that on 14th October 2003 it was reported through a six o'clock news broadcast\u000athat the President had appointed two tribunals to investigate the twenty-three (23) judges whose names\u000awere announced during the broadcast as well as their suspension. The Complainant asserts that this is the\u000afirst time that the judges learnt of their presence on the list and of their immediate suspension. The\u000aannouncement however did not contain details of the allegations made against each judge. It is however\u000areported in the Daily Nation Newspaper on 18th October 2003 that the police would question some of the\u000ajudges before they appear before the tribunals and it is only during those interrogations they will be\u000ainformed of the accusations against them and their statements taken.\u000a6. The Complainant alleges that as of 17th October 2003, the judges had still not received details of the\u000aallegations made against them despite continued press coverage of the matter. Although maintaining their\u000ainnocence, some of the named judges tendered their resignations or sought retirement.\u000a7. The Complainant further submits that the Chair of the Law Society of Kenya on 18th October 2003\u000aannounced through the press that the Society would in two weeks' time release its report containing a list of\u000ajudges other than those named in the Ringer[a] Report.\u000a8. The Complainant on the whole submits that failure to advise the judges mentioned in the Ringera Report\u000aof the allegations against them and to give them an opportunity to accept or dispute the allegations coupled\u000awith varied threats and warnings amounts to harassment and hounding of judges thereby undermining the\u000aprinciples of security of tenure and the independence of the judiciary.\u000a9. Furthermore, the Complainant claims that the manner in which the whole matter was dealt with violates\u000aArticles 7 and 26 of the African Charter as well as other international human rights instruments namely the\u000aUN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the International Covenant on Civil and Political\u000aRights and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a10. The Complainant alleges a violation of 7 and 26 of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a11. The communication was faxed and received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 21st\u000aOctober 2003. The Complainant also requested the African Commission to take provisional Measures\u000aunder Rule 111 of the Rules of the African Commission to ensure that the process of removal of judges\u000adoes not interfere with independence of the judiciary and the right to a fair hearing.\u000a12. The Secretariat of the African Commission on 24th October 2003 forwarded a copy of the\u000acommunication as well as a draft Appeal Letter to the Chair of the African Commission and requested him\u000a1\u000a\u000ato take necessary action.\u000a13. By email dated 28th October 2003, the Chair of the African Commission wrote advising the Secretariat\u000athat since the matter would be handled as a communication at the African Commission's forthcoming 34th\u000aSession, an Appeal Letter should not be sent to the government of Kenya until after the African\u000aCommission had examined the matter and determined what course of action to take.\u000a14. On 31st October 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant\u000aacknowledging receipt of the communication.\u000a15. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission examined the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\u000a16. On 4th December 2003, the parties to the communication were informed accordingly and requested to\u000aforward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication within 3 months.\u000a17. On 15th March 2004, the parties to the communication were reminded to forward their written\u000asubmissions on admissibility to the Secretariat.\u000a18. By email dated 16th March 2004, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant withdrawing the\u000amatter as she believed that the matter was now being addressed by the Respondent State.\u000a19. On 25th March 2004, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility and\u000aacknowledged receipt of the same on 26th March 2004.\u000a20. By letter dated 26th March 2004, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's letter\u000awithdrawing the communication and also forwarded a copy of the Respondent State's submissions on\u000aadmissibility.\u000a21.

aV286/04 Communication 286 /2004 - Dino Noca vs\u000aDemocratic Republic of the Congo\u000aSummary of the Facts\u000a1. The complaint was brought before the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (the\u000aCommission) on 6 December, 2004 against the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC) or the\u000aRespondent State 1 by Mr. Dino Noca represented by Mr. NYABIRUNGU Mwene Songa, a Lawyer at the\u000aBar of Kinshasa (the Complainant); then by Mr. FAKATI wa LUHINDI Défi Augustin, a Lawyer at the same\u000aBar who later continued with the proceedings.\u000a2. The Complainant presents a dispute concerning a building located in the District of Ibanda and\u000aregistered in the cadastral plan of the city of Bukavu, South Kivu Province, under number 17 R/2 2 , which\u000adispute was ruled on by Judgment No. RCR/C019, on 28 November 2003 by the Supreme Court of Justice\u000aof the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u000a3. The Complainant alleges that the building is the property of the late Lucio NOCA, of Italian nationality,\u000adeceased on 27 May 1992, at Sordevolo, a demise which occurred in the course of the hearing.\u000a4. He further emphasizes the fact that the complainants' rights to the building were covered by the\u000aRegistration Certificate vol. F.XXX, folio 23, which constituted a title deed under the legislation of the\u000aRepublic of Zaire, now the DRC.\u000a5. The Complainant alleges that later on the State adopted Ordinance No. 74-152 of 2 July 1974 relating to\u000aabandoned or undeveloped properties and other assets acquired by the State under the law. Properties\u000acovered by this law were ceded to Congolese nationals and the relevant title deeds were nullified without\u000aintervention by any court.\u000a6. The Complainant alleges that to circumvent the application of the said law, the late Lucio NOCA\u000aentrusted the management of his building to the State-owned National Insurance Company (SONAS) which\u000ahad the competence to manage real estates belonging to non-resident expatriates.\u000a7. The Complainant alleges that in spite of this state of affairs, the building was declared abandoned and\u000aallocated in turn to persons by name Matakina and Kafwa Kasongo respectively. As Mr. Matakina had not\u000asatisfied the required conditions for the aforementioned property to be allocated to him, it was instead\u000aallocated to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo, the then State Prosecutor at the Bukavu High Court, whose claim was\u000adeemed to be valid.\u000a8. The Complainant further submits that the withdrawal of the building from the estate of Noca also followed\u000aOrder No. 1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980, which had wrongly classified the building as abandoned\u000aproperty. 3\u000a9. The Complainant alleges that following an appeal made by SONAS to the competent authority against\u000athis ruling declaring it abandoned property, the latter won the case by Order No. 1440/000207/82 of 20\u000aSeptember 1982, ceding back the building in question.4\u000a10. The Complainant claims that the appeal filed by SONAS was initially ignored by the Head of Lands\u000aDepartment in Bukavu City who requested that the document in his possession be authenticated. This was\u000adone by a telephone message No. 00027/84 dated 5th July 1984. The same message was confirmed by\u000aletter No. 1.440/000748 of the same date from the Minister of Lands, who was then State Commissioner, to\u000arepeal Order no 1.440/000152/80.\u000a11. The Complainant points out that without waiting for the authentication of the document, the Head of the\u000aLands Department issued a registration certificate to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo on 9 June 1984 in defiance of the\u000aorder; whereas the Judgement on the declaration of buildings as abandoned property of 3 September 1980\u000aand Order no.74-152/74 of 2 Jul 1974 had been repealed one after the other on 20 September 1982 and 2\u000aFebruary 1984 by Judgement No. 1440/000207/82 and Order No. 84-026/84 respectively.\u000a12. The Complainant further alleges that copies of the aforementioned documents were produced and\u000acopied at the same time to the Head of the Regional Department of Lands, the Curator of Title Deeds and\u000athe Governor's Office in Kivu Province.\u000a13. The Complainant therefore concludes that the Head of the Regional Department of Lands had acted\u000aknowingly and intentionally refused to wait for the reaction of his superior.\u000a14. The Complainant asserts that following the issuance of the registration certificate to Mr. Kafwa, the\u000aState Counsel for South Kivu was invited by the Ministries of Justice and Lands to file for an annulment of\u000a1\u000a\u000athe title deed wrongfully allocated to Mr. Kafwa.\u000a\u000aThe Complaint\u000a15. The Complainant submits that in the light of the above mentioned facts, the Respondent State has\u000aviolated Articles 3, 7 and 14 of the African Charter.\u000a16. The Complainant further requests the Commission to:\u000a\u2022 Declare judgement No. RCR/C019 of 28th November 2003 null and void following the requested\u000adisqualification of the right of Mr. KAFWA to the disputed property; recognise the right of Mr. NOCA\u000aLucio, and, by extension, his sole heir, Mr. Dino NOCA to the said property.\u000a\u2022 Award to Mr. Dino NOCA as compensation for occupation and deprivation of use of property for 28\u000ayears a minimum amount of USD 400,000, including legal fees.\u000a\u000aThe Procedure\u000a17. The Complaint was submitted on 12 February 2004 to the Secretariat of the Commission, which\u000aacknowledged receipt of it the same day.\u000a18. At its 35th Ordinary Session held from 21 May to 4 June 2004 in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission\u000adecided to be seized of the Communication and requested that the interested Parties be informed. The\u000aSecretariat informed the Parties of the Commission's decision and requested them to submit their written\u000aarguments on admissibility.\u000a19. The Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication to the\u000aSecretariat of the Commission during the deliberations of the 35th Ordinary Session. The Secretariat\u000asubmitted a copy of the complaint and the arguments of the Complainant to representatives of the\u000aRespondent State present at this Session.\u000a20. By an additional submission on the admissibility of the Communication forwarded on 6 December 2004,\u000athe Complainant informed the Secretariat of the Commission about the replacement of Mr. NYABIRUNGU\u000aMwene SONGA by Mr. FATAKI wa LUHINDI D®fi Augustin, a Lawyer at the Bar of Kinshasa/Gombe to\u000apursue his interests at the Commission.\u000a21. The Commission considered the Communication at its 36th, 37th, 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st 42nd and 43th\u000aOrdinary Sessions and at every session deferred its decision for lack of arguments from the Respondent\u000aState on admissibility.\u000a22. The Secretariat informed the parties to the Communication of the Commission's decision by requesting\u000aat each time that the Respondent State should submit its written observations on the admissibility of the\u000aCommunication.\u000a23. A Note verbale as a reminder had been forwarded to the Respondent State on 23 March 2006 with a\u000acopy of the arguments of the Complainant Party attached to it.\u000a24. In another note verbale dated 4 October 2007, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State that the\u000aCommission's decision on deferment was firm on the submission of its written arguments within a period of\u000aone month. In this regard, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State that if it failed to present its\u000aarguments, the Commission would proceed with the consideration of the case on the basis of the facts in\u000athe file.\u000a25. At its 44th Ordinary Session held in Abuja, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Commission declared\u000athe Communication ADMISSIBLE on the basis of the information in its possession.\u000a26. By note verbale and letter dated 19 December 2008, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the\u000aparties that it had declared the Communication admissible and invited them to submit on the merits of the\u000acase before the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled for 13 to 27 May 2009 in Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a27. By note verbale and letter dated 24th April, 2009, the Secretariat of the Commission advised the parties\u000ato file their submissions on the merits of the Communication at the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled for 13th\u000ato 27th May, 2009 in Banjul, the Gambia.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000aArguments of the Complainant on Admissibility\u000a\u000a28. The Complainant argues that the Communication meets all the requirements laid down by Article 56 of\u000athe African Charter. He emphasizes that the Victim is well known and that the Complaint is compatible with\u000athe Charter as it relates to alleged violations by the DRC of Articles 3, 7 and 14 of the African Charter.\u000a29. Still according to the Complainant, the complaint filed at the Commission does not contain any\u000adisparaging remarks against Congolese authorities.\u000a30. The Complainant notes that his Complaint is based on real facts as evidenced by the numerous\u000adocuments submitted in support of the complaint.\u000a31. The Complainant also alleges that local remedies under Congolese law have been exhausted, given\u000athat the Complainant seized the High Court of Bukavu and the Bukavu Appeals Court.\u000a32. The Complainant declares that following a petition lodged on 12 July 1991, the Supreme Court of\u000aJustice, by ruling in judgement No. RC/1704/1705, dated 3 March 1994, had overturned judgement No. RC\u000a1155/1180/1729 delivered on 8 April 1991 by the Bukavu Appeals Court and referred the case to the\u000aAppeals Court in Kinshasa/Matete. By Judgement No. RAC 001 delivered on 29 December 1994, the Court\u000aof Appeal in Kinshasa Matete rejected the appeals of the appellants, namely State, Noca and Kizila.\u000a33. The complainant alleges that a second appeal for annulment of judgment No. RAC 001 rendered on 29\u000aDecember 1994 by the Court of Appeal of Kinshasa/Matete was lodged with the Supreme Court and\u000aregistered under RC029/TSR.\u000a34. The Complainant alleges having even resorted to extraordinary remedies which are vested solely in the\u000aMinister of Justice and Attorney General who had declared the remedy unavailable as confirmed by letter\u000aNo. 1023/mm90/CAB/MIN/J/2004, dated 23 March 2004, which was sent in response to the letter from Mr.\u000aManzila,dated 12 December 2003 (documents attached to the file).\u000a35. The Complainant asserts that the Complaint was lodged with the Commission for almost three months\u000aafter delivery of the final judgment by the Supreme Court on 28 November 2003 and that the Commission\u000ais the only body seized of this matter.\u000aArguments of the Respondent State on Admissibility\u000a\u000a36. The Respondent State made no submission on the admissibility of this communication despite\u000anumerous reminders that had been forwarded to it.\u000aAnalysis of the Commission on Admissibility\u000a\u000a37. The admissibility of Communications submitted in accordance with Article 55 of the Charter is governed\u000aby the requirements stipulated in Article 56 of the same Charter.\u000a38. The Commission consistently made sustained efforts to get the Respondent State to forward its written\u000aarguments and observations on admissibility since its 35th Ordinary Session held from 21 May to 4 June\u000a2004 in Banjul, The Gambia, when the Commission was seized of the Communication.\u000a39. The Commission therefore notes the refusal by the Respondent State to cooperate, and is obliged to\u000aconsider the Communication on the basis of verifiable information provided by the Complainant.\u000a40. Furthermore, it must be noted that during the 42nd Ordinary Session held in Brazzaville, Congo, a\u000adelegation of the Respondent State pledged to exercise due diligence in order to forward its written\u000aarguments on admissibility.\u000a41. The Respondent State, however, did not make any submissions to dispute the arguments of the\u000aComplainant on the admissibility of the case.\u000a42. As a result, the Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance with Article 119\u000aparagraph 45 of its Rules of Procedure and with its own jurisprudence.6\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000aMERITS\u000aObservations of the Complainant on the Merits\u000a\u000a43. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated his rights guaranteed by the African\u000aCharter. In specific terms, the Complainant alleges the violation of Articles 3, 7.1c and 14 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000aOn the alleged violation of Article 14\u000a44. The Complainant alleges that in execution of the measures referred to as economic, based on\u000aCongolese legislation adopted on 2 July 1974 in relation to abandoned or undeveloped properties and\u000aother assets acquired by the State under the law, Mr. NOCA's building covered by the registration\u000acertificate drawn up on 1st September 1952, was declared abandoned.\u000a45. The Complainant also alleges that before leaving the DRC for his native country, Italy, Mr. Dino NOCA\u000ahad taken precautions by entrusting the management of his building to SONAS, an official institution of the\u000aCongolese State. This, according to the Complainant, was one of the conditions for eluding this measure\u000awhich was aimed at declaring his building as abandoned.\u000a46. The Complainant also asserts that despite the fact that Mr. NOCA had complied with this requirement,\u000athe greed to grab the assets of foreigners made some Congolese citizens, in collusion with some State\u000aofficials, to outwit the vigilance of the authorities and declare NOCA's building as abandoned. Thanks to the\u000aintervention of SONAS, an opposition to this action was granted by the Minister of Lands and Property.\u000a47. The Complainant alleges that Mr. NOCA is the undisputed owner of the building situated at no17R/2 in\u000aIbanda in the city of Bukavu and this is based on a registration certificate issued to him by the Curator of\u000aLanded Property Titles on 1st September 1952, an act which consequently recognizes the property right of\u000athe Victim under Congolese law.\u000a48. The Complainant further argues that on the basis of Article 227 of the Congolese Land Law, the\u000aregistration certificate is indisputable after two years of existence with effect from the date of its\u000aestablishment, and the Complainant further argues that notwithstanding this Article 227 of the Land Law\u000aand of Article 14 of the African Charter, Mr. NOCA was deprived of his property right.\u000a49. According to the Complainant, on the basis of Order No 74-152 of 2 July 1974 on abandoned or\u000aundeveloped properties and other assets acquired by the State under the law, a Ministerial Order\u000an?1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980 all the same declared residential plot n?17R/2 situated in\u000aIbanda-Bukavu as abandoned, thus undermining the rights of the Victim.\u000a50. The Complainant further alleges that two years after the appeal for annulment filed by SONAS, the\u000aabove mentioned Order was annulled by Order no1440/000207/82 of 20 September 1982.\u000a51. The Complainant asserts that the Order of the Minister responsible for Landed Property and Real\u000aEstate was communicated by letter dated 20 September 1982 to the SONAS Property Manager on the\u000asame day.\u000a52. The Complainant also alleges that two years after the annulment of the Order of 3rd September 1980,\u000athe President of the Republic pronounced the Order no84-026 of 2nd February 1984 relating to the repeal of\u000athe Order on abandoned or undeveloped property and other assets acquired by the State under the law of\u000a2 July 1974.\u000a53. The Complainant also points out that the repeal of this Order had been justified in these terms:\u000a"unfortunately, the difficulty of determining the objective criteria of the abandonment, the insufficiency and\u000athe vagueness of those set out by this Order (of 2nd July 1974), the brevity of the opposition time frame and\u000athe inefficiency of the publicity measures have given rise to an alarming opinion at both the national and\u000ainternational levels that this law is only aimed at merely confiscating the landed property of foreigners.\u000aFurthermore, its application has given rise to considerable fraud. Several unscrupulous and dishonest\u000aindividuals with the complicity of the Public Service, have used it to defraud others illegally. This has\u000aresulted in the numerous cases of litigation now pending before our Courts and Tribunals and which too\u000aoften undermine the responsibility of the State".\u000a54. The Complainant alleges that the NOCA case is an illustration of this relation in which the complicity of\u000athe administration is evidenced in the manoeuvres of the Real Estate Curator (State Official) of the city of\u000aBukavu who, under the guise of adherence to procedure, and by his letter dated 30th May 1984, requested\u000afrom his superior, the Minister responsible for Landed Property and Real Estate, clarification regarding the\u000aauthenticity of Order n?1440/000207/09/82 of 20th September 1982 which repealed Order\u000a4\u000a\u000ano1440/000152/80 of 3rd September 1980 because there was no trace of the said document in the file of\u000athe disputed property and his Department had only a photocopy.\u000a55. The Complainant further alleges that only 8 days after forwarding his letter to the Minister for Landed\u000aProperty, namely on the 9th June 1984, this official, who was bent on undermining the interests of Mr. Noca,\u000adecided to issue the registration certificate for Mr. NOCA's building to Mr. KAFWA, in violation, among\u000aothers, of the provisions of Article 235 of the Land Law which stipulates that: "except in cases where the\u000aassignment is ordered by law or in those provided for by special laws, no assignment can be effected\u000awithout prior delivery to the Curator of a certificate in replacement. In all cases of assignment, the old\u000acertificate recorded in the Registration Book must be marked with an annulment stamp and with a note\u000aindicating, in the format established by Article 226, the reasons for annulment and the date and number of\u000athe new certificate".\u000a56. The Complainant recalls the fact that this decision of the Curator notwithstanding, close to 25 days\u000aafterwards, namely on the 5th July 1984, the Minister for Land Matters sent a letter and a phone message\u000ato the Curator in which he confirmed the repeal of the Order of 3rd September 1980, but this did not bother\u000athe Curator to the point of making him go back on his decision and annul the registration certificate which\u000ahad been unjustly established for the benefit of Mr. KAFWA.\u000a57. The Complainant underscores that the right to property guaranteed by the Charter is fully recognized by\u000athe Constitution of the DRC and conveyed by the Congolese doctrine. Indeed, Article 36 of the Constitution\u000astipulates that "private property is sacred. The State guarantees individual or collective property rights\u000aacquired pursuant to law or custom."7 These rights may be undermined only by virtue of a law and for\u000areasons of general interest, subject to prior and fair compensation payable to the person being deprived of\u000ahis rights. Finally, according to Article 37 paragraph 2 of the Constitution "No one shall be dispossessed of\u000ahis property except by virtue of a decision taken by a competent judicial authority."\u000a58. The Complainant considers that all these constitutional provisions establish the constitutional bases\u000aand value of property in general and, in particular ownership, in the DRC.\u000a59. The Complainant points out that the decision of the Curator is confiscatory and devoid of any legal\u000abasis considering that the Order declaring the NOCA building abandoned and the Ordinance on abandoned\u000aproperty had been repealed.\u000a60. The Complainant argues that the repeal of the Order of 3rd September 1980 and the Order of 2nd July\u000a1974 have amply buttressed Mr. NOCA's right to ownership of the aforementioned building.\u000a61. The Complainant concludes that despite the two repeals and the constitutional guarantees of property\u000arights, the State, through its agent the Curator of Landed Property, has wrongfully dispossessed Mr. NOCA\u000aof his property. Hence it may safely be concluded that Article 14 of the Charter has been violated.\u000aOn the violation of Articles 3 and 7. 1. c\u000a62. The Complainant alleges that despite the formal decision taken by the aforementioned Minister to\u000aremove the NOCA building from the category of abandoned assets, Mr. Kafwa, then State Prosecutor at\u000athe Bukavu High Court in South Kivu, used his position of authority and his relations with the South Kivu\u000aprovincial authorities to obtain a Title Deed for the NOCA building.\u000a63. Alerted by SONAS, the Ministers of Justice and Land Matters instructed the State Counsel for Kivu\u000aProvince to seize the Court for the annulment of the Title Deed illegally issued to the former Public\u000aProsecutor Mr. Kafwa.\u000a64. The Complainant submits that on the basis of the observation that the State Commissioner for Land\u000aAffairs had annulled the letter allocating the disputed property in favour of citizen KAFWA through letter No.\u000a1440/OOO7/48/84 of 5th July 1984, the Congolese State had instituted proceedings under RC 1443 against\u000aKAFWA for the annulment of the Certificate issued to the latter to the detriment of the late NOCA. Contrary\u000ato all expectations, the Bukavu Tribunal had rejected the request of the State for non justification through its\u000aJudgement of 10th June 1985 which was to be served on the State of DRC on the 17 July 1985 represented\u000aby the Governor of the Kivu Region in Bukavu.\u000a65. The Complainant goes on to say that curiously, the same Governor of the Region who had issued an\u000aillegal order to the Curator to issue the registration certificate to Mr. KAFWA, even though the Judgement\u000ahad quite rightly been served on him, refrained from seizing the competent authorities to appeal against this\u000aruling.\u000a66. Nonetheless, according to the Complainant, the Appeals Court was seized by special powers of the\u000aMinister of Justice to the State Attorney against this decision considered illegal. Thus, the Government of\u000athe DRC, through its Secretary of State for Justice filed an appeal under RCA 1180 against the Judgement\u000a5\u000a\u000aof 10 June 1985. For his part, against this same ruling, the successors of the late NOCA instituted a\u000athird-party opposition under RC 1729 before the Bukavu High Court, but the Appeals Judge confirmed his\u000acolleague's first proof ruling.\u000a67. The Complainant further states that the Minister gave a second instruction to his Counsel in the\u000aSupreme Court to seize this Court to set aside the Judgement rendered by the Bukavu Appeals Court. This\u000ajudgement was annulled and the case returned to the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court.\u000a68. The Complainant alleges that the State did not win the case before this Court and again through the\u000aintermediary of the Minister of Justice introduced a second petition for annulment against the judgement\u000aRAC 001 of 29/12/1994 issued by the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court. The Supreme Court, seized once\u000aagain, did not give in to the State's request and the case was dismissed.\u000a69. The Complainant notes that the demise of Mr. Lucio Noca in Sorvedolo, Italy in 1992, occurred\u000asubsequent to the institution of the first annulment proceedings initiated in 1991 and the Supreme Court\u000adeemed it necessary to call the Noca successor to the case to enable the latter to present his case and\u000adefend his interests just like Mr. Kafwa.\u000a70. According to the Complainant, the ruling of the Supreme Court under Judgement No RCR/C 019 of 14\u000aJuly 2000 ordered the successors in title of the late NOCA to continue the suit in the following terms: "Start\u000aproceedings to allow perfecting of the case. Give instructions for the notification of dates to be issued\u000acollectively to the successors in title of the late NOCA LUCIO to the elected Domicile during his lifetime". 8\u000a71. The Complainant further alleges that, on the subject of the pursuance of the lawsuit, this Judgement\u000aputs forward the following reasons: "the Court indicates that the combination of Articles 19 and 20 of the\u000aprocedure applicable before it, the time frame appoints beforehand the 6 months set out collectively to the\u000asuccessors in title at the last elected domicile. This formality was not fulfilled in this case. In consequence,\u000asince Mr. NOCA's successors in title were not informed of the current proceedings, they cannot be\u000apresumed to have withdrawn from the pursuance of the lawsuit".\u000a72. The Complainant contends that afterwards the Dino Noca party was summoned to pursue the lawsuit\u000aby a writ served by a bailiff 9 under the terms of Judgment No RCR/C 019 of 14 July 2002.\u000a73. The Complainant states that as the sole heir to Lucio Noca's estate,Mr. Dino Noca responded to the\u000asummons of the Supreme Court to resume the suit during which he became a constrained party, a position\u000awhich is clarified by an author as follows: "where a party has just died when a case is pending, a voluntary\u000aor constrained resumption of the suit may be resorted to by the heirs in order to continue the\u000aproceedings"10\u000a74. The Complainant also alleges that it is surprising to note that in spite of the decision by the Supreme\u000aCourt to resume the case pending before it, the latter surprisingly prohibited the NOCA Party, under\u000ajudgement RCR/C019 delivered on the merit on 28th November 2003, from submitting the case for the\u000adefence by rejecting the right of the Noca succession's pursuance of the suit that it had itself decided and a\u000aallow a third-party opposition. According to that Judgement, the following was stipulated: "regarding the\u000athird-party opposition and the pursuance of the suit, the Court rules that the Judgement RC029/TSR having\u000abeen declared inadmissible, the joint appeal of 3rd May 1995 as emanating from Mr. NOCA Lucio who had\u000apassed away on the 27th May 1992, the issue is definitively settled since Judgement No RAC/001 of 29\u000aDecember 1994 of the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court which had acquired competence of the case had\u000airrevocably judged against the NOCA Lucio successors. Consequently, the pursuance of the suit should not\u000ahave been ordered".11\u000a75. The Complainant regrets that in spite of his determination to continue the suit, the Supreme Court did\u000anot give him that opportunity because it rescinded its decision to allow the suit to continue by nullifying it,\u000awhereas in such circumstances, if the Supreme Court had thought it had made a mistake by forcing Dino\u000aNoca to continue the suit, it should have reopened proceedings for the purposes of notifying Dino Noca of\u000athis fact.\u000a76. The Complainant believes that the parties should therefore take the written conclusions and present\u000aarguments on the position of the Supreme Court with regard to the resumption of the suit by the heirs of\u000alate Noca which is presumed to have been wrongly ordered.\u000a77. The Complainant asserts that the final decision RCR/C019 of 28 November 2003 pretends to be\u000aunaware of the existence of the previous decision RCR/C 019 of 14 July 2002, which provides the above\u000areasons as justification for the pursuance of the suit by the Noca claimants.\u000a78. The Complainant is outraged at the possibility that the composition of the Court, which is the author of\u000athe decision of 28 November 2003, should have a real problem of interpretation of these two decisions\u000awhich it was required to reconcile in light of the judgment delivered by all sections put together.\u000a6\u000a\u000a79. The Complainant further alleges that the final judgment RCR/CO19 of 28 November 2003 which\u000adismissed the obligation to reopen the proceedings for hearings on the position of Dino Noca, thus deprived\u000athe latter of the "right to have his case heard", which right would have provided the Noca party the\u000apossibility of appearing for hearing at the Court to prove its claims to the building under litigation12\u000a80. The Complainant further alleges that this attitude of the Court violates in consequence Article 7. 1c and\u000aArticle 3 of the African Charter. On the one hand, the Noca Lucio successors represented by their legal\u000aliquidator Mr. Dino Noca had not had the opportunity to adequately prepare their case for the defense, the\u000aevidence and submission of arguments to counter the claims and evidence of the adverse party. On the\u000aother hand, the principle of equality before the law stipulated in Article 3 of the Charter was violated since\u000aonly the case of the opposing party, in this instance Mr. Kafwa, had been taken into account.\u000a81. According to the Complainant, in light of the foregoing, there is no shadow of doubt that the provisions\u000aof Article 7. 1c and 3 of the Charter were violated by the Supreme Court, an institution run by officials of\u000aState of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\u000aArguments of the Respondent State on the Merits\u000a\u000a82. The Respondent State claims that following a request for land ownership signed on 30 January 1984 by\u000aMr. Kafwa, then Public Prosecutor in Bukavu, the Curator of Real Estate of Bukavu by letter\u000an?2448.5/820/84 of 27 March 1984, had proposed to the State Commissioner responsible for Land Issues\u000athat he be allocated the building situated on plot 17R/2 in Ibanda, formerly owned by NOCA and declared\u000aabandoned by Order n?1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980 and allocated the same day to a certain\u000aMATAKINA who up to the date of the proposal had not paid for the cost to the Public Treasury.\u000a83. The Respondent State argues that at the time the Curator of Title Deeds was making this proposal, he\u000awas unaware that the abandonment order had already been repealed by Order No. 1440/000207/82 of 20\u000aSeptember 1982\u000a84. The Respondent State alleges that in response to the letter from the Curator of Title Deeds, the State\u000aCommissioner allocated the disputed building to the party per letter no 1445/21/000605/84 of 23 May 1984.\u000aHowever, at the time that the registrar was getting ready to issue the title deeds to give effect to the\u000aallocation made by the State Commissioner, he was informed about the existence of the repeal order.\u000a85. The Respondent State further indicates that by a letter dated 30 May 1984, it requested the State\u000aCommissioner to confirm the authenticity of the said Order of which he had only been provided with an\u000aordinary photocopy. On 2nd June 1984, the Governor of the Region requested the Curator to prepare the\u000aTitle Deed in favour of Mr. KAFWA in view of the former owner's lack of interest in recovering his property.\u000a86. The Respondent State in its memorandum states that on the 9th June 1984, the Curator of Real Estate\u000asigned a lifetime lease with the applicant in favour of whom he prepared the registration certificate volume\u000aF 82-folio3, sequel to the receipt by the Authorities of the costs relating to the valuation of the building as\u000awell as the related expenses, so that following the annulment of the Order that had declared the property\u000aabandoned, the concerned parties could no longer make a claim to the legal authorities for the building for\u000awhich the ownership had been finally and legally allocated to the applicant pursuant to Section 227 of the\u000aLand Law which stipulates that the registration certificate was final and constituted evidence as of right of\u000athe ownership of the building.\u000a87. The Respondent State further says that on the 18th July 1984, the DRC, on the signing by the State\u000aCommissioner in charge of Landed Property, instructed his Counsel in the following terms: "the Curator has\u000aissued a registration certificate to Citizen KAFWA KASONGO BIN KASENDE. This certificate, having no\u000alegal basis, I ask you to institute legal proceedings for its annulment".\u000a88. It would appear from the arguments of the Respondent State that using as basis the Report of the State\u000aCommissioner for Landed Property, the DRC had instituted a lawsuit against Mr. KAFWA under RC 1443\u000arequesting the annulment of Mr. KAFWA's registration certificate. The outcome was a Judgement on the\u000a10th June 1985, the terms of which declared the demurrer groundless for want of qualification raised by the\u000aRespondent; the suit of the original plaintiff and dismissed it in consequence; the suit of the Respondent on\u000areconversion; and condemned each of the Parties to pay half of the taxed costs.\u000a89. The Respondent State shows further that the Republic of Zaire (currently DRC) was notified of the\u000aJudgement on the 17th July 1985 represented by the Regional President of the MPR and the Governor of\u000athe Kivu Region in Bukavu who was in the latter's office discussing it with Mr. BALAGIZI, official of the\u000aGovernorate who signed for receipt of the notification, in conformity with Article 8 of the Civil Procedure\u000aCode.\u000a7\u000a\u000a90. The Respondent State further indicates that the DRC having refrained from filing an appeal within the\u000atimeframe laid down by law, the Chief Registrar of the Kivu Appeals Court in Bukavu issued to Mr. KAFWA\u000aon the 19th August 1985, a certificate reporting the absence of any appeal on the part of the DRC against\u000aruling No RC.1443.\u000a91. In order to fully enjoy his right of ownership, Mr. KAFWA filed a writ for eviction under RC 1683 on 22\u000aNovember 1985 against Mr. KIZILA wa TUBULWA who according to the Respondent State was occupying\u000athe disputed building with neither Title Deed nor right under RC 1683.\u000a92. The case having been adjourned on two successive occasions, it eventually took place with Mr. NOCA\u000aLucio and Mr. KASILEMBO KAKIENGNE through a subpoena for intervention of 3 January 1986.\u000a93. The Respondent State asserts that during the proceedings Mr. KASILEMBO had placed his withdrawal\u000aon record following a letter of 8 January 1986.\u000a94. The Respondent State continues by saying that the case (RC 1683) of the 19th February 1986 led to\u000aMr. KIZILA and his family being condemned to eviction and to the payment of an amount of fifty thousand\u000a(50,000) zaire to Mr. KAFWA; and also condemned Messrs NOCA Lucio, KAZILA, KASILEMBO to pay a\u000athird each of the costs.\u000a95. The Respondent State still in its memorandum declared that the DRC, sequel to the acquisition of a\u000aspecial proxy provided by the Secretary of State for Justice on behalf of DRC filed an appeal on the 12th\u000aFebruary 1986 under RCA.1180 against the Judgement RC.1443.\u000a96. Mr. KIZILA also filed for appeal under RCA 1155 against RC 1683 of 19 February 1986. Mr. NOCA\u000aLucio also instituted proceedings under RC 1729 before the Bukavu High Court supposedly in third-party\u000aopposition against Judgement No RC 1443.\u000a97. The Respondent State further declares that by a ruling of the 7th July 1986, the Bukavu High Court\u000areferred the case in third-party opposition on the express request of the third opponent NOCA Lucio to the\u000aCourt of Appeal for it to be joined to that of RCA 1155 which was pending on the appeal of KIZILA and\u000aRCA.1180 pending on the appeal of the Republic.\u000a98. A single and only Judgement was delivered by the Bukavu Court of Appeal after having ruled on the\u000aentire litigation after combination of the different cases under RCA 1180/1155 and RC 1729, declaring them\u000ainadmissible for violation of the law of Mr. NOCA's third party opposition under RC 1729 and the appeal of\u000athe Republic under RCA 1180 and the unjustified appeal of Mr. KIZILA under RCA.1155.\u000a99. The Respondent State further declares that the first appeal for annulment of judgement No.\u000aRCA1155/1180/1729 of 9 April 1991 was filed through the requests of 31st May and 25th June 1991 by the\u000aparties NOCA Lucio, KIZILA and the DRC under RC1704/1705. The outcome was a Judgement of the 3rd\u000aMarch 1994 delivered by the Supreme Court referring the case to the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court and\u000astated the law that: "the jurisdiction of discharge should not take into account the notification of the first\u000aproof ruling served to the Governor of the Region in lieu and on behalf of the Ministry of Justice or of his\u000adelegate to decree the inadmissibility of the appeal by the Republic of Zaire for lateness".\u000a100. The Respondent State also intimates that in view of Mr. NOCA's demise on the 27th May 1992 in\u000aSorvedolo in Italy, since no haste was made to direct the case to the Matete Appeals Court which had been\u000aduly seized by the ruling on referral by the Supreme Court, Mr. KAFWA took charge of it by sending to the\u000adifferent parties the notifications for appeals and subpoenas and the notifications for the dates of the\u000acommon hearings. The Court of Appeal, satisfied that it had been duly seized of the said acts, ruled on the\u000acase and pronounced on 20 December 1994, under RCA.001, a ruling confirming the appealed Judgment\u000ain all its provisions.\u000a101. The Respondent State asserts that the Judgement delivered paved the way for an appeal for\u000aannulment initiated under RC. 029/TSR by way of an application filed on 3rd May 1995 at the Registry of\u000athe Supreme Court by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Noca Lucio and KIZILA WATUMBULWA\u000arespectively.\u000a102. The Supreme Court ruled by Judgement of the 21st January 2000. It declared inadmissible the appeal\u000afor annulment emanating from NOCA Lucio, but received the joint appeal by the DRC and KIZILA\u000aWATUMBULWA, the said counsel and referred the case to the Judicial Division for ruling on the merits.\u000a103. The Respondent State further indicates that the case referred by the ruling of the Appeals Court to the\u000aJudicial Division of the Supreme Court had had two major highlights, namely the pursuance of the suit by\u000athe successors of NOCA Lucio, deceased on 27 December 1992, and then the testimony of the said\u000asuccessors under the terms of which the late NOCA Lucio, during his lifetime, had already sold the\u000adisputed building to Mr. KASILEMO, with the consequence that his successors could no longer lay any\u000aclaim to the disputed building.\u000a8\u000a\u000a104. For the Respondent State, a reproduction of the testimony of the successors and the Deed of\u000apursuance of the suit was done so as to establish the futility of the lawsuit instituted by Mr. NOCA Dino\u000abefore the Commission.\u000a105. Following reading of the terms of the late NOCA Lucio's will, the Respondent State declares that\u000aNOCA Dino admitted that his father had sold the disputed building to Mr. KASILEMBO. Therefore, the only\u000alogical conclusion to be drawn was that the said building had long ago ceased to be part of Mr. NOCA\u000aLucio's inheritance and estate. According to the State, it was with good reason that the Supreme Court had\u000adismissed all of Mr. NOCA Dino's claims. Consequently, it is up to Mr. KASILEMBO to claim his landed\u000aproperty.\u000a106. The Respondent State in its conclusion asserts that according to the history of the facts and\u000abackground of the case, Mr. KASILEMBO, having been subpoenaed to the suit RC1683 in voluntary\u000aintervention of 3rd January 1986, he also voluntarily withdrew his suit and in any case did not file any\u000aappeal against the Judgement of the 19th February 1986 which had declared his suit inadmissible for non\u000apayment of deposit. Thus, the real property rights on which Mr. NOCA Dino based his appeal having been\u000atransmitted at the time to Mr. KASILEMBO, or at least since 1986, Mr. NOCA Dino should have his appeal\u000adismissed for want of qualification due to the absence of his own claimed right to the property.\u000a107. The Respondent State in its memorandum is of the view that since Mr. NOCA, Father, could not take\u000aadvantage of a right to property which he had already assigned to a third Party; his successor had\u000awrongfully pleaded the violation of Article 14 of the Charter to which he is a stranger.\u000a108. With regard to the violation of Article 7 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that Mr.\u000aNOCA Dino is taking advantage of his own wrongdoing or more specifically of the fraud in his claim.\u000a109. The Respondent State in fact further indicates that as the case referred by the ruling of the Appeals\u000aCourt to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court for the determination of the merits was the result of the\u000afiling of the second appeal which the Supreme Court considered as justified that brought about the second\u000aappeal, it was only natural for it to be quashed in respect of Mr. NOCA Lucio, once it was revealed at the\u000aJudicial Division of the Supreme Court that the second appeal which was based on this second appeal was\u000afraudulent as it was filed on 3 May 1995 on behalf of Mr. NOCA Lucio whose demise had occurred on 27\u000aMay,1992.\u000a110. The Respondent State concludes by saying that it was therefore natural that the successor of the\u000adeceased who claimed to have filed an appeal should be kept out of the proceedings.\u000a111. The Respondent State claims that the Supreme Court's action, the reasoning of which is\u000airreproachable in law, cannot at all be considered as a violation of Article 7 of the Charter.\u000aComplainant's rebuttal on the Merits\u000a\u000a112. The Complainant contends that while looking at the facts, the Respondent State has itself outlined the\u000aprocess of putting the late NOCA at a disadvantage by its officials.\u000a113. The Complainant points out that following a request for land on the 30th January 1984 submitted by\u000aMr. KAFWA, then Public Prosecutor in Bukavu, the Curator, who had all the same been informed of the\u000aabrogation of Order n?1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980 by Order no 1440/000207/82 of 20 September\u000a1982 restoring the rights of Mr. Noca.\u000a114. He notes that the Curator, by complying with an order that is palpably illegal, later on 9 June 1984,\u000aestablished a registration certificate volume F 82-folio 3, in the form of a title deed in favour of Mr. KAFWA.\u000a115. The Complainant points out the decision smacks of complicity between the Governor of the region, the\u000aCurator of title deeds and KAFWA. But he later indicates that later, the Minister of State in charge of\u000aLanded Property instructed his Counsel Mr. MAMBOLEO in the following terms: "...the Curator has issued\u000aa registration certificate to citizen KAFWA KASONGO BIN KASENDE. As this registration certificate has no\u000alegal basis, I request you to institute proceedings to have it annulled".\u000a116. Then began the proceedings of the DRC against KAFWA joined by the NOCA party for the triumph of\u000ajustice and truth.\u000a117. The Complainant first of all underlines the fact that all the legal actions to which the late NOCA had\u000abeen a party or had had to initiate, in the final analysis, had been to defend his interests and that of his\u000aestate. He points out that at no time in the proceedings did any court sitting on the merits or cassation find it\u000anecessary to raise objection, which in principle cannot happen at this stage. No court has ever dismissed\u000athe case of the late NOCA for want of quality, an argument which cannot be brought up for the first time\u000abefore the Commission by the DRC.\u000a9\u000a\u000a118. The Complainant further indicates that in view of the legal proceedings that the Respondent State had\u000ahad to institute instead of trying to defend itself against the violation of the African Charter by its officials, for\u000awhich reason it finds itself before the Commission, it should have taken the lead and humbly acknowledged\u000athe injury suffered by the petitioner and in addition propose means of arriving at an amicable settlement of\u000athis dispute.\u000a119. The Complainant alleges that concerning the sole argument seeking the dismissal of NOCA's appeal\u000aon the grounds that the building is no longer the property of the late Mr NOCA and, therefore, of his\u000asuccessor; we think it would be useful to have recourse to constant jurisprudence in that contracts can only\u000agive rise to actual obligations and cannot affect by themselves the transfer of real rights, even between the\u000acontracting parties, and that the conveyance of property can only stem from an entry into the registration\u000arecord13 . This ruling by the Court of First Instance was upheld by the Supreme Court.14\u000a120. The Complainant, in addition, underscored that this jurisprudence has remained constant to this day,\u000ain spite of the divergence in opinion with regard to the doctrine. On the grounds of this jurisprudence, it was\u000adecided that only the holder of a registration certificate can claim ownership of a building and the property\u000ashall be deemed to belong to him as long as the transfer has not taken place. In this particular case, the\u000amatter referred to the Commission by NOCA Dino, son and sole heir to the late NOCA Lucio, can only be\u000aadmissible because of the position of this jurisprudence.\u000a121. Moreover, the Complainant argues, as indicated in the memorandum on admissibility, that the African\u000aCommission does not make legal formalism its pet subject; but that the most important thing is to know\u000awhether the African Charter has been violated; which has amply been demonstrated and recognized by the\u000aRespondent State itself.\u000a122. The Complainant concludes by praying the Commission, in view of the foregoing, to do justice to the\u000aComplainant's request and to his subsequent requests.\u000aThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\u000a\u000a123. In the present Communication, the Commission seeks to determine if the assignment of the Noca\u000abuilding to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo constitutes a violation of Articles 3, 7.1(c) and 14 of the African Charter.\u000a124. The violation of Article 14 of the African Charter will first be examined, given that this provision is the\u000asource of the other violations.\u000a125. Articles 3 and 7.1(c) will be examined together, given that both articles were violated in the same\u000acircumstances of time and place.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 14\u000a126. The Complainant argues that the decision taken by the Curator of Title Deeds to issue the registration\u000acertificate of Mr. NOCA's building to Mr. KAFWA was a violation of Article 14 of the African Charter.\u000a127. Article 14 of the African Charter states that: "The right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be\u000aencroached upon in the interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in\u000aaccordance with the provisions of appropriate laws".15\u000a128. Before the Commission determines whether Article 14 was violated in this present Communication,\u000athere is the need to ascertain who can be the holder of a property right. Article 14 of the Charter does not\u000aspecify who the holder of the right of ownership is 16 . However, its interpretation in the light of Article 2 of\u000athe African Charter 17 , and the jurisprudence of the Commission18 clearly show, beyond reasonable doubt,\u000athat every individual has the right to property under the Charter.\u000a129. In the present Communication, the victim, Mr. Noca, an Italian national, alleges that his property was\u000astolen under the pretext of the execution of residential measures referred to as economic measures based\u000aon the Congolese law of 2 July 1974 relative to abandoned or undeveloped property and other assets\u000aacquired by the State under the law.\u000a130. The Complainant affirms that in order to avoid the likelihood of his building being declared as\u000aabandoned, thereby paving the way for its transfer to Congolese nationals; his client had taken all the\u000anecessary precaution by entrusting his building to SONAS before leaving the DRC.\u000a131. Notwithstanding this precaution taken by Mr. Noca, the Complainant said the greed to grab the assets\u000aof foreigners motivated some Congolese, in collusion with some State officials, to deceive the authorities\u000aand declare NOCA's building as abandoned through Order No. 1440/000152/80 of 3rd September 1980.\u000a132. The Complainant argues, however, that following the intervention of SONAS which formulated\u000afavourable opposition in this regard and which was accepted by the Minister responsible for landed\u000a10\u000a\u000aproperty and real estate matters, a decision was taken to formally exclude NOCA's building from the\u000acategory of abandoned buildings as per Order no1440/000207/82 of 20th September 1982.\u000a133. The Complainant further indicates that two years after the annulment of the Order of 3rd September\u000a1980, the President of the Republic issued Ordinance No. 84-026 of 2 February 1984 repealing the\u000aOrdinance relating to abandoned or undeveloped property and other assets acquired by the State under\u000athe law.\u000a134. The Complainant argues that, in spite of these repeals, the Registrar of Land Titles took on the heavy\u000aresponsibility of issuing to Mr. KAFWA the registration certificate for Mr. NOCA's building.\u000a135. The Respondent State argues that following a land application by Mr. KAFWA, then State Prosecutor\u000aat the Bukavu High Court, the Registrar of property titles proposed he should be allocated the property\u000aformerly owned by Mr. NOCA, which was declared abandoned on 3rd September 1980 and allocated on the\u000asame day to a certain MATAKINA who, until the date of the proposal had not made any payment into the\u000apublic treasury.\u000a136. In its response, the Respondent State claimed that at the time the Registrar made the proposal, he\u000awas unaware that the 1980 Abandonment Order had been repealed by Order no 1440/000207/82 of 20\u000aSeptember 1982 19 .\u000a137. The Commission notes that though it is true that the administration was unaware of the repeal and the\u000aopposition raised during the procedure for registration and issuance of the title deed and issued a title deed\u000afor a piece of land which already had a title deed, it means that the State failed in its obligation to protect\u000athe rights of foreigners living in its territory, and that the State could have demonstrated good faith by\u000areinstating the rights of the victim.\u000a138. In any case, the Commission notes that the Head of the Lands Department in the city of Bukavu\u000areceived a copy of the annulment of the Order declaring the NOCA building as abandoned, given that he\u000aeven requested the authentication of the document in his possession. This request was made through\u000atelephone message No. 00027/84 of 5 July 1984 and letter No. 1.440/000748 of the same 5 July 1984,\u000afrom the Minister of Lands, then State Commissioner, confirming the repeal of Order No. 1.440/000152/80.\u000a139. The Commission also notes that even though the Head of the Lands Department had requested\u000aauthentication of the document, he did not wait for the aforementioned responses, but proceeded with the\u000aissuance of the registration certificate to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo.\u000a140. The Commission deplores the lack of diligence and goodwill on the part of the Head of Division, who\u000abefore the assignment of the Noca plot of land, could have waited for the response of the Minister of Lands\u000ain respect of the authenticity of the copy relating to the annulment of the Order declaring the building as\u000aabandoned property.\u000a141. It is quite right that the Complainant cites jurisprudence according to which only the holder of a\u000aregistration certificate can lay claim to the ownership of a building and the property is deemed to belong to\u000ahim as long as the transfer of property ownership has not been made.\u000a142. On the argument of the Respondent State that due to the lack of interest by the former owner to\u000arecover his property, the Commission believes that for the owner to entrust the management of his building\u000ato SONAS before leaving Zaire (now DRC) was a means for Mr. NOCA to maintain his property a link with\u000ahis property which excludes lack of interest to recover his property as claimed by the Respondent State.\u000a143. The Commission notes that the right to ownership embodies two key principles. The first is a general\u000aone which focuses on the principle of the right of ownership and the peaceful enjoyment of property. The\u000asecond principle focuses on the possibility and condition of deprivation of the right to property 20 . Article 14\u000aof the African Charter recognizes that States are authorized to violate it under certain circumstances,\u000aparticularly, to control the use of the property in the public or general interest by administering laws which\u000aare deemed necessary towards that end.\u000a144. In Communication 276/2003 Centre for Minority Rights Development (Kenya) and Minority Rights\u000aGroup International on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council vs. Kenya (Endorois case), of May 2009, the\u000aCommission dealt at length with the right to ownership and established a two-pronged criterion which sets\u000aout that this right cannot be violated except "in the interest of the public or in the general interest of the\u000acommunity" and "in conformity with the provisions of the appropriate laws" 21 ; this latter aspect referring to\u000adomestic and international laws 22 .\u000a145. At the same time, the Commission has indicated that the limitations to the right to property should be\u000adetermined in the light of the principle of proportionality, meaning that interference in the right to property\u000amust be "proportional to a legitimate need, and should represent the least restrictive measure possible" 23 .\u000aThat is not the case for the Communication under review.\u000a11\u000a\u000a146. Moreover, in the situation depicted in the present Communication, the Commission notes that the\u000aState has not demonstrated that the Complainant's building was confiscated in the interest of public need\u000aor general interest. The deprivation was done without any legal basis as the Respondent State itself had\u000ataken so many decisions on the same building in the interest of the Complainant.\u000a147. Without such a justification and adequate compensation determined by an impartial court of\u000acompetent jurisdiction, the African Commission believes that the actions of the Respondent State are in\u000aviolation of the right to property guaranteed by Article 14 of the African Charter. 24\u000a148. On the defence of the Respondent State that it was no longer admissible for the interested parties to\u000aclaim before the court property whose ownership was finally and legally vested in the applicant under\u000aArticle 227 of the Land Law which provides that the registration certificate is an absolute proof of ownership\u000aof buildings, the Commission believes that it is never too late to stop any violation and make reparation for\u000aits consequences.\u000a149. The Commission notes that the Respondent State is not contesting the repeal of the Order of 3rd\u000aSeptember 1980 as well as the Ordinance of 2nd July, 1974, texts which are the basis for the withdrawal of\u000athe disputed building from the inheritance of Mr. Noca.\u000a150. The Commission believes these two repeals fully consolidated the ownership right of Mr. NOCA to the\u000aabove mentioned building; given that after the repeal, the Order declaring the Noca building an abandoned\u000aproperty became null and void.\u000a151. The Commission, from a legal standpoint, further believes the annulment of the two Orders ought to\u000aresult either in the annulment of the Title Deed issued on the basis of these two repealed texts, therefore\u000adubiously obtained or the restoration of a duly obtained Title Deed by Mr. Noca.\u000a152. The Commission further argues that the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter are based on\u000aprocedural rules for their effective enjoyment. The application of these procedural rules giving effect to the\u000aenjoyment of those rights should be followed in that, in the present case, their misapplication can deny the\u000afundamental rights, thus leading to the limitation or deprivation thereof.\u000a153. The Commission, based on the two repeals, concludes that there was culpable negligence or a wilful\u000amisconduct on the part of the Curator of Title Deeds.\u000a154. The Commission believes that the Title Deed issued on the basis of repealed texts, therefore\u000anon-existent, is itself non-existent, and without any effect.\u000a155. The Commission recalls the principle enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter, according to which States\u000aParties not only recognize the rights, obligations and freedoms proclaimed in the Charter, but also\u000aundertake to respect them and to take steps for their implementation. In other words, if a State Party cannot\u000aensure respect of the rights contained in the African Charter, this constitutes a violation of the Charter25 .\u000a156. The Commission, in Communication 155/96 on the Ogoni case, adopted an integral approach,\u000anotably pertaining to the correlative obligations of the State. The Commission has insisted on the\u000aresponsibility of States to protect their citizens "not only by enacting appropriate legislation and by applying\u000athem effectively, but also by protecting the said citizens from prejudicial activities which may be perpetrated\u000aby private parties."26\u000a157. The Commission points out that from its jurisprudence: All rights, civil, political, social and economic,\u000acreate at least four levels of obligations for a State which undertakes to adopt a system of rights, in\u000aparticular the responsibility of respecting, protecting, promoting and fulfilling these rights. These obligations\u000aare universally applied to all the rights and impose a combination of negative and positive responsibilities.\u000a27\u000a\u000a158. The Commission further considers that it is the duty of States to investigate and remedy violations\u000aunder the general obligations incumbent on them pursuant to Article 1 of the African Charter on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights which provides that States must adopt legislative or other measures to implement the\u000arights, duties and freedoms enshrined in the Charter. "They need to prevent acts that violate any right\u000arecognized by international human rights law, investigate such acts or punish the perpetrators". 28\u000a159. The Commission further believes that it is the obligation of the Respondent State to respect the right to\u000aproperty. For the African Commission, the right to property set out in Article 14 of the Charter relating to\u000aland and housing, implies in particular, the protection from arbitrary deprivation of the enjoyment of property\u000arights, adequate compensation for public acquisition, nationalization or expropriation, peaceful enjoyment of\u000aproperty and protection from arbitrary eviction 29 .\u000a160. This obligation prohibits States from interfering arbitrarily in the enjoyment of property rights.\u000aExpropriation without legal grounds or which is not performed in the public interest is an example of breach\u000aof the obligation to respect the right to property.\u000a12\u000a\u000a161. It is also noteworthy that the Commission has an independent and broad conception of the right to\u000aproperty, particularly in Communication no 276/03, Centre for Minority Rights Development (Kenya) and\u000aMinority Rights Group (on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council) vs. Kenya - the Ogoni case, where it held\u000athat "the right to property includes not only the right of access to one's property and freedom from violation\u000aof the enjoyment of such property or injury to it, but also the free possession and utilization and control of\u000asuch property, in a manner the owner deems adequate" 30 .\u000a162. The Commission feels that the State is obliged to protect the holders of rights against other subjects,\u000aby legislation and the provision of effective remedies. This obligation requires the State to take measures to\u000aprotect beneficiaries of the protected rights against political, economic and social interference. Protection\u000agenerally entails the creation and maintenance of an atmosphere or a framework through an effective\u000ainterplay of laws and regulations, so that individuals can freely exercise their rights and freedoms. This is\u000ainextricably linked to one of the obligations of the State which consists in promoting the enjoyment of all\u000ahuman rights 31 .\u000a163. The Commission further believes that by adopting laws on abandoned properties, the State should\u000ahave taken all the necessary measures to ensure that there would be no misapplications whatsoever of\u000athese laws to the extent of arbitrarily and unjustly depriving an individual for the benefit of another.\u000a164. On the argument advanced by the Respondent State that Mr Noca's successor cannot lay claim to a\u000aproperty which no longer belonged to his father, the Complainant in his reply points out that the purpose of\u000aall legal actions, in which the late NOCA was involved or initiated, were to defend his interests and that of\u000ahis successors, and that at no time of the procedure did the Congolese State raise such an exception,\u000awhich in principle cannot be done at this stage.\u000a165. The Commission should seek to know, considering the argument advanced by the Respondent State,\u000awhether or not the Complainant is the holder of the disputed property in order to claim ownership thereof.\u000a166. The Commission notes that, based on the provisions of Section 235 of the said Congolese Land Law\u000awhich provides that: "Except in cases where the transfer is ordered by the courts or in cases based on\u000aspecific legislation no transfer may be made until after delivery to the Curator of the certificate in\u000areplacement. In all cases of transfer, the old certificate entered in the registration book shall be marked with\u000aa cancellation stamp and a notation indicating, in the form established by Article 226, the reasons for the\u000acancellation and the date and number of the new certificate", only the holder of a registration certificate duly\u000aestablished can lay claim to property in the form of a building and the property is expected to belong to him\u000afor as long as possible that the transfer would not have occurred.\u000a167. Except for the presentation of a certificate which would have been drafted by the NOCA succession,\u000athe Respondent State, has not proved the existence of the sales contract or proved that the transfer of\u000aownership had indeed taken place.\u000a168. The Commission further reminds the Congolese State that at no time during the proceedings was Dino\u000aNoca's lack of interest raised. Neither the lower courts nor those of appeal had ever rejected the late NOCA\u000aor the State of DRC for lack of interest.\u000a169. The Commission takes note that Mr. Noca has brought several actions in real estate to claim his right\u000ato property without winning his case.\u000a170. The Commission, based on the property management agreement concluded in due and proper form\u000abetween Mr. Lucio Noca, owner of the building, and SONAS, before Mr. Lucio Noca left the DRC to prevent\u000ait from being considered abandoned property, including all steps taken by him before he died and by his\u000ason after the death of the owner for the return of the property in the Noca heritage, are a proof of the\u000ainterest that Mr. NOCA had in the building.\u000a171. Furthermore, as far as the Commission is concerned, to admit that a person, in this case the son of\u000athe deceased, would recognize the sale of his father's plot of land to a third party and still continue to bear\u000athe expenses and transportation costs of his counsel to pursue the case, in the absence of any grounds in\u000athis particular case, is an inconceivable fact.\u000a172. The Commission further notes that there was no reaction from the alleged purchaser, and that the\u000aargument of the Respondent State that the building had long ceased to be part of the estate of Mr. Noca,\u000awho may have sold it to Mr. KASILEMBO, who himself withdrew from the case, is not admissible given that\u000athe administration had at the same time recognized the property right of Mr. Noca to the disputed property.\u000a173. The Commission ultimately concludes that given the proven misconduct of the administration,\u000aresulting in particular from an irregularity committed in the procedure for granting the title deed that was still\u000ain the inheritance of Mr. Dino Noca, the Respondent State has indisputably violated Article 14 of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a13\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Articles 3 and 7.1c\u000a174. The Complainant alleged that the decision taken by the Supreme Court in Judgment RC029/TSR\u000aprohibiting the NOCA party from presenting its defence and the decision by the latter Court rejecting the\u000aresumption of proceedings by the Noca succession and the third-party opposition violated the principle of\u000aArticles 3 and 7.1c of the Charter.\u000a175. Article 3 stipulates that: "Every individual shall be equal before the law. Every individual shall be\u000aentitled to equal protection of the law".\u000a176. Article 7.1c for its part provides that "Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard.\u000aThis right includes the right to defence and the right to be defended by counsel of one's choice".\u000a177. The Complainant alleges that the disputed decision was motivated in these terms: "regarding the\u000athird-party opposition and the pursuance of the suit, the Court rules that the Judgement RC029/TSR having\u000abeen declared inadmissible, the joint appeal of 3rd May 1995 as emanating from Mr. NOCA Lucio who\u000apassed away on the 27th May 1992, the issue is definitively settled since the Judgement RAC/001 of 29\u000aDecember 1994 of the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court which had acquired competence of the case had\u000airrevocably judged against the NOCA Lucio successors. Consequently, the pursuance of the suit should not\u000ahave been prescribed".32\u000a178. In this communication, the victim complained of not having had the opportunity to present his defence.\u000aAfter the death of Mr. Lucio NOCA, biological father of Dino NOCA, the Supreme Court found it necessary\u000ato call the Noca succession to the trial to allow him to present his defence so that his rights in the disputed\u000aproperty are protected in the same way as those claimed by Mr. Kafwa on the same property.\u000a179. The Complainant emphasizes that by Judgment No. RCR/C 019 of 14 July 2000, the Supreme Court\u000asummoned the entitled beneficiaries of the late NOCA to continue the proceedings.\u000a180. Moreover, the Complainant adds that the pursuance of this lawsuit was decided on the following\u000agrounds: "since Mr. NOCA's successors in title were not informed of the current proceedings, they cannot\u000abe presumed to have withdrawn from pursuing the lawsuit".\u000a181. The Complainant argues that despite his determination to pursue the proceedings, the Supreme Court\u000adid not give him that opportunity because it reversed its decision on the continuation of the lawsuit, by\u000anullifying it for the reason that the issue is definitively settled since the Judgement RAC/001 of 29\u000aDecember 1994 of the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court which had acquired competence of the case had\u000airrevocably judged against the NOCA Lucio successors.\u000a182. The Complainant alleges that the right to equality before the courts guaranteed by the Charter was\u000aviolated by the Supreme Court, given that only the arguments of Mr Kafwa, the other party, were\u000aconsidered as opposed to those of Mr Noca who was refused from pursuing the case.\u000a183. The Respondent State states for its part that the approach of the Supreme Court whose reasoning is\u000aimpeccable in law can in no way be regarded as a violation of Article 7 of the Charter.\u000a184. For the Respondent State, the referral of the case to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court for the\u000adetermination of the merits was only the consequence of the second appeal, which having been deemed to\u000ahave grounds by the Supreme Court, had recognized a second referral; and it was only natural for it to be\u000ainvalidated in respect of Mr. NOCA Lucio, since it became clear before the Judicial Division of the Supreme\u000aCourt that the second appeal which necessitated the second referral was fraudulent given that it was filed\u000aon 3rd May,1995 on behalf of Mr. NOCA Lucio who passed away on 27 May 1992.\u000a185. The Commission recalls that though the complainants decided to pursue the lawsuit, they only used\u000athe opportunity offered them by the Congolese State which had observed many irregularities in the\u000aadministration of justice in the Noca case.\u000a186. The right to a fair hearing is based on key elements including in particular the principle of equality of\u000aarms for the parties to the case, whether administrative, civil, criminal or military33 , the opportunity to\u000aproperly prepare the defence, to present arguments and evidence and to respond to the arguments and\u000aevidence of the prosecution or the defendant 34 .\u000a187. Pursuant to Article 7.1.c of the Charter, anyone who feels that his rights have been violated has the\u000aright to bring his case before the relevant national courts. Thus, the position or status of the victim or those\u000aof the alleged perpetrator do not matter. This means that any person, whose rights have been violated,\u000aincluding by persons acting in their official capacity, should be entitled to an effective remedy before a\u000acompetent and impartial judicial body and enjoy the right to have his case heard without any discrimination.\u000a188. The States Parties to the African Charter thus have a duty to ensure that the judicial organs are\u000aaccessible to all and that all parties have the opportunity to present their defence in a fair manner.\u000a14\u000a\u000a189. The Commission notes that the title deed is an administrative act likely to be brought before the Judge\u000aand can constitute the object of an appeal against abuse of power if it has been fraudulently established\u000aother than as a result of a flaw which happened during the registration procedure.\u000a190. The right to be heard requires that the Complainant has unfettered access to a court having\u000ajurisdiction to hear his case. It also requires that the matter be brought before a court having jurisdiction to\u000ahear the case. A competent court to hear a case in law is so empowered by the law.\u000a191. The Commission provided clarification on Article 7 in the Kenneth Good vs. Republic of Botswana\u000acase, in which it asserted that the right to be heard requires that the Complainant should enjoy unrestricted\u000aaccess to a court of competent jurisdiction to have his case heard 35 .\u000a192. The Commission believes that when the authorities put impediments in the way to prevent victims\u000afrom having access to competent courts, they deprive victims of their right to have their case heard.\u000a193. In the case of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum vs. Zimbabwe 36 , the Commission noted that\u000athe protection afforded by Article 7 is not limited to the protection of the rights of persons arrested and\u000adetained but it includes the right of everyone to have access to relevant judicial bodies with jurisdiction to\u000ahear their case and grant them adequate compensation.\u000a194. The Commission regrets that after having taken the right decision to reopen the proceedings, the\u000aSupreme Court reversed its decision by prohibiting the NOCA party from presenting its defence and\u000arejecting the resumption of proceedings by the Noca succession decided by itself and the third-party\u000aopposition.\u000a195. The Commission believes that though the Respondent State noted that the second appeal which\u000aprompted the second referral was fraudulent, the Supreme Court should not have rejected the pursuance of\u000athe lawsuit, the only remedy available to the victim to claim his building.\u000a196. The Commission also believes that in such circumstances, if the Court thought it had erred in allowing\u000athe NOCA party to pursue the lawsuit whereas there was an existing ruling that had acquired the force of a\u000ajudgement delivered, and also that the second appeal was granted on the basis of a fraudulent act, it was\u000aobliged to re-open the proceedings in order to notify the Noca party about the facts.\u000a197. The Commission believes that the final judgment which rejected an obligation to reopen the\u000aproceedings to hear the position of Dino Noca therefore deprived him of the right to have his case heard.\u000a198. The Commission moreover believes that the Supreme Court did not offer the basic procedural\u000asafeguards. Its decision cannot have legitimacy when both sides have not been heard with due respect for\u000athe principle of equality of arms, which would have allowed the parties to discuss the issue of continuing\u000awith the proceedings.\u000a199. In such circumstances, the Commission can only endorse the claims of the Complainant according to\u000awhich the decision of the Supreme Court to exclude the NOCA party from the proceedings without giving\u000ahim the opportunity to present his defence and without examining the consequences of such action on his\u000arequest does not comply with the requirements of the African Charter and the general principles of law.\u000a200. The Commission considers that the argument advanced by the Respondent State to justify the\u000aposition taken by its own courts is inconsistent with the obligations of the Respondent State to comply with\u000aArticle 7 of the Charter.\u000a201. The Complainant also alleges a violation of Article 3 of the Charter which deals with the right to equal\u000aprotection of the law and equality before the law. For the parties to a case, these rights entail access to\u000aequal opportunity in the preparation and presentation of their arguments. In other words, they must be able\u000ato defend their case before the court on an equal footing.\u000a202. In the Communication Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights and Institute for Human Rights and\u000aDevelopment in Africa vs. Republic of Zimbabwe 37 ,the African Commission relied on the decision of the\u000aSupreme Court in the case Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka38 , in which Chief Justice Earl Warren\u000aof the United States of America argued that "equal protection by law refers to the right of everyone to have\u000aequal access to courts of justice and to be treated the same way by the courts, both for procedures and for\u000athe essence of the law. It is akin to the right to due process of law, but applies in particular to equal\u000atreatment as an element of fundamental equity".\u000a203. The Commission considers that this attitude of the Supreme Court is in contradiction with the\u000aprinciples of the right to equality before the law and the right to defence and thus infringes Articles 3 and\u000a7. 1.c of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights in the sense that firstly the succession of Noca\u000aLucio represented by its legal liquidator Mr. Dino Noca could not present its defence and secondly the\u000aprinciple of equality of litigants was not respected since only the defence of the opposing party, in this case\u000aMr Kafwa, was taken into account.\u000a15\u000a\u000a204. In its analysis of the situation in the light of the arguments presented by the parties, the Commission\u000aconsiders that Articles 3, 7. 1.c and 14 of the African Charter have been violated.\u000a205. The Complainant finally prays the Commission to prescribe to the Respondent State to grant him, as\u000acompensation for damages suffered, the minimum sum of USD 400 000, including fees paid to lawyers.\u000a206. The Commission, while acknowledging that the Complainant has certainly suffered damages relating\u000ato his right of ownership of the disputed building for several years (28 years), however notes that it is not in\u000apossession of sufficient facts to quantify the damages suffered.\u000a207. Therefore, in the name of fairness and in light of its jurisprudence39 , the Commission recommends\u000athat the amount of compensation should be determined by the laws of the Democratic Republic of the\u000aCongo.\u000a\u000aDecision of the Commission\u000aThe Commission:\u000a\u2022 Notes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has violated the provisions of Articles 3, 7. 1.c\u000aand 14;\u000a\u2022 Declares that the transfer of the Noca family building to a third party by the State on the basis of\u000arepealed texts is in violation of Article 14 of the African Charter;\u000a\u2022 Thus declares that Judgment RCR/C019 of 28 November 2003 is in violation of Articles 3 and 7.\u000a1.c of the African Charter;\u000a\u2022 Enjoins the DRC to restore the right to property of the beneficiaries of the late Mr Noca by\u000areinstating their title deed of the disputed building, or failing that, pay them expeditious, just and fair\u000acompensation;\u000a\u2022 Finds that the DRC should compensate without delay for the damages suffered by the Dino Noca\u000afamily in accordance with the DRC laws in force;\u000a\u2022 Declares that the Respondent State should present within a period of 180 days, with effect from the\u000anotification of this decision, a detailed report on the measures taken to implement this decision.\u000a\u000aDone in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, at the 52nd Ordinary Session of the African Commission on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights held from 9 to 22 October 2012.\u000a\u000a16\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 The DRC ratified the African Charter on 20 July, 1987\u000a2 Supporting evidence No. 1\u000a3 Supporting evidence No. 17-18\u000a4 Supporting evidence No. 19\u000a5 Indeed, Article 119 (4) of the old Rules of Procedure stipulates that "States parties from whom\u000aexplanations or statements are sought within specified times shall be informed that if they fail to comply\u000awithin those times the Commission will act on the evidence before it."\u000a6 Using as sole basis the arguments of the Complainants in the absence of arguments from the\u000aRespondent State, the African Commission proceeded to consider communications 155/96 Social and\u000aEconomic Rights Action Center, Center for Economic and Social Rights vs Nigeria and 159/96 Inter African\u000aHuman Rights Union, International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, African Human Rights\u000aEncounter, National Human Rights Organization in Senegal and the Malian Human Rights Association vs\u000aAngola (11th Annual Activity Report).\u000a7 Article 37 paragraph 1 of the Transitional Constitution of 4 April 2003.

aV290/04 Open Society Justice Initiative (on behalf of\u000aPius Njaw? Noumeni) / Cameroon\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The complaint is lodged by the NGO, Open Society Justice Initiative, on behalf of a Cameroonian citizen,\u000aPius Njaw? Noumeni, against the Government of Cameroon, a state Party to the African Charter.\u000a2. The communication was submitted in accordance with Article 55 of the African Charter and the\u000aComplainant alleges that in November 1999 the Messager Group based in Douala, Cameroon, and headed\u000aby Mr Pius Njaw? began operating a radio station in Douala whilst an illegal decision banning the operation\u000aof private radio stations was in place.\u000a3. The Complainant maintains that following the formal liberalisation of air waves in April 2000, the\u000aMessager Group submitted an application with the Ministry of Communications of Cameroon for a license\u000ato operate a radio station. After the six (6) months period required under the law, the Ministry of\u000aCommunication did not respond favorably to the request arguing that the application was still being\u000aconsidered.\u000a4. The Complainant, moreover maintains that the Ministry of Communications of Cameroon was in the habit\u000aof processing applications for operational licenses in an arbitrary, illegal and discriminatory manner and had\u000aon many occasions refused to grant statutory license to operators of radio stations, and on the contrary\u000aresorting to the practice of informally issuing temporary authorization to operate on some frequencies,\u000awhich did not provide any legal cover to the operators of radio stations but only placed them in a situation of\u000auncertainty since the informal authorisation could at any given time be withdrawn. In addition, the\u000acomplainant maintains that by refusing to process applications for operating licenses or providing reasons\u000afor refusal to grant licenses, the Ministry of Communications tends to ban, in an arbitrary, discriminatory\u000aand politically motivated manner existing operators from continuing to operate.\u000a5. Taking into consideration that the Ministry of Communications did not respond within the legally\u000aprescribed period to the Messager Group's request and in view of the practice of arbitrarily refusing to grant\u000aoperating licenses for stations, the complainant further maintains that the Messager [Group] announced in\u000amid May 2003 that it will begin broadcasting programs on Radio Freedom FM on 24th May 2003. But on\u000a23[[sup]]rd May 2003, even before Freedom FM began broadcasting, the Ministry of Communications took\u000athe decision to ban the broadcasting of the said programs and the police and the army sealed the premises\u000aof the radio station.\u000a6. In September 2003, the Messager took the matter to court requesting for a break of the seals. After five\u000a(5) months of consecutive adjournments, the Court of First Instance of Douala decided that the matter\u000acame under the competence of the Administrative Court and took 3 months to deliver a written judgment\u000awhich should have enabled the Messager [Group] to appeal. Whilst the Court of Appeal should be\u000aconsidering this appeal, equipments worth $110,000 continue to daily depreciate because of inadequate\u000astorage conditions.\u000a7. As the procedure in the civil court followed its course, the Ministry of Communications took Mr Pius\u000aNjaw? and the Messager Group to court for having 'set up and operated' without a license a radio\u000abroadcasting company.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a8. The Complainant maintains that the facts stated above constitute a violation by Cameroon of Articles 1,\u000a2, 9, 14 of the African Charter and consequently request the African Commission to consider as such and\u000arequest Cameroon to pay adequate compensation to the victims for multiple violations of their rights and\u000afreedoms.\u000a9. The Complainant moreover, requests the African Commission, in accordance with Article 111 of its Rules\u000aof Procedure to request Cameroon to adopt provisional measures with a view to:\u000a1. immediately lifting the ban affecting the programs of Freedom FM and authorise it to operate whilst\u000aawaiting the outcome of the African Commission's decision on the complaint;\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000a2. break the seal on the premises of Freedom FM so that the equipments could undergo proper\u000amaintenance whilst awaiting the African Commission's decision on the complaint;\u000a3. undertake a quick review of the legislative framework and administrative practices on issuing\u000alicenses for operating radio stations with a view to harmonizing them with the provisions of Article 9\u000aof the African Charter and the 2002 Declaration of Principles.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a10. The complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 28th June 2004.\u000a11. By a letter ref. ACHPR/COMM 290/2004/RK addressed to the complainant, the Secretariat of the\u000aAfrican Commission acknowledged receipt of this communication on 5th July 2004 and indicated that the\u000aseizure of the complaint will be considered by the African Commission at its 36th Ordinary Session (23rd\u000aNovember to 7th December 2004, Dakar, Senegal).\u000a12. By a letter ref. ACHPR/GOV/COMM/3/RK of 15th July 2004, the Chairperson of the African Commission\u000asent an urgent request for the adoption of provisional measures in accordance with the provisions of Article\u000a111 of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure, to H.E Mr Paul Biya, President of the Republic of\u000aCameroon requesting that provisional measures be taken to ensure that no irreparable damage is done to\u000athe equipment of Radio Freedom FM.\u000a13. By a letter of 16th November 2004, the Complainant informed the Chairperson of the African\u000aCommission, Commissioner Sawadogo, that the request for provisional measures had not been complied\u000awith and that further the Complainant had received death threats over the matter.\u000a14. During the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal, from 23rd November to 7th December 2004,\u000athe African Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it. The Complainants\u000amade oral submissions on the failure of the State to comply with the request for provisional measure. The\u000aState delegates indicated that they ha[d] not been made aware of the request and the head of delegation,\u000aMinister Joseph Dion Ngute offered his good offices with a view to facilitating an amicable solution of the\u000amatter.\u000a15. On 22nd December 2004, the Secretariat informed the parties that the African Commission had been\u000aseized of the communication and requested them to submit arguments on admissibility in three months\u000afrom the date of notification.\u000a16. On 22nd February 2005, the Secretariat reminded the State through a Note Verbale to submit its\u000aarguments on admissibility within one month from the date of the reminder.\u000a17. On 22nd March 2005, the Complainant submitted further arguments on admissibility, which were\u000atransmitted to the Respondent State on 29th March 2005 through the Embassy of the Respondent State.\u000a18. At its 37th Ordinary Session, which was held from 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia,\u000athe African Commission considered the case and heard oral submissions from the parties. The African\u000aCommission subsequently deferred its decision on admissibility of the case pending receipt of arguments of\u000athe Respondent State on the same.\u000a19. On 8th December 2005, the Respondent State sent to the Secretariat a letter informing it that amicable\u000asettlement was underway in the matter.\u000a20. On 4th October 2005, the Secretariat informed the Complainant of the above letter and forwarded the\u000aattached documentation and requested them to send in their comments on the same.\u000a21. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from the 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia,\u000athe African Commission deferred its decision on the matter awaiting for comments of the Complainant on\u000athe outcome of the said amicable settlement.\u000a22. On 28th April 2006, the Secretariat received a note from the Complainant informing it that:\u000a1. the Government of Cameroon [had] dropped the criminal charges against the Freedom FM director\u000aand released the equipment of the Radio;\u000a2. the Government committed itself to grant Radio Freedom FM a provisional authorization to\u000abroadcast, and process its application for a full license in a fair and equitable manner;\u000a3. Freedom FM, for its part, agreed to discontinue the communication before the Commission, and\u000asettle the case;\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a4. the ongoing negotiations between the parties on the compensation issue have now produced a\u000amutually acceptable compromise, with the Government of Cameroon agreeing to re-open the\u000adiscussions with Radio Freedom FM in relation to the compensation of the damages suffered by the\u000aradio, with a view to reaching a fair, comprehensive and final settlement of the case; and\u000a5. the Government has reiterated its commitment to grant Freedom FM a provisional authorization as\u000asoon as consideration of the current communication is discontinued - as well as process the Radio's\u000aapplication for a broadcasting license in a fair, transparent, and expeditious manner.\u000a23. In consideration of the above, the Open Society Justice Initiative, acting on behalf of Mr Pius Njaw? and\u000aGroup Le Messager, requested the African Commission to discontinue the consideration of communication\u000a290/04 against the Republic of Cameroon and the amicable settlement be registered in its lieu.\u000a24. At its 39th Ordinary session held from 11th to 25th May 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to close the file.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aThe African Commission takes note of the above request and decides to close the file.\u000a\u000aThe African Commission also requests the parties to forward to the Secretariat the written copy of the said\u000aamicable settlement for inclusion in the file.\u000a\u000aDone at the 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 11th to 25th May 2006.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a

aV299/05 Anuak Justice Council / Ethiopia\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The communication is submitted by the Anuak Justice Council, through Obang Metho the Director for\u000aInternational Advocacy, Anuak Justice Council which was prepared by the International Human Rights\u000aClinic, Washington College of Law, in Washington D.C., the United States of America against the Federal\u000aDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Respondent State, a party to the African Charter since 1998.\u000a2. The Complainant avers that the Respondent through its agents, the Ethiopian Defence Forces has been\u000aengaged in massive discrimination resulting in serious human rights abuses and violations of the people of\u000aAnuak ethnicity. They claim that the abuses by the Ethiopian Defence Forces include the massacre of over\u000afour hundred and twenty-four (424) civilians, the wounding of over two hundred (200) civilians and the\u000adisappearance of over eighty-five (85) civilians in the Gambella region in the three day period of 13th to 15th\u000aDecember 2003. The Complainant states that the abuses have continued against the Anuak since that\u000aperiod including extrajudicial killing, torture, detention, rape and property destruction throughout the\u000aGambella region resulting in one thousand (1000) Anuak deaths and that, over fifty-one thousand (51,000)\u000aAnuak have been displaced within the Gambella region.\u000a3. The Complainant adds, that the Republic of Ethiopia has violated its legal obligations to uphold the rights\u000aand principles of all Ethiopian citizens, and has violated its obligation to uphold the rights and protections\u000aenshrined in the African Charter under Articles 4, 5, 6, 12, 14 and 18.\u000a4. The Anuak Justice Council requests the African Commission to grant provisional measures Rule 11 and\u000adeclare them binding on the Ethiopian government.\u000a5. The Complainant states that the Anuak are an indigenous minority group living in south-western\u000aGambella region of Ethiopia and that despite their dominance in the region, the Ethiopian government has\u000aa long history of marginalising, excluding and discriminating against them. The Complainant claims that due\u000ato Gambella's natural resources, the Ethiopian government has resettled over sixty thousand (60,000)\u000ahighlanders, who had almost completely destroyed the Anuak way of life within Gambella.\u000a6. The Complainant avers that the Anuak believe that oil in the region should belong to them, while the\u000aFederal Government argues that under the Federal Constitution all mineral resources belong to the\u000aEthiopian State. The complainant adds that the Ethiopian Defence Forces are stationed throughout the\u000aGambella in order to identify and destroy disparate groups of armed Anuak known collectively as shifta that\u000ahave attacked highlander civilians.\u000a7. The Complainant submits that the December 2003 massacre was sparked by the killing of eight (8)\u000ahighlander refugee camp officials and propelled the Ethiopian Defence Forces into a broad-based assault\u000aon Gambella's Anuak community. The Complainant states that despite the fact that nobody was\u000aimmediately found responsible for the death of the eight people, there is no indication that the Ethiopian\u000agovernment had undertaken an official investigation into the ambush of the refugee camp officials thus\u000ablaming the Anuak community for the attacks.\u000a8. The Complainant avers that the violence in the Gambella region has continued since December 2003\u000aand remains a serious threat to Anuak citizens as well as other ethnic groups in the region. The\u000aComplainant allege that the Ethiopian Defence Forces search for shifta has become the pretext for bloody\u000aand destructive raids on numerous Anuak villages since the December 2003 massacre on the Gambella\u000atown. The Complainant further allege[s] that unarmed Anuak within Gambella are currently being killed by\u000aEthiopian Defence Forces without due process or the use of judicial proceedings without even making an\u000aeffort to distinguish Anuak civilians from the shifta they claim to be looking for.\u000a9. The Complainant further allege[s] that many Anuak have been detained in prison without charge both in\u000aGambella and Addis Ababa which accounts to about one thousand (1000) detained to this day. The\u000aComplainant also adds that a substantial group of Gambella's educated Anuak have been imprisoned or\u000aforced into exile and that many have been charged with offences relating to alleged collaboration with\u000aAnuak insurgents and put on trial but none of the leaders are yet to be convicted.\u000a10. The Complainant further alleged that in rural areas the Ethiopian military continues to burn homes,\u000adestroy crops, burn food stores, disrupt planting cycles, and destroy agricultural equipment of the Anuak to\u000aprevent them from sustaining themselves. The Complainant asserts that as recently as January 2005 the\u000aEthiopian government threatened Anuak elders in Gambella that anyone attempting to tarnish the\u000areputation of the Ethiopian government over the massacres would be dealt with.\u000a1\u000a\u000a11. The Complainant claims that the Ethiopian government's response to the December massacre has\u000abeen grossly inadequate and disingenuous. The Complainant states that the government's initial position\u000athat no soldiers had taken part in the massacre had become impossible to defend and adds that the\u000aCommission of Inquiry set up by the Government was biased and ineffectual and did not investigate the\u000abehaviour of the Ethiopian Defence Forces as an organisation despite numerous reports.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a12. The Complainant states that crimes against humanity, such as extrajudicial killing, torture, and rape,\u000acrimes that take place against the Anuak civilians is in violation of international law as well as a violation of\u000aArticles 4, 5, 6, 12,14 and 18 of the African Charter. The Anuak Justice Council urges the African\u000aCommission to intervene to prevent further human rights abuses of the Anuak by the Ethiopian\u000agovernment.\u000a13. The Comp[lainant] further makes an urgent request for provisional measures under Rule 111 of the\u000aRules of Procedure of the African Charter [sic] that the African Commission may intervene to "avoid\u000airreparable damage being caused to the victim of the alleged violation".\u000aRequest for provisional measures - summary\u000a\u000a14. The Complainant, requests for provisional measures to the African Commission pursuant to Rule 111 of\u000athe Rules of Procedures of the Commission. The complaint relates to the alleged actions of the Defence\u000aForces of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. These actions according to the Complainant reveal\u000aa pattern of serious and massive human and peoples' rights violations by the Ethiopian Defence Forces.\u000aThat, bound by the African Charter, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, has and continues to\u000aviolate Articles 4, 5, 6, 12, 14 and 18 of the African Charter.\u000a15. The Anuak Justice Council therefore seeks the [African] Commission's intervention and issuance of\u000aProvisional Measures requesting that the Ethiopian government stops the human rights abuses of the\u000aAnuak pending a decision of the African Commission on the concurrent communication and is also seeking\u000aan in-depth study of the treatment of the Anuak by the African Commission pursuant to Article 58 of the\u000aCharter.\u000a16. The Anuak Justice Council notes that it does not request the [African] Commission to evaluate the\u000amerits of this case rather, in this provisional measures submission, the Anuak Justice Council merely asks\u000athat the [African] Commission request that the Ethiopian government immediately stops the series of\u000aserious and massive violations of human and peoples' rights of the Anuak people prior to the issuance of a\u000adecision by the African Commission on the merits.\u000a17. That the [African] Commission has jurisdiction to issue provisional measures under Rule 111 of the\u000aRules of Procedure of the African Charter [sic], see Registered Trustees of the Constitutional Rights Project\u000av. the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Five Others[sic]. Similar to the Nigeria case, many\u000aAnuak have also been, and continue to be, sentenced to death. The [African] Commission should therefore\u000afind the Anuak situation as even more sever[e] and compelling than the Nigeria case and grant provisional\u000ameasures.\u000a18. The Complainant notes further that while the African Commission has not decided whether grants of\u000aprovisional measures should be binding on State Parties, other international and regional human rights\u000abodies have declared that provisional measures be binding on States including the European Court of\u000aHuman Rights, Inter-American Commission, the International Court of Justice and the UN Human Rights\u000aCommittee. Due to the severity of the situation that the Anuak find themselves subject to in the Gambella,\u000ain prisons throughout Ethiopia and as refugees in Sudan and Kenya, petitioners plead that the African\u000aCommission grant provisional measures and declare them binding on the Ethiopian government.\u000a19. The Complainant seeks the [African] Commission's intervention and issuance of provisional measures\u000arequesting that the Ethiopian government stop human rights abuses of the Anuak, pending the decision of\u000athis Commission on the Anuak Justice Council's concurrent communication to the African Commission on\u000athe merits of this claim and further urges the Commission to find that its order of provisional measures in\u000athis case be binding upon the Ethiopian government.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a20. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 4th April 2005.\u000a21. By letter of 20th April 2005 the Secretariat acknowledged receipt thereof informing the Complainant that\u000athe communication has been registered as communication 299/05 - Anuak Justice Council/Ethiopia and\u000athat the communication will be considered on seizure at the 37th Ordinary Session of the African\u000aCommission.\u000a22. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 27th April to 11th May 2005, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a23. By Note Verbale of 24th May 2005 the Secretariat of the African Commission notified the State of the\u000aAfrican Commission's decision and forwarded the complaint to the State with a request for the latter to\u000amake its submission on the merits within three months of the notification. By letter of 24th May 2005, the\u000aSecretariat of the African Commission informed the Complainant of the African Commission's decision.\u000a24. On 23rd August 2005, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility.\u000a25. On 25th August 2005, the Secretariat transmitted the Respondent State's submission on admissibility to\u000athe Complainant, requesting the latter to respond thereto before 25th September.\u000a26. On 21 [sic] complainant wrote to the Secretariat informing the latter that the legal representative of the\u000aAnuak Justice Council had changed adding that they received the Secretariat's letter of 25th August only on\u000a9th September and would like the deadline for the submission of their arguments on admissibility to be\u000amoved to 9th October 2005. The Complainant also requested for provisional measures to be taken by the\u000aAfrican Commission.\u000a27. On 10th October 2005, the Secretariat received the Complainant's response on the Respondent State's\u000asubmissions on admissibility.\u000a28. On 19th October 2005, the Secretariat transmitted the Complainant's response to the Respondent State\u000awith a request to the latter to make its comments, if any, before 31st October 2005.\u000a29. At its 38th Ordinary Session, the African Commission deferred consideration on the admissibility of the\u000acommunication and to enable the Secretariat get additional information from the parties.\u000a30. By Note Verbale of 19th January 2006 and by letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission notified the parties of the African Commission's decision.\u000a31. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 11th to 25th May 2006, the African\u000aCommission considered the communication and decided to declare it inadmissible.\u000a32. By Note Verbale of 29th May 2006 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\u000aAfrican Commission's decision.\u000aComplainant's submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a33. The Complainant submits that Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that complainants exhaust\u000adomestic remedies before a case is considered by the African Commission. The Complainant notes further\u000athat if the potential domestic remedies are unavailable or unduly prolonged, the Commission may\u000anevertheless consider a communication, adding that this is especially true when the country against which\u000athe complaint is lodged has committed vast and varied scope of violations and the general situation in the\u000acountry is such that domestic exhaustion would be futile.\u000a34. The Complainant argue that in the Anuak Justice Council case, pursuing domestic remedies would be\u000afutile due to the lack of an independent and impartial judiciary, a lack of an efficient remedy, the significant\u000alikelihood of an unduly prolonged domestic remedy, and most importantly, the potential for violence against\u000athe Anuak or those supporting them within the legal system.\u000a35. Anuak Justice Council alleges that it cannot seek exhaustion of domestic remedies because of its\u000ainability to receive an independent and fair hearing, as a direct consequence of the fact that the aggressor\u000ais the government of Ethiopia. The Complainant notes that in spite the protection in Article 78\u000a×\u000a1. An independent judiciary is established by this Constitution.\u000a2. Supreme Federal judicial authority is vested in the Federal Supreme Court. The House of Peoples'\u000aRepresentatives may, by two-thirds majority vote, establish nationwide, or in some parts of the country\u000aonly, the Federal High Court and First-Instance Courts it deems necessary. Unless decided in this manner,\u000a3\u000a\u000athe jurisdictions of the Federal High Court and of the First-Instance Courts are hereby delegated to the\u000aState courts.\u000a3. States shall establish State Supreme, High and First-Instance Courts. Particulars shall be determined by\u000alaw.\u000a4. Special or ad hoc courts which take judicial powers away form the regular courts or institutions legally\u000aempowered to exercise judicial functions and which do not follow legally prescribed procedures shall not be\u000aestablished.\u000a5. Pursuant to sub-Article 5 of Article 34 the House of Peoples' Representatives and State Councils can\u000aestablish or give official recognition to religious and customary courts. Religious and customary courts that\u000ahad state recognition and functioned prior to the adoption of the Constitution shall be organised on the\u000abasis of recognition accorded to them by this Constitution.\u000aof the Respondent State's Constitution guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, it is perceived by\u000aindividuals both at home and abroad that the executive has considerable and even undue influence on the\u000ajudiciary.\u000a36. The Complainant quoted a World Bank Report entitled Ethiopia: Legal and Judicial Sector Assessment\u000a(2004) which concluded that "... of the three branches of government, the judiciary has the least history and\u000aexperience of independence and therefore requires significant strengthening to obtain true independence".\u000aAccording to the Complainant, the Report notes that the interference in the judiciary is more flagrant at\u000aState level where there are reports of administrative officers interfering with court decisions, firing judges,\u000adictating decisions to judges, reducing salaries of judges and deliberately refusing to enforce certain\u000adecisions of the courts.\u000a37. The Complainant also alleges that bringing the case before Ethiopian courts would unduly prolong the\u000aprocess as the Ethiopian judiciary suffers from a complex system of multiple courts that lack coordination\u000aand resources, including "dismal conditions of service, staff shortages, lack of adequate training,\u000adebilitating infrastructure and logistical problems". The Complainant claims court proceedings take years to\u000ayield results, and concluded that the Respondent State's judicial system is so under resourced that\u000aprosecutions would be nearly impossible, noting that to date, no action had been taken to prosecute any of\u000athe Ethiopian Defence Forces or government officials for the atrocities they committed against the Anuak.\u000a38. The Complainant also alleges that the Anuak fear for their safety in bringing the case in Ethiopia adding\u000athat there are no Anuak trained as lawyers who could bring the case before Ethiopian courts. The\u000aComplainant notes that the overwhelming sentiment in the Gambella Region and of the Anuak who have\u000afled the country is that non-Anuak lawyers within Ethiopia would be unwilling to take the case due to the\u000apotential persecution they would face, as well as the insurmountable odds of achieving a just remedy. The\u000aComplainant added that Anuak who remain in the Gambella Region continue to suffer from extra-judicial\u000aexecutions, torture, rape and arbitrary detention from the authorities of the Respondent State adding that\u000aseveral of them have been threatened and warned specifically against pursuing a case against the\u000aRespondent State. The Complainant noted that as recently as January 2005, the Respondent State\u000athreatened Anuak leaders, declaring that anyone attempting to tarnish the reputation of the Respondent\u000aState would be dealt with. The Complainant concluded by stating that to bring the case within the\u000aRespondent State would only further endanger the lives of the remaining Anuak in the Ethiopia.\u000a39. The Complainant added that the Respondent State had been given notice and adequate time to\u000aremedy the human rights violations against the Anuak but has utterly failed to do so. That the Respondent\u000aState received notice of the violations but chose not to take action to halt the atrocities or to make its forces\u000aaccountable. The Complainant added that the Respondent State's response to the massacres in December\u000a2003 in the Gambella Region was inadequate and disingenuous. That under international pressure, the\u000aRespondent State established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the killings, however, according to the\u000aComplainant, the inquiry was biased and ineffectual and did not meet international standards of an\u000aindependent investigation.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000aRespondent State's submissions on admissibility\u000a\u000a40. The Respondent State claims that the cases of those involved in the alleged violations that took place\u000ain the Gambella Region are currently pending before the Federal Circuiting Court and the Respondent,\u000atherefore, argued that domestic remedies have not yet been exhausted. The State provided a list of about\u000anine such cases including their file numbers and previous and future dates of adjournments.\u000a41. The Respondent State argues that the rule that local remedies be exhausted is not limited to individuals\u000aand also applies to organisations, including those in no way subject to the jurisdiction of the Respondent\u000aState. According to the Respondent, the Complainant could have sought redress from the domestic courts,\u000athe Judicial Administration Office, the Commission of Inquiry or the Human Rights Commission but did not.\u000aThe Complainant has not, argued the State, shown the existence of any impediment to the use of these\u000aremedial processes or that such were unduly long.\u000a42. Without indicating the status of the proceedings, the State argued that all those alleged of human rights\u000aoffences associated with the Gambella incident of December 2003 were brought before the Federal Circuit\u000aCourt. The State indicated that three domestic remedies were available to the Complainants: the competent\u000acourts, the Judicial Administration Officer and the Human Rights Commission but the Complainants failed\u000ato approach any of them.\u000aProvisional measures\u000a43. The Republic of Ethiopia argues that the Complainant has sought only to present what it claims is prima\u000afacie evidence of violations and has not shown that if such alleged violations continue there will be\u000a'irreparable injury', as required. Finally, the Respondent submits that the Government has presented\u000asufficient evidence that it has taken adequate measures to rectify the situation and that the situation in\u000ageneral has stabilised and does not warrant any provisional measures from the African Commission. The\u000aRespondent State submits as follows:\u000a\u2022 In February 2004, the Office of the Prime Minister issued instructions to Federal institutions to assist\u000athe Regional Administration in safeguarding the security of the people and institutions and\u000apreventing further violence; soliciting the support of elders, the youth and civil servants in the effort\u000atowards sustainable peace, democracy and development; rehabilitating victims of the violence and\u000ainternally displaced people; and bringing to justice those responsible for committing the violence\u000aand the destruction of property.\u000a\u2022 The Defence Forces, once deployed, protected the civilian population and allowed humanitarian\u000aassistance and rehabilitation.\u000a\u2022 The Federal Government, in cooperation with international agencies, coordinated humanitarian\u000aassistance to alleviate the suffering of the victims of violence and the displaced.\u000a\u2022 A Commission of Inquiry has been established to investigate the circumstances surrounding the\u000acrisis; charges have been filed against several individuals as a result.\u000a\u2022 The Government has organised various consultations and workshops with the participation of the\u000alocal population which have proposed concrete solutions aimed at resolving the problems facing the\u000aregion and have identified the root causes of the crisis.\u000a\u2022 The Federal Police have recently graduated more than three hundred police officers from the\u000aGambella region to aid in maintaining law and order in the region once the situation has stabilised.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000a44. The current communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter which allows the\u000aAfrican Commission to receive and consider communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of\u000athe African Charter provides that the admissibility of a communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is\u000asubject to seven (7) conditions. The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in\u000aArticle 56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is absent, the communication will be declared\u000a5\u000a\u000ainadmissible.\u000a45. The Complainant in the present communication argued that it has satisfied the admissibility conditions\u000aset out in Article 56 of the African Charter and as such, the communication should be declared admissible.\u000aThe Respondent State on the other hand submitted that the communication should be declared\u000ainadmissible because, according to the State, the Complainant has not complied with Article 56(5) of the\u000aAfrican Charter. As there seems to be agreement by both parties as to the fulfillment of the other\u000arequirements under Article 56, this Commission will not make any pronouncements thereof.\u000a46. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that communications relating to human and peoples' rights\u000ashall be considered if they: "[a]re sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this\u000aprocedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a47. Human rights law regards it as supremely important for a person whose rights have been violated to\u000amake use of domestic remedies to right the wrong, rather than address the issue to an international\u000atribunal. The rule is founded on the premise that the full and effective implementation of international\u000aobligations in the field of human rights is designed to enhance the enjoyment of human rights and\u000afundamental freedoms at the national level. In Free Legal Assistance Group, Lawyers' Committee for\u000aHuman Rights, Union Interafricaine des Droits de l'Homme, Les Témoins de Jehovah / DRC, Paragraph 36\u000aand Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme (RADDHO) / Zambia, Paragraph 11, this\u000aCommission held that "a government should have notice of a human rights violation in order to have the\u000aopportunity to remedy such violations before being called before an international body." 1 Such an\u000aopportunity will enable the accused state to save its reputation, which would be inevitably tarnished if it\u000awere brought before an international jurisdiction.\u000a48. The rule also reinforces the subsidiary and complementary relationship of the international system to\u000asystems of internal protection. To the extent possible, an international tribunal, including this Commission,\u000ashould be prevented from playing the role of a court of first instance, a role that it cannot under any\u000acircumstances arrogate to itself. Access to an international organ should be available, but only as a last\u000aresort; after the domestic remedies have been exhausted and have failed. Moreover, local remedies are\u000anormally quicker, cheaper, and more effective than international ones. They can be more effective in the\u000asense that an appellate court can reverse the decision of a lower court, whereas the decision of an\u000ainternational organ does not have that effect, although it will engage the international responsibility of the\u000astate concerned.\u000a49. The African Charter states that this African Commission shall consider a communication after the\u000aapplicant has exhausted local remedies, "if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\u000aprolonged". The Charter thus recognises that, though the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is a\u000aconventional provision, it should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access to international\u000aremedies. This Commission has also held that Article 56(5) "must be applied concomitantly with Article 7,\u000awhich establishes and protects the right to fair trial". th 2 In interpreting the rule, the African Commission\u000aappears to take into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which\u000athe formal remedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant. Its interpretation of the local\u000aremedies criteri[ion] can therefore not be understood without some knowledge of that general context.\u000a50. A local remedy has been defined as "any domestic legal action that may lead to the resolution of the\u000acomplaint at the local or national level." 3 The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that\u000a"[t]he Commission shall determine questions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter" 4\u000aGenerally, the rules require applicants to set out in their applications the steps taken to exhaust domestic\u000aremedies. They must provide some prima facie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies.5\u000aAccording to the African Commission's guidelines on the submission of communications, applicants are\u000aexpected to indicate, for instance, the courts where they sought domestic remedies. Applicants must\u000aindicate that they have had recourse to all domestic remedies to no avail and must supply evidence to that\u000aeffect. If they were unable to use such remedies, they must explain why. They could do so by submitting\u000aevidence derived from analogous situations or testifying to a state policy of denying such recourse.\u000a51. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, three major criteria could be deduced in determining the rule\u000aon the exhaustion of local remedies, namely: that the remedy must be available, effective and sufficient. 6\u000aAccording to this Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner can pursue it without\u000aimpediments 7 or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.8 The word 'available' means\u000a'readily obtainable; accessible'; or 'attainable, reachable; on call, on hand, ready, present; . . . convenient,\u000aat one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck and call'.9 In other words, "remedies,\u000athe availability of which is not evident, cannot be invoked by the State to the detriment of the Complainant."\u000a6\u000a\u000a10\u000a\u000a52. A remedy will be deemed to be effective if it offers a prospect of success. 11 If its success is not\u000asufficiently certain, it will not meet the requirements of availability and effectiveness. The word 'effective'\u000ahas been defined to mean "adequate to accomplish a purpose; producing the intended or expected result,"\u000aor "functioning, useful, serviceable, operative, in order; practical, current, actual, real, valid".12 Lastly, a\u000aremedy will be found to be sufficient if it is capable of redressing the complaint.13 It will be deemed\u000ainsufficient if, for example, the applicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of a generalised\u000afear for his life "or even those of his relatives."14 This Commission has also declared a remedy to be\u000ainsufficient because its pursuit depended on extrajudicial considerations, such as discretion or some\u000aextraordinary power vested in an executive state official. The word 'sufficient' literally means "adequate for\u000athe purpose; enough"; or "ample, abundant; . . . satisfactory."15\u000a53. In the present communication, the author of the communication is based in Canada, alleging human\u000arights violations in the Respondent State following an incident that occurred in the country. The\u000aComplainant does not hide the fact that local remedies were not attempted but argued that pursuing\u000adomestic remedies in the Respondent State would be futile "due to the lack of an independent and impartial\u000ajudiciary, a lack of an efficient remedy, the significant likelihood of an unduly prolonged domestic remedy,\u000aand most importantly, the potential for violence against the Anuak or those supporting them within the legal\u000asystem". The Complainant argued that the violations that took place in Gambella were massive and serious\u000aand involved many people; it noted that "the government forces and its collaborators, having previously\u000adrawn a list of targets, went from door to door, slaughtering any educated Anuak men they could find,\u000awomen and children were raped, and homes and schools were burnt to the ground...".\u000a54. The Complainant noted further that the judiciary in the Respondent State is not independent due to\u000ainterference at State level where there are reports of administrative officers interfering with court decisions,\u000afiring of judges, dictating decisions to judges, reducing salaries of judges and deliberately refusing to\u000aenforce certain decisions of the courts; and that bringing the case before Ethiopian courts would be unduly\u000aprolonging the process as the Ethiopian judiciary suffers from "a complex system of multiple courts that lack\u000acoordination and resources", including "dismal conditions of service, staff shortages, lack of adequate\u000atraining, debilitating infrastructure and logistical problems". The Complainant claims court proceedings\u000a"take years to yield results", and concluded that the Respondent State's judicial system is "so under\u000aresourced that prosecutions would be nearly impossible".\u000a55. The Complainant also alleges that the Anuak fear for their safety in bringing the case in Ethiopia adding\u000athat there are no Anuak trained as lawyers who could bring the case before Ethiopian courts. The\u000aComplainant concluded by stating that to bring the case within the Respondent State would only further\u000aendanger the lives of the remaining Anuak in the Ethiopia. The Complainant added that the Respondent\u000aState had been given notice and adequate time to remedy the human rights violations against the Anuak\u000abut has utterly failed to do so.\u000a56. Can this Commission conclude, based on the above allegations by the complainant that local remedies\u000ain the Respondent State are not available, ineffective or insufficient?\u000a57. It must be observed here that the Complainant's submissions seem to suggest that local remedies may\u000ain fact be available but it is apprehensive about their effectiveness as far as the present case is concerned.\u000aFrom the Complainant's submissions, it is clear that the Complainant has relied on reports, including a\u000aWorld Bank report which concluded that "of the three branches of government, the judiciary has the least\u000ahistory and experience of independence and therefore requires significant strengthening to obtain true\u000aindependence".\u000a58. The Complainant's submissions also demonstrate that it is apprehensive about the success of local\u000aremedies either because of fear for the safety of lawyers, the lack of independence of the judiciary or the\u000ameagre resources available to the judiciary. Apart from casting aspersions on the effectiveness of local\u000aremedies, the Complainant has not provided concrete evidence or demonstrated sufficiently that these\u000aapprehensions are founded and may constituted [sic] a barrier to it attempting local remedies. In the view of\u000athis Commission, the Complainant is simply casting doubts about the effectiveness of the domestic\u000aremedies. This Commission is of the view that it is incumbent on every complainant to take all necessary\u000asteps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of, local remedies. It is not enough for the complainant\u000ato cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated or past incidences. In\u000athis regard, the African Commission would like to refer to the decision of the [UN] Human Rights Committee\u000ain A v. Australia16 in which the Committee held that "mere doubts about the effectiveness of local remedies\u000a... did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies".17 The African Commission can therefore not\u000a7\u000a\u000adeclare the communication admissible based on this argument. If a remedy has the slightest likelihood to\u000abe effective, the applicant must pursue it. Arguing that local remedies are not likely to be successful,\u000awithout trying to avail oneself of them, will simply not sway this Commission.\u000a59. The Complainant also argue[s] that the violations alleged are serious and involve a large number of\u000apeople and should be declare admissible as the African Commission cannot hold the requirements of local\u000aremedies to apply literally in cases where it is impracticable or undesirable for the Complainant to seize the\u000adomestic courts in the case of each violation. In the 54.91-61.91-98.93-164.97_196.97-210.98 case18 , for\u000aexample, this Commission observed that [t]he gravity of the human rights situation in Mauritania and the\u000agreat number of victims involved render[ed] the channels of remedy unavailable in practical terms, and,\u000aaccording to the terms of the Charter, their process [was] 'unduly prolonged'. In like manner, the Amnesty\u000aInternational, Comité Loosli Bachelard, Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, Association of Members of\u000athe Episcopal Conference of East Africa / Sudan, Paragraph 32 case 19 involved the arbitrary arrest,\u000adetention and torture of many Sudanese citizens after the coup of 30th July 1989. The alleged acts of\u000atorture included forcing detainees into cells measuring 1.8 metres wide and 1 metre deep, deliberately\u000aflooding the cells, frequently banging on the doors to prevent detainees from lying down, forcing them to\u000aface mock executions, and prohibiting them from bathing or washing. Other acts of torture included burning\u000adetainees with cigarettes, binding them with ropes to cut off circulation, and beating them with sticks until\u000atheir bodies were severely lacerated and then treating the resulting wounds with acid. After the coup, the\u000aSudanese government promulgated a decree that suspended the jurisdiction of the regular courts in favour\u000aof special tribunals with respect to any action taken in applying the decree. It also outlawed the taking of\u000aany legal action against the decree. These measures, plus the "seriousness of the human rights situation in\u000aSudan and the great numbers of people involved," the Commission concluded, "render[ed] such remedies\u000aunavailable in fact." 20\u000a60. Thus, in cases of massive violations, the state will be presumed to have notice of the violations within\u000aits territory and the State is expected to act accordingly to deal with whatever human rights violations. The\u000apervasiveness of these violations dispenses with the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies,\u000aespecially where the state took no steps to prevent or stop them. 21\u000a61. The above cases must however be distinguished from the present case which involves one single\u000aincident that took place for a short period of time. The Respondent State has indicated the measures it took\u000ato deal with the situation and the legal proceedings being undertaken by those alleged to have committed\u000ahuman rights violations during the incident. By establishing the Gambella Commission of Inquiry and\u000aindicting alleged human rights perpetrators, the state, albeit under international pressure, demonstrated\u000athat it was not indifferent to the alleged human rights violations that took place in the area and in the view of\u000athis Commission could be said to have exercised due diligence.\u000a62. This Commission has also held in many instances that domestic remedies have not been exhausted if a\u000acase that includes the subject matter of the petition before it is still pending before the national courts. In\u000a45.90, 22 the African Commission declined to consider a communication with respect to which a claim had\u000abeen filed but not yet settled by the courts of the Respondent State. In the present communication, the\u000aRespondent State indicates that the matter is still pending before its courts and attached a list of cases still\u000apending before the Federal Circuit Court in relation with the Gambella incident. The list provided the names\u000aof the suspects, file number of their cases, previous and future dates of adjournments. The Complainant\u000adoes not deny this process is going on. In the view of this Commission, it does not matter whether the\u000acases still pending before the courts have been brought by the Complainant or the state. The underlying\u000aquestion is whether the case is a subject matter of the proceedings before the African Commission and\u000awhether it is aimed at granting the same relief the Complainant is seeking before this Commission. As long\u000aas a case still pending before a domestic court is a subject matter of the petition before this Commission,\u000aand as long as this Commission believes the relief sought can be obtained locally, it will decline to entertain\u000athe case. It is the view of this Commission that the present communication23 is still pending before the\u000acourts of the Respondent State and therefore does not meet the requirements under Article 56(5).\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aFor the above reasons, the African Commission declares communication 299/05 Anuak Justice\u000a8\u000a\u000aCouncil/Ethiopia inadmissible for non-exhaustion of local remedies in conformity with Article 56(5)\u000aof the African Charter.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 See communications 25/89, 47/90, 56/91, 100/93 Free Legal Assistance Group et al./Zaire, para. 36,\u000a1995 and communication 71/92 Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l'Homme/Zambia, para.\u000a11.\u000a2 consolidated communication 48/90, 50/91, 89/93 Amnesty International [et] al./Sudan, para. 31.\u000a3 See communication 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project/Nigeria.\u000a4 Rule 116 of the [African] Commission's Rules of Procedures.\u000a5 communication 86/93 Ceesay/The Gambia.\u000a6 Consolidated communications 147/95, 149/96 Jawara/The Gambia, para. 31.\u000a7 Ibid, para. 32.\u000a8 Ibid, para 33.\u000a9 Longman Synonym Dictionary, 82 (1986).\u000a10 Consolidated communications 147/95, 149/96 Jawara/The Gambia supra, para. 33.\u000a11 Ibid, para. 32.\u000a12 Longman Synonym Dictionary, 82 (1986).\u000a13 Consolidated communications 147/95-149/96 Jawara/The Gambia, para. 32.\u000a14 Ibid, para 35.\u000a15 Longman, p. 1183.\u000a16 Communication 560/1993, UN Doc CCPR/C/59/D/560/1993 (1997).\u000a17 See also L.

aV301/05 Haregewoin Gebre-Sellaise & IHRDA (on behalf\u000aof former Dergue officials) v. Ethiopia\u000aSummary of the Facts\u000a1. The present Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission (the Secretariat)\u000aon 16 November 2004. It is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\u000aRights (the African Charter or Charter). The Secretariat later received a letter from the Institute for Human\u000aRights and Development in Africa (hereafter the IHRDA) dated 29th March 2006, whereby the IHRDA\u000asought to join as co-author of the communication.\u000a2. The Complaint is thus submitted by Haregewoin Gabre-Salassie and IHRDA (the Complainants) on\u000abehalf of "the Dergue officials" former officials of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia) who have been detained\u000aby the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (Respondent State) since 1991.\u000a3. The complainants alleged that following the overthrow of the former Mengistu regime in Ethiopia\u000a(commonly referred to as Dergue regime) by the Ethiopia People's Revolutionary Democratic Front\u000a(EPRDF), in 1991, the Dergue officials surrendered to the new government and they were arrested and\u000adetained on account of collective responsibility for policies or abuses by the Dergue regime rather than on\u000aan account of individual responsibility for particular criminal offences. The Complainants submit that they\u000ahave been in detention since then.\u000a4. The Complainants also claim that a year after their detention a new legislation was enacted whereby the\u000aSpecial Public Prosecutor's (SPO) was established and mandated to conduct "investigation and bring to\u000atrial Dergue officials] detainees, as well as those persons who are responsible for having committed\u000aoffences and are at large, both within and [outside] the country".\u000a5. They submit that upon coming into force, the SPO Proclamation barred and suspended the applicability\u000aof provisions concerning time limitation of criminal action to proceedings instituted by the SPO office;\u000athereby giving the SPO the liberty to submit charges, evidence1 and other matters pertaining thereto\u000awhenever it pleased, without any concerns about the statute of limitation miming against its actions, and\u000aforeclosing their right to fair trial. Such offences may not be commuted by amnesty or pardon."\u000a6. They aver that the SPO Proclamation also ousted the applicability of the provisions of habeas corpus\u000aunder the Civil Procedure Code to persons detained prior to the coming into force of the Proclamation in\u000amatters under the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor, thereby wiping out the possibility of challenging the\u000aexcessively prolonged detention without trial of the detainees. According to the Complainants this ouster is\u000adiscriminatory as it applies to the targeted groups only, and was applied retroactively, as it narrowed down\u000athe rights of the detainees to judicially challenge their prolonged detention.\u000a7. The complainants further submit that although the law demands a speedy trial, the victims stayed in\u000adetention without access to legal counsel from 1991 - 1994, and that the SPO trial finally commenced only\u000ain October 1994. The Dergue officials discovered during the trial they have been charged with the crime of\u000aGenocide and Crime Against Humanity under Article 281 of the Ethiopia Penal Code of 1957. The\u000aallegations included the killing and torture of secessionists, political activists and farm owners.\u000a8. The Complainants submit that after fifteen (15) years of detention of the alleged victims and twelve (l2)\u000ayears of the commencement of the trial, the proceeding yet to be concluded.\u000a9. They aver further that the Dergue officials were collectively charged solely on basis of being members of\u000athe Council of the defunct Provisional Military Administration, and accordingly, they have been defending\u000atheir cases collectively; which procedure has made it difficult to individualise guilt, or to prove/rebut\u000aindividual innocence and guilt, and according to the Complainants will lead to collective guilt and collective\u000apunishment.\u000a10. This situation is alleged to have also manifestly contributed to the delay of the proceedings. In order to\u000aexpedite the trial therefore, it is submitted that the Dergue officials have pleaded with the Court for\u000aindividual trials, and that their request was overruled. It is also noted that an appeal on this issue, being an\u000a"interlocutory matter" is permissible only if or when the party lodges an appeal on the conviction or\u000asentencing of the final verdict, and that since the final judgment is yet to be handed down, the detainees do\u000anot have a right of appeal on this issue at this stage of the proceedings.\u000a11. The Complainants claim that although all the Dergue officials were collectively charged with the crime\u000aof Genocide, they raised an objection through their defence lawyers that the charge filed by the Prosecution\u000a1\u000a\u000adid not clearly stipulate which cases fall under Genocide and which ones fall under crime against humanity,\u000ahowever, the court proceeded without making a ruling on the issue. They submit that to their dismay, they\u000alater learnt that most of those indicted had all been convicted and sentenced to rigorous prison terms,\u000aincluding capital punishment for the crime of Genocide. Those sentenced to death are waiting for the\u000adecision of the Head of State whether they would be pardoned or executed.\u000a12. They allege that Genocide has an international definition, and by adding illegal and clandestine political\u000aparties and organizations to the list of protected entities under the Genocide Convention, the Ethiopian\u000acourts have created a new crime of genocide by analogy. The Complainants submit that the Ethiopian court\u000aby creating crimes by analogy have not only deviated from the international Genocide Convention to which\u000as Ethiopia is a party, but also Article 9 of the Constitution of Ethiopia, which stipulates that all the laws of\u000athe land must be interpreted in conformity with international conventions, treaties and agreements.\u000a13. They averred that when trial commenced, they had requested for an impartial and international tribunal\u000ato be set up to investigate the allegations but the Respondent State refused. The judges were mostly fresh\u000aUniversity graduates, civil servants and ex-combatants from the new regime. Regarding the right to be\u000arepresented by legal counsel, Complainants submit that the Court ordered legal practitioners to represent\u000athem in the subsequent trials, and that they did not have the chance to make a choice counsel, but had to\u000acontend with the legal counsels assigned them by the State.\u000a14. It is also alleged that the lawyers assigned to the detainees did not have the right to decline the order of\u000athe State to take up the cases, even if they indicated that they were not interested and/or that they did not\u000ahave the expertise in defending cases dealing with the crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.\u000aThe lawyers were allegedly underpaid for the work, with no incentives and many of them are said to have\u000agiven up going to Court to defend the detainees, consequently leaving many of the detainees virtually\u000awithout legal counsel.\u000a15. They submit that the detainees fall under the following categories:\u000ao Those that have been sentenced from, rigorous imprisonment up to death;\u000ao Those that have presented their defence and are awaiting judgment at the Federal High Court;\u000ao Those that are in the process of presenting their defence and\u000ao Those that have appealed to the Supreme Court after having been sentenced by the Federal High Court.\u000a16. The Complainants submit that the detainees have been frustrated by the long adjournments, shortages\u000aand frequent change of judges and absenteeism. This has been exacerbated by the movement of judges\u000aon circuit basis to different regions of the capital.\u000a17. The Complainants informed the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African\u000aCommission or the Commission), that out of the 109 Dergue officials, only 76 survived to be charged\u000aincluding those in the Diaspora; only 46 appeared in court; while 9 have died during the proceedings in\u000aprison; and that to date, 37 have remained to defend their case collectively. However, the African\u000aCommission was later informed by the IHRDA that not less than ten (10) of the detainees have died in\u000adetention before they were able to know their conviction or acquittal and that some of the deaths occurred\u000aafter the submission of the present Communication; with the last one in March/April 2006.\u000a18. The Complainants claim that the Government is using this case as a means of precluding certain\u000agroups or a sector of a population from participating in political activities. They submit that while the\u000aGovernment is using the judiciary to create an image and sense of justice to the international community\u000aand advocate of human rights, the truth is that the charge convictions and sentences are all politically\u000amotivated, the end result of which is a "Victor's Justice".\u000a19. The Complainants submitted that the delay and procedural irregularities in the case have been\u000aunprecedented in judicial history and reminded the African Commission that "Justice threatened anywhere\u000ais justice threatened everywhere".\u000a\u000aArticles alleged to have been violated\u000a20. The Complainants allege violation of Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d), 7(2), 25 and 26 of the\u000aAfrican Charter by the Respondent State.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aPrayers\u000a21. The Complainants request the African Commission to:\u000ao Declare specifically that the Proclamation setting up the Special Prosecutor Office and the conduct of\u000aofficials of the Federal Government of Ethiopia during the trial of the Dergue Officials constitute a violation\u000aof the right to be presumed innocent guaranteed in Article 7 (1) (b) of the Charter;\u000ao Declare specifically that by failing to try the victims within a reasonable time after their detention and\u000asubjecting them to a trial that lasted for more than 12 years, Ethiopia has violated their right to a speedy\u000atrial guaranteed in Article 7 (1) (d) of the Charter;\u000ao Declare that by failing to recognize the victims' right to a fair trial as enshrined in the African Charter, the\u000aFederal Government of Ethiopia has violated Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter;\u000ao Award compensation to those who remained in detention pending the completion of their trial and were\u000aeventually found innocent, and recommend that the period of detention be counted into the time of\u000aimprisonment of the victims;\u000ao Strongly recommend the Ethiopian Courts not to pass death sentences against any of victims of the trials\u000aconsidering the fact that several rights of the victims have been violated in the process of the trial;\u000ao Strongly recommend that the Ethiopian Courts, which may be approached by way of appeal, to commute\u000athe capital sentences passed against the victims to terms of imprisonment. In the alternative or as\u000acomplementary, should recommend to the authorities (the Head of State and the Prime Minister) in\u000aaccordance to the power conferred upon them by Ethiopian laws to reduce capital punishment\u000aimprisonment terms;\u000ao Strongly recommend the Federal Government of Ethiopia that legislative and other measures should be\u000ataken to ensure that all citizens of Ethiopia enjoy the right to a fair trial guaranteed in the African Chaffer.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a22. The Complaint was received at the Secretariat on 16 November 2004.\u000a23. On 14 January 2005, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants through the office of the Commissioner\u000afor Political Affairs asking them whether the complaint should be considered as a Communication before\u000athe Commission.\u000a24. On 14 April 2005, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainants confirming that the complaint\u000ashould be treated as a Communication.\u000a25. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission considered the\u000aCommunication and decided to be seized thereof.\u000a26. By Note Verbale of 24 May 2005, the Respondent State was notified of the African Commission's\u000adecision and requested to submit its arguments on admissibility within three months of the notification. By\u000aletter of the same date, the Complainants were notified of the African Commission's decision.\u000a27. On 23 August 2005, the Secretariat received the arguments of the Respondent State on the\u000aadmissibility communication.\u000a28. On 25 August 2005, Secretariat received the Complainant's arguments on admissibility\u000a29. By Note Verbale of 25 August 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Respondent State's\u000asubmission and transmitted the Complainant's submission to the State. By letter of the same date, the\u000aSecretariat informed the Complainant of the Respondent State's submissions.\u000a30. On 23 September 2005, the Secretariat received additional submission on admissibility from the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a31. At its 38th Ordinary Session Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission deferred consideration of the\u000aCommunication to allow the Complainant submit further arguments on admissibility.\u000a32. By Note Verbale dated 15 December 2005 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission notified both parties of the African Commission's decision and the Complainant was requested\u000a3\u000a\u000ato submit arguments within thirty days.\u000a33. On 6 March 2006, the Secretariat sent by DHL, all the submissions of the State on the admissibility of\u000athe Communication to the Complainant and requested the latter to send submissions within 30 days.\u000a34. On 29 March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the IHRDA\u000aindicating its intention to assist the Complainant in dealing with the case and its intention to become a\u000aco-author to the Communication.\u000a35. On 29 March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the IHRDA's\u000aletter.\u000a36. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 11 - 25 May 2006, the African\u000aCommission deferred further consideration on the admissibility of the Communication in order to make a\u000apreliminary determination of the status of the co-author.\u000a37. By a Note Verbale dated 29 May 2006 and by a letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\u000aAfrican Commission's decision, and the IHRDA was requested to explain how it intends to become a coauthor to the Communication.\u000a38. On 7 August 2006, the Secretariat received a brief from the IHRDA explaining its status as co-author of\u000athe communication.\u000a39. By letter dated 15 August 2006, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt IHRDA's letter and submission,\u000aand by a Note Verbale of the same date, transmitted both documents to the Respondent State.\u000a40. By Note Verbale dated, 10 October 2006, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State to submit its\u000acomments on the submission made the IHRDA before 31 October 2006.\u000a41. At its 40th Ordinary Session held from 15 to 29 November 2006, the African Commission considered the\u000aCommunication in light of the IHRDA, and decided to defer further consideration of its 41st Ordinary\u000aSession in order to allow the Respondent State reply to the IHRDA's submissions on admissibility, in line\u000awith Rule 117(2) Commission's Rules of Procedure.\u000a42. By letter and a Note Verbale dated 9 and 15 February 2007, the parties were respectively informed\u000aabout the African Commission's decision. The African Commission further reminded the Respondent State\u000ato submit its comments of the submissions made by the IHRDA before 15th March 2007.\u000a43. By Note Verbale dated 24 April 2007, the African Commission reminded the Respondent State to\u000arespond to the IHRDA's submissions on admissibility; and requested the State to make the said\u000asubmissions by 10 May 2007.\u000a44. At its 41st Ordinary Session held from 16 to 30 May 2007, in Accra Ghana, the African Commission, in\u000athe absence of any response from the Respondent State, acted on the evidence before it in line with Rule\u000a117 (4). It therefore made a preliminary determination on the IHRDA's status as a co-author to the\u000aCommunication arid declared the Communication admissible.\u000a45. By Note Verbale of 25 June 2007 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\u000aAfrican Commission's decision, and requested to make submissions on the merits.\u000a46. By letter dated 31 July 2007, the Complainant requested the African Commission to postpone\u000aconsideration on the merits of the Communication to its 43rd Ordinary Session to give it adequate time to\u000aprepare its arguments.\u000a47. By Note Verbale or 24 September 2007, the Respondent State submitted its arguments on the merits.\u000a48. At its 42nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred its\u000adecision the 43rd Ordinary Session to allow the complainant to make its submissions on the merits.\u000a49. By Note Verbale of 19 December 2007 and by letter of the same date, both parties to the\u000acommunication were notified of the African Commission's decision.\u000a50. On 18th April 2008, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submissions on the merits of\u000acommunication.\u000a51. By Note Verbale of 24 April 2008, the Secretariat forwarded the Complainant's submissions to the\u000aRespondent State.\u000aSUBMISSIONS ON LOCUS STANDI AND JOINDER OF PARTIES\u000aSubmissions from the IHRDA\u000a\u000a52. The IHRDA submits that it is a pan-African organisation with an interest in the protection and promotion\u000aof human rights in Africa, and with a specialization in litigation before the African Commission.\u000a53. The IHRDA informs the African Commission that it has information about blatant violations of\u000a4\u000a\u000aCharter-guaranteed human rights in the Respondent State, being the detention of over 106 former Dergue\u000aofficials, and that it had been interested in bringing these to the attention of the Commission. However,\u000ahaving discovered that there is a pending Communication before the Commission - i.e., based on the same\u000afacts and alleged violations, it decided to apply to the African Commission to be joined as a co-author of\u000athis Communication, rather than bring a fresh Communication. The IHRDA notes that the original author of\u000athe Communication has abandoned it and will not appear before the Commission anymore due to clear and\u000apresent threat against her life, and as a consequence has refused to speak with the Institute or anyone.\u000a54. The interest of the IHRDA in this matter, especially now that original author has abandoned the matter\u000ais stated to be related to its principal objective, which is providing necessary assistance and expertise..."\u000aand supported by the principle of action popularis.\u000aResponse from the Respondent State\u000a\u000a55. The Respondent State argues in their oral submissions that the IHRDA is not registered in Ethiopia and\u000ahas no relationship with the victims, and therefore does not have a "legal interest" in the Communication.\u000aThe IHRDA's Response to the Submission of the Respondent State\u000a\u000a56. The IHRDA argues that there is no requirement of "citizenship" or "legal interest" in the provisions of\u000aArticle 56(1) of the Charter which refers to the authorship of Communications (under the admissibility\u000arequirements) before the Commission. More so, it argues, neither the Charter's provisions nor the practice\u000aof the Commission imposes any limitation on the locus standi of authors of Communications.\u000a57. According to the IHRDA, Article 56 of the Charter provides for seven admissibility requirements, and\u000athat the list therein is exhaustive, adding that "Legal Interest" and "Citizenship" requirements as argued by\u000athe Respondent State do not feature under the admissibility requirements under Article 56, and are\u000atherefore at odds with the Charter. It further argues that introducing these additional requirements to the\u000aadmissibility requirements under the Charter would be tantamount to reviewing the Charter, which the\u000aRespondent State lacks the power to do. It notes that respect for the existing text is the practice of\u000ainternational mechanisms in general and of the African Commission, in particular. The IHRDA notes further\u000athat introducing additional requirements to the admissibility requirements under the Charter would render\u000athe Commission inaccessible, thereby defeating the intention of the drafters of the Charter, which\u000aencourages, rather than stifles, the submission of human rights violations to the Commission.\u000a58. Thus, the IHRDA contends that it is not required to prove legal interest, but that it suffices to show that it\u000ais interested in the protection and promotion of human rights through the African regional mechanism.\u000aSimilarly, it notes that the "citizenship" of the IHRDA, which is not registered in Ethiopia, is irrelevant to the\u000aadmissibility of the Communication; and argues that such a restrictive approach would complicate matters\u000awhere, for one reason or another, the "domestic actors" are unable to lodge complaint themselves before\u000athe Commission. It argues that such an approach would insulate the violating states against international\u000ascrutiny and foster the culture impunity, which is at odds with the purpose of the Charter to promote and\u000aprotect the rights and freedoms of Africans.\u000a59. It further contends that its line of argument is in consonance with the practice of other regional and UN\u000amechanisms, whereby complaints may be lodged on behalf of alleged victims of human rights violations.\u000a60. The IHRDA further contends that with respect to Article 56(1) of the Charter, the provision merely\u000arequires that a Communication should "indicate their authors", and that is designed to enable the\u000aCommission's Secretary to remain in contact with the author, to keep him or her informed about the status\u000aof the Communication, and to request further information if it is required. The IHRDA disagrees with the\u000aRespondent State's argument that there is no author to the present Communication, and submits that this\u000ais a misconception of the "victim - author" difference.\u000aThe African Commission Decision on Locus standi and Joinder of Parties\u000aLocus standi\u000a\u000a61. The African Commission notes that neither the African Charter nor the Rules of Procedure the\u000aCommission makes provisions on the locus standi of parties before it. The Commission has however,\u000athrough its practice and jurisprudence adopted the actio popularis principle allowing everyone the legal\u000ainterest and capacity to file a Communication, for its consideration. For this purpose, non-victim individuals,\u000a5\u000a\u000agroups and NGOs constantly submit Communications to the Commission. Thus, the Commission upholds\u000athe argument of the IHRDA on their capacity to approach the Commission in its capacity as an organisation\u000awith an interest in the protection and promotion of human rights in Africa under the actio popularis principle.\u000a62. With respect to the argument of the Respondent State that there is no legal interest for the Institute to\u000adeal with the case, the Commission has made it clear, inter alia, in WOAT/OMCTs vs. Zaire 2 that the\u000aauthor of a Communication need not be the victim nor related to the victim(s) of the human rights violations\u000aalleged. This position is put succinctly in the Commission's decision in Malawi African Association and\u000aOthers v Mauritania3 , where it held that "Article 56(1) of the Charter demands that any persons submitting\u000acommunications to the Commission relating to human and peoples' rights must reveal their identity. They\u000ado not necessarily have to be the victims of such violations or members of their families. This characteristic\u000aof the African Charter reflects sensitivity to the practical difficulties that individuals can face in countries\u000awhere human rights are violated. The national or international channels of remedy may not be accessible to\u000athe victims."4\u000a63. As a result of the foregoing, the commission is disagrees with the Respondent State's argument that\u000athe Institute lacks legal interest in the matter.\u000a64. With respect to the argument the Respondent State that the Institute is not a citizen of or an\u000aorganization registered in Ethiopia, the Commission made it clear in Spilg and Mack & DITSHWANELO (on\u000abehalf of Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi) / Botswana5 that the person or NGO filing the Communication need\u000anot be national or be registered in the territory of the Respondent State. There is no requirement of\u000a"citizenship" for the authorship of a Communication.6 Any interested individual or organisation can bring a\u000aCommunication on behalf of a victim and such individual or organisation need not be a citizen or be\u000aregistered within a States party to the African Charter.\u000a65. Thus, the fact that the Institute is not registered in Ethiopia is immaterial. As long as it satisfies the\u000aconditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter, the African Commission will entertain the\u000aCommunication as it has done, in several other cases where Communications have been instituted by\u000anon-nationals of the State against which the Communication is instituted.\u000a66. Accordingly, the African Commission holds that the Institute can appear before it in respect of the\u000apresent Communication under its much espoused actio popularis principle.\u000aJoinder of Parties\u000a\u000a67. Joinder of parties is a legal term which refers to the act if uniting as parties to an action all persons who\u000ahave the same rights or against whom rights are claimed, as either co-plaintiff co-defendants.7 Joinder of\u000aparties therefore allows multiple plaintiffs or defendants to join in an action if each of their claims arises\u000afrom the same transaction or occurrence, or are of a similar nature or if there is a common question of law\u000aor fact relating all their claims.\u000a68. Notably, neither the African Charter nor the Rules of Procedure of the Commission make provision on\u000athe joinder of parties before the Commission. The closest to this is Rule 114 (2) which provides that the\u000aCommission, may, if it deems it good, jointly consider two or more Communications. Consequently, the\u000aprerogative of the Commission, from the facts presented, to join Communications, and the same would\u000aapply to the joinder of parties.\u000a69. The IHRDA has applied to join the present Communication as co- authors, and indeed, as shown\u000aabove, there is no jurisprudential or legal bar that precludes them from joining as co-authors. Indeed, if the\u000aAfrican Commission were deny the Complainant access to its Communications procedure, there is the\u000apossibility of the alleged victims, on whose behalf this Communication has been brought to continue to\u000aviolations of their fundamental rights; especially as the first Complainant has refused to proceed with the\u000aCommunication, even though he has not formally communicated this decision to the Commission. Such\u000adenial of access to the Institute would indeed be contrary to the spirit of the Charter which mandates the\u000aAfrican Commission to ensure the protection of human and peoples' rights in Africa.\u000a70. More specifically, in respect of the Respondent State's argument that there is no author to the present\u000aCommunication, the Commission notes that even if the original Complainant has formally withdrawn from\u000athe present Communication, as the ultimate protector of human rights on the African continent, the\u000aCommission may still proceed to examine the Communication if it deems it appropriate. The Commission\u000ahereby alludes to the practice of other similar bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human\u000aRights.8 In this respect, the Commission notes that while there is no provision to this effect in its current\u000arules of procedure, there is also nothing therein precluding it from adopting this progressive approach to the\u000a6\u000a\u000aprotection of human rights.\u000a71. Accordingly, the African Commission hereby joins the IHRDA as co- author to the present\u000aCommunication, in line with its widely espoused actio popularis principle, as an organisation with an\u000ainterest in the protection and promotion of human rights in Africa under the actio popularis principle. The\u000aCommunication will henceforth be cited as Haregewoin Gebresellaise and Institute for Human Rights &\u000aDevelopment in Africa / Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.\u000aThe Law on Admissibility\u000aRespondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\u000a\u000a72. The Respondent State's submissions on admissibility are divided into two parts. In Part One, the\u000aRespondent States provides a background of the conflict in Ethiopia that led to the overthrow of the Dergue\u000aRegime in 1991. The State notes the alleged gross human rights violations that were perpetrated by the\u000aand notes further that domestic mechanisms were put in place to prosecute perpetrators of gross human\u000arights that were perpetrated by the said regime and notes further that domestic mechanisms human rights\u000aviolations. These mechanisms, according to the Respondent State includes the Special Prosecutors Office\u000aset up in 1992 to among other things, establish a historical record in human rights were put in place to\u000aprosecute perpetrators of gross according to the Respondent State/includes the Special Prosecutor Office\u000aset up in 1992 to, among other things, establish a historical record of human rights violations under the\u000aMengistu regime; and to bring officials, members and auxiliaries of the armed and security forces of the\u000aDergue regime who participated in the commission of serious human rights violations to justice.\u000a73. The Respondent State also notes that it has an independent judiciary dealing with the cases of the\u000aofficials and insists that most of the cases have been disposed of and some people have been tried, some\u000aset free, others have been convicted while some are still being tried.\u000a74. In Part Two of its submission, the Respondent State addresses itself to the question of Admissibility\u000aand argues that the Communication should be declared Inadmissible for the following reasons: that the\u000aComplainant failed to comply with the burden and standard of proof; that the case is pending before the\u000acourts of the Respondent State, that remedies are available, effective and sufficient to address the matters\u000araised in the Communication. The Respondent State also insists that the Special Prosecutor Office has\u000asufficient and independent mechanism to address the grievances and that the remedies sought are beyond\u000athe mandate of the African Commission. The State submits further that the Communication does not make\u000areference to the African Charter and fails to indicate the provisions of the Charter alleged to have been\u000aviolated, adding that the case has already been settled by another international organ.\u000a75. According to the State, the Complainant is required to provide a prima facie evidence of an attempt to\u000aexhaust local remedies which the Complainant's have not exhausted. The State pointed out that the\u000aComplainants could have addressed their grievances to the High Court or the Judicial Administration\u000aOfficer or the Human Rights Commission.\u000a76. The State further avers that right to a speedy trial alleged to have been violated is embodied in\u000aEthiopian law, including in the Constitution, and is a fundamental right recognized by international human\u000arights treaties Ethiopia has ratified, which by virtue of Article 9(4) is an integral part of the laws of Ethiopia.\u000aThus, according to the State, the courts are bound to ensure the realization of this right.\u000a77. The State acknowledges that in terms of Article 19 of its Constitution "...where the interest of justice so\u000arequires, the court may order the arrested person remain in custody, or when requested, remand him for a\u000atime strictly required to carry out the investigation. In determining the additional time necessary for\u000ainvestigation, the court shall ensure that the responsible law enforcement authorities carry out the\u000ainvestigations respecting the arrested person's right to a speedy trial".\u000a78. According to the State, these are legal safeguards that cancel the risk of breach of the right of me\u000aaccused to speedy trial. The State points out that if the Prosecution's office or any other organ was\u000atherefore 'engaged in an act that violates the victims' right to a speedy trial, they could and should have\u000acalled the attention of the court to the violation. According to the State, there was no indication that the\u000aComplainants resorted to this.\u000a79. Regarding the Judicial Administration Council established by Proclamation No. 24/1996, the State\u000aindicates that one of its powers is to discipline judges who act in breach of disciplinary rules and if the judge\u000aturned a deaf ear to the pleas of the Complainants, they could and should have brought their complaints\u000abefore the Judicial Administration Council, a recourse which the State claims was not sought by the\u000a7\u000a\u000aComplainants.\u000a80. The State argues further that the Complainants did not bring their grievances to the attention of the\u000aJudicial Administration Offices and the Human Rights Commission. According to the State, the\u000aComplainants have not shown that the judicial process was unduly prolonged and do not show why they\u000adid not attempt to exhaust all these remedies available to them.\u000a81. The State also notes that for local remedies to be exhausted, the Complaint must have been dealt with\u000aby the highest court of the land, but in the instant case, there is no evidence to show that the Complainants\u000ahave submitted a case with the Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia. The State however: notes that many of\u000athe suspects have just recently brought their cases to the Supreme Court after being convicted by lower\u000acourts and these cases are still awaiting judgment. The State notes further that with respect to senior\u000agovernment officials of the Dergue regime, their cases were still being heard in the Federal High Court\u000aCriminal Branch and they still have an opportunity to appeal to higher courts, if convicted.\u000a82. Regarding the allegation of the Complainants that the process is unduly long, the State notes that\u000ameasures have been taken to reduce the time that will be taken Jo effectively try the victims to meet\u000ainternational fair trial standards. It states that it is intended that all the trials will be completed by the\u000abeginning of 2006. The state notes further that the delay has been caused by both the defence and the\u000aprosecution due to the many witnesses they had.\u000a83. The State claims the remedy sought by the Complainants is beyond the competence of the\u000aCommission, claiming that the latter is being requested to not only review the ongoing trial process in\u000aEthiopia but also to instruct Ethiopia on what form of domestic mechanism it should adopt in prosecuting\u000aand trying of persons accused of gross human rights violations. In particular, the State argues that the\u000acomplainants are asking the Commission to order Ethiopia to agree to the setting up of an international\u000atribunal similar to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda or the International Criminal Tribunal for\u000athe Former Yugoslavia. The State notes that different countries have adopted different approaches in\u000abringing human rights perpetrators to book, such as the establishment of the truth and reconciliation\u000acommission, international tribunals, etc., but in Ethiopia, the government has established the Special\u000aProsecutions Offices, making a clear choice to prosecute former Dergue officials who committed serious\u000aoffences and this decision has been widely supported by the international community.\u000a84. The State avers that the Complainants claim the right to pardon and amnesty under international law\u000ahas been infringed. According to the State, there are no such rights under international law, adding that, the\u000aEthiopian constitution precludes any blanket amnesty.\u000a85. According to the State, the Complainants' requests are not directly related to any human right\u000aguaranteed in the African Charter and thus the Communication is not compatible with the provisions of the\u000aCharter.\u000a86. The State went on to state that the Communication does not refer to the Charter and fails to indicate the\u000aprovision of the Charter that have been violated, noting that the African Commission has indicated that\u000aCommunications must illustrate a prima facie violation of the Charter by invoking specific provisions of the\u000aCharter alleged to have been violated. It also notes that the African Commission has rejected\u000aCommunications which failed to make reference to the provisions of the Charter, that even though they\u000acited provisions under UN texts, made only general allegations to human rights violations without making\u000aany specific breaches of the Charter.\u000a87. The State also argues that the Communication has been settled by another international organ. The\u000aState indicates that in its report E / CN.4/1994/ 27, Decision Nos. 45/1992 and 33/1993, the UN Working\u000aGroup on Arbitrary Detention issued decisions regarding the detention and prosecution process involving\u000athe victims. The State argues that following, this decision, the government took the necessary measures in\u000aorder to comply. The State argues that the Communication should therefore be declared inadmissible as it\u000ahas been settled by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.\u000a88. The state also argues that the Communication does not conform with the procedures in the African\u000aCharter and the Commission's rules of procedures. The State notes that the present Communication does\u000anot meet the requirements of Communication, as it is simply a letter of appeal sent to the Special\u000aRapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa. The State argues that the Special Rapporteur\u000awas engaging the Commission on issues which "it is already addressing and is adequately seized of\u000athrough its promotional mandate". The State concludes that the present Communication was not addressed\u000ato the Secretariat as a Communication but rather as a feedback from alleged victims of human rights to the\u000aSpecial Rapporteur during her visit to Ethiopia. The Respondent State therefore requests the Commission\u000ato also reject the Communication on this ground.\u000a8\u000a\u000aComplainants' submissions on Admissibility\u000a\u000a89. The Complainants note that Article 56 of the Charter provides for seven admissibility requirements, and\u000athat the list therein is exhaustive. They submit that the present Communication fulfils all the requirements\u000astipulated in Article 56 of the Charter and should therefore be declared admissible by the African\u000aCommission.\u000a90. With respect to Article 56(1) the Complainant submit that the authors of the Communication are clearly\u000aidentified Heregewoin Gabre-Sellasie and the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (on\u000abehalf of the over 106 Officials Dergue Regime). They thereby deny the Respondent State's argument that\u000athe Communication has no author.\u000a91. In respect of Article 56(2) which requires that Communication must be compatible with the African\u000aCharter or the OAU Charter, the Complainants note that neither the Charter nor the Commission's\u000aGuidelines on the Submission of Communications requires the Complainants to cite the precise violations\u000aof the Charter alleged, and that in fact, the Guidelines clearly provides that "...the Complainant need not\u000amention the specific articles of the Charter alleged to have been violated". They also reject the argument of\u000athe Respondent State in this regard.\u000a92. The Complainants argue that their subsequent submission on admissibility actually specified the\u000aarticles of the Charter allegedly violated by the Respondent State.\u000a93. In respect of Article 56(3) which requires that Communications should not be written in insulting or\u000adisparaging language directed at the State, its institutions or the African Union; the Complainants submit\u000athat the present Communication is based entirely on the factual situation giving rise to the complaint, and is\u000awritten in a manner that is both polite and respectful.\u000a94. In respect of Article 56(4) which provides that the Communication must not be based exclusively on\u000anews disseminated through the mass media, the Complainants submit that the present Communication is\u000abased on information verified by first-hand accounts of the events, supported by means of affidavits.9\u000a95. In respect of Article 56(5) which requires that Complainants exhaust all local remedies before\u000aapproaching the Commission, the Complainants submit that the State has been given sufficient notice of\u000athe continuing violations and has had ample opportunity to remedy the situation. They argue that "the laws,\u000aprocedures and practices have conspired to make it impossible for the Dergue Officials to seek any viable\u000alocal remedies and/or made the remedies ineffective at best".\u000a96. The Complainants rebut the argument of the Respondent State on their access to the High Court or the\u000aJudicial Administrative Commission (JAC) or the Human Rights Commission. In respect of the High Court,\u000athey note that the SPO Proclamation forecloses the detainees' rights to habeas corpus or a speedy trial,\u000aand that their request for individual charges cannot be appealed against until the final verdict is given.10\u000a97. In respect of the accessing the Human Rights Commission, they argue that apart from the fact that the\u000aHuman Rights Commission was established nine years after effective detention of the victims; the former is\u000aexpressly precluded by its establishing law from interfering in cases before the courts at any level. Article 7\u000aof the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission Establishing Proclamation No. 210/2000 provides that "The\u000a[Human Rights] Commission shall have full powers to receive and investigate all complaints on human\u000arights violations made against any person, save cases brought before...the courts of law, at any level".\u000a98. In respect of the JAC, the Complainants submit that the body has always been fully aware of the trials\u000aof the Dergue Officials, and has chosen to remain a "disinterested spectator".\u000a99. They concluded that there is no remedy left for the Dergue Officials to exhaust as they have exhausted\u000aall available local remedies. Alternatively, they submit that should there be any reason to believe\u000aotherwise,11 exhausting them as these remedies would be ineffective and/or their exhaustion would be\u000a'undesirable'. This, according to the Complainants, is because the process of exhaustion of local remedies\u000ahas been unduly prolonged, and the reasons for the delays are all attributable to the Respondent State.12\u000aThey therefore urge the Commission to follow its jurisprudence in Institute for Human and Development in\u000aAfrica (on behalf of Collectif des Veuves et Ayants droits)/Mauritania13 where it held that the duty on the\u000aComplainant to pursue legal avenues at the national level may be waived if it is 'impractical'14 or\u000a'undesirable' for the Complainant to do so15 .\u000a100. In respect of Article 56(7) which requires that Communications must not deal with cases which have\u000abeen settled in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (UN), the Charter of the OAU (now AU)\u000aor the provisions of African Charter; the Complainants note the argument of the Respondent that the\u000apresent Communication has been settled by another international organ, namely the UN Working Group on\u000a9\u000a\u000aArbitrary Detention (UNWGAD), by its Decisions Nos. 45/1992 and 33/1993.16 The Complainants however\u000aargue that there is no overlap between the complaint submitted to the UNWGAD and the present\u000aCommunication. They argue that the substance of the present Communication varies with the one dealt\u000awith by the UNWGAD, as do the victims, the facts making up the present Communication and the period\u000aover which the alleged violations have been committed.\u000a101. They note specifically that the complaint to the UNWGAD was submitted and decided before the\u000acommencement of the trial of the Dergue Officials, therefore did not cover the subsequent period of trial\u000awhich the present Communication is dealing with. They also note that the complaint UNWGAD was\u000aconcerned solely with five members of the Dergue, and therefore does not cover the over 106 Dergue\u000aOfficial in respect of whom the present Communication has been submitted before the Commission. Hence,\u000athey submit that the present Communication does not deal with any settled matter. They further argue that\u000afor the matter to have been settled there should have been a decision on merits complained of herein,\u000awhich is not the case. In support of this argument, they cite the Commission's decision in Bob Njoku vs.\u000aEgypt,17 where the Commission "had rightfully rejected the argument of the Respondent States on similar\u000agrounds and declared the Communication Admissible".18\u000a102. The Complainants conclude that the seven admissibility requirements have been effectively complied\u000awith in the present Communication and respectfully requested the African Commission to declare the\u000aCommunication admissible.\u000aThe African Commission's analysis on Admissibility\u000a103. The admissibility of Communications submitted before the African Commission pursuant to Article 55\u000aof the African Charter is governed by the seven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter. The\u000aComplainants submit that they have complied with all the Communication does not meet certain\u000arequirements under Article 56, in particular, Article 56 (2), (5) and (7).\u000a104. The African Commission notes, that only three of the requirements seem to be in dispute between the\u000aparties, but will proceed to examine all seven requirements to ensure they meet the admissibility test.\u000a105. Article 56(1) of the Africa Charter states that "Communication relating to Human Rights... received by\u000athe Commission shall be considered if they indicate their author even if the latter request anonymity...".The\u000aCommunication indicates the authors as well as the victims of the alleged violations, and the African\u000aCommission therefore holds that the requirement under Article 56(1) of the African Charter is fulfilled.\u000a106. Article 56(2) of the African Charter states that "Communication...received by the Commission shall be\u000aconsidered if they are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present\u000aCharter." The facts reveal that the Communication is brought against the Republic of Ethiopia which\u000abecame a party to the African Charter 1998, secondly the Communication alleges violations of rights\u000acontained in the African Charter. The State argues that the Communication is incompatible with the Charter\u000aas it does not indicate any provision of the Article alleged to have been violated. The Commission notes\u000athat the Complainants submissions on admissibility details the rights allegedly violated and specifically cited\u000athe corresponding Articles of the Charter. The Commission concurs with the Complainants that the\u000aComplainants does not necessarily need to list the articles of the Charter alleged to have been violated.\u000aThe African Commission is satisfied that the requirement of Article 56(2) has been fulfilled.\u000a107. Articled 56(3) of the African Charter states that "Communications ...received by the Commission shall\u000abe considered if they are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State\u000aconcerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity now African Union (AU)". The present\u000aCommunication is not written in disparaging or insulting language directed to the State, its institutions or the\u000aAU and for these reasons the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56 (3) been\u000acomplied with.\u000a108. Article 56(4) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'\u000aRights...shall be considered if they are not based exclusively on news disseminate through the mass\u000amedia. The Communication is not based on news disseminated through the mass media and there is\u000aevidence to show that the Communication is based on statements and affidavits from the victims. For these\u000areasons, the African Commission holds that the requirements under Article 56(4) have been fulfilled.\u000a109. Article 56(5) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'\u000aRights... shall be considered if they: are sent after exhausting remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this\u000aprocedure is unduly prolonged". The Respondent State submits that the Complainants failed to avail\u000athemselves of the local remedies within the State. The State contends that the Complainants could have\u000a10\u000a\u000aapproached the High Court, Human Rights Commission as well as the Judicial Administration Council. The\u000aComplainants argue that the state has had ample notice of the alleged violations and ought to have taken\u000asteps to deal with the same. They add with respect to the Human Rights Commission that the latter was\u000aestablished nine years after the arrest and detention of the victims and that the Commission does not have\u000athe power to deal with matters already being handled by the courts.\u000a110. In the present Communication therefore, the fact that the Complainants have not sufficiently\u000ademonstrated why they could not exhaust domestic remedies does not mean such remedies are available,\u000aeffective and sufficient. The African Commission can infer from the circumstances surrounding the case\u000aand determine whether such remedies are in fact available, and if they are, whether they are effective and\u000asufficient.\u000a111. The invocation of the exception to the rule requiring that remedies under domestic law should be\u000aexhausted provided for in Article 56(5) must invariably be linked to the determination of possible violations\u000aof certain rights enshrined in the African Charter, such as the right to a fair trial enshrined under Article 7 of\u000athe African Charter.19 The exception to the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies would therefore\u000aapply where the domestic situation of the State does not afford due process of law for the protection of the\u000aright or rights that have allegedly been violated.\u000a112. In the present Communication, this seems to be the case. The victims cannot access the courts to\u000aclaim protection of their rights, either because they have been displaced or because they are being\u000aharassed, intimidated and persecute, the prevalence of violence in the region makes any attempt at\u000aexhausting local remedies by the victims an affront to common sense, good conscience and justice.\u000a113. Another rationale for the exhaustion requirement is that a government should have notice of human\u000arights violation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation, before being called to account by\u000aan international tribunal. The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State has had ample\u000atime and notice of the alleged violation to at least create conducive environment for the enjoyment of the\u000arights of the victims. If it is shown that the State has had ample notice and time within which to remedy the\u000asituation, as is the case with the present Communication, the State may be said to have been properly\u000ainformed and expected to have taken appropriate steps to remedy the violations alleged.\u000a114. On the claim that the Communication has been settled by UN mechanisms, the African Commission\u000awishes to state that a matter is settled within the context of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter if it has been\u000adealt with by any of the human rights treaty bodies or the Charter bodies of the United Nations system.\u000a115. The UN treaty bodies include bodies created under international human rights treaties. They presently\u000ainclude inter alia the Human Rights Committee (HRC), the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural\u000aRights (CESCR), the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CBRD), the Committee on the\u000aElimination of Discrimination Against Women (CBDAW), the Committee Against Torture (CAT), the\u000aCommittee on the Rights of the Child (CRC)and the Committee on Migrant Workers (CMW).\u000a116. The Charter bodies are those created under the UN Charter and include the Human Rights Council\u000a(HRC), Special procedures of the Human Rights Council, in particular, the 1503 procedure20 and the\u000aSub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.\u000a117. To be settled also requires that the treaty or Charter body dealing with the matter has taken a decision\u000awhich addresses the concerns, including the relief being sought by the Complainant. It is not enough for the\u000amatter to simply be discussed by these bodies. In the opinion of this Commission, the present\u000aCommunication was never submitted to any of these bodies, either by the present Complainant or any\u000aother individual or institution. The general human rights situation in the region was rather discussed by the\u000aUN Security Council following reports from different agencies of the UN itself. None of these bodies\u000aspecifically dealt with, or was intended to deal with the allegations raised in the present Communication and\u000ait can thus not be said that the matter has been dealt with or settled as required under Article 56 (7) of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a118. The African Commission agrees with the Respondent State's argument that the Complainants'\u000aargument relating to Ethiopia's protection of political groups from genocide is irrelevant to the present issue\u000aof admissibility. In same vein, the Commission notes that the Respondent State's argument relating to the\u000anature of the remedy sought by the complainants .is irrelevant to the present issue of admissibility, and\u000aprematurely raised at this stage. The Commission cannot therefore pronounce upon it at the present stage,\u000aand notes that the proceeding on the merits would thus place the Commission in a better position to make\u000aa finding in this regard.\u000a119. Finally, in respect of the Respondent State's submission that the present Communication does not\u000aconform with the procedures in the African Charter, as it was done by way of a mere letter of appeal sent to\u000a11\u000a\u000athe (then) Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa. The African Commission\u000anotes that while Article 47 of the African Charter and Rule 88 of its old Rules of Procedure, which relate\u000aonly to Inter-State Communications, prescribe that Communications should be submitted in written form,\u000aand addressed to the Secretary General of the OAU (now Chairperson of the AU Commission) and the\u000aChairperson of the African Commission; there is no provision either in the Charter or its Rules of Procedure\u000arelating to the prescribed form for Non-State/Individual Communications.\u000a120. The Commission further notes that Article 56 of the Charter has an exhaustive list of admissibility\u000arequirements, which do not include the form of the Communication or the manner in which it was received.\u000aThe Commission therefore holds that the prescribed (and not authorised) form for submission of\u000aCommunications is not a prerequisite for the admissibility of communications, and is extraneous to the\u000apresent issue before the Commission. More so, the present Communication was brought in written form,\u000aalbeit addressed to a Commissioner of the African Commission, and the then Special Rapporteur on\u000aPrisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa. A letter to a visiting Special Rapporteur Prisons and\u000aConditions of Detention in Africa seemed to have been the most practicable and reliable means for the\u000aComplainants to bring the plight of the victims to the African Commission.\u000a121. For these reasons, the African Commission declares this Communication Admissible.\u000a\u000aTHE MERITS\u000aCOMPLAINANTS' SUBMISSIONS ON THE MERITS\u000a\u000aClarifications Submitted by the Complainants\u000a122. Since the submission of their brief on Admissibility the Complainants have informed the African\u000aCommission that they are making some substantial amendments and clarifications to their initial\u000asubmissions.\u000a123. It says that in paragraph two of the brief on Admissibility it had alleged violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 5,\u000a6, 7(1 )(a), (b), (c), (d), 7(2), 25 and 26 of the African Charter and the right to privacy guaranteed under the\u000ainternational conventions to which the Respondent State is a party to. It states that in spite of its efforts and\u000athe fact that the violations appear very probable, it has not been able to get evidence to support some of\u000athe alleged violations. It has therefore decided to drop its previous Claim that Articles 3, 5, 6 and 7(2) are\u000aviolated for lack of evidence. It states that it will only argue violations of Articles 1, 2, 7 (1) (b)(d) of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a124. The Complainants further state that Paragraph four of its brief on Admissibility stated that the victims\u000awere detained on account of collective responsibility for policies or abuses by the Dergue regime rather\u000athan on account of individual responsibility for particular criminal offences. In addition paragraph 13 stated\u000athat the 106 detainees were collectively charged under one file, and have been defending their case\u000acollectively and that the procedure of collective trial has made it difficult to individualize guilt, or to prove/\u000arebut individual's innocence and guilt.\u000a125. The Complainants say that they wish to qualify the above statement to the effect that although there\u000awas joinder, the charges, the conviction and the sentences are individualized. They argue that the trial of all\u000athose who have been alleged to have committed crimes during the era of the former Government were not\u000aconducted in a single case or in a single venue.21 Rather, there have been several trials going on at\u000adifferent locations throughout the country both at the Federal High Court divisions and Supreme Courts of\u000athe regional states of the Ethiopian Federation.\u000a126. They also state that from the former Dergue Officials accused jointly, for example, one defendant was\u000aacquitted, while others were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from 23 years to\u000alife. They state that the Victims were able to present separate arguments of their own and so they are\u000aaccordingly clarifying their previous submissions. It nevertheless argues that the joinder of the trials has\u000aimmensely contributed to the undue delay in the trial of the former Dergue Officials.\u000a127. The Complainants also informs the African Commission that paragraph nine of its brief on\u000aAdmissibility indicates that the proceedings are yet to come to a conclusion fifteen years after the detention\u000aof the Complainants and twelve years after the commencement of the proceedings. They state that the\u000astatement was true over a year ago, however, some developments have taken place subsequently. They\u000astate that on 12 December 2006, the Ethiopian Federal High Court convicted many of the victims, among\u000a12\u000a\u000aothers, on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. They also state that on 11 January 2007\u000aprison sentences ranging from 23 years to life imprisonment were passed, while some of the convicted\u000apersons were sentenced to death. They also inform the African Commission that the SPO has since filed\u000aan appeal to the Federal Supreme Court demanding capital punishment for many of the 55 sentenced to\u000alife imprisonment. Some of the convicted persons have also appealed while others are expected to file\u000across appeals. Therefore the trials, at least for some of the 55 victims, are yet to be completed.\u000a128. The Complainants also stated that the major violations argued, hereunder, relate to prolonged pre-trial\u000adetention and trials lasting for more than 12 years, thus resulting in violations of the Complainants' right to\u000afair trial.22 Thus article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights is the main legal basis on\u000awhich it anchors its argument. They also state that in recognition of Article 60 of the African Charter by\u000awhich the African Commission is empowered to draw inspiration from other international instruments for the\u000aprotection of human and peoples' rights, they are drawing the attention of the African Commission to Article\u000a14\u000a× 1. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge\u000aagainst him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public\u000ahearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public\u000amay be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national\u000asecurity in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the\u000aextent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice\u000athe interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made\u000apublic except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern\u000amatrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.\u000a2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty\u000aaccording to law.\u000a3. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following\u000aminimum guarantees, in full equality: (a) To be informed promptly and in detail in a language which he\u000aunderstands of the nature and cause of the charge against him;\u000a(b) To have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and to communicate with counsel\u000aof his own choosing;\u000a(c) To be tried without undue delay;\u000a(d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own\u000achoosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance\u000aassigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any\u000asuch case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it;\u000a(e) To examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and\u000aexamination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;\u000a(f) To have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in\u000acourt;\u000a(g) Not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.\u000a4.

When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when subsequently his\u000aconviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact\u000a13\u000a\u000ashows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment\u000aas a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the\u000anon-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him.\u000a7. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally\u000aconvicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.\u000aof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Article 8\u000a× Article 8. Right to a Fair Trial\u000a1.

Every person accused of a criminal offense has the right to be presumed innocent so long as his guilt\u000ahas not been proven according to law. During the proceedings, every person is entitled, with full equality, to\u000athe following minimum guarantees:\u000aa. the right of the accused to be assisted without charge by a translator or interpreter, if he does not\u000aunderstand or does not speak the language of the tribunal or court;\u000ab. prior notification in detail to the accused of the charges against him;\u000ac. adequate time and means for the preparation of his defense;\u000ad. the right of the accused to defend himself personally or to be assisted by legal counsel of his own\u000achoosing, and to communicate freely and privately with his counsel;\u000ae. the inalienable right to be assisted by counsel provided by the state, paid or not as the domestic law\u000aprovides, if the accused does not defend himself personally or engage his own counsel within the time\u000aperiod established by law;\u000af. the right of the defense to examine witnesses present in the court and to obtain the appearance, as\u000awitnesses, of experts or other persons who may throw light on the facts;\u000ag. the right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself or to plead guilty; and\u000ah. the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court.\u000a3. A confession of guilt by the accused shall be valid only if it is made without coercion of any kind.\u000a4. An accused person acquitted by a nonappealable judgment shall not be subjected to a new trial for the\u000asame cause.\u000a5. Criminal proceedings shall be public, except insofar as may be necessary to protect the interests of\u000ajustice.\u000aof the American Convention on Human Rights (American Convention) and Article 6\u000a× Right to a fair trial\u000a1.

Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from\u000aall or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society,\u000awhere the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent\u000astrictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the\u000ainterests of justice.\u000a14\u000a\u000a2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to\u000alaw.\u000a3.

In additional they draw the attention of the African Commission to, among others, the Guidelines on\u000athe Role of Prosecutors, the Basic Principles of the Role Lawyers and the Statutes of the International\u000aCriminal Court and the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 1 and 2 of the African Charter\u000a130. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State failure to recognize the rights of the former\u000aDergue officials enshrined in the African Charter violates Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter. They argue\u000athat States Parties to the Charter are obliged not only to recognize the rights, duties and freedoms\u000aenshrined in it but also undertake to adopt legislative and other measures to give effect to them. States are\u000aalso required to ensure that these rights are available to all without discrimination. The Complainants\u000asubmit that where a State neglects to protect the rights in the Charter, this can constitute a violation of\u000aArticle 1, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause of the violation.\u000a131. The Complainants further submit that by failing to respect the Victims right to a fair and speedy trial\u000aguaranteed in Article 7 of the African Charter, the Respondent State is similarly in violation of Articles 1 and\u000a2 of the Charter as a violation.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 7(1 )(b) - right to have ones cause heard\u000a\u000aArticle 7(l)(b) of the African Charter states:\u000a(b) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\u000a132. The Complainants argue the Respondent State has violated the rights of the former Dergue officials to\u000abe presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal.The Complainants state that the\u000apresumption of innocence is universally recognized23 and proclaimed by all major legal systems of the\u000aworld.24 They stated that the Respondent State violated the right to be presumed innocent enshrined in\u000aArticle 7 (1)(b) of the Charter in following ways: a. Proclamation No. 22/1992 which provides for the\u000aestablishment of the special prosecutor's office violates the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in\u000aArticle 7 (1) (b) of the African Charter. Proclamation No. 22/1992 provides, inter alia, as follows:\u000aWHEREAS the people of Ethiopia have been deprived of their personal human and political rights and\u000asubject to gross oppression under the yoke of the fascistic rules of the Dergue-WPE regime for the last\u000aseventeen years;\u000aWHEREAS heinous and horrendous criminals which occupy a special chapter in the history of the of the\u000apeople of Ethiopia have been perpetrated against the people of Ethiopia by official, members and\u000aauxiliaries of the security and armed forces of the Dergue-WPE regime;\u000aWHEREAS officials and auxiliaries of the Dergue-WPE dictatorial regime impoverished the economy of the\u000aCountry by plundering illegally confiscating and destroying the property of the people as well\u000amisappropriating public and state property;\u000a\u000a15\u000a\u000aWHEREAS it is the interest of a just historical obligation to record for posterity the brutal offences the\u000aembezzlement of property perpetrated against the people of Ethiopia and to educate the people and make\u000athem aware of those offences in order to prevent the recurrence of such a system of government.\u000a133. The Complainants argues that it is clear from this Proclamation that even before the Victims were\u000abrought to court, they were branded criminals by the Proclamation. Thus, it argues, in the eyes of the\u000aTransitioned Government, the Victims had subjected Ethiopians to gross oppression under the yoke of a\u000afascistic rule; they had perpetrated 'brutal', 'heinous' 'horrendous' crimes which occupy a special chapter in\u000aEthiopia's history, they had impoverished the Ethiopian economy through illegal plundering, destruction and\u000amisappropriation of public property.\u000a134. It argues that the Proclamation looks more like a legislative sentence which only short of declaring the\u000aVictims guilty even before they were charged. It avers that legislation is conceived as a system of rules with\u000aa generality of application for the regulation of the life and activities of the community as a whole and\u000asingling out a person for individualized treatment by legislation may not only be arbitrary and discriminatory,\u000ait can lead itself to oppression, favoritism or other kinds of abuse.\u000a135. They further aver that in the performance of their duties, the Special Prosecutor and his official are\u000aexpected to be impartial and to protect the public interest with objectivity, take proper account-of the\u000aposition of the suspect and the victim, and pay attention to all relevant circumstances, irrespective of\u000awhether they are to the advantage or disadvantage of the suspect.25 However, they aver that, from the way\u000athe law setting up the Special Prosecutor's Office was couched, this was not the role envisaged for the\u000aOffice of the Special Prosecutor. They state that the Proclamation made the Special Prosecutor more of a\u000a"persecutor" than "prosecutor" and that it was obvious based on the Proclamation that the Special\u000aProsecutor began the prosecution and investigation of the cases against the complainants on the basis that\u000athey were already guilty and needed to prove their innocence.\u000ab. statements made by the Respondent State officials during and after the trial of the Victims violate the\u000aviolates the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter.\u000a136. The Complainants state that Dergue officials were treated as if they were guilty of the offences with\u000awhich they were charged even before their guilt was established by a competent court. They argue that\u000astatements from, the Respondent State at the pre-trial and trial period clearly demonstrate the\u000agovernment's hostility and bias towards the Victims.\u000a137. The Complainants state that while the SPO gathered evidence and the Respondent State trained and\u000aappointed judges, the former Dergue Officials were subjected to 'massive media propaganda and untold\u000adefamation by top government officials and their cadres'.26 They state that the SPO repeatedly appealed to\u000athe public through the Government media and promise to pay compensation, house rent and jobs to people\u000awho were willing to testify against the former Dergue Officials. It states that workshops and mass\u000ademonstrations were organized and red-terror - victims committees set up to help in gathering evidence\u000aagainst the former Dergue Officials. They say that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi also repeatedly stated that\u000ahaving the former Dergue Officials punished was part and parcel of their armed struggle and that whatever\u000athese officials did in hours of darkness 'would be retaliated through the courts and in the manner he so\u000adesires in broad daylight'\u000a138. The Complainant also state that talking to the New York Times about the activities of the Dergue\u000aregime, the Special Prosecutor Girma Wakjira stated that "it was not simply eliminating your enemy, it was\u000ashowing savagery at its utmost." 27 They stated that the hostility and bias continued even after trial and in a\u000aletter addressed to the Minster External Affairs, the Special Prosecutor stated; "The genocide started as\u000asoon as the Derg [sic] came to power and only stopped in May 1991, when the Derg [sic] was military (sic)\u000adefeated and removed from power.28\u000a139. Quoting the Respondent State submissions on the Merit, they observe that its own submissions\u000adisclose that: "All these unlawful acts were committed in violation of the existing domestic laws of the\u000acountry and relevant international obligations of Ethiopia, These heinous criminal acts were committed in\u000aextremely sophisticated and covert circumstances. What makes the Dergue very unique is that it continued\u000aits atrocious acts up to its overthrow in May 1991."29\u000a140. It says that the Respondent State's brief goes on to outline the 'grave human rights violations',\u000a'multitude of crimes committed against humanity', 'heinous criminal acts', 'heinous crimes of genocide and\u000acrimes against humanity' committed all over Ethiopia by the Dergue regime.\u000a141. The Respondent State argues that faced with such 'heinous' and 'grave??? 'crimes against humanity'\u000aand genocide, the Respondent State took it for granted that the Victims were guilty and even portrayed\u000a16\u000a\u000athem as 'criminals' even before they were tried. They further argue that the officials of Respondent State\u000adid not conceal their bias against the victims and the Special Prosecutor and his officials saw their task as\u000aprosecuting criminals thereby violating the principle on presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 7 (1)\u000a(d) of the Charter. They aver that the Dergue Trials looked more as revenge when "the ultimate\u000adesideratum should be to engrave the rule of law into the social fabric of Ethiopian society".30\u000ac. Excessive long preventive detention or pre-trial imprisonment is a violation the right to be presumed\u000ainnocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000a142. The Complainants submit that the procedure adopted by the Respondent State in bringing the\u000aaccused persons to justice failed to assign blame within a reasonable length of time. The Complainants\u000aargue that the Victims were detained for three years before their trial finally started in 1994. They state that\u000athe trial dragged on for more than thirteen years before a final judgment was reached in 2007. It avers that\u000apre-trail detention of the Victims and their long continuous detention even after they were charged\u000aessentially meant substituting pre-trial detention for their punishment. They state that their long preventive\u000acustody thus lost its purpose as an instrument to serve the interests of sound administration of justice. They\u000aalso argues that the prolonged imprisonment without conviction of the Victims for a period of about 16\u000ayears clearly violates their right to be presumed innocent in that it was meant as a sanction prior to the\u000adelivery of the judgment. The Complaint concludes that it is safe to say that the Victims were criminally\u000apunished by presuming their guilt even before they were heard, in violation of the principle of presumption\u000aof innocence established in Article 7 (1) (b) of the African Charter, Article XX of the Universal Declaration\u000aand rule XXX of the Principles and Guidelines on fair trial.31\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 7(1 )(d) - right to have ones cause heard\u000a\u000aArticle 7(1 )(d) of the African Charter states: (d) the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial\u000acourt or tribunal.\u000a143. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated the former Derg [sic] offcial's right to\u000aa fair trial by deliberately denying them the right to be tried by an impartial court within a reasonable time as\u000aenshrined in Article 7(d) of the African Charter.\u000a144. The right to an impartial hearing within a reasonable time is one of the cardinal elements the right to a\u000afair trial. The Article is specially designed to ensure that the charges which the penal procedure places on\u000athe individual are not unremittingly protracted and do not produce permanent harm. An individual who is\u000aaccused and held in custody is entitled to have his or her case resolved on a priority basis and conducted\u000awith diligence.\u000a145. With regards to the Dergue trials, the Complainants submit that even though several causes have\u000abeen attributed for delays in the trials, none of these causes are attributable to the former Dergue Officials.\u000aThe Complainant state that the delay in rendering a judgment was therefore not due either to negligence or\u000alack of interest on the part of the Victims rather, to the inactivity and failure of the State to proceed with the\u000acases against the complainants with the diligence required and without due delay. They aver that the\u000aDergue officials, had their rights violated for several years and the Respondent State failed to put failed to\u000aput in place the necessary structures for them to be tried expeditiously. They state that the causes for the\u000adelay include the following:\u000a\u000aa. Dismantling of the Ethiopian Court system by the Government\u000ab. ambitious nature of the transitional justice Ethiopia pursued\u000ac. absence of appropriate legal checkpoints\u000ad. joinder of cases and accused persons\u000ae. the charges were not clear and specific which hampered their speedy trial\u000a\u000a17\u000a\u000af. other causes of delays in the Dergue trials Dismantling of the Ethiopian Court system by the Government\u000a146. The Complainants state that immediately upon seizing power, the new Respondent State dismantled\u000aalmost all state institutions, including the court system, by summarily dismissing close to 300 judges on the\u000aalleged ground that tip judiciary had been an ally to the Dergue regime. Consequently they aver\u000aRespondent State could not afford a speedy trial to the Dergue official due to shortage of judges. It argues\u000athat there were many instances where cases were adjourned for lack of quorum of judges.\u000a147. The Complainants aver that at the beginning, the Special First Bench of the Federal High Court,\u000acomposed of three Judges, was exclusively dealing with the trial of the Dergue officials. However, from the\u000ayear 2001 there to the end of the trial date, it has been additionally charged with the equally complicated\u000aand numerous anticorruption cases, thereby reducing significantly the amount of time the Bench could\u000adevote to the Dergue officials' trials. This additional assignment, it argues, was given to the Bench when\u000athe judicial authorities were fully aware of the fact that the Bench was exclusively constituted for the trial of\u000athe Dergue officials and that their trials have not been concluded ages after they were charged.\u000aAmbitious Nature of the Transitional Justice Ethiopia Pursued\u000a148. The complainants aver that another cause is the ambitious nature of the model of transitional justice\u000aEthiopia pursued. The SPO was established with two mandates: (1) to establish for public knowledge and\u000afor posterity a historical record of the abuses of the Mengistu regime and (2) to bring those criminally\u000aresponsible for human rights violations and/or corruption to justice.32 They say from these two it was very\u000aclear that the SPO gave more attention and priority to its first mandate.33\u000a149. By the opening of the trials in December 1994, the SPO had gathered. 309,215 pages of relevant\u000agovernment documents, many with clear signatures of high ranking officials.34 They state that in addition to\u000athis kind of documentation, forensic teams continued searching for and exhuming dozens of mass graves\u000awhich allegedly contained the bodies of murdered civilians. They said that the SPO stated in February 1994\u000athat it had "tens [sic] times more evidence than needed to successfully prosecute several of the detained\u000aand many of the exiles for serious criminal offenses." By August 1998, the Complainants allege, the SPO\u000apresented five hundred prosecution witnesses and warned that he had another five hundred to go. The\u000aComplainants argue that the SPO, therefore, insisted on and indeed introduced thousands of witnesses\u000awhile a smaller number could establish and prove the charges against the former Dergue Officials. They\u000aargue that with such extensive documentary evidence, one thousand prosecution witnesses is excessive\u000aand unduly infringes upon the right of the accused to a fair and speedy trial. They aver that the SPO did not\u000ahave to wait until it gathered 'ten times' more evidence to try the complainants bearing in mind the fact that\u000athey remained in detention throughout the investigation and trial of their cases.\u000aAbsence of Appropriate Legal Checkpoints\u000a150. The Complainants stated that the absence of appropriate legal checkpoints that could force the\u000aRespondent State to diligently and expeditiously work to investigate, charge and conduct trials also\u000acontributed to the delay. The states that the right to petition for writ of habeas corpus, for example, was not\u000aavailable to many of the victims and the statute of limitation with regard to the crimes the victims were\u000aalleged to have committed was removed.35\u000aJoinder of Cases and Accused Persons\u000a151. The Complainants state that Articles 116 and 117 of the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code provide\u000afor joinder of charges and accused persons. They state that even through joinder per se is permissible,\u000awhere there is conflict of interest that may cause serious prejudice to the accused or to the interest of\u000ajustice, which is the case with the Dergue trial, the court should order separate trials. They aver, for\u000ainstance, that if the joinder of accused persons would cause undue delay to the trials of others, the court\u000ashould not permit joinder and, if any, it should order for separate trials. They argue that in the Dergue\u000aTrials, the SPO brought cases joining several accused and counts together. They state that more than\u000aseventy accused persons were charged with numerous counts. They argue that one could find one\u000aaccused charged with only one count while another accused in the same file charged with many counts.\u000a152. The Complainants also state that the Dergue trials were also delayed because of the problem of\u000ajoinder of cases, especially when it came to the hearing of witnesses. They state that where an accused\u000aperson who was jointly charged with others was absent for various reasons, the other co-accused persons\u000awould have no option but to wait for his return because that accused person had the right to be tried in his\u000apresence and to cross-examine witnesses called in his case. They also state that where an accused who\u000a18\u000a\u000awas jointly charged with the other accused persons was tried other accused persons was tried in absentia,\u000athe other accused persons were also obliged to wait until all the evidence was concluded, including the\u000aevidence adduced against accused person(s) tried in abstentia. They argue that these situations led to\u000aperiodic adjournments of the case and thereby caused delays for the rest of the accused persons. The\u000aComplainants argue that the Dergue trials were, therefore, unduly delayed mainly because of the numerous\u000aadjournments occasioned by the joinder of the accused persons and the cases against them. They state\u000athat a large number of charges were unnecessary to secure a conviction because it created unnecessary\u000adelay in processing those defendants as well as those waiting for trial.\u000aThe charges were not Clear and Specific which Hampered their Speedy Trial\u000a153. The Complainants state that the charges filed against the Dergue officials were not clear and specific\u000aand this hampered their speedy trial. In many respects, the indictments were not as clear and succinct as\u000athey needed to be for the accused to understand them. They state that this is a defect that goes to the form\u000aof the indictment and a violation of Article 111 and 112 of the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code.36 It says\u000athat Jpg SPO, for example, filed charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes against\u000athe former high-level Dergue Officials.\u000a154. The Complainants say that the accused were held for the murder of 1,823 persons, causing grave\u000abodily injury to ninety-nine persons and the disappearance of 194 individuals. The Complainants say that\u000athe original Ethiopian indictments written in Amharic were more than two hundred pages long and alleged\u000a211 criminal counts. They state that according to the indictment, persons who allegedly committed\u000a"offenses" cited in the Proclamation were charged with violations of Articles 281 and 286 of the Ethiopian\u000aPenal Code, which provides for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, and incitement to genocide\u000aand crimes against humanity. They further state that in the alternative, the defendants were charged with\u000aaggravated homicide under Article 522 of the Ethiopian Penal Code, grave willful injury under Article 538,\u000aabuse of power under Article 414 and unlawful arrest or detention under Article 416. It states that the\u000aindictments further accused the defendants of establishing themselves as a provisional military council or\u000agovernment and setting up committees and sub-committees for the purpose of committing genocide and\u000acrimes against humanity against various political groups whom the accused referred to as "anti-people" and\u000a"counter-revolutionary" in violation of Article 32 and 281 of the Penal Code of Ethiopia.\u000a155. The Complainants further state that the indictments alleged that the defendants incited and\u000aencouraged people to massacre thousands of members of different political groups in violation of Articles\u000a32(l)(a) and 286(a) of the Penal Code. They argue that the fundamental problem with these indictments\u000awas that the details of the crimes were unclear because several concepts and legal doctrines were lumped\u000atogether in one very long sentence.\u000aOther Causes of Delays in the Dergue Trials\u000a156. The Complainants state apart from the above, there were other factors which caused the delays.\u000aFirstly, there was a delay by the Respondent State to decide how to handle the matter. They argue that the\u000aRespondent State made its decision to take the matter through the legal machinery after having arrested\u000athe former government officials for more than one year. When the Special Prosecutors Office was\u000aestablished, they say, some ex-officials had been jailed for 18 months without charges, taking almost five\u000ayears for the prosecution finally to come up with a charge of genocide against the majority of the\u000adefendants. They say that even after the opening of the case against the Victims before the court there\u000awere still some problems associated with the prosecution. It also states that the failure of the prosecution to\u000apresent evidence on time was the major problem. They aver that though the prosecutor gathered the\u000anecessary exhibits and they are found in its control, it was common to see the Prosecutor asking the court\u000afor additional adjournment to present them.\u000a157. They submit that the Respondent State should be found liable for violating Article 7 (1) (d) of the\u000aCharter in the absence of evidence from it attributing the delay to the negligence or lack of interest of the\u000acomplainants. They note that since the conduct of the Dergue officials has not contributed to slowing down\u000athe proceedings, the delay in the proceedings can be only attributed to the Respondent State, they argue\u000athat the long and unnecessary delay in the Dergue Trials was occasioned by the inactivity and failure of the\u000aRespondent State to proceed with the trials with the diligence required and without undue delay.\u000a158. They conclude that the Victims were entitled to have their case decided expeditiously and with priority\u000aby the national authorities. They urge the African Commission to find for the Victims that the length of time\u000afor which they had been held in custody pending trial and the number of years it took for the trial court to\u000a19\u000a\u000acome up with a judgment on the merits to be excessive and unreasonable in the light of the Respondent\u000aState's constitutional principles and international commitments. This they say is in line with national and\u000ainternational jurisprudence, including that of the African Commission, on the matter.\u000aRespondent State's Submissions on the Merits\u000a\u000a159. The Respondent State for its part argues that local remedies are yet to be exhausted. It argues that\u000athe Complainants have not yet completed the local remedies available to them and therefore submit that it\u000ais sufficient ground for dismissing the Communication.\u000a160. The Respondent State further alleges that there is no conflict between the Penal Code of Ethiopia and\u000athe International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It argues that\u000athe Complainant have made a lengthy argument regarding a conflict between Article 281 of me Penal Code\u000aof Ethiopia and the 1948 International Convention on the Prevention and Punishments of Crimes of\u000aGenocide to which Ethiopia is party and argue that their acts would not constitute a criminal act.\u000a161. The Respondent State further argues that firstly, the Complainants were wrong in arguing that political\u000acrimes should be seen as out of the purview of the Conventions as the Conventions do not prohibit\u000aanywhere in its provisions the inclusion of broader definitions under national laws. It underlines the fact that\u000afrom the outset, the Penal Code was issued in 1957 well before the Dergue came to power and was not\u000atargeting any specific political or other group of Dergue Regime.\u000a162. Secondly, the Respondent State underlines the fact that the Dergue officials have not denied that they\u000ahave extra-judicially killed and harmed innocent civilians and that they were committing the crimes '\u000aviolation of the existing criminal law to stay in power. It is worth emphasizing, the Respondent stale\u000asubmits, that the Dergue amended the Penal Code in 1982 and issued a Special Penal Code through\u000aProclamation No.114/1982 and did not bother to amend this part of the Penal Code including the provision\u000athey are contesting hereunder. The Respondent State explains that the Dergue were applying the Penal\u000aCode in Ethiopia until the downfall of their regime and contested its application when it was found that it\u000acame to regulate their past criminal activities.\u000a163. Thirdly the Respondent State argues that the Federal High Court had rejected, with the appropriate\u000alegal reasoning, when the Complainants raised the Penal Code in their preliminary objections during the\u000atrial and finally, the Respondent State argue that even if one could allege that there could be a conflict\u000abetween the Penal Code and the Convention, this type of interpretation shall be the mandate of the House\u000aof Federation in accordance with Article 62(1) and 83(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Ethiopia.\u000aThus the Respondent State submits that the African Commission cannot replace national remedies\u000amechanism for local remedies and could not be regarded as a tribunal substituting national court.\u000a164.The Respondent State further argue that full judicial independence is guaranteed by domestic laws\u000aEthiopia as is provided for in Article 78 of the Constitution. It argues that in the Constitution further\u000aguarantees in Article 78(4) that special or ad hoc court which takes judicial powers away from the regular\u000acourts or institutions legally empowered to exercise judicial functions and which do not follow legally\u000aprescribed procedure shall not be established. The Constitution, the Respondent State submits, also\u000aguarantees in Article 79(2) and (3) that the courts from any level shall be free from interference by\u000agovernment or any other source and that the judges shall exercise their functions in full independence and\u000ashall be directed solely by law.\u000a165. The Respondent State says that every person in Ethiopia has the right to access impartial and\u000aindependent courts and judges having jurisdiction over any alleged infringements including violations of\u000ahuman rights. It further submits that the Complainants' submission regarding the partiality of Ethiopian\u000ajudiciary is unfounded and not substantiated by any evidence whatsoever.\u000a166. The Respondent State maintains that the African Commission should dismiss the Communication on\u000athe following grounds:\u000ao For lack of exhaustion of local remedies because the subject matter of the petition before the African\u000aCommission is still pending before a national court and entertaining it will interfere in the appeal and might\u000alead to contradictory findings with the Supreme Court;\u000ao The Communication lacks Locus Standi because the Communication does not have a legal basis;\u000ao The allegation that elimination of political groups that was perpetrated all over the country on a\u000a20\u000a\u000alarge-scale does not constitute genocide, fails to pass the criteria for criminal act constituting genocide and\u000athat the line of argument of the Complainants concerning the inconsistency between the Penal Code of\u000aEthiopia and the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishments of the Crime of Genocide\u000adoes not hold water. According to the Respondent State, if there arises a conflict, the matter should be\u000areferred to the House of Federation in accordance with the Constitution of Ethiopia;\u000ao It mentions the African Commission's Communication Procedure which clearly stipulates that a\u000aCommunication which does not illustrate prima facie violations of the African Charter by invoking specific\u000aprovisions of the Charter shall not be examined. In this regard the Respondent State underscores that a\u000anumber of Communications presented to the African Commission were rejected because Communications,\u000awhile they cited provisions in the UN texts failed to make any reference to the provisions of the African\u000aCharter.37\u000a167. The Respondent State also refer to the African Commission's Guidelines on Submitting\u000aCommunications, where applicants are expected to indicate the courts where they sought domestic\u000aremedies and must attach judgments, writs of habeas corpus and other relevant documents. They submit\u000athat the Complainants have not attached any such evidences and documents and therefore their\u000aapplication fails to comply with the Guidelines for Communication to the African Commission.\u000a168. Finally the Respondent State argues that under paragraph 23 of the Complainants' letter to the\u000aChairperson of the African Commission, their prayer of relief makes it very clear that the Complainants do\u000anot see the African Commission as a source of their relief but are rather seeking the establishment of\u000aanother impartial independent investigative body, which is not within the mandate of the African\u000aCommission.\u000a169. The Respondent State therefore request the African Commission to dismiss Communication 301/05\u000aas unfounded for the foregoing reasons. The African Commission's Decision on the Merits.\u000a\u000aThe African Commission's Decision on the Merits\u000a170. The Complainants base their claims against the Respondent State on the violations of Articles 1, 2,\u000aand 7(l)(b)(d) of the African Charter.\u000a171. Alleged Violation of Article 1: Article 1 of the African Charter requires all the States Parties to the\u000aCharter to recognize the rights guaranteed therein and to adopt legislative and other measures to give\u000aeffect to these rights, duties and freedoms.\u000a172. Alleged Violation of Article 2: Article 2 of the African Charter further imposes a duty on States\u000aparties to the African Charter to ensure that every individual enjoys the rights and freedoms recognized and\u000aguaranteed in the Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, color, sex, language,\u000areligion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.\u000a173. The Complainants discuss two Articles together. They argue that the Respondent State's failure to\u000arecognize the rights of the former Dergue Officials enshrined in The African Charter violates Articles 1 and\u000a2 of the African Charter.\u000a174. The Complainants' argue that Article 1 gives the African Charter a legally binding character38 while\u000aArticle 2"abjures discrimination on the basis of any grounds set out, among them "language... national or\u000asocial origin... birth or other status..."39 it argues that States Parties to the African Charter are obliged not\u000aonly to recognize the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined in it and to undertake to adopt legislative and\u000aother measures to give effect to them, but also to ensure that these rights are available to all without\u000adiscrimination. Thus, by ratification, it argues, States are obligated to diligently undertake the harmonization\u000aof their legislation with the provisions of the Charter.40 Where a State neglects to protect the rights in the\u000aCharter, this can constitute a violation, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause of the\u000aviolation.41\u000a175. The Complainants state that the Respondent State ratified the African Charter on 15 June 1998 and is\u000aobligated to give effect to the rights guaranteed therein, without discrimination. They argue that as stated by\u000athe Commission in Purohit and Moore/The Gambia,42 'when a state ratifies the African Charter it is\u000aobligated to uphold the fundamental rights contained therein. Otherwise if the reverse were true, the\u000asignificance of ratifying a human rights treaty would be seriously defeated.'\u000a176. They argue that by failing to respect the Victim's right to a fair and speedy trial guaranteed in Article 7\u000aof the African Charter, the Respondent State is in violation of Article 1 and 2 of the African Charter. They\u000afurther state that a violation of any provision of the African Charter automatically means a violation of Article\u000a21\u000a\u000a1.43\u000a177. The African Commission notes that in its submission of the Merits, the Respondent State did not\u000aspecifically address the allegation made against it that it had violated Articles 1 and 2 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a178. According to the African Commission's long- standing practice, in cases of human rights violations, the\u000aburden of proof rests on the government (See, ACHPR/59/91, ACHPR/60/91, ACHPR/64/92, 68/92, 78/92,\u000aACHPR/87/ 93, ACHPR /101 / 93).44 If the government provides no evidence to contradict an allegation of\u000ahuman rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or at the least probable or\u000aplausible. On the information available, the Commission considers that there was a violation of Articles 1\u000aand 2 of the African Charter.\u000a179. To reiterate in the instant matter if the government provides no evidence to contradict an allegation of\u000ahuman rights violation made against it, the African Commission will take it as proven, or at the least\u000aprobable or plausible. This principle conforms with the practice of other international human rights\u000aadjudicatory bodies and the African Commission's duty to protect human rights. Since the Respondent\u000aState did not respond to the allegations, the African Commission must, regrettably, come to a conclusion\u000abased on the facts and opinions submitted by the Complainants.\u000aThe African Commission,\u000a180. Declares that the Respondent State has violated both Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 7(1 )(b) - right to have ones cause heard Article 7(1 )(b) of the African Charter\u000astates: (b) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\u000a181. The Complainants argue that Respondent State has violated the rights of the former Dergue officials\u000ato be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court. It argues that the presumption of\u000ainnocence is universally recognized45 and proclaimed by all major legal systems of the world.46 They state\u000athat the Respondent State violated the right to be presumed innocent enshrined in Article 7 (1) (b) of the\u000afollowing ways:\u000aa. Proclamation No. 22/1992 which provides for the establishment of the special prosecutors [sic] office\u000aviolates the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000ab. statements made by the Respondent State officials during and after the trial of the Victims violate the\u000aviolates [sic] the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000ac. Excessive long preventive detention or pre-trial imprisonment is a violation the the [sic] right to be\u000apresumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000aThe African Commission's Analysis on Article 7(1)(b)\u000a182. The Respondent State have not specifically addressed the allegation that Proclamation No. 22/1992\u000aviolated the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African charter.\u000a183. It merely stated that after the Dergue regime was overthrown in 1991, cases had to be instituted in ten\u000afederal and regional courts against 6000 defendants. It stated that the complexity of bringing all those\u000aresponsible for crimes committed during the Dergue regime would be a very daunting task. It stated that\u000ataking into account the voluminous nature of the cases, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia\u000aestablished an independent body known as the Special Prosecutor's Office on 8 August 1992 by\u000aProclamation No 22/1992 for the purpose of conducting prompt investigation and bringing to trial arrestees\u000aas well as those persons responsible for having committed offences and at large within and outside the\u000acountry.\u000a184. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, the African\u000aCommission reiterated that everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed\u000ainnocent until proved guilty according to law. The presumption of innocence, the African Commission\u000afurther stated, places the burden of proof during trial in any criminal case on the prosecution. In its\u000aResolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial (1992), the African Commission further recognised the\u000aessential elements of a fair hearing to include, among other things, that persons charged with a criminal\u000aoffence shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court.47\u000a\u000a22\u000a\u000a185. It is generally agreed that the presumption of innocence specifically entails that the person charged\u000awith a crime must be treated, within and outside criminal proceedings, as being innocent until proven guilty.\u000aAs guaranteed in the African Charter, the principle constructs a presumption in favor of an individual\u000aaccused of a crime according to which he or she is considered innocent until criminal responsibility is\u000aestablished in the case before the courts. In accordance with general opinion, which is also specifically\u000aconfirmed by the European Court on Human Rights, the presumption of innocence is available not only to\u000athe defendant in the strictest sense of the word but also to an accused person prior to the filing of a criminal\u000acharge. A person has this right 'until proved guilty according to law', i.e., until conviction becomes binding\u000afollowing final appeal.48 The presumption applies during the pre-trial investigations and should be\u000aconsidered even stronger with regard to a person against whom 'not even a prima facie case has been\u000aconfirmed'.49\u000a186. The African Commission agrees with the Complainants that the principle of the presumption of\u000ainnocence constitutes a fundamental principle which protects everybody against being treated by public\u000aofficials as if they were guilty of an offence even before such guilt is established by a competent court. It\u000aagrees that the Proclamation setting up the Special Prosecutor Office in itself clearly presumed the\u000acomplainants' guilt, thereby violating the principle of presumption of innocence. In Communication 224/98:\u000aMedia Rights Agenda v Nigeria, the African Commission agreed with the Complainant that that prior to the\u000asetting up of the tribunal, the military Government of Nigeria organised intense pre-trial publicity to\u000apersuade members of the public that a coup plot had occurred and that those arrested in connection with it\u000awere guilty of treason. The African Commission agreed further that any possible claim to national security\u000ain excluding members of the public and tire press from the actual trial by the tribunal cannot be justified,\u000aand therefore in breach of the right to fair trial, particularly, the right to presumption of innocence.\u000a187. As in the case of Communication 224/98: Media Rights Agenda v Nigeria, in the instant matter the\u000aRespondent State has not really contested the veracity of the Complainant's allegation. In this\u000acircumstance, the African Commission is obliged to accept this as the he Respondent State in violation of\u000aArticle 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000a188. Again, the Respondent State have not specifically addressed the allegation that Proclamation No\u000a22/1992 violated the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter.\u000aStatements made by the Respondent State officials during and after the trial of the victims violate the\u000aviolates [sic] the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter. The\u000aRespondent State has not specifically addressed the allegation in the Proclamation.\u000a189. The Respondent State have not addressed the allegation that statements made by the Respondent\u000aState officials during and after the trial of the Victims violate the violates [sic] the right to be presumed\u000ainnocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000a190. The presumption of innocence implies a right to be treated in accordance with this principle. In Civil\u000aLiberties Organisation, Legal Defence Centre, Legal Defence and Assistance Project v Nigeria the African\u000aCommission stated that the principle of the presumption of innocence constituted a fundamental principle,\u000awhich protects everybody against being treated by public officials as if they were guilty of an offence even\u000abefore such guilt is established by a competent court.50 By reason of the presumption of innocence, the\u000aburden of proof of the charge is on the prosecution and the accused has the benefit of the doubt. No guilt\u000ashould be presumed until a charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is, therefore, a duty for all\u000apublic authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial. The African Commission has found a\u000aviolation of the right to be presumed innocent based on a State's negative pre-trial publicity. In the above\u000amentioned case of Media Rights Agenda/Nigeria, the African Commission agreed with the Complainant that\u000aadverse negative publicity violated the defendants' rights to fair trial.\u000a191. In Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman/ Sudan51 , the African Commission again examined the right to\u000apresumption of innocence. Here, the complainant alleged that high-ranking government officials and\u000ainvestigators had publicly asserted the defendants' guilt. Furthermore, it was alleged that\u000agovernment-orchestrated publicity stated that the defendants were behind a coup attempt against the state.\u000aSudan did not conceal its bias against the defendants showing 'open hostility towards the victims by\u000adeclaring that 'those responsible for the bombings' will be executed'. Because Sudan had publicly\u000apre-judged the defendants before a proper court had established their guilt, the African Commission found\u000athat the State had violated the right to be presumed innocent under Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000a192. This position of the African Commission is further reinforced by its Principles and Guidelines on the\u000aRight to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, where it stated that: 'Public officials shall maintain a\u000apresumption of innocence. Public officials, including prosecutors, may inform the public about criminal\u000a23\u000a\u000ainvestigations or charges, but shall not express a view as to the guilt of any suspect'. The African\u000aCommission agrees with the Complainant that the Dergue officials were treated as if they were guilty of the\u000aoffences with which they were charged even before their guilt was established by a competent court. It\u000aagrees that statements by the Respondent State at the pre-trial and trial period clearly demonstrate the\u000agovernment's hostility and bias towards the Victims.\u000a193. In its General Comment on Article 14, the Human Rights Committee stressed the duty of all public\u000aauthorities to 'refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial'.52 In particular, the Committee held that\u000aministers or other influential government officials may, in this respect commit a violation of Article 14 (2)\u000a× Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty\u000aaccording to law.\u000aof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the case of excessive 'media justice' or tire\u000adanger of impermissible influencing of lay or professional judges by other powerful social groups, one also\u000ahas to assume that the State is under a corresponding positive duty to ensure the presumption of\u000ainnocence.53 Similarly, in the Inter-American case of Juan Humberto Sanchez vs. Honduras54 , it was held\u000athat the right of the victim to presumption of innocence, set forth in Article 8(2)\u000a× 2. Every person accused of a criminal offense has the right to be presumed innocent so long as his guilt\u000ahas not been proven according to law. During the proceedings, every person is entitled, with full equality, to\u000athe following minimum guarantees:\u000aa. the right of the accused to be assisted without charge by a translator or interpreter, if he does not\u000aunderstand or does not speak the language of the tribunal or court;\u000ab. prior notification in detail to the accused of the charges against him;\u000ac. adequate time and means for the preparation of his defense;\u000ad. the right of the accused to defend himself personally or to be assisted by legal counsel of his own\u000achoosing, and to communicate freely and privately with his counsel;\u000ae. the inalienable right to be assisted by counsel provided by the state, paid or not as the domestic law\u000aprovides, if the accused does not defend himself personally or engage his own counsel within the time\u000aperiod established by law;\u000af. the right of the defense to examine witnesses present in the court and to obtain the appearance, as\u000awitnesses, of experts or other persons who may throw light on the facts;\u000ag. the right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself or to plead guilty; and\u000ah. the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court.\u000aof the American Convention, was breached, as the head of the armed forces repeatedly referred to the\u000avictim as "noticing other than a criminal."\u000a194. The African Commission agrees with the existence of a growing suspicion of a person in the course of\u000athe criminal proceeding is not per se contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence. Neither is the\u000afact that such mounting suspicion justifies the adoption of safeguard--such as pre-trial incarceration--in\u000aregard to the suspect's person. However, these must be implemented with the 'discretion and\u000acircumspection necessary to respect the presumption of innocence'. As stated by the African Commission\u000ain its 'Principles and Guidelines on the Right to fair and Legal Assistance in Africa', public officials, are\u000aallowed to inform the public about criminal investigations or charges, but shall not express a view as to the\u000aguilt of any suspect. 55\u000a195. In the instant matter the Respondent State has again not contested the veracity of the Complainant's\u000aallegation. The African Commission is thus obliged to accept this as the facts of the case and therefore\u000afinds Respondent State in violation of Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter.\u000a196. Unlike the above two strands of how article 7(b) had been violated, the Respondent State attempted to\u000aaddress the allegation of excessive long prevention detention or pre-trial imprisonment.\u000a197. In its submission, the Respondent State informs the African Commission that taking into consideration\u000athe volume of the cases under review and the time it would require to adjudicate on it, the Federal Supreme\u000a24\u000a\u000aCourt, as the highest organ in charge of the administration of justice in the country, was obliged to allocate\u000aa special Bench in the Criminal Divisions of the Federal High Court. It says that this was done to facilitate\u000athe process of fair and speedy trial in accordance with Article 19 (4) of the 1995 Constitution of the Federal\u000aDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Criminal Procedure Code of Ethiopia. It stated that the process of\u000aallocating dedicated benches was pursued even within the criminal divisions of regional courts. In this\u000aregard, perpetrators of genocide crimes were being tried in courts in different parts of the country.\u000a198. The Respondent State argues that Government even provided competent legal counsels to\u000adefendants at its own cost when they are unable to do so themselves, all in an attempt to facilitate the trial\u000aprocess as expeditiously as possible and respect the rights of the defendants for fair and speedy trial.\u000a199. The Respondent State argues that after charges were filed, the defendants were then informed of the\u000aparticulars of charges brought against them. It says that copies of the charge were given to them and the\u000acharges read to them as prescribed by the relevant provisions of the criminal procedure Code of Ethiopia. It\u000asays that the defendants in exercise of their rights to challenge the charges brought against them in\u000aaccordance with Article 300 of the Criminal Procedure Code submitted their respective preliminary\u000aobjections to the charges, which amounted to about 800 pages of preliminary objections.\u000a200. The Respondent State says that the Special Prosecutor was then asked by the court to reply to the\u000apreliminary objections - and the whole process of reviewing all the preliminary objections and replies and\u000athe adjudication of the preliminary objections took the court about one year, that is, from November 1995 to\u000aSeptember 1996. The Respondent state avers that after examining the defendants preliminary objections to\u000athe charges and replies of the Special Prosecutor, the Court dismissed most of the objections during its\u000ahearing on 9 October 1994 and ordered amendments of some of the charges.\u000a201. It stated that the Special Prosecutor then amended the charges as per the court order and filed the\u000aamended charges to the court in November 1994. It says that the charges were again read out to the\u000adefendants by the court and they were asked to enter their plea. All of them pleaded not guilty. It says that\u000athereafter, the court ordered the Special Prosecutor to present its documentary evidences and witnesses. It\u000asays that the Prosecutor submitted a list of 2500 witnesses and the hearing of witnesses started in January\u000a1996.\u000a202. The Respondent State argues that defense lawyers cross-examined the witnesses presented by the\u000aProsecutor during the various levels examinations and it was not uncommon for a witness to come back to\u000athe court for several weeks because of the endless cross- examinations by the defendants and their\u000adefence counsels. It says that the court ordered the Special Prosecutor to present witnesses twice every\u000aweek on Tuesdays and Thursdays considering the length of time it took to examine one witness as well as\u000athe large amount of evidences to be presented, an exercise which took many years.\u000a203. The Respondent State avers that in the year 2000, after presenting 726 witnesses, the Special\u000aprosecutor, convinced that justice would be delayed if the hearing all over the country continued, applied to\u000athe court to stop the presentation of witnesses and started presenting other documentary evidences. It says\u000athat the court accepted the application of the Special Prosecutor and the presentation of witnesses came to\u000aan end on June 2000. By then, the Respondent State avers, the Special Prosecutor had presented 2,500\u000adocumentary evidences in 24 volumes with a 192 pages of explanation. In addition, it says, films, audios,\u000aand other technical evidences were presented against the defendants. However, the Respondent State\u000asay, the defendants were also given the evidence presented against them according to Article 20 (4) of the\u000aFederal Constitution as well as the criminal Procedure Code. The presentation of evidence was completed\u000ain December 2001 and the court set a date to review the files and render its verdict.\u000a204. The Respondent State avers that after examining the charges and the evidence vis-?-vis the\u000astatements of defence brought by the defendants, the court issued a 587- page verdict on 21 January\u000a2003, to prove the charges against the defendants. In its ruling, the Respondent State say, the court then,\u000acalled on the defendants to start their defenses and informed them that they could make defense\u000astatements in answer to the charges and call witnesses in their defence.\u000a205. It says that one-year after the court's ruling, on 15 December 2003, the defendants brought a list of\u000atheir own three hundred witnesses and documentary evidences. It argues that each defendant was allowed\u000ato give his own testimony which was exceedingly long. The Respondent State says that 22 defendants\u000apresented 787 pages of documentary evidences, while those that opted to individually present their own\u000adefence submitted 1,416 pages of evidences. It says that the whole process of hearing the defendants was\u000acompleted on 5 January 2005, at which time the court had set a date for judgement. It avers that to render\u000aits [sic] judgment, the court had to cautiously review a total of 3703 pages of evidence presented by both\u000asides.\u000a25\u000a\u000a206. The Respondent State argues that after examining the evidences provided by the parties, the court\u000ahad to cautiously review a total of 3,703 pages of evidences and written arguments. It says that on 11\u000aDecember 2006, the judgment written in 792 pages found all the defendants, except one, guilty of the\u000acharges. It says that on 11 January 2007, the court found most of the defendants guilty as charged and\u000asentenced them to twenty three years to life imprisonment. It also stated that as most were dissatisfied with\u000athe judgement they lodged appeals in March 2007.\u000a207. As an accused person enjoys the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, it is only appropriate to\u000aestablish whether he or she is innocent or guilty as rapidly as possible. Proceedings should therefore be as\u000aexpeditious as possible, especially where the accused person is in prison. The African Commission is yet to\u000acome up with a decision on the matter. However, Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter enjoins the\u000aAfrican Charter enjoins the African Commission to draw inspiration from, inter alia, other international law\u000ainstruments and bodies.56 By virtue of this Article, therefore, the Commission can draw inspiration from the\u000adecisions of and the Inter- American Commission and Court, particularly bearing in mind the similarities\u000awithin the two systems.\u000a208. In the case of Dayra Maria Levoyer Jiménez v. Ecuador, the Inter-American Commission again\u000aemphasized a similar interpretation of the right to be presumed innocent under Article 8 (2)\u000a× 2. Every person accused of a criminal offense has the right to be presumed innocent so long as his guilt\u000ahas not been proven according to law. During the proceedings, every person is entitled, with full equality, to\u000athe following minimum guarantees:\u000aa. the right of the accused to be assisted without charge by a translator or interpreter, if he does not\u000aunderstand or does not speak the language of the tribunal or court;\u000ab. prior notification in detail to the accused of the charges against him;\u000ac. adequate time and means for the preparation of his defense;\u000ad. the right of the accused to defend himself personally or to be assisted by legal counsel of his own\u000achoosing, and to communicate freely and privately with his counsel;\u000ae. the inalienable right to be assisted by counsel provided by the state, paid or not as the domestic law\u000aprovides, if the accused does not defend himself personally or engage his own counsel within the time\u000aperiod established by law;\u000af. the right of the defense to examine witnesses present in the court and to obtain the appearance, as\u000awitnesses, of experts or other persons who may throw light on the facts;\u000ag. the right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself or to plead guilty; and\u000ah. the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court.\u000aof the American Convention. It maintained that depriving Mrs. Levoyer Jimenez, the petitioner of her liberty\u000afor a period that exceeded one half the maximum penalty established for the offence is a violation of the\u000aprinciple of presumption of innocence established in the American Convention. It noted that in the present\u000acase the imposition of preventive detention for an indefinite period was tantamount to anticipating the\u000apunishment of Mrs Jiménez. The Commission held further that 'universally accepted general principles of\u000alaw prohibit anticipating the punishment before sentencing'. Stressing the interrelatedness of anticipatory\u000apunishment and violation of the presumption of innocence, the Inter-American Commission found that\u000aEcuador had violated Jiménez's right to be presumed innocent.\u000a209. The African Commission agrees with the Complainants that the procedure adopted by the Respondent\u000aState in bringing the accused persons to justice failed to assign blame within a reasonable length of time.\u000aThe Victims were detained for three years before their trial finally started in 1994, Their trial dragged on for\u000amore than thirteen years before a final judgment was reached in 2007. The pre-trail detention of the Victims\u000aand their long continuous detention even after they were charged essentially meant substituting pre-trial\u000adetention for their punishment. The African Commission agrees that their long preventive custody thus lost\u000aits purpose as an instrument to serve the interests of sound administration of justice. The prolonged\u000aimprisonment without conviction of the Victims for a period of about 16 years clearly violates their right to\u000a26\u000a\u000abe presumed innocent in that it was meant as a sanction prior to the delivery of the judgment. As held by\u000athe Inter-American Court, the deprivation of a person's liberty for a disproportionate time is the same as\u000aserving a sentence in advance for of the judgment. The African Commission agrees with the Complainant\u000athat the Victims were criminally punished by presuming their guilt even before they were heard, in violation\u000aof the principle of presumption of innocence established in Article 7(1) (b) of the African Charter, Article XX\u000aof the Universal Declaration and rule XXX of the principles and Guidelines on fair trial.57\u000aThe African Commission,\u000a210. Declares that the Respondent State has violated Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 7(1)(d) - right to have ones cause heard. Article 7(1)(d) of the African Charter\u000astates: (d) the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\u000a211. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated the former Derg [sic] official's right to\u000aa fair trial by deliberately denying them the right to be tried by an impartial court within a reasonable time as\u000aenshrined in Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter.58 It states that the causes for the delay include the\u000afollowing:\u000a\u000aa. Dismantling of the Ethiopian Court system by the Government;\u000ab. ambitious nature of the transitional justice Ethiopia pursued;\u000ac. absence of appropriate legal checkpoints;\u000ad. joinder of cases and accused persons;\u000ae. the charges were not clear and specific which hampered their speedy trial;\u000af. other causes of delays in the Dergue trials.\u000a212. The African Commission will now proceed to analyse Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter under the\u000aabove rubrics to determine if a violation has occurred according to the allegation levied by the Complainant.\u000aDismantling of the Ethiopian Court System by the Government\u000a213. In their submission on the Merits, the Complainants argue that the Respondent State immediately\u000aupon seizing power, dismantled almost all state institutions, including the court system, by summarily\u000adismissing close to 300 judges on the ground that the judiciary had been an ally to the Dergue regime.\u000aConsequently, they state, the Respondent State could not afford a speedy trial to the Dergue officials due\u000ato shortage of judges. It argues that there were many instances where cases were adjourned for lack of\u000aquorum of judges.\u000a214. The Respondent State did not address this allegation.\u000a215. The African Commission however, wishes to restate that the right to an impartial hearing within a\u000areasonable time is one of the cardinal elements of the fair trial. Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter not only\u000aprovides that person charged with a criminal offence has the right to be tried without undue delay / within a\u000areasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal, but that an individual who is accused and held in custody\u000ais entitled to have his or her case resolved promptly.\u000a216. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, the African\u000aCommission stated that anyone who is arrested on a criminal charge shall be brought before a judicial\u000aofficer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or\u000ato release. The purpose of the review before a judicial or other authority includes to assess whether\u000asufficient legal reason exists for the arrest; assess whether detention before trial is necessary; determine\u000awhether the detainee should be released from custody, and the conditions, if any, for such release;\u000asafeguard the well-being of the detainee; prevent violations of the detainee's fundamental rights; give the\u000adetainee the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of his or her detention and to secure release if the\u000aarrest or detention violates his or her rights.\u000a217. The right to an impartial hearing within a reasonable time is further reinforced by the Commission's\u000aResolution on Fair trial, which provides that persons arrested or detained or facing criminal charges shall\u000a27\u000a\u000abe brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be\u000aentitled to trial within reasonable time or to be released.59 The African Commission is unable to determine\u000awhether the delays in promptly concluding the trial in the instant case was due partly to the fact that the\u000aRespondent State dismantled almost all state institutions, including the court system, as the Respondent\u000aState has not specifically addressed this allegation.\u000a218. Accordingly, the African Commission is left with no alternative but to apply its long-standing practice\u000athat if the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to contradict an allegation of human\u000arights violation made against it, it will take it as proven, or at the least probable or plausible.\u000aAmbitious Nature of the Transitional Justice Ethiopia Pursed\u000a219. The Complainants aver that justice was delayed and therefore denied by the very ambitious nature the\u000amodel of transitional justice the Respondent State pursued. The Complainant allege that the SPO had\u000astated in February 1994 that tens [sic] times more evidence than needed to successfully prosecute several\u000aof the detained and many of the exiles for serious criminal offences.\u000a220. Unfortunately, the Respondent State again chose not fully respond to this particular allegation. It\u000acommented generally that because of the multitude of crimes committed against humanity all over the\u000acountry and the complexity involved in bringing all those responsible for these crimes to justice, the task\u000awould become, at the very least, daunting. In a statement that seem to support the allegation of the\u000aComplainant, the Respondent State said that during the trial process, while the total number of prosecution\u000awitnesses presented in the Mengistu HaileMariam case alone was 726, those of the defendants were 303,\u000amaking the total number of witnesses to be heard by the court to be 1029. It further stated that the\u000adocumentary evidences presented by both parties and became heavily insurmountable when they\u000apresented their replies and counter-replies in addition to the original charges constituting the several\u000acounts.\u000a221. Again applying its long-standing practice, that in cases of human rights violations, the burden of proof\u000arests on the government, and where the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to\u000acontradict an allegation of human rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or\u000aat the least probable or plausible.\u000aAbsence of Appropriate Legal Checkpoints\u000a222. The Complainants allege that the absence of appropriate legal checkpoints that could force the State\u000ato diligently and expeditiously work to investigate, charge and conduct trials also contributed to the delay.\u000aGiving the example of the right to petition for writ of habeas corpus was not available to many of the victims\u000aand the statute of limitation with regard to the crimes the victims were alleged to have Committed [sic] was\u000aremoved.\u000a223. The Respondent State did not fully address this allegation. It argued that full judicial independence in\u000aEthiopia as is guaranteed by domestic laws in Ethiopia as is provided for in Article 78 of the constitution. It\u000aargued that in the Constitution further guarantees in Article 78(4) that special or ad hoc courts which take\u000ajudicial powers away from the regular court or institutions legally empowered to exercise judicial functions\u000aand which do not follow legally prescribed procedures be established. The Constitution, the Respondent\u000aState argues, also guarantees in Article 79(2) and (3) that the courts from any level shall be free from\u000ainterference by government or any other source and that the judges shall exercise their functions in full\u000aindependence and shall be directed solely by law.\u000a224. The Respondent State submit that after establishing the SPO, the Office undertook examining\u000adetained defendants, requesting remand in custody to complete investigation and responding to habeas\u000acorpus demands in the relevant courts. It did not say what the outcome was.\u000a225. Again applying its long-standing practice, that in cases of human rights violations, the burden of proof\u000arests on the government, and where the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to\u000acontradict an allegation of human rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or\u000aat the least probable or plausible.\u000aJoinder of Cases and Accused Persons\u000a226. The Complainants argue that though Articles 116 and 117 of the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code\u000aprovides for joinder of charges and accused persons, where there is conflict of interests that may cause\u000aserious prejudice to the accused or to the interests of justice, which is the case with the Dergue trials, the\u000acourts should order separate trials.\u000a28\u000a\u000a227. The Respondent State did not address this allegation.\u000a228. Applying its long-standing practice, that in cases of human rights violations, the burden of proof rests\u000aon the government, and where the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to contradict\u000aan allegation of human rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or at the least\u000aprobable or plausible.\u000aCharges were not Clear and Specific which Hampered their Speedy Trial\u000a229. The Complainants submit that the charges filed against the Dergue Officials were not clear and\u000aspecific which hampered their speedy trial. They argue that in many respects, the indictments were not as\u000aclear and succinct as they needed to be for the accused to understand them. They aver that this is a defect\u000athat goes to the form of the indictment and a violation of Articles 111 and 112 of the Ethiopian Criminal\u000aProcedure Code.\u000a230. The Respondent State did not fully address this allegation. It merely stated that once the investigation\u000awas completed, the Office of the SPO, began to charge the accused persons before the court of law. It\u000astated that on 24 November 1994, the Office of the SPO brought a charge against Colonel Mengistu\u000aHailemariam et al at the Federal High court. There were also thousands of charges of arbitrary arrest and\u000aillegal confiscation of property brought against the defendants.\u000a231. An accused's ability to fully comprehend the charges brought against him is fundamental to a fair trial.\u000aIn the instant matter, the African Commission will also state that in such serious matter it is imperative that\u000aboth the accused and their counsel are able to fully understand the charges. The Complainants have for\u000aexample alleged that the fundamental problem with the indictments was that the details of the crimes were\u000aunclear because several concepts and legal doctrines were lumped together in one very long sentence.\u000aThe respondent state did not challenge that allegation.\u000a232. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial, the African Commission outlined the factors\u000arelevant to what constitutes undue delay as including the complexity of the case, the conduct of the parties,\u000athe conduct of other relevant authorities, whether an accused is detained pending proceedings, and the\u000ainterest of the person at stake in the proceedings. However, since the Respondent State chose not to fully\u000aaddress this allegation, the Commission will take the allegation as proven, or at the least probable or\u000aplausible.\u000aOther Causes of Delays in the Dergue Trials\u000a233. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has also contravene Article 7(1)(d) by the failure\u000aof the Respondent State to decide how to handle the matter and the failure of the prosecution to present\u000aevidence on time was the major problem.\u000a234. The Complainants submit that what occurred in Ethiopia during the trial of the Dergue officials, was\u000aprejudice and lack of activity by the courts handling the cases and thus constituted a violation of Article 7\u000a(1) (d) of the Charter. They argue that the Respondent State was already aware of the facts and\u000aseriousness of the cases against the Dergue officials but failed to act with the due diligence required and,\u000athereby violating their right to a speedy trial. They further argue that the nature of the violations against the\u000aVictims entitles them to relief. The African Commission agrees. In keeping with the spirit of Articles 7(1)(d)\u000aof the African Charter an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and\u000aexpedited by the proper authorities.\u000a235. The African Commission also agrees with the Complainants that the complexity of a case should not\u000adebar domestic courts from acting with due diligence in dealing with a case on the Merits. 60 At any rate, it\u000ais the responsibilities of States Parties to the African Charter to organize their judiciary in such a way that\u000athe right guaranteed in Article 7 (1) (d) of the Charter can be effectively enjoyed. In Mouvement Burkinabe\u000ades Droits de I'Homme et des peuples/Burkina Faso61 the African Commission that l5 years without a\u000adecision on the relief sought or the fate of the people concerned or any action at all on the case amounted\u000ato a denial of justice and a violation of the right to an impartial trial within a reasonable time. In Annette\u000aPagnoulle (on behalf of Abdoulaye Mazou) / Cameroon,62 the African Commission found the Cameroonian\u000aGovernment in violation of Article 7 (1) (d) of the Charter because Mr. Mazou did not have a judgment on\u000ahis case which was before the supreme Court for two years and he was not given any reason for the delay.\u000a236. Similarly in Alhassan Abubakar v Ghana63 , the African Commission held that detaining the\u000aComplainant for seven years without trial before his escape "clearly violates the "reasonable time" standard\u000astipulated in the Charter." In CRP v Nigeria64 , the Commission held, inter alia, that: in criminal case,\u000aespecially one in which the accused is detained until trial, the trial must be held with all possible speed to\u000a29\u000a\u000aminimize the negative effects on the life of a person who, after all, may be innocent. The Commission\u000afurther held that since nearly two years can pass without even charges being filed there was an\u000aunreasonable delay and thus, the detainees rights under Article 7(1 )(d) were violated.\u000a237. Where there is unacceptable duration, it is the obligation of the Respondent State to adduce specific\u000areasons for the delay. The African Commission agrees with the Complainant that the Respondent State has\u000ato prove that the case is complex to justify the delay under consideration. A mere affirmation that the delay\u000awas not excessive, as in the instant case, is not sufficient. The African Commission further agrees with the\u000aComplainants that even if the Respondent State did not intend to delay the proceedings the African\u000aCommission can still review the prejudice the delay has caused the defendants.\u000a238. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, the African\u000aCommission observed that 'no circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of international\u000aor internal armed conflict, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to\u000ajustify derogations from the right to a fair trial'.65 In its Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial,\u000athe Commission again recognized the right to a fair trial as essential for the protection of fundamental\u000ahuman rights and freedoms and further recommended State Parties to the African Charter to create,\u000aawareness of the accessibility of the recourse procedure.66\u000a239. The Dakar Declaration and Recommendations on the Right to a Fair Trial in Africa adopted by the\u000aCommission at its 26th Ordinary Session, held in Kigali, Rwanda, from 1-15 November 1999 also reiterates\u000athat: the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right, the non- observance of which undermines all other human\u000arights. Therefore, the right to a fair trial is a non-derogable right, especially as the African Charter does not\u000aexpressly allow for any derogation from the rights it enshrines.67\u000a240. The realization of the right to a fair trial is dependent on the existence of certain conditions. These\u000ainclude:68 the right to an impartial hearing, trial within a reasonable time and the presumption of innocence.\u000aThe African Commission,\u000a\u000aDeclares that the Respondent State has violated the right of the Victims to be tried within a reasonable time\u000aby an impartial court or tribunal as recognized in Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aRecommendations\u000aIn view of the above, the African Commission finds that the Respondent State is in violation of Article\u000a7(1)(b) and (d) of the African Charter. The African Commission recommends that the Respondent State:\u000a\u000ao Pay adequate compensation to the Victims for violation of their right to be presumed innocent until proved\u000aguilty by a competent court of tribunal and to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or\u000atribunal as recognized in Article 7(1)(b)(d) of the African Charter.\u000ao Report on the implementation of these recommendations within three months from the date of\u000anotification.\u000aDone in Banjul, The Gambia during the 50th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights, 24th October - 7th November 2011.\u000a\u000a30\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 Dergue means "Council or Committee" in Amharic and it is usually associated with the Mengistu regime\u000athat toppled Haile-Sellasie' Monarchic regime in 1974, and ruled the country from 1974-1991.\u000a2 Communications No. 25/89, 47/90, 56/91, 100/93\u000a3 Communications 54/91, 61/91, 164/97 to 196/97, 210/98.\u000a4 Ibid, (Comm: 210/98) para 78.\u000a5 Communication 277/2003.

France, the applicant, a French\u000anational, was arrested in connection with the murder of a member of parliament. That same day, at a press\u000aconference, the Minister for the Interior and senior police officers made several conclusory statements\u000aasserting that the applicant was an instigator in the murder. Two French television channels reported these\u000astatements in their news programs. On 14 January 1977, the applicant was charged with aiding and\u000aabetting intentional homicide and taken into custody. In his complaint to the European Commission, the\u000a32\u000a\u000aapplicant claimed that the statements made by the Minister for the Interior violated his right to the\u000apresumption of innocence. In its defence, the government argues that the presumption of innocence could\u000abe infringed only by judicial authorities. The European Court held, firstly, that right to presumption of\u000ainnocence secured by Article 6 (2) may be infringed by public authorities other than a judge or court.\u000aAccording to the Court's decision, Article 6 (2) does not prevent public authorities from discussing criminal\u000ainvestigation in progress, but it does require that they do so with the discretion and circumspection\u000anecessary to respect the presumption of innocence. In the case at hand, the court found that the\u000adeclaration of the applicant's guilt by some of the highest ranking police officials in the presence and under\u000athe authority of the Minister for the Interior not only encouraged the public to believe the applicant to be\u000aguilty, but also prejudiced the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.\u000a53 See General Comment 13, paragraph 11 and Manfred Nowak (See n 111 above, page 254).\u000a54 Series C No. 99 [2003] IACHR 2 (7 June 2003).\u000a55 See Rule N of the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal\u000aAssistance in Africa.\u000a56 See for example Communication 211/98 - [211/98#58,Legal Resources Foundation/Zambia]], paragraph\u000a58 and communication 155/96 - The Social and Economic Rights Action Centre and the Centre for\u000aEconomic and Social Rights/Nigeria paragraph 48, 52, 57 and 63.\u000a57 See also Waldemer Geronimo Pinheiro and Jose Victor dos Santos v.

aV308/05 Michael Majuru / Zimbabwe\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. The Complainant, Michael Majuru (hereinafter called the Complainant), submitted this communication\u000aagainst the Republic of Zimbabwe, (hereinafter called the Respondent State), a State Party to the African\u000aCharter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter). The Complainant is a citizen of the\u000aRespondent State and is currently residing in the Republic of South Africa.\u000a2. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has committed gross violations of human rights and\u000afundamental freedoms against him through acts committed by the Minister of Justice, Legal and\u000aParliamentary Affairs and the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) under the Office of the President and\u000aCabinet.\u000a3. The Complainant alleges further that in committing the gross violations, the aforementioned\u000aorganisations, individuals and organs of the state were acting in the course and scope of their employment\u000aas Respondent State's agents.\u000a4. The Complainant submits further that his rights were abused because of his role as a presiding judge in\u000aa case in which the Associated Newspaper Group of Zimbabwe (ANZ), a publishing house in the\u000aRespondent State, sought to challenge, before the Administrative Court, the Respondent State's act on\u000abanning ANZ from publishing its two newspapers, the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday. The\u000amatter was lodged before the Administrative Court on or about 23rd September 2003 and he presided over\u000athe matter.\u000a5. The Complainant states that following his decision in favour of the ANZ, he became a target of human\u000arights abuses brought upon him by agents of the Respondent State and recounts the chronology of events\u000athat depict incidents in which the Respondent State allegedly violated his human rights.\u000a6. The first incident is reported to have occurred on or about 24th September 2003. It is alleged that the\u000aMinister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, the Hon. Patrick Chinamasa invited the Complainant's\u000aworkmate, who was also a judge at the Administrative Court (Justice Chipo Machaka) to his office to issue\u000ainstructions that the matter relating to the ANZ case that was to be presided over by the Complainant\u000ashould be conducted in a manner that the said Minister was going to dictate. Justice Machaka was\u000ainstructed by the Minister to convey these instructions to the Complainant, with an order that Complainant\u000ashould comply with such orders.\u000a7. It is further alleged that the Minister also instructed that the Administrative Court should delay the court\u000aproceedings until February 2004, noting that the ANZ did not deserve impartial treatment by the Judiciary\u000abecause it was a front of western nations and 'other imperialists'. Secondly, Justice Machaka is alleged to\u000ahave been told that if the ANZ were granted its application for urgent appeal hearing and thereafter allowed\u000apublication at that stage this would jeopardise continuing negotiations between ZANU PF and the\u000aMovement for Democratic Change (MDC), (the biggest opposition party in Zimbabwe), which according to\u000athe Minister, had reached a delicate stage. As proof of this delicate relationship between ZANU PF and\u000aMDC, Justice Machaka was shown a draft constitution agreed upon between the two parties and some\u000aother supporting documents.\u000a8. The Complainant submits that the he disregarded the aforesaid instructions and upon considering the\u000aANZ's application on its merits ruled in favour of the ANZ by granting the application for an urgent appeal\u000ahearing on or about 27th September 2003. From 15th to 19th October 2003, the Complainant presided over\u000athe appeal hearing between the two parties. He adjourned the matter for judgement to 24th October 2003.\u000a9. Subsequently, the Complainant states that he was summoned by Enoch Kamushinda, a suspected\u000amember of the CIO for a meeting at Kamushinda's office on 22nd October 2003. This information was\u000aconveyed through another CIO operative with instructions that the Complainant should dismiss the ANZ\u000aappeal. As a reward for dismissing the ANZ appeal, Kamushinda promised the Complainant a fully\u000adeveloped farm in Mashonaland West Province.\u000a10. The Complainant further states that on 23rd October 2003 at around 21:00 hours, the Minister of\u000aJustice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hon. Patrick Chinamasa, telephoned and enquired from the\u000aComplainant whether he had finalised the judgement in the ANZ matter and what decision he had reached.\u000aThe Complainant advised him that he was in the process of finalising the judgement and that he was going\u000ato allow the appeal. The Complainant states that the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said\u000adecision and further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant.\u000a1\u000a\u000a11. The Complainant claims that he went ahead to deliver the judgement in favour of ANZ at about 1600\u000ahours on 24rd November 2003. Subsequently, at about 21:30 hours, Hon. Chinamasa in an angry\u000atelephone call to the Complainant, accused the latter of pre-determining the matter and berated him for\u000adelivering a judgement dictated by British agents and other imperialist forces.\u000a12. Subsequently, the Media and Information Commission (MIC) appealed to the Supreme Court against\u000athe decision of the Administrative Court. ANZ on the other hand decided to approach the Administrative\u000aCourt seeking an order that its original decision be rendered operative notwithstanding the institution of an\u000aappeal by the MIC.\u000a13. The Complainant claims that upon the lodging of this application by the ANZ, the Complainant was\u000aplaced under immense pressure from agents of the Respondent State urging him to desist from dealing\u000awith the matter. The Complainant claims that the Respondent sent members of the CIO to track, trial and\u000amonitor the Complainant's movements and interactions with other people.\u000a14. The Complainant alleges that on several occasions he was approached by Ben Chisvo, a suspected\u000aCIO informer, a former ruling ZANU PF Councillor of the City of Harare and also a war veteran. Chisvo\u000asought to persuade the Complainant to rescue himself from presiding over the matter, claiming that the\u000acase was serious and sensitive and that President Mugabe did not want the ANZ to be registered. Chisvo\u000afurther indicated that the President had set up a team led by a senior assistant commissioner of Zimbabwe,\u000aChangara, to monitor the proceedings in the ANZ matter and confirmed that the Complainant was being\u000amonitored by state security agents.\u000a15. On 23rd November 2003, at around 23:00 hours, the Complainant received a telephone call from\u000aChisvo in which he claimed that his car had had a puncture close to the Complainant's residence and\u000arequested for assistance. Upon meeting the Complainant, Chisvo demanded to know whether the former\u000awould preside over the ANZ matter or excuse him as previously ordered. The Complainant informed Chisvo\u000athat he would be presiding over the ANZ matter.\u000a16. The Complainant further alleges that, on 24th November 2003, following the Complainant's\u000apostponement on the ANZ matter upon the request of the two parties to the case, he received a telephone\u000acall from Hon. Chinamasa at around 21:00 hours. The Complainant states that the Minister alleged that he\u000ahad information linking the Complainant to British agents and other imperialists and that the Complainant\u000awas under investigation for these alleged links with the British agents and imperialists. The Minister also\u000aindicated that he was aware through his informants that the ANZ was going to succeed in the second\u000amatter which was pending before the Complainant and advised him that the Minister of Justice had also\u000aphoned her ordering her to meet him at his office the following morning. She informed the Complainant that\u000athe Minister wanted to be advised on how the Complainant intended to decide the ANZ matter in order for\u000ahim to brief the Cabinet that morning. Soon after the telephone call from Justice Machaka, the Minister\u000atelephoned the Complainant once again ordering that they meet the following morning at his office at 08:00\u000ahours.\u000a17. On 25th November 2003, the Complainant met with the Minister as instructed. The Minister wanted to\u000aknow what the Complainant's decision in the ANZ matter would be but the Complainant declined to inform\u000astating that he had not yet heard the parties' arguments on the matter and was therefore in no position to\u000aknow the outcome. The Complainant alleges that the Minister informed him that the Police Commissioner\u000aAugustine Chuchuri had approached him previous night with information that the Complainant was under\u000ainvestigation for colluding with British agents over the ANZ matter and was considering arresting him.\u000a18. The Minister is also reported to have shown the Complainant the Herald newspaper which carried an\u000aarticle on its front page alleging that the Complainant was under probe over the ANZ matter. The Minister\u000aalso produced an affidavit, which he said had been obtained from Chisvo by the Police Commissioner. In\u000athe said affidavit, Chisvo had made statements to the effect that the Complainant had informed Chisvo that\u000athe ANZ matter was predetermined.\u000a19. The Complainant claims that as a result of such sustained and relentless pressure he had no other\u000aoption but to excuse himself from the matter. Notwithstanding the recusal, the Complainant remained under\u000asurveillance by state security agents.\u000a20. The Complainant states that on 1st December 2003, he received a telephone call from a member of the\u000alegal fraternity and the Police informing him that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him\u000aand that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the\u000aRespondent's orders.\u000a21. The Complainant alleges that fearing for his safety and security; he decided to go into hiding until 9th\u000aDecember when he fled to South Africa, where he remains in exile.\u000a2\u000a\u000a22. The Complainant submits that he is not the only member of the Judiciary who has been persecuted but\u000athat there is a systematic, consistent and sustained pattern of interference with the Judiciary by the\u000aExecutive in the Republic of Zimbabwe.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a23. The Complainants allege that Articles 3, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 26 of the African Charter on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights have been violated.\u000a24. The Complainant requests that the African Commission should:1. Urge the Respondent State to institute an inquiry and investigation that should result in the\u000aGovernment of Zimbabwe bringing those who perpetrated the violations to justice;\u000a2. Order the Respondent State to pay compensation for the physical pain, psychological trauma, loss\u000aof earnings and job and access to family suffered by the Complainant.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a25. The Communication is dated 2th November 2005 and was sent by email to the Secretariat, and was\u000areceived on 8th November 2005.\u000a26. On 17th November 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Communication and informed the\u000aComplainant that the communication would be scheduled for consideration by the African Commission at\u000aits 38th Ordinary Session.\u000a27. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.\u000a28. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to\u000athe Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000aThe Complainant was also requested to send his submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000a29. By letter and Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the parties to the communication were reminded to\u000aforward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication.\u000a30. On 3rd April 2006, the Secretariat received submissions on admissibility of the communication from one\u000aGabriel Shumba. By letter dated 12th April 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to Gabriel\u000aShumba informing him that the communication had been brought before the African Commission by\u000aMichael Majuru who had never made any indication to the African Commission that Gabriel Shumba could\u000amake representations on his behalf. This letter was also copied to the Complainant Michael Majuru.\u000a31. As at the 40th Ordinary Session there had been no reply from the Complainant. The communication\u000awas therefore deferred to the 41st Ordinary Session pending the reply of the Complainant and Mr Shumba,\u000aas well as the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.\u000a32. By letter and Note Verbale dated 11th December 2006, written to the Complainant and Respondent\u000aState respectively, the parties were informed by the Secretariat, about the decision of the African\u000aCommission during its 40th Session, to consider the admissibility of the communication during its 41st\u000aSession. The parties were asked to send their submissions on admissibility within 3 months of receiving the\u000aletters.\u000a33. The Complainant sent an email on 18th December 2006, confirming that Zimbabwe Exiles Forum to\u000awhich Gabriel Shumba is the Executive Director are his agents in the matter and that the Secretariat should\u000aacknowledge submissions made by them.\u000a34. By Note Verbale dated 4th January 2007, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State of the\u000aCommission's decision during its 40th Ordinary Session, and asked them to make their submissions on\u000aadmissibility within 3 months of receipt of the notification. Another reminder by way of a Note Verbale dated\u000a10th April 2007 was also sent to the Respondent State.\u000a35. On 24th April 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submission on admissibility. The\u000aRespondent State's submission was forwarded to the Complainant by email and he was asked to make\u000aadditional submissions (if any), in order to address some important points which were raised by the\u000aRespondent State in its submission.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a36. During its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer consideration of the\u000acommunication to its 42nd Ordinary Session for its decision on admissibility.\u000a37. By letter ACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/TN dated 20th July 2007 and by Note Verbale\u000aACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/RE, with the same date, the parties were informed of the decision of\u000athe African Commission to defer consideration of the communication to its 42th Ordinary Session.\u000a38. At its 42nd Ordinary session held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, the Commission considered this\u000acommunication and decided to defer further consideration into the 43rd Ordinary Session due to lack of\u000atime.\u000a39. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the Commission\u000anotified both panics of the Commission's decision.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000aComplainant's submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a40. The Complainant submitted that he has local standing before the African Commission as the\u000acommunication is brought by himself, a citizen of Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this matter.\u000aRegarding compatibility, the Complainant submitted that the communication raises a prima facie violation of\u000athe African Charter committed by the Respondent State. He submitted further that the evidence he has\u000asubmitted reveals that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated by the mass\u000amedia, adding that it is based on first hand evidence - including reports by reputable human rights\u000aorganisations.\u000a41. On the exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainant submitted that the onus is on the State to\u000ademonstrate that remedies are available, citing the Commission's decisions in the cases of 71.921 and\u000a147.95-149.96,2 . The Complainant added that he remedy in his particular circumstance is not available\u000abecause he cannot make use of it that he was forced to flee Zimbabwe for fear of his life and that of his\u000aimmediate family. Because of his work as a judge of the Administrative Court. That he fled to the Republic\u000aof South Africa following threats of arrest and unspecified harm by the Respondent State.\u000a42. The Complainant drew the Commission's attention to its decision on 215.983 , where the Commission\u000aheld that a Complainant's inability to pursue local remedies following his flight for fear of his life to Benin,\u000aand was subsequently granted asylum was sufficient to establish a standard for constructive exhaustion of\u000alocal remedies. He concluded by noting that considering the fact that he was no longer in the Respondent\u000aState's ternary where remedies could be sought. And that he fled the country against his will due to threat\u000ato his life; remedies could not be pursued without impediments.\u000a43. The Complainant also challenged the effectiveness of the remedies noting that remedies are effective\u000aonly where they offer a prospect of success. He claimed the Respondent State's reaction to court rulings\u000athat go against it is well documented by reputable international and African NGOs, noting that the\u000aRespondent State treats court rulings that go against it with indifference and disfavour, and that he does\u000anot expect that in his case, any decision of the court would be adhered to. He said there was a tendency in\u000athe Respondent State to ignore court rulings that went against it and added that the Zimbabwe Lawyers for\u000aHuman Rights had documented at least 12 instances where the State had ignored court rulings since 2000.\u000aHe cited the ruling of the High Court in the Commercial Farmers Union, the Mark Chavunduka and Ray\u000aChoto cases, where, in the latter case, the duo were allegedly abducted and tortured by the army. He\u000aconcluded that given the prevailing circumstances and the nature of his complaint and the Respondent\u000aState's well publicised practice of non-enforcement of court decisions, his case had no prospect of success\u000aif local remedies were pursued and according to him, not worth pursuing. Finally, the Complainant\u000asubmitted that he could not have exhausted local remedies as any such exhaustion would have to comply\u000awith the States Liabilities Act which prevents the Complainant from suing the Respondent State after the\u000aexpiration of two months of the date of the incident complained of, no prior notice has been given.\u000a44. The Complainant further submitted that the communication was submitted 22 months after the violation\u000abecause he hoped that the situation in the country would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies.\u000aHe said there is instead a deterioration of the situation and hope of improvement is highly unlikely in the\u000anear future, adding that "continuing to wait whilst the Complainant is undergoing tremendous psychological\u000atorture and suffering attributable to his persecution will undoubted cause irreparable harm". The\u000a4\u000a\u000aComplainant added that since he fled to South Africa he has been undergoing psycho-therapy and was not\u000ain a position to submit his communication to the Commission.\u000a45. The Complainant indicated other reasons that prevented him from submitting his complaint on time,\u000aincluding the fact that the judiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily\u000aspeak out and take positions against the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have\u000aleft Zimbabwe because of persecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was\u000aafraid for the lives of members of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him and\u000athat he was unable to submit immediately for want of resources and facilities, noting that the submission\u000awas made possible through the assistance and support of well wishers.\u000a46. Finally, Complainant further submitted that the communication had not been before any other\u000ainternational body for settlement as required by Article 56(7).\u000aRespondent State's submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a47. The Respondent State briefly restated the facts of the communication and indicated that it will attend to\u000athe matters of fact, pertaining to the complaint "in order to put the communication in proper perspective".\u000aThe State submitted that the Complainant was appointed to the Office of Administrative Court President in\u000aterms of Section 79\u000a× 79 Judicial authority (1) The judicial authority of Zimbabwe shall vest in-- (a) the Supreme Court; and (b)\u000athe High Court; and (c) such other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court as may be\u000aestablished by or under an Act of Parliament. (2) The provisions of subsection (1) shall not be construed as\u000apreventing an Act of Parliament from-- (a) vesting adjudicating functions in a person or authority other than\u000aa court referred to in subsection (1); or (b) vesting functions other than adjudicating functions in a court\u000areferred to in subsection (1) or in a member of the judiciary. [Section as substituted by section 10 of Act 30\u000aof 1990 - Amendment No. 11] 79A Judiciary\u000aThe judiciary of Zimbabwe shall consist of-- (a) the Chief Justice, who shall be the head of the judiciary;\u000aand (b) the judges of the Supreme Court; and (c) the Judge President and the other judges of the High\u000aCourt; and\u000a(d) persons presiding over other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court that are\u000aestablished by or under an Act of Parliament. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11] 79B Independence of judiciary\u000aIn the exercise of his judicial authority, a member of the judiciary shall not be subject to the direction or\u000acontrol of any person or authority, except to the extent that a written law may place him under the direction\u000aor control of another member of the judiciary. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11]\u000aof the Constitution at Zimbabwe, read together with the Administrative Court Act. The State added that\u000awhile performing his functions as a Magistrate, Presidents of the Administrative Court are not judges, noting\u000athat in essence, the Complainant was not a judge.\u000a48. According to the State, the Complainant was supposed to be in a court in Bulawayo, but due to his poor\u000ahealth and his relationship with the Minister of Justice, he was appointed to the Administrative Court in\u000aHarare. The State noted that Complainant was a sick man throughout his whole duration at the court and\u000aadded that "in fact from the time of his appointment as a Court President, the Complainant used to travel to\u000aSouth Africa to seek medical attention".\u000a49. The State claims that Complainant applied for two weeks vacation from 9th to 31st December 2003 and\u000awent to South Africa for medical attention. That he then tendered his resignation on 14th January 2004. The\u000aState observed that even though the letter has a Zimbabwean address, an examination of the delivery slip\u000ashowed that it had been dispatched from South Africa. The State concluded that the above circumstances\u000awhich show how Complainant left the country do not amount to forced flight as he claims.\u000a50. The State questioned why Complainant would take steps to regularise his absence from office by\u000aapplying for vacation leave and tender his resignation to the Minister who was threatening him. Without\u000aproducing any document title, the State added that it is apparent from the documents available that he was\u000amaintaining dialogue with a government which he claims was persecuting him. The State observed further\u000athat the letter of resignation even showed the address Complainant was residing and "assuming the\u000agovernment of Zimbabwe really wanted his life, it would have used the address he had volunteered to track\u000ahim". The State concluded by stating that the truth is that [the] "Complainant was never threatened by\u000a5\u000a\u000aanyone, anywhere both within and outside Zimbabwe".\u000a51. On the admissibility of the communication, the State argued that the communication be declared\u000ainadmissible for non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter.\u000a52. The State argued that the communication is not compatible as required by Article 56(2) of the Charter,\u000aas it makes general allegations without substantiating, adding that, for a complaint to be compatible with\u000athe Charter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter. According to the\u000aState, the facts raised in the communication do not raise any violation of the Charter, noting that "basically\u000athe facts and issues in dispute do not fall within the rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the\u000aCommission".\u000a53. On the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5), the State submitted that local remedies were\u000aavailable to the Complainant, citing section 24\u000a× 24 Enforcement of protective provisions (1) If any person alleges that the Declaration of Rights has been,\u000ais being or is likely to be contravened in relation to him (or, in the case of a person who is detained, if any\u000aother person alleges such a contravention in relation to the detained person), then, without prejudice to any\u000aother action with respect to the same matter which is lawfully available, that person (or that other person)\u000amay, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), apply to the Supreme Court for redress. [Subsection as\u000aamended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (2) If in any proceedings in the High Court or\u000ain any court subordinate to the High Court any question arises as to the contravention of the Declaration of\u000aRights, the person presiding in that court may, and if so requested by any party to the proceedings shall,\u000arefer the question to the Supreme Court unless, in his opinion, the raising of the question is merely frivolous\u000aor vexatious. [Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (3) Where in\u000aany proceedings such as are mentioned in subsection (2) any such question as is therein mentioned is not\u000areferred to the Supreme Court, then, without prejudice to the right to raise that question on any appeal from\u000athe determination of the court in those proceedings, no application for the determination of that question\u000ashall lie to the Supreme Court under subsection (1). [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of\u000a1981 - Amendment No. 2] (4) The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction-- (a) to hear and determine\u000aany application made by any person pursuant to subsection (1) or to determine without a hearing any such\u000aapplication which, in its opinion, is merely frivolous or vexatious; and\u000ab) to determine any question arising in the case of any person which is referred to it pursuant to subsection\u000a(2);\u000aand may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for the\u000apurpose of enforcing or securing the enforcement of the Declaration of Rights:\u000aProvided that the Supreme Court may decline to exercise its powers under this subsection if it is satisfied\u000athat adequate means of redress for the contravention alleged are or have been available to the person\u000aconcerned under other provisions of this Constitution or under any other law. [Subsection as amended by\u000asection 20 of Act 23 of 1987 - Amendment No. 7 and by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10]\u000a(5) If in any proceedings it is alleged that anything contained in or done under the authority of any law is in\u000acontravention of section 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 or 22 and the court decides, as a result of hearing the parties,\u000athat the complainant has shown that the court should not accept that the provision of the law concerned is\u000areasonably justifiable in a democratic society on such of the grounds mentioned in section 16(7), 17(2),\u000a19(5), 20(2) and (4), 21(3) or 22(3)(a) to (e), as the case may be, as are relied upon by the other party\u000awithout proof to its satisfaction, it shall issue a rule nisi calling upon the responsible Minister to show cause\u000awhy that provision should not be declared to be in contravention of the section concerned. (6) If in any\u000aproceedings it falls to be determined whether any law is in contravention of the Declaration of Rights, the\u000aAttorney-General shall be entitled to be heard by the court on that question and if in any such proceedings\u000aany law is determined by the court to be in contravention of the Declaration of Rights, then, whether or not\u000ahe has exercised his right to be heard in those proceedings, the Attorney-General shall have the like right\u000awith respect to an appeal from that determination as if he had been a party to the proceedings. (7) Where\u000aany law is held by a competent court to be in contravention of the Declaration of Rights, any person\u000adetained in custody under that law shall be entitled as of right to make an application to the Supreme Court\u000afor the purpose of questioning the validity of his further detention, notwithstanding that he may have\u000apreviously appealed against his conviction or sentence or that any time prescribed for the lodging of such\u000aan appeal may have expired. [Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10]\u000a(8) A written law may confer upon the Supreme Court powers additional to those conferred by this section\u000afor the purpose of enabling the Supreme Court more effectively to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it\u000aby this section. [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of 1981 - Amendment No. 2] (9) A written\u000a6\u000a\u000alaw may make provision with respect to the practice and procedure-- (a) of the Supreme Court in relation to\u000athe jurisdiction and powers conferred upon it by or under this section; and (b) of subordinate courts in\u000arelation to references to the Supreme Court under subsection (2);\u000aincluding provision with respect to the time within which any application or reference shall or may be made\u000aor brought. [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of 1981 - Amendment No. 2]\u000aof the Constitution of Zimbabwe which provides the course of action to be taken where there is human\u000arights violation. The State added that there is no evidence to prove that the Complainant pursued local\u000aremedies. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, where one is engaged in acts that\u000aviolate the rights of another person, that other person can obtain an interdict from the court restraining the\u000aviolator from such act.\u000a54. On the effectiveness of the remedies, the State submitted that the Constitution provides for the\u000aindependence of the judiciary in the exercise of its mandate in conformity with both the UN Principles on an\u000aIndependent Judiciary and the African Commission's Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial.\u000a55. The State dismissed the Complainant's argument that his case is similar to those brought by Sir Dawda\u000aJawara / The Gambia and Rights International (on behalf of Charles Baridorn Wiwa) / Nigeria, adding that\u000ain the latter cases, there was proof of real threat to life, the State went further to indicate instances where\u000athe government has implemented court decisions that went against it.\u000a56. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, it is not a legal requirement for a\u000aComplainant to be physically present in the country in order to access local remedies, adding that both the\u000aHigh Court Act and the Supreme Court Act permit any person to make an application to either court through\u000ahis/her lawyer. The State added that in the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case, the victims were\u000atortured by State agents and they applied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom\u000aand succeeded in their claim. The State concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing\u000aremedies in a similar manner.\u000a57. The State further submitted that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay\u000athe Complainant his pension benefits and argued that the excuse raised by the Complainant of lack of\u000aresources to enable him submit his complaint on time is therefore without merit adding that he could have\u000ainstructed his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on his behalf.\u000a58. According to the State, the Complainant sought to mislead the Commission by claiming that under the\u000aState Liabilities Act, claims against the State are prescribed within a period of sixty days. The State\u000aindicated that section 6 of the Act is clear that the sixty days is in respect of a notice of intention to sue. The\u000aAct prescribes that a summons against [the] State in certain matters must be delivered sixty days after the\u000anotice of intention to sue, and according to the State, this would actually work well for the Complainant,\u000aadding that the period of proscription of claims is three years and Complainant's claim was not yet three\u000ayears and thus not prescribed.\u000a59. The State also submitted that the complaint does not conform to Article 56(6) of the Charter indicating\u000athat the communication should be lodged within a reasonable time after exhaustion of local remedies, but\u000awhere Complainant realises that local remedies shall be unduly prolonged, he/she must submit the\u000acomplaint to the Commission immediately. According to the State, although the Charter does not specify\u000awhat constitute a reasonable time, the Commission should get inspiration from the other jurisdictions,\u000aincluding the Inter-American Commission which has fixed six months as reasonable time, adding that even\u000athe draft protocol merging the African Court of Justice and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights\u000aprovides for six months.\u000a60. The State argued that the communication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which\u000aaccording to the State "was filed well out of time". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking\u000apsycho therapy treatment, the State argued that [the] Complainant had been the centre of attraction in\u000aSouth Africa since 2004, demonising the Respondent State, adding that articles published by [the]\u000aComplainant in the South African press do not show someone with a psychological ailment. The State\u000aadded that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert diagnosis of how such condition\u000awas acquired. On [the] Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the State argued that he had his\u000apension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the Commission.\u000a61. The State concluded its submissions by noting that "no cogent reasons have been given for the failure\u000ato pursue local remedies or remedies before the Commission within a reasonable time", and as such the\u000acommunication should be declared inadmissible.\u000a\u000a7\u000a\u000aCompetence of the African Commission\u000a\u000a62. In the present communication, the Respondent State raises a question regarding the competence of the\u000aAfrican Commission to deal with this communication. The State avers that: "... basically the facts and\u000aissues in dispute do not fall within the rationae materae and rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the\u000aCommission". This statement thus challenges the competence of the African Commission to deal with this\u000acommunication. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue of its competence raised by\u000athe Respondent State.\u000a63. Black's Law Dictionary defines rationae materae as "by reason of the matter involved; in consequence\u000aof, or from the nature of, the subject-matter". While rationae personae is defined as "By reason of the\u000aperson concerned; from the character of the person".4\u000a64. Given the nature of the allegations contained in the communication, such as allegations of violation of\u000apersonal integrity or security, intimidation and torture, the Commission is of the view that the\u000acommunication raises material elements which may constitute human rights violation, and as such, it has\u000acompetence rationae materae to deal with the matter, because the communication alleges violations to\u000ahuman rights protected in the Charter. With regards to the Commission's competence rationae personae,\u000athe communication indicates the name of the author, an individual, whose rights under the African Charter,\u000athe Respondent State is committed to respecting and protecting. With regards to the State, the Commission\u000anotes that Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this case, has been a State Party to the African Charter\u000asince 1986. Therefore, both the Complainant and the State have locus standi before the Commission, and\u000athe Commission thus has competence rationae personae to examine the communication.\u000a65. Having decided that it has competence rationae materae and rationae personae, the African\u000aCommission will now proceed to pronounce on the admissibility requirements and the contentious areas\u000abetween the parties.\u000aDecision of the African Commission on admissibility\u000a\u000a66. The admissibility of communications before the African Commission is determined by the requirements\u000aof Article 56 of the African Charter. This article provides seven requirements which must all be met before\u000athe Commission can consider and declare a communication admissible. It one of the\u000aconditions/requirements is not met the Commission shall declare the Communication inadmissible, unless\u000athe Complainant provides justifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\u000a67. ln the present communication, the Complainant avers that his complaint meets the requirements under\u000aArticles 56 (1) to (4), (6) and (7). He admits that he did not attempt to comply with the requirement provided\u000aunder Article 56.5 dealing with the exhaustion of local remedies, but added that given the nature of his\u000acase, and the circumstances under which he left the Respondent State, and is living in South Africa, the\u000aexception rule under this sub-section of Articles 56, should be invoked.\u000a68. The State on the other hand argues that the Complainant thus not complied with the provisions of\u000aArticles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter, and urges the Commission to declare the communication\u000ainadmissible, based on non-compliance with these requirements.\u000a69. The African Commission will thus examine each of the provisions under Article56 of the African Charter,\u000awhether it is disputed of not, as the African Commission has a responsibility to ensure that every\u000arequirement in Article 56 has been fulfilled before admitting a communication.\u000a70. The requirements under Article 56 of the Charter are meant to ensure that a communication is properly\u000abrought before the Commission, and seek to sieve frivolous and vexatious communications before they\u000areach the merits stage. Thus declaring a communication admissible does not mean the Slate Party\u000aconcerned has violated the provisions of the Charter. It simply means that the communication meets the\u000arequirements necessary for it to be considered on the merits. As indicated earlier, for a communication to\u000abe declared admissible, it must meet all the requirements under Article 56. Therefore, it a party contends\u000athat another party has not complied with one of the requirements, the Commission must pronounce itself on\u000athe contentious issues between the parties, as well as the non-contentious issues.\u000a71. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that communications will be admitted if they indicate their\u000aauthors, even if they request anonymity. In the present case the author of this communication is identified\u000aas Michael Majuru, he has also not requested that his identity be hidden. The respondent State has also\u000abeen cleared identified as the Republic of Zimbabwe. Therefore the provision of Article 56(1) has been\u000aadequately complied with.\u000a\u000a8\u000a\u000a72. Article 56(2) of the African Charter provides that a communication must be compatible with the Charter\u000aof the OAU (now Constitutive Act of the African Union) or with the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\u000aRights In the present communication, the Respondent State argues that the communication does not\u000acomply with this requirement. The State asserts in this regard that, for a complaint to be compatible with the\u000aCharter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter.\u000a73. Compatibility denotes 'in compliance' or 'in conformity with' or 'not contrary to' or 'against'.5 In the\u000apresent communication, the Complainant alleges among others, violations of his right to personal integrity\u000aand being subjected to intimidation, harassment and psychological torture lie alleges further that agents of\u000athe intelligence service of the Respondent State constantly harassed him and prevented him from\u000aexercising his duties freely. These allegations do raise a prima facie violation of human rights. In particular,\u000athe right to the security of the person or personal integrity and the fight to work under satisfactory condition\u000aas stipulated in the Charter. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, Complainants need not specify which\u000aarticles of the Charter have been violated, or even which right is being invoked, so long as they have raised\u000athe substance of the issue in question. That, in the view of the Commission, has been established in this\u000acase. Based on the above, the African Commission is satisfied that the requirement of Article 56(2) of the\u000aAfrican Charter has been sufficiently compiled with.\u000a74. Article 56(3) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted if they are not written in\u000adisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the\u000aOrganisation of African Unity (now the African Union). In the present case, the communication sent by the\u000aComplainant, does not, in the view of the, African Commission, contain any disparaging or insulting\u000alanguage, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(3) has been fulfilled.\u000a75. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that the communication must not be based exclusively on news\u000adisseminated through the mass media. This communication was submitted by the Complainant himself and\u000agives an account of his personal experience with the law enforcement agents of the Respondent State. As\u000aa result of this, the requirement of Article 56(4) has also been met.\u000a76. Article 56(5) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted only after all local remedies\u000ahave been exhausted. The Respondent State contends that the Complainant has not brought his case\u000abefore the courts of the State in compliance with this provision of the Charter. The State argues that there\u000aare sufficient and effective local remedies available to the Complainant in the State, and the Complainant\u000ahas not sought these remedies before bringing the present communication before the Commission. On the\u000aother hand, the Complainant argues that since he had to flee the country due to fear for his life, he could\u000anot come back to the country to pursue these local remedies.\u000a77. The rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies is to ensure that before proceedings are brought\u000abefore an international body, the State concerned must have the opportunity to remedy the matter through\u000aits own local judicial system. This prevents the international tribunal from acting as a court of first instance,\u000arather than as a body of last resort.6\u000a78. Three major criteria could be deduced from the practice and Jurisprudence of the Commission in\u000adetermining compliance with this requirement namely: the remedy must be available, effective and\u000asufficient.\u000a79. ln 147.95-149.96, the Commission stated that "a remedy is considered available if the petitioner can\u000apursue it without impediment: it is deemed effective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found\u000asufficient if it is capable or redressing the complaint". In 147.95-149.96, which both parties have cited, the\u000aCommission held that "the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in\u000apractice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. ... Therefore, if the applicant\u000acannot turn the judiciary of his country because of fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local\u000aremedies would be considered to be unavailable to him".\u000a80. The Complainant in the present communication on claims that he left his country out of fear for his life\u000adue to intimidation, harassment and undue influence in the exercise of his duties. The Complainant has\u000aalso alleged a history of non-compliance with the orders of the court of the Respondent, and alleges that a\u000ahuman rights NGO in Zimbabwe - the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, has documented 12 cases\u000asince the year 2000, where the State has ignored court rulings that go against it. According to the\u000aComplainant, it is noteworthy that although local remedies may be available in the Respondent State, there\u000ais no assurance of its effectiveness or its implementation due to the fact that if the court rules in favour of\u000athe Complainant, there is no guarantee that the ruling will be complied with by the State.\u000a81. The Complainant cited the African Commission's decisions in the Jawara case and the cases of\u000aAlhassan Abubakar v Ghana7 and Rights International v Nigeria8 in which he said the Commission found\u000a9\u000a\u000athat the Complainants in these cases could not be expected to pursue domestic remedies in their country\u000adue to the fact that they had fled their country and were in fact residing outside their country at the time the\u000acommunications were brought before the Commission.\u000a82. Having studied the Complainant's submissions, and comparing it with the above cases cited in support\u000aof his claim, this Commission is of the opinion that the above cases cited by the Complainant are not similar\u000ato his case. In the Jawara case for example, the Complainant was a former Head of State who had been\u000aoverthrown in a military coup. Mr Jawara alleged that after the coup, there was, "blatant abuse of power\u000aby.... the military junta". The military government was alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation\u000aand arbitrary detention. He further alleged the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970\u000aGambia Constitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or\u000aquestion the validity of any such Decree. The communication alleged the banning of political parties and of\u000aMinisters of the former civilian government from taking part in any political activity. The communication\u000afurther alleged restrictions on freedom of expression, movement and religion. These restrictions were\u000amanifested, according to the Complainant, by the arrest and detention of people without charge,\u000akidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.\u000a83. In the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission concluded that "the Complainant in this case had been\u000aoverthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia former Ministers and Members of Parliament of his\u000agovernment have been detained and there was terror and fear for lives in the country. There is no doubt\u000athat there, was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the Complainant. This created\u000aan atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right thinking people that returning\u000ato his country at that material moment, for whatever reason would be risky to his life. Under such\u000acircumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the Complainant". The\u000aCommission finally noted that, "it would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the\u000aComplainant to return to his country to exhaust local remedies".\u000a84. In the 103.93 case, it should be recalled that Mr Alhassan Abubakar was a Ghanaian citizen who was\u000aarrested by the Ghanaian authorities in the 1980s for allegedly cooperating with political dissidents. He was\u000adetained without charge or trial for over 7 years until his escape from a prison hospital on 19th February\u000a1992 to Côte d'lvoire. After his escape, his sister and wife who had been visiting him in Côte d'lvoire, were\u000aarrested and held for two weeks in an attempt to get information on the Complainant's whereabouts. The\u000aComplainant's brother informed him that the police have been given false information about his return, and\u000ahave on several occasions surrounded his house, searched it, and subsequently searched for him in his\u000amother's village.\u000a85. In the early part of 1993, the UNHCR in Côte d'lvoire informed the Complainant that they had received\u000aa report on him from Ghana assuring that he was free to return without risk of being prosecuted for fleeing\u000afrom prison. The report further stated that all those detained for political reasons had been released. [The]\u000aComplainant on the other hand maintained that there is a law in Ghana which subjects escapees to\u000apenalties from 6 months to 2 years imprisonment, regardless of whether the detention from which they\u000aescaped was lawful or not. On the basis of the above, the Commission held that "considering the nature of\u000athe complaint it would not be logical to ask the Complainant to go back to Ghana in order to seek a remedy\u000afrom national legal authorities. Accordingly, the Commission does not consider that local remedies are\u000aavailable for the Complainant".\u000a86. In Rights International9 , the victim, a certain Mr Charles Baridorn Wiwa, a Nigerian student in Chicago\u000awas arrested and tortured at a Nigerian Military Detention Camp in Gokana. It was alleged that Mr Wiwa\u000awas arrested on 3rd January 1996 by unknown armed soldiers in the presence of his mother and other\u000amembers of his family and remained in the said Military detention camp from 3rd to 9th January 1996. While\u000ain detention, Mr Wiwa was horsewhipped and placed in a cell with forty-five other detainees. When he was\u000aidentified as a relative of Mr Ken Saro \u2212Wiwa he was subjected to various forms at torture. Enclosed in the\u000acommunication was medical evidence of Mr Wiwa's physical torture. After 5 days in the detention camp in\u000aGokana, Mr Wiwa was transferred to the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) in Port Harcourt. Mr Wiwa was\u000aheld from 9-11 January 1996, without access to a legal counsel or relatives, except for a five minutes\u000adiscussion with his grandfather. On 11th January 1996, Mr Wiwa and 21 other Ogonis were brought before\u000athe Magistrate Court 2 in Port-Harcourt, charged with unlawful assembly in violation of Section 70 of the\u000aCriminal Code Laws of Eastern Nigeria 1963. Mr Wiwa was granted bail, but while out on bail some\u000aun-known people believed to be government agents abducted him and threatened his life by forcing him\u000ainto a car in Port-Harcourt. On the advice of human rights lawyers, Mr Wiwa fled Nigeria on 18th March\u000a1996 to Cotonou Republic of Benin, where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared him a\u000a10\u000a\u000arefugee. On September 17th 1996, the US government granted him refugee status and he has been\u000aresiding in the United States since then.\u000a87. In this case, the African Commission declared the communication admissible on grounds that there was\u000alack of available and effective domestic remedies for human rights violations in Nigeria under the military\u000aregime. It went further to assert that "the standard for constructive exhaustion of domestic remedies is\u000asatisfied where there is no adequate or effective remedy available to the individual. In this particular case,\u000aMr Wiwa was unable to pursue any domestic remedy following his flight for fear of his life to the Republic of\u000aBenin and the subsequent granting of refugee status to him by the United States of America".\u000a88. The present communication brought by Mr Michael Majuru should also be differentiated from Gabriel\u000aShumba v Republic of Zimbabwe10 . In the Shumba case, the Complainant alleged that, he, in the\u000apresence of 3 others, namely Bishop Shumba, Taurai Magayi and Charles Mutama was taking instructions\u000afrom one of his clients, a Mr John Sikhala, in a matter involving alleged political harassment by members of\u000athe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP). Mr John Sikhala is a Member of Parliament from the Movement for\u000aDemocratic Change (MDC), which is an opposition party in Zimbabwe. At about 11:00 pm riot police\u000aaccompanied by plain-clothes policemen and personnel identified to be from the Central Intelligence\u000aOrganisation (CIO) stormed the room and arrested everyone present. During the arrest, the Complainant's\u000alaw practising certificate, diary, files, documents and cell phone were confiscated and he was slapped and\u000akicked several times by, among others, the Officer in Charge of Saint Mary's Police Station.\u000a89. The Complainant and the others were taken to Saint Mary's Police Station where he was detained\u000awithout charge and denied access to legal representation. He was also denied food and water. The\u000aComplainant claimed that on the next day following his arrest he was removed from the cell, a hood was\u000aplaced over his head and he was driven to an unknown location where he was led down what seemed like\u000aa tunnel to a room underground. The hood was removed, he was stripped naked and his hands and feet\u000awere bound in a foetal position and a plank was thrust between his legs and arms. While in this position,\u000athe Complainant was questioned and threatened with death by about 15 interrogators. The Complainant\u000afurther alleged that he was also electrocuted intermittently for 8 hours and a chemical substance was\u000aapplied to his body. He lost control of his bodily functions, vomited blood and he was forced to drink his\u000avomit. The Complainant submitted a certified copy of the medical report describing the injuries found on his\u000abody. Following his interrogation, at around 7pm of the same day, the Complainant was unbound and\u000aforced to write several statements implicating him and several senior MDC members in subversive\u000aactivities. At around 7:30pm he was taken to Harare Police Station and booked into a cell. On the third day\u000aof his arrest, his lawyers who had obtained a High Court injunction ordering his release to court were\u000aallowed to access him. The Complainant was subsequently charged under section 5 of the Public Order\u000aand Security Act that relates to organising, planning or conspiring to overthrow the government through\u000aunconstitutional means. He then fled Zimbabwe for fear of his life.\u000a90. In the above cases, there is one thing in common - the clear establishments of the element of fear\u000aperpetrated by identified state institutions fear which in the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission observed\u000athat "it would be reversing the clock of justice to request me complainant to attempt local remedies".\u000a91. In the communication under consideration however, Mr Michael Majuru alleges that he fled the country\u000afor fear of his life, that he was intimidated and harassed by the Minister of Justice and by suspected state\u000aagents. He also indicated that he received "a telephone call from a sympathetic member of the legal\u000afraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him and that he was to\u000abe arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the Respondent's orders".\u000a92. In this communication, it is clear that the Complainant has simply made general accusations and has\u000anot corroborated his allegations with documentary evidence, sworn affidavits or testimonies of others. He\u000aclaims the Minister sent an Instruction through a colleague of his but there is no way of ascertaining this\u000afact. The applicant was the President of the Administrative Court, and has not show how the instruction\u000apurportedly sent by the Minister through the Complainant's colleague, who the Commission is not told the\u000akind of influence he had over the Complainant, could have or did intimidate him. Apart from the direct\u000atelephone call the Complainant claims he received from the Minister on 23rd October and 24th November\u000a2003, all the alleged threats intimidations and harassment he claims, were perpetrated by persons he\u000asuspects were government agents. Most of his allegations are unsubstantiated. For example, he indicated\u000ain paragraph 2.5.4.7 of his submissions that "the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said decision\u000aand further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant". He fails to show how this\u000aattempted influence or threat by the Minister was carried out.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000a93. It is further observed by the Commission that the alleged threat or pressure claimed by the Complainant\u000ato have been meted by Enoch Kamushinda, who the complainant himself refers to as a suspected Central\u000aIntelligence Organisation (CIO) operative, has not been substantiated: neither has the purported pressure\u000aand entrapment alleged to have been made by Mr Ben Chisvo who according to the Complainant, is a\u000asuspected CIO informer. Furthermore, the Complainant alleged he received a telephone call from a\u000asympathetic member of the legal fraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case\u000aagainst him, and that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for\u000adefying the Respondent's orders. All the above allegations are not substantiated take the latter for example,\u000awhat if the "sympathetic member of the legal fraternity" was a hoax? What if he was acting on his own or\u000awanted to benefit from the misfortune of the Complainant? His or her name is not even known.\u000a94. It is not possible for the Commission to determine the level of intimidation or harassment that is needed\u000ato instil fear in a person to force that person to flee for their life. However, in the instant case, there is no\u000aconcrete evidence to link the Complainant's fear to the Respondent State.\u000a95. It is therefore the opinion of the Commission that the Complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated\u000athat his life or those of his close relatives were threatened by the Respondent State, forcing him to flee the\u000acountry, and as such, cannot hold that the Complainant left the country due to threats and intimidation from\u000athe State.\u000a96. However, the question is, having left the country, could the Complainant still have exhausted local\u000aremedies or better still is he required to exhaust local remedies?\u000a97. The first test that a local remedy must pass is that it must be available to be exhausted. The word\u000a"available" means "readily obtainable", [/quote]"accessible"[/quote]11 ; or "attainable, reachable on call, on\u000ahand ready, present; ... convenient, at one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck\u000aand call"12 . According to the African Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner\u000acan pursue it without impediments or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.13 In the\u000apresent communication, the question to be asked is whether there were remedies available to the\u000aComplainant even from outside the Respondent State?\u000a98. The State indicates that in terms of its laws, a Complainant need not be physically present in the\u000acountry in order to access local remedies, adding that both the High Court Act and the Supreme Court Act\u000apermit any person to make an application to either court through his/her lawyer. In support of this, the State\u000acited the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case where the victims were tortured by state agents and they\u000aapplied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom and succeeded in their claim. The\u000aState concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing remedies in a similar manner. The State\u000afurther argues that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay the Complainant\u000ahis pension benefits which he could have used to instruct his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on\u000ahis behalf.\u000a99. The Complainant does not dispute the availability of local remedies in the Respondent State, but\u000aargues that in his particular case, having fled the country for fear of his life, and now out of the country,\u000alocal remedies are not available to him.\u000a100. The African Commission holds the view that having failed to establish that he left the country\u000ainvoluntarily, and the view of the fact that in Zimbabwe law, one need not be physically in the country to\u000aaccess local remedies; the Complainant cannot claim that local remedies were not available to him.\u000a101. The Complainant argues that even if local remedies were available, they were not effective because\u000athe State has the tendency of ignoring court rulings taken against it, citing among others, the High Court\u000adecision in the Commercial Farmers Union and the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka cases, and added\u000athat the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights has documented at least 12 instances where the state has\u000aignored court rulings since 2000.\u000a102. The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that "the Commission shall determine\u000aquestions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter"14 . Generally the rules require applicants to\u000aset out in their submissions the steps taken to exhaust domestic remedies. They must provide some prima\u000afacie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies. The Human Rights Committee has stated that the\u000amere fact that a domestic remedy is inconvenient or unattractive, or does not produce a result favourable to\u000athe petitioner does not, in itself, demonstrate the lack of exhaustion of all effective remedies.15 In the\u000aCommittee's decision on A v Australia16 , it held that [quote]"mere doubts about the effectiveness of local\u000aremedies or prospect of financial costs involved did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies"17\u000a. In Article 19 v Eritrea, the Commission held that "it is incumbent on the Complainant to take all necessary\u000asteps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of local remedies. It is not enough for the Complainant\u000a12\u000a\u000ato cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated incidences". The\u000aEuropean Court of Human Rights on its part has held that even if the applicants have reason to believe that\u000aavailable domestic remedies and possible appeals will be ineffective, they should seek those remedies\u000asince "it is generally incumbent on an aggrieved individual to allow the domestic courts the opportunity to\u000adevelop existing rights by way of interpretation".18\u000a103. From the above analysis, this Commission is of the view that the Complainant ignored to utilise the\u000adomestic remedies available to him in the Respondent State, which had he attempted, might have yielded\u000asome satisfactory resolution of the complaint.\u000a104. Article 56(6) of the Charter provides that "Communications received by the Commission will be\u000aconsidered if they are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or\u000afrom the date the Commission is seized with the matter ..." The Respondent State contends that the\u000apresent communication on was not submitted on time by the Complainant, as required by the African\u000aCharter.\u000a105. The present communication was received at the Secretariat of the Commission on 8th November 2005\u000a(even though dated 2nd November 2005). It was considered for seizure by the Commission in November\u000a2005, that is, two years after the Complainant allegedly fled from the country. The Complainant never\u000aapproached the courts of the Respondent State. He left the country in December 2003 and only seized the\u000aCommission twenty two months later. The Complainant submits without substantiating that he had been\u000aundergoing psychotherapy while in South Africa, and also indicated that he did not have the financial\u000ameans to bring the case before the Commission. He also stated that he had hoped the situation in the\u000acountry would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies but there was instead a deterioration.\u000a106. The Commission notes that the Complainant is not residing in the Respondent State and notes further\u000athat the Complainant indicated that he was prevented from submitting his complaint on time, because the\u000ajudiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily speak out and take positions\u000aagainst the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have left Zimbabwe because of\u000apersecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was afraid for the lives of\u000amembers of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him.\u000a107. The State on its part argues that "no cogent reasons have been given for the failure to pursue local\u000aremedies or remedies before the Commission within reasonable time". The State submits that the\u000acommunication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which according to the State "was filed\u000awell out of time". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking psycho-therapy treatment, the\u000aState argued that Complainant had been the centre of attraction in South Africa since 2004 demonising the\u000aRespondent State adding that articles published by the Complainant do not show someone with a\u000apsychological aliment. The State added that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert\u000adiagnosis of having such condition was acquired. On Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the\u000aState argued that he had his pension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the\u000aCommission.\u000a108. The Charter does not provide for what constitutes "reasonable period". However, the Commission has\u000athe mandate to interpret the provisions of the Charter19 and in doing so; it takes cognizance of its duty to\u000aprotect human and peoples' rights as stipulated in the Charter. The provisions of other international\u000aregional instruments like the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the\u000aInter-American Convention on Human Rights, are almost similar and state that they > 20 , after this period\u000ahas elapsed the Court/Commission will no longer entertain the communication.\u000a109. The Commission is urged in Articles 60 and 61 of the Charter to consider as subsidiary measures to\u000adetermine the applicable principles of law "other general or special international instruments, laying down\u000arules expressly recognised by member states of the African Union." Going by the practice of similar\u000aregional human rights instruments, such as the inter-American Commission and Court and the European\u000aCourt, six months seem to be the usual standard. This not withstanding, each case must be treated on its\u000aown merit. Where there is good and compelling reason why a Complainant could not submit his/her\u000acomplaint for consideration on time, the Commission may examine the complaint to ensure fairness and\u000ajustice.\u000a110. In the present communication, the arguments advanced by the Complainant as impediments for his\u000alate submission of the complaint do not appear convincing. The complainant does not supply the\u000aCommission with medical proof to indicate he was suffering from mental problems, he does not indicate\u000awhat gave him the impression that things might improve in Zimbabwe, alter he himself noted in his\u000acomplaint that since 2000 there has been documented evidence to show that things were deteriorating,\u000a13\u000a\u000aincluding the fact that the government does not respect court judgments. Even if the Commission accepts\u000athat he fled the country and needed time to settle, or that he was concerned for the safely of his relatives,\u000atwenty two (22) months after fleeing the country is clearly beyond a reasonable man's understanding of\u000areasonable period of time. The African Commission thus holds that the submission of the communication\u000awas unduly delayed and thus does not comply with the requirements under Article 56(6) of the Charter.\u000a111. Article 56(7) of the African Charter provides that the communication must not deal with cases which\u000ahave been settled by the States, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations, or the Charter of\u000athe OAU or the African Charter. In the present case, this case has not been settled by any of these\u000ainternational bodies, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(7) has been fulfilled by the\u000aComplainant.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a\u000aThe African Commission finds that in the present communication, that is, Communication 308/05 - Michael\u000aMajuru/Zimbabwe, the Complainant has not complied with sub-sections (5) and (6) of Article 56 of the\u000aAfrican Charter, and thus declares the communication inadmissible.\u000aAdopted at the 44th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights,\u000a10th - 24th November 2008, Abuja, Nigeria.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 Communication 71/92.\u000a2 Communication 147/95 and 149/96.\u000a3 Communication 215/98.\u000a4 H C Black, JN Nolan-Haley & J R Nolan, Black's Law Dictionary (6 Ed.) 1990, 1262-1263.

aV310/05 Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre /\u000aSudan\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. This communication is submitted by the Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre (DRDC) (hereinafter\u000acalled the complainant), on behalf of 33 Sudanese citizens (hereinafter referred to as victims) against the\u000aRepublic of Sudan1 (hereinafter called the Respondent State).\u000a2. The Complainant states that the victims were hired by the Iraqi - owned Southern Oil Company in the\u000aearly 1980s as drivers, mechanics, electricians, cooks, servants and manual workers in the oil fields of the\u000asaid company in Basra City (Southern Iraq).\u000a3. On 22nd and 23rd February 1983 the said victims were arrested during the first Gulf War between Iran\u000aand Iraq and taken to Iranian territory on 24th February 1983 as civilian war detainees where they were\u000adetained in special military prisons, until 5th October 1990 (seven years), when they were released and\u000arepatriated to Sudan.\u000a4. The Complainant submits that while in detention, the victims lost their sources of income and were\u000aunable to communicate with their families and lawyers; they were psychologically and physically tortured,\u000ahad no access to medical treatment and could not carry out their religious rituals.\u000a5. Following the victims' release from prison, the Iraqi government agreed to meet part of the unpaid\u000asalaries for the years that they had spent in Iranian custody. No arrangements were made to pay\u000acompensation, damages or reparations for the suffering caused to the victims during their detention.\u000a6. A total of US$ 500,000, paid in Sudanese currency at the exchange rate of the day of payment, was to\u000abe given to the detainees and divided evenly among all of them. It was agreed by the governments of\u000aSudan and Iraq that the said amounts would be paid to the victims through the Ministry of Finance and\u000aEconomic Planning in Khartoum. (See supporting documents No. 1, 2, and 3).The two governments further\u000aagreed that the full amount would be deducted from the debt that Sudan owed Iraq.\u000a7. The complainant submits further that the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in Khartoum\u000ainformed the victims about the payment arrangements reached between Sudan and Iraq (See supporting\u000adocument No. 4). The victims accepted the payment terms despite the fact that they were not part of the\u000anegotiations that led to the payment agreement reached between Sudan and Iraq. This included payment\u000ain Sudanese currency and yet their salaries had been earmarked in US dollars.\u000a8. The complainant alleges that on 20th March 1992, the Sudanese Ministry of Finance and Economic\u000aPlanning approved the payments to the victims and instructed the bank of Sudan to effect the said\u000apayments. (See supporting document No. 5). Subsequently, on 15th April 1993 and 10th May 1993, a total\u000aof US$ 167,367 (SP 22,700,000) was paid to the victims as the first instalment. (see supporting document\u000aNo.6) Each victim received the equivalent of US$ 5,230. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning\u000apromised to pay the remaining balance amounting to US$ 332,633 at a later date.\u000a9. Payment of the remaining balance due to the victim was delayed and the complainant states that the\u000aMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning eventually refused to pay the said amount altogether. The\u000acomplainant alleges that the then First Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning,\u000aMr Hassan Mohamed Taha was responsible for ensuring that the said amounts were not paid to the\u000avictims.\u000a10. The complainant submits that the victims have attempted to use all the legal and political avenues\u000aavailable in order to have their rights recognised and recover the monies owed them but to no avail.\u000a\u000aArticles alleged to have been violated\u000a11. The Complainant alleges that Articles 1, 2, 5, 7(1)(a), 14 and 16(1) of the African Charter on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights have been violated.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aPrayers\u000a\u000a12. The complainant requests the African Commission to urge the government of Sudan to -:\u000a\u2022 Pay the outstanding balance due to the victims which currently amounts to US$ 2,965,789, taking\u000ainto account the accumulated benefit over the years or rebeeh2 specified under the Islamic Banking\u000asystem applied in Sudan;\u000a\u2022 Pay an additional US$3 million in compensation for the material, social and psychological damage\u000aand disruption of life that the victims have endured during the last 13 years. This brings the total\u000aamount being requested to US$5,965,789.\u000a13. The Complainant further requests that in case of delay in satisfactorily settling the communication and\u000aeffecting payment, similar benefits should be paid during 2006 and the subsequent years, as well as, US$\u000a1,000,000 compensation for each additional year from 1st January 2006. The complainant seeks payment\u000aof the above balance, benefits and compensation in US currency to be divided equally between the victims.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a14. The communication is dated 22nd November 2005 and was received by the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission on 24th November 2005.\u000a15. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.\u000a16. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to\u000athe Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000aThe complainant was also requested to send its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000a17. On 13th February 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the complainants'\u000asubmissions on admissibility and acknowledged receipt of the same in a letter dated 14th February 2006. A\u000acopy of the complainants' submissions on admissibility was forwarded to the Respondent State by fax and\u000aemail.\u000a18. By Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the Respondent State was reminded to forward its written\u000asubmission on admissibility of the communication.\u000a19. On 20th May 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a Note Verbale dated 20 May\u000a2006 and attached to it was the State's submission on admissibility.\u000a20. During the 39 Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the Commission decided to defer its\u000adecision on admissibility of the communication to its 40th Ordinary Session. By letter and Note Verbale\u000adated 31st May 2006, the Secretariat informed the complainant and the State respectively, of the\u000aCommission's decision to defer the communication to its 40th Session.\u000a21. By email dated 16th April 2007, the Secretariat received a letter dated 10th April 2007, from the\u000acomplainant, which had attached to it, additional submissions and documents in reply to the submissions of\u000athe Respondent State.\u000a22. At its 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer the communication for further\u000aconsideration on admissibility, to its 41st Ordinary Session.\u000a23. During its 41st Ordinary Session which was held in Accra, Ghana, the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission received, on the 22nd of May 2007, a letter to the African Commission to which was attached\u000afurther submissions by the complainant in reply to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.\u000a24. At the 41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the decision on admissibility of the\u000acommunication was further deferred to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\u000a25. At the 42nd Session of the African Commission the decision on admissibility of this communication was\u000adeferred, to get clarification on some issues from the complainants.\u000a26. At the 43rd Session the Secretariat was yet to receive the complainants response and as a result\u000adeferred the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session.\u000a27. The communication was further deferred during the 44th Session to give time to the Secretariat to draft\u000aits decision on admissibility.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aThe Law\u000aAdmissibility\u000aSummary of the complainant's arguments on admissibility of the communication\u000a\u000a28. The Complainant states that a letter was addressed to the President of Sudan HE Omar El Bashir\u000arequesting him to intervene in the matter and resolve the case. (Attachment No. 7).\u000a29. After studying the relevant documents relating to this matter, the Solicitor General, on 5th September\u000a2000 forwarded a legal opinion to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning confirming that the\u000avictims were entitled to the payment of the outstanding balance held by the said Ministry. (Attachment\u000aNo.9).\u000a30. On 28th August 2001, Dr Maghzoub Al Khalifa, the then Chair of the Joint Iraqi-Sudanese Ministerial\u000aCommittee and a former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of Sudan, sent a letter to the Ministry of\u000aFinance and Economic Planning reminding them of the agreement between the Sudanese and Iraqi\u000agovernments and requesting them to pay the victims the outstanding amounts without delay. (Attachment\u000aNo. 8). Complainant states that since attempts at solving the matter amicably had failed, the victims\u000adecided to pursue the matter in the courts of law.\u000a32. The Complainant states that on 18th June 2000, the victims in this matter filed a complaint against the\u000aMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning before the Court of First Instance in Khartoum. The case - No.\u000aAM/1724/2000 was dismissed by the Court on 21st March 2000 (Attachment No. 10). The victims appealed\u000aagainst the judgment of the Court of First Instance before the Court of Appeal in case no. ASM/475/2001.\u000aOn 7th July 2001, the Court of Appeal issued an order to the Court of First Instance to reconsider its\u000ajudgement and on 19th February 2002 the Court of First Instance dismissed the case once again.\u000a(Attachment No. 10).\u000a33. The victims appealed against the second judgment of the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeal\u000ain Khartoum in Case No. ASM/250/2002) and on 26th December 2002, the Court of Appeal upheld the\u000ajudgment of the Court of First Instance and dismissed the case. (Attachment No. 11).\u000a34. The victims approached the High Court in Khartoum, Civil Circuit in case MA/TM/165/2003 for an\u000ainjunction against the ruling of the Court of Appeal. However, on 18th June 2003, the High Court decided to\u000auphold the ruling of the Court of Appeal and dismissed the matter. (Attachment No. 11). The complainants\u000aallege that the decisions of the court of first instance, Court of Appeal and the High Court, to dismiss the\u000acase, were based on technicalities and not on the spirit of justice, law and good conscience.\u000a35. Consequently, the Complainant submits that the victims have exhausted all domestic remedies by\u000avirtue of the ruling of the High Court on 18th June 2003, which dismissed the case.\u000a36. The Complainant submits that when reaching their judgments, the courts neglected to take into account\u000aelementary facts that would have favoured the victims' case. For instance, the fact that the victims received\u000aa part payment in respect of the agreement reached between Sudan and Iraq and that the Ministry of\u000aFinance and Economic Planning made an undertaking to pay the victims the outstanding balance; failure to\u000atake into account the legal opinion of the Solicitor General stating that he was not a witness to specific\u000aincidents. They also claim that the decisions of these Courts to dismiss the matter were based on\u000atechnicalities and not on the spirit of fairness, law and justice.\u000a37. The Complainant submits further that the Sudanese domestic courts are not competent to deal with a\u000acase of such magnitude and notes that the High Court when delivering its judgement in respect of the\u000aapplication for an injunction stated that the amount of financial indemnification claimed in this case\u000asupersedes the amount fixed by the Judicial Circular No. 44/99 which is a necessary condition for\u000aacceptance of an injunction before the High Court.\u000a38. Additionally, the Complainant avers that the courts in Sudan failed to take into consideration the fact\u000athat the then ruling regime in Iraq was totalitarian and that the one in Sudan is military and as such citizens\u000aare unable to interfere with government decisions or procure the necessary documents that could prove\u000atheir cases in a court of law.\u000a39. For these reasons, the Complainant submits that the domestic judicial process was flawed and could\u000anot render justice to the victims.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a40. The Complainant states that Sudan has been under totalitarian military government headed by a\u000aPresident who is still an active army officer since 30th June 1989. Consequently, the regime pursues a\u000asystematic policy of control and domination at all levels of the State apparatus including the judiciary whose\u000aprocedure and decisions are not respected. As a result, Sudanese citizens, groups and organisations are\u000aunable to submit cases relating to human rights before the courts of law for fear of harassment, threats and\u000aintimidation by the government security agents.\u000a41. To illustrate that the judiciary is not independent, the complainant refers the African Commission to the\u000aannual reports the then UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan in the\u000aFifty-eighth3 and the Fifty-ninth4 Sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights which make reference\u000ato the lack of independence of the judiciary in Sudan. Furthermore, the complainant states that the\u000aInternational Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (ICID), established by the UN Security Council in October\u000a2004 to investigate crimes committed within the context of the armed conflict in Darfur also examined the\u000ajudicial system in Sudan as part of its mandate. In its report of 25th January 2005, the ICID gives a\u000acomprehensive overview of the Sudanese judicial system5 . The Complainant submits that the report\u000aacknowledges that during the last decade the judiciary appeared to have been manipulated and politicised\u000aand as such judges who disagreed with the government often suffered harassment, including dismissals.6\u000a42. The Complainant notes that, the Commission of Inquiry stated that it "considers that in view of the\u000aimpunity which reigns in Darfur today, the judicial system has demonstrated that it lacks adequate\u000astructures, authority, credibility..." 7\u000a43. The Complainant also draws the attention of the African Commission to its decision in Amnesty\u000aInternational, Comité Loosli Bachelard, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Association of Members of\u000athe Episcopal Conference of East Africa/Sudan8 in which the Commission found that the judiciary in Sudan\u000awas not independent. The Complainant states that even after this pronouncement by the Commission, the\u000asituation in Sudan has not improved but has in fact deteriorated in manifolds, as more judges are purged\u000afrom the judiciary and supporters of the government were appointed in their place.\u000aSummary of the Respondent State's submission on Admissibility\u000a\u000a44. The Respondent State starts by stating that the judicial system of the Sudan is one of the most\u000acompetent and efficient organs of the State based on the principle of its total independence and the\u000aprinciple of separation of powers. It goes further to state that the judicial system is efficient, honest and\u000acharacterised with competence. The State submits that the Sudan is one of the few African States which\u000ahas a Supreme Court in every Province and a judicial system which is available to all.\u000a45. The State contends that the complainants have not fulfilled the conditions stated in Article 56 of the\u000aAfrican Charter. The Respondent State submits that the complaint has not complied with the condition in\u000aArticle 56(5) of the African Charter which provides for the exhaustion of local remedies before a\u000aCommunication is brought before the African Commission.\u000a46. The State submits in this regard, that the complainants are afforded the opportunity to have their cases\u000aheard by the Constitutional Court and Department of Grievances these are the two mechanisms put in\u000aplace by the Constitution of Sudan, for the protection of human rights. The State substantiates this claim\u000awith documents on statistics illustrating the judicial performance in the Sudan and states that the\u000acomplainants are yet to exhaust all these avenues which are available to them.\u000a47. The Respondent State claims that the provision of Article 56(1) was not fulfilled because the complaint\u000a"was submitted by a so-called Abdul-Baqui Jubril on behalf of Darfur Centre for Relief and Documentation\u000aCentre." The State further states that this person continues to lodge complaints which are not backed by\u000aany evidence or legal basis, sometimes to the Commission, presenting complaints under the umbrella of a\u000anumber of civil society organisations.\u000a48. The State further states that the complainant has failed to comply with the provisions of Article 56(2) of\u000athe African Charter and that the complainant's resort to Article 1 of the Charter is not applicable in the\u000apresent case. The State submits that the ultimate nature of any case is that there is a winner and a loser\u000aand states further that the Charter requires that there is compliance with the law when rights of individuals\u000aand groups are discussed. It goes further to state that it is unacceptable to say that the judgments passed\u000aby the courts are in violation of human rights, that these judgments testify to the reality and are in keeping\u000awith the letter and spirit of the African Charter and the AU Charter and that any assumption contrary to that\u000ashall be tantamount to denying the courts of the member States of their functions.\u000a49. The State goes further to state that the international human rights instruments recognise the\u000a4\u000a\u000asovereignty of States and the rule of the natural law existing in these States and that any assumption to the\u000acontrary is itself a blatant violation of the law.\u000a50. The Respondent State further submits that the complaint is not in compliance with Article 56(3) of the\u000aAfrican Charter, which provides that a communication brought before the Commission should not be written\u000ain insulting or disparaging language. The State contends that the complainants' submissions, especially in\u000apara. 40 of the communication contained statements which had improper utterances against officials as\u000awell as the methods of the application of justice and the rule of law in the Sudan.\u000a51. The Respondent State also submits that the complaint is not in conformity with Article 56(6) of the\u000aAfrican Charter, which provides that a communication should be brought within a reasonable time after the\u000aexhaustion of local remedies. The State contends that the present communication was brought before the\u000aCommission after the expiration of 31 months of the court's judgement.\u000a52. That for these reasons the communication should be declared inadmissible by the African Commission.\u000a\u000aSummary of the complainants' reply to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a53. The complainant alleges that though the Supreme Court is the highest court in the Sudan, the Civil\u000aProcedures Act of Sudan provides that the "Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to determine: Objection\u000aby way of cassation against the decisions and orders of the Courts of Appeal concerning objections against\u000aadministrative decisions."\u000a54. The complainant also argues that the communication does not have to do with, nor were it brought\u000abefore the Shar'ia Courts; it is a civil suit which was properly brought before the civil law circuit.\u000a55. Also the complainant submits that the final decision of the High Court which dismissed their case was\u000ahanded to them by the registrar, more than three months after its pronouncement by the court. This delay\u000aprevented the petitioners from bringing an application for review of the Supreme Court's judgment within\u000athe prescribed period of 15 (fifteen days).\u000a56. On the contention of the Respondent State that they could bring their matter before the Constitutional\u000aCourt, the complainants state that the Sudan's Constitutional Bill of 2005, outlines the jurisdiction, functions\u000aand powers of the Constitutional Court. This Bill provides that the Constitutional Court has no jurisdiction to\u000areview judgements, decisions, proceedings, and orders passed by the judiciary. This means that the\u000aConstitutional Court lacks the competence to entertain matters that were already dealt with by other Courts.\u000a57. The complainant also alleges that the victims' ordeal with the Sudanese authorities has been going on\u000asince 1993, when the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning failed to pay the remaining balance of the\u000afunds. The victims then started proceedings in the courts in 2000, which was finally dismissed by the High\u000aCourt in June 2003, and according to the Complainants, the victims have exhausted all means possible at\u000atheir disposal to recover their outstanding funds to no avail.\u000a58. The complainant also allege that the judiciary of the Sudan is not independent of the government in the\u000adischarge of its duties. This it alleges is due to the fact that the country is ruled by a totalitarian military\u000aregime. That the government pursues a systematic policy of tight control and domination at all levels of the\u000aState apparatus including the judiciary.\u000a59. The complainant alleges that in view of the above facts, it has exhausted all possibilities for local\u000aremedy in the Sudanese courts and seek that the African Commission finds this communication admissible.\u000aAnalysis on admissibility\u000a\u000a60. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of\u000aArticle 56 of the African Charter. This Article provides seven requirements which must all be met before the\u000aCommission can declare a communication admissible. If one of the conditions/requirements is not met, the\u000aCommission will declare the communication inadmissible, unless the complainant provides sufficient\u000ajustifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\u000a61. In the present communication, the complainant claims that it has fulfilled all the requirements of Article\u000a56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that five requirements of\u000aadmissibility, that is, Articles 56(1), 56(2), 56(3), 56(5), and 56(6), have not been met.\u000a62. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that "Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...\u000areceived by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request\u000aanonymity..."\u000a5\u000a\u000a63. According to the Respondent State, the communication does not indicate the authors. The\u000acommunication received by the African Commission indicates that the author of the communication is the\u000aDarfur Relief and Documentation Centre which brought the communication on behalf of 33 Sudanese\u000anationals whose names are stated in the communication. This means that the author of the communication\u000aand the victims are clearly identified. The Commission therefore holds that the requirement under Article\u000a56(1) of the African Charter has been met* .\u000a64. The State also submits that the communication is incompatible with the Charter of the Organisation for\u000aAfrican Unity (OAU) and as such does not comply with Article 56(2), of the African Charter. This sub-Article\u000aprovides that "Communications...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are compatible\u000awith the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter." In the present case, there\u000ais evidence of prima facie violation of the African Charter in the refusal of the Ministry of Finance and\u000aEconomic Planning (an institution of the Sudanese government), to pay the outstanding balance of the\u000amoney due to the 33 Sudanese nationals in breach of the agreement between the Sudanese and Iraqi\u000agovernments to pay them this money as compensation for their time in Iranian prisons. Secondly in view of\u000athe compatibility requirements, Sudan is a State Party to the African Charter. Thirdly the Republic of Sudan\u000abecame party to the Charter on 18th February, 1986, the alleged violations in this communication falls\u000awithin the period of the Charter's application to Sudan. Lastly, the alleged violation took place within the\u000aterritorial sphere which the Charter applies. For these reasons, the Commission holds that the\u000acommunication has sufficiently fulfilled the requirement of Article 56(2) of the African Charter.\u000a65. In its submission, the State calls on the African Commission to declare the communication inadmissible\u000aon the ground that it does not comply with Article 56(3) of the African Charter which states that\u000a"communications ...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are not written in disparaging or\u000ainsulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African\u000aUnity (AU)".\u000a66. The Respondent State objects to the statements made by the Complainant in para. 40 of the complaint\u000aarguing that it is improper to describe any sovereign State as such. Paragraph 40 of the complaint states\u000athat "This Communication documents a situation of absolute misuse of government authority and executive\u000apowers to inflict gross injustice and suffering among a vulnerable segment of the Sudanese citizens. This\u000asituation is a classical example of the absence of accountability of public officials and for the lack of proper\u000aadministration of justice and the rule of law in Sudan."\u000a67. In its decision on admissibility in Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights/ Zimbabwe(ZLHR)9 , the African\u000aCommission stated inter alia that "in determining whether a certain remark is disparaging or insulting and\u000awhether it has dampened the integrity of the judiciary, the Commission has to satisfy itself whether the said\u000aremark or language is aimed at unlawfully and intentionally violating the dignity, reputation or integrity of a\u000ajudicial officer or body and whether it is used in a manner calculated to pollute the minds of the public or\u000aany reasonable man to cast aspersions on and weaken public confidence on the administration of justice.\u000aThe language must be aimed at undermining the integrity and status of the institution and bring it into\u000adisrepute. To this end, Article 56(3) must be interpreted bearing in mind Article 9(2) of the African Charter\u000awhich provides that "every individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the\u000alaw". A balance must be struck between the right to speak freely and the duty to protect state institutions to\u000aensure that while discouraging abusive language, the African Commission is not at the same time violating\u000aor inhibiting the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed in the African Charter, such as in this case, the right\u000ato freedom of expression."\u000a68. The decision taken in ZLHR should be distinguished from another decision of the African Commission\u000ain Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme/ Cameroon10 , where the African Commission held that the\u000aCommunication was inadmissible because of the complainant's use of language like "[President] Paul Biya\u000amust respond to crimes against humanity", "30 years of the criminal neo-colonial/regime", "regime of\u000atorturers", "government barbarisms" e.t.c., as this was considered as insulting language.\u000a69. The Respondent State in this communication does not expressly state that the communication was\u000ainsulting or disparaging but however noted that the language used is "improper" . In the opinion of the\u000aAfrican Commission, the language used in the communication, and especially in Para. 40, is not insulting or\u000adisparaging to the Government of Sudan and as such, is not contrary to Article 56(3). For this reason, the\u000aCommission holds that the proviso under Article 56(3) has been complied with.\u000a70. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that a communication would be admissible if it is "...not based\u000aexclusively on news disseminated by the mass media". There is nothing in this communication which has\u000ashown that it was based on news by the mass media and none of the parties have contested that point. To\u000a6\u000a\u000athis end the African commission holds that this proviso has been fulfilled.\u000a71. The Respondent State further submits that the communication does not comply with Article 56(5) of the\u000aAfrican Charter which requires that "communications...received by the Commission shall be considered: if\u000athey are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\u000aprolonged". The Commission has stated that the justification for this requirement is that a government\u000ashould be aware of a human rights violation in order to have a chance to remedy such violation, thus\u000aprotecting its reputation which may be tarnished by being called to plead its case before an international\u000abody. This requirement also precludes the African Commission from becoming a tribunal of first instance, a\u000afunction which it cannot fulfil practically or legally.\u000a72. In the present case, the Respondent State contends that the complainant has not exhausted local\u000aremedies available to it in the Sudan. The State submits that the complainant has not brought its case\u000abefore the Supreme Court for review and have also not taken the matter to the Constitutional Courts on\u000aappeal. Article 15 (2) of the Constitutional Court Act of Sudan (as amended in 2005), stipulates that\u000a"...there shall not be subject, to review of the Constitutional Court, the business of the Judiciary, the\u000ajudgements, decisions, proceedings and orders passed by the Courts thereof". This means that the\u000aConstitutional Court has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals arising from judgements, decisions,\u000aproceedings, and orders passed by the Judiciary.\u000a73. The author alleges that the matter was first brought before the Court of first instance, but the case was\u000adismissed, an appeal of this ruling was made to the Court of Appeal which ordered reconsideration of the\u000amatter in the court of first instance. The case was dismissed a second time by the court of first instance and\u000athis time the judgement was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The victims then brought the case before the\u000aHigh Court which approved the judgement of the Court of First Instance and dismissed the case. The\u000acomplainant claims that there is no other Court where they could take the case.\u000a74. The Respondent State has however pointed out that there is still an option of taking the case before the\u000aConstitutional Court of the Sudan, available to the Complainants. The Constitutional Court Act of Sudan\u000aprovides that "...The Court.... shall assume protection of the rights of a human being and the fundamental\u000afreedoms thereof" 11 This, according to the State, means that the complainant can still take its case on the\u000aalleged violation of the rights of the 33 Sudanese, to the Constitutional Court of Sudan for a remedy of the\u000acomplaint. The African Commission therefore holds that not all the local remedies which are available to the\u000acomplainants have been exhausted in accordance with Article 56(5) of the Charter, and as such the\u000acommunication has not fulfilled this provision.\u000a75. Regarding the requirement under Article 56(6) of the African Charter which provides that\u000a"Communications...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are submitted within a\u000areasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized\u000awith the matter,..." . The African Commission notes that the Charter does not provide for what constitutes "a\u000areasonable period of time," and neither has it defined reasonable time. For this reason, the African\u000aCommission would therefore treat each case on its own merits12 .\u000a76. Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter provides that the African Commission, in deciding matters\u000abrought before it, should draw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights. The African\u000aCommission in this communication would look at the jurisprudence of the European Court on Human\u000aRights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The European Convention on Human Rights\u000aand Fundamental Freedoms provides that the (European) >13 , after this period has elapsed, the European\u000aCourt on Human Rights will declare such Application inadmissible. The American Convention on Human\u000aRights also provides that to be declared admissible, "the petition or communication is lodged within a period\u000aof six months from the date on which the party alleging violation of his rights was notified of the final\u000ajudgment" 14 The Convention went further to provide circumstances where this provision will not be\u000aapplicable to include when "...there has been unwarranted delay in rendering a final judgment under the\u000aaforementioned remedies".\u000a77. The Inter American Commission on Human Rights has indicated that the six month period provided for\u000ain Article 46(1)(b) of the American Convention "has a twofold purpose: to ensure legal certainty and to\u000aprovide the person concerned with sufficient time to consider his position"15\u000a78. In the present communication, a period of twenty nine (29) months (2 years and 5 months) has elapsed\u000abetween the time when the High Court dismissed the matter (18th June 2003), and when the\u000acommunication was submitted to the African Commission (24th November 2005). The complainant\u000asubmitted this communication way beyond a time which could be considered reasonable, looking at the\u000aEuropean Court and the Inter- American Court jurisprudence. The complainants have also not given any\u000a7\u000a\u000acompelling reason why there was such a long wait before bringing the matter before the African\u000aCommission.\u000a79. The provision of the Charter regarding time limit in Article 56(5) is to make a party complaining of a\u000awrong done by a State, to be vigilant and to discourage tardiness from prospective complainants. However,\u000awhere there is a good and compelling reason why a complainant does not submit his complaint to the\u000aCommission for consideration, the Commission has a responsibility, for the sake of fairness and justice, to\u000agive such a complainant an opportunity to be heard.\u000a80. In the present case, there is no sufficient reason given as to why the communication could not be\u000asubmitted within a reasonable period. For this reason, the African Commission holds that the\u000acommunication does not fulfil the proviso of Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aDecision of the Commission\u000a81. It must be reiterated that the African Charter provides that all the requirements in Article 56 must be\u000afulfilled before a communication will be declared admissible by the African Commission. The Commission\u000aholds that the provisions of sub-Articles 56(5) and 56(6) of Article 56 have not been fulfilled by the\u000acomplainant.\u000a82. In view of the above, the African Commission decides:\u000a1.\u000a2. to declare the communication inadmissible;\u000a3. to transmit its decision to the parties;\u000a4. to publish this decision in its 27th Activity Report.\u000a\u000aDone in Banjul, The Gambia during the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights held from 11th - 25th November 2009.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a* Editor's note:The English version of this decision is longer than the French version. In the French version\u000aparagraphs 62 and 63 have been merged, as well as paragraphs 80 and 81\u000a1 The Republic of Sudan ratified the African Charter on 18th February 1986 and is consequently a State\u000aparty to the African Charter.\u000a2 According to the Islamic Banking System the "rebeeh" is an annual benefit on the principal fund.

During the meetings held, a number of very serious concerns were expressed to the Special\u000aRapporteur, which left him under the impression that a credibility gap still remains to be bridged by the\u000aGovernment. More specifically, extremely serious concern was repeatedly expressed about the role of\u000asecurity agents, who are invariably described as putting human rights and fundamental freedoms in\u000ajeopardy.\u000a20. As he highlighted in paragraph 75 of his interim report, the Special Rapporteur finds it alarming that\u000asecurity forces continued a campaign of harassment, intimidation and persecution, targeting political\u000aopponents and human rights defenders, by means of arbitrary arrests, followed by protracted, at times\u000aincommunicado, arbitrary detention without judicial review. Practices such as reporting, whereby an\u000aindividual is forced to report to the police on a regular basis, constitute an obvious form of harassment\u000a8\u000a\u000awhich totally disrupts the daily life of the individual concerned.\u000a21. As for freedom of expression, the Special Rapporteur was informed that censorship had increased as of\u000aDecember 2000. It was reported that censorship is at times selective and discriminatory insofar as one\u000anewspaper is sometimes prevented from publishing articles that other newspapers are allowed to print.\u000aFrom information gathered, it would seem that the National Press Council often failed to mount a significant\u000adefence of freedom of expression. As a result of the generally held belief that no article is immune from\u000acensorship, people's interest in newspapers has consistently decreased, to the point that most newspapers\u000aare facing financial difficulties.\u000app. 6 and 7.\u000a4 E/CN.4/2003/42dated 6th January 2003' Para. 28\u000a× The state of emergency in force since December 1999 provided the basis for the imposition of security\u000ameasures, often arbitrarily implemented. The Special Rapporteur has already referred to the amendment to\u000athe National Security Forces Act, which virtually allows for incommunicado detention for periods of six to\u000anine months, as well as the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act of 1991 which strengthen the\u000apowers of law enforcement agents in matters relating to, inter alia, investigation, arrest, interrogation and\u000adetention, without judicial review. Overall, the role of the security apparatus as the main entity responsible\u000afor the human rights abuses as well as the impunity enjoyed by security officers remains an issue of serious\u000aconcern.\u000ap.8.\u000a5 See paragraphs 432-455, pp 111-115.\u000a6 See Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, at p.111 at Para. 432\u000a× 432.

Judges disagreeing with the Government\u000aoften suffered harassment including dismissals.\u000a7 See Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, at p 115 at Para. 455\u000a× 455. Based on the above, the Commission considers that in view of the impunity which reigns in Darfur\u000atoday, the judicial system has demonstrated that it lacks adequate structures, authority, credibility, and\u000awillingness to effectively prosecute and punish the perpetrators of the alleged crimes that continue to exist\u000ain Darfur.\u000a8 communications No. 48/90, 50/91, 52/91 and 89/93.\u000a9 Communication 284/2003\u000a10 Communication 65/92\u000a11 Article 15(1) (d) of the Constitutional Court Act\u000a12 communication 308/05- Michael Majuru/Zimbabwe and communication 43/90 Union des Scolaires\u000aNigeriens- Union Generale des Etudiants Nigeriens au Benin/Niger, where the Communication was\u000adeclared inadmissible on the ground that none of the conditions relating to form, time limit or procedure laid\u000adown under Article 56 and Rule 114 of the (Previous Version of the Rules of Procedure) were complied\u000awith.\u000a13 Article [35\u000a× The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to\u000athe generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which\u000athe final decision was taken.\u000aof The European Convention on Human rights.\u000a14 Article 46(1) (b)\u000a× 1.

aV310/05 Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre /\u000aSudan\u000aSummary of Facts\u000a1. This communication is submitted by the Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre (DRDC) (hereinafter\u000acalled the complainant), on behalf of 33 Sudanese citizens (hereinafter referred to as victims) against the\u000aRepublic of Sudan1 (hereinafter called the Respondent State).\u000a2. The Complainant states that the victims were hired by the Iraqi - owned Southern Oil Company in the\u000aearly 1980s as drivers, mechanics, electricians, cooks, servants and manual workers in the oil fields of the\u000asaid company in Basra City (Southern Iraq).\u000a3. On 22nd and 23rd February 1983 the said victims were arrested during the first Gulf War between Iran\u000aand Iraq and taken to Iranian territory on 24th February 1983 as civilian war detainees where they were\u000adetained in special military prisons, until 5th October 1990 (seven years), when they were released and\u000arepatriated to Sudan.\u000a4. The Complainant submits that while in detention, the victims lost their sources of income and were\u000aunable to communicate with their families and lawyers; they were psychologically and physically tortured,\u000ahad no access to medical treatment and could not carry out their religious rituals.\u000a5. Following the victims' release from prison, the Iraqi government agreed to meet part of the unpaid\u000asalaries for the years that they had spent in Iranian custody. No arrangements were made to pay\u000acompensation, damages or reparations for the suffering caused to the victims during their detention.\u000a6. A total of US$ 500,000, paid in Sudanese currency at the exchange rate of the day of payment, was to\u000abe given to the detainees and divided evenly among all of them. It was agreed by the governments of\u000aSudan and Iraq that the said amounts would be paid to the victims through the Ministry of Finance and\u000aEconomic Planning in Khartoum. (See supporting documents No. 1, 2, and 3).The two governments further\u000aagreed that the full amount would be deducted from the debt that Sudan owed Iraq.\u000a7. The complainant submits further that the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in Khartoum\u000ainformed the victims about the payment arrangements reached between Sudan and Iraq (See supporting\u000adocument No. 4). The victims accepted the payment terms despite the fact that they were not part of the\u000anegotiations that led to the payment agreement reached between Sudan and Iraq. This included payment\u000ain Sudanese currency and yet their salaries had been earmarked in US dollars.\u000a8. The complainant alleges that on 20th March 1992, the Sudanese Ministry of Finance and Economic\u000aPlanning approved the payments to the victims and instructed the bank of Sudan to effect the said\u000apayments. (See supporting document No. 5). Subsequently, on 15th April 1993 and 10th May 1993, a total\u000aof US$ 167,367 (SP 22,700,000) was paid to the victims as the first instalment. (see supporting document\u000aNo.6) Each victim received the equivalent of US$ 5,230. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning\u000apromised to pay the remaining balance amounting to US$ 332,633 at a later date.\u000a9. Payment of the remaining balance due to the victim was delayed and the complainant states that the\u000aMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning eventually refused to pay the said amount altogether. The\u000acomplainant alleges that the then First Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning,\u000aMr Hassan Mohamed Taha was responsible for ensuring that the said amounts were not paid to the\u000avictims.\u000a10. The complainant submits that the victims have attempted to use all the legal and political avenues\u000aavailable in order to have their rights recognised and recover the monies owed them but to no avail.\u000a\u000aArticles alleged to have been violated\u000a11. The Complainant alleges that Articles 1, 2, 5, 7(1)(a), 14 and 16(1) of the African Charter on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights have been violated.\u000a\u000a1\u000a\u000aPrayers\u000a\u000a12. The complainant requests the African Commission to urge the government of Sudan to -:\u000a\u2022 Pay the outstanding balance due to the victims which currently amounts to US$ 2,965,789, taking\u000ainto account the accumulated benefit over the years or rebeeh2 specified under the Islamic Banking\u000asystem applied in Sudan;\u000a\u2022 Pay an additional US$3 million in compensation for the material, social and psychological damage\u000aand disruption of life that the victims have endured during the last 13 years. This brings the total\u000aamount being requested to US$5,965,789.\u000a13. The Complainant further requests that in case of delay in satisfactorily settling the communication and\u000aeffecting payment, similar benefits should be paid during 2006 and the subsequent years, as well as, US$\u000a1,000,000 compensation for each additional year from 1st January 2006. The complainant seeks payment\u000aof the above balance, benefits and compensation in US currency to be divided equally between the victims.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a14. The communication is dated 22nd November 2005 and was received by the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission on 24th November 2005.\u000a15. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\u000aAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.\u000a16. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to\u000athe Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000aThe complainant was also requested to send its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\u000a17. On 13th February 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the complainants'\u000asubmissions on admissibility and acknowledged receipt of the same in a letter dated 14th February 2006. A\u000acopy of the complainants' submissions on admissibility was forwarded to the Respondent State by fax and\u000aemail.\u000a18. By Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the Respondent State was reminded to forward its written\u000asubmission on admissibility of the communication.\u000a19. On 20th May 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a Note Verbale dated 20 May\u000a2006 and attached to it was the State's submission on admissibility.\u000a20. During the 39 Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the Commission decided to defer its\u000adecision on admissibility of the communication to its 40th Ordinary Session. By letter and Note Verbale\u000adated 31st May 2006, the Secretariat informed the complainant and the State respectively, of the\u000aCommission's decision to defer the communication to its 40th Session.\u000a21. By email dated 16th April 2007, the Secretariat received a letter dated 10th April 2007, from the\u000acomplainant, which had attached to it, additional submissions and documents in reply to the submissions of\u000athe Respondent State.\u000a22. At its 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer the communication for further\u000aconsideration on admissibility, to its 41st Ordinary Session.\u000a23. During its 41st Ordinary Session which was held in Accra, Ghana, the Secretariat of the African\u000aCommission received, on the 22nd of May 2007, a letter to the African Commission to which was attached\u000afurther submissions by the complainant in reply to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.\u000a24. At the 41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the decision on admissibility of the\u000acommunication was further deferred to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\u000a25. At the 42nd Session of the African Commission the decision on admissibility of this communication was\u000adeferred, to get clarification on some issues from the complainants.\u000a26. At the 43rd Session the Secretariat was yet to receive the complainants response and as a result\u000adeferred the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session.\u000a27. The communication was further deferred during the 44th Session to give time to the Secretariat to draft\u000aits decision on admissibility.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aThe Law\u000aAdmissibility\u000aSummary of the complainant's arguments on admissibility of the communication\u000a\u000a28. The Complainant states that a letter was addressed to the President of Sudan HE Omar El Bashir\u000arequesting him to intervene in the matter and resolve the case. (Attachment No. 7).\u000a29. After studying the relevant documents relating to this matter, the Solicitor General, on 5th September\u000a2000 forwarded a legal opinion to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning confirming that the\u000avictims were entitled to the payment of the outstanding balance held by the said Ministry. (Attachment\u000aNo.9).\u000a30. On 28th August 2001, Dr Maghzoub Al Khalifa, the then Chair of the Joint Iraqi-Sudanese Ministerial\u000aCommittee and a former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of Sudan, sent a letter to the Ministry of\u000aFinance and Economic Planning reminding them of the agreement between the Sudanese and Iraqi\u000agovernments and requesting them to pay the victims the outstanding amounts without delay. (Attachment\u000aNo. 8). Complainant states that since attempts at solving the matter amicably had failed, the victims\u000adecided to pursue the matter in the courts of law.\u000a32. The Complainant states that on 18th June 2000, the victims in this matter filed a complaint against the\u000aMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning before the Court of First Instance in Khartoum. The case - No.\u000aAM/1724/2000 was dismissed by the Court on 21st March 2000 (Attachment No. 10). The victims appealed\u000aagainst the judgment of the Court of First Instance before the Court of Appeal in case no. ASM/475/2001.\u000aOn 7th July 2001, the Court of Appeal issued an order to the Court of First Instance to reconsider its\u000ajudgement and on 19th February 2002 the Court of First Instance dismissed the case once again.\u000a(Attachment No. 10).\u000a33. The victims appealed against the second judgment of the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeal\u000ain Khartoum in Case No. ASM/250/2002) and on 26th December 2002, the Court of Appeal upheld the\u000ajudgment of the Court of First Instance and dismissed the case. (Attachment No. 11).\u000a34. The victims approached the High Court in Khartoum, Civil Circuit in case MA/TM/165/2003 for an\u000ainjunction against the ruling of the Court of Appeal. However, on 18th June 2003, the High Court decided to\u000auphold the ruling of the Court of Appeal and dismissed the matter. (Attachment No. 11). The complainants\u000aallege that the decisions of the court of first instance, Court of Appeal and the High Court, to dismiss the\u000acase, were based on technicalities and not on the spirit of justice, law and good conscience.\u000a35. Consequently, the Complainant submits that the victims have exhausted all domestic remedies by\u000avirtue of the ruling of the High Court on 18th June 2003, which dismissed the case.\u000a36. The Complainant submits that when reaching their judgments, the courts neglected to take into account\u000aelementary facts that would have favoured the victims' case. For instance, the fact that the victims received\u000aa part payment in respect of the agreement reached between Sudan and Iraq and that the Ministry of\u000aFinance and Economic Planning made an undertaking to pay the victims the outstanding balance; failure to\u000atake into account the legal opinion of the Solicitor General stating that he was not a witness to specific\u000aincidents. They also claim that the decisions of these Courts to dismiss the matter were based on\u000atechnicalities and not on the spirit of fairness, law and justice.\u000a37. The Complainant submits further that the Sudanese domestic courts are not competent to deal with a\u000acase of such magnitude and notes that the High Court when delivering its judgement in respect of the\u000aapplication for an injunction stated that the amount of financial indemnification claimed in this case\u000asupersedes the amount fixed by the Judicial Circular No. 44/99 which is a necessary condition for\u000aacceptance of an injunction before the High Court.\u000a38. Additionally, the Complainant avers that the courts in Sudan failed to take into consideration the fact\u000athat the then ruling regime in Iraq was totalitarian and that the one in Sudan is military and as such citizens\u000aare unable to interfere with government decisions or procure the necessary documents that could prove\u000atheir cases in a court of law.\u000a39. For these reasons, the Complainant submits that the domestic judicial process was flawed and could\u000anot render justice to the victims.\u000a\u000a3\u000a\u000a40. The Complainant states that Sudan has been under totalitarian military government headed by a\u000aPresident who is still an active army officer since 30th June 1989. Consequently, the regime pursues a\u000asystematic policy of control and domination at all levels of the State apparatus including the judiciary whose\u000aprocedure and decisions are not respected. As a result, Sudanese citizens, groups and organisations are\u000aunable to submit cases relating to human rights before the courts of law for fear of harassment, threats and\u000aintimidation by the government security agents.\u000a41. To illustrate that the judiciary is not independent, the complainant refers the African Commission to the\u000aannual reports the then UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan in the\u000aFifty-eighth3 and the Fifty-ninth4 Sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights which make reference\u000ato the lack of independence of the judiciary in Sudan. Furthermore, the complainant states that the\u000aInternational Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (ICID), established by the UN Security Council in October\u000a2004 to investigate crimes committed within the context of the armed conflict in Darfur also examined the\u000ajudicial system in Sudan as part of its mandate. In its report of 25th January 2005, the ICID gives a\u000acomprehensive overview of the Sudanese judicial system5 . The Complainant submits that the report\u000aacknowledges that during the last decade the judiciary appeared to have been manipulated and politicised\u000aand as such judges who disagreed with the government often suffered harassment, including dismissals.6\u000a42. The Complainant notes that, the Commission of Inquiry stated that it "considers that in view of the\u000aimpunity which reigns in Darfur today, the judicial system has demonstrated that it lacks adequate\u000astructures, authority, credibility..." 7\u000a43. The Complainant also draws the attention of the African Commission to its decision in Amnesty\u000aInternational, Comité Loosli Bachelard, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Association of Members of\u000athe Episcopal Conference of East Africa/Sudan8 in which the Commission found that the judiciary in Sudan\u000awas not independent. The Complainant states that even after this pronouncement by the Commission, the\u000asituation in Sudan has not improved but has in fact deteriorated in manifolds, as more judges are purged\u000afrom the judiciary and supporters of the government were appointed in their place.\u000aSummary of the Respondent State's submission on Admissibility\u000a\u000a44. The Respondent State starts by stating that the judicial system of the Sudan is one of the most\u000acompetent and efficient organs of the State based on the principle of its total independence and the\u000aprinciple of separation of powers. It goes further to state that the judicial system is efficient, honest and\u000acharacterised with competence. The State submits that the Sudan is one of the few African States which\u000ahas a Supreme Court in every Province and a judicial system which is available to all.\u000a45. The State contends that the complainants have not fulfilled the conditions stated in Article 56 of the\u000aAfrican Charter. The Respondent State submits that the complaint has not complied with the condition in\u000aArticle 56(5) of the African Charter which provides for the exhaustion of local remedies before a\u000aCommunication is brought before the African Commission.\u000a46. The State submits in this regard, that the complainants are afforded the opportunity to have their cases\u000aheard by the Constitutional Court and Department of Grievances these are the two mechanisms put in\u000aplace by the Constitution of Sudan, for the protection of human rights. The State substantiates this claim\u000awith documents on statistics illustrating the judicial performance in the Sudan and states that the\u000acomplainants are yet to exhaust all these avenues which are available to them.\u000a47. The Respondent State claims that the provision of Article 56(1) was not fulfilled because the complaint\u000a"was submitted by a so-called Abdul-Baqui Jubril on behalf of Darfur Centre for Relief and Documentation\u000aCentre." The State further states that this person continues to lodge complaints which are not backed by\u000aany evidence or legal basis, sometimes to the Commission, presenting complaints under the umbrella of a\u000anumber of civil society organisations.\u000a48. The State further states that the complainant has failed to comply with the provisions of Article 56(2) of\u000athe African Charter and that the complainant's resort to Article 1 of the Charter is not applicable in the\u000apresent case. The State submits that the ultimate nature of any case is that there is a winner and a loser\u000aand states further that the Charter requires that there is compliance with the law when rights of individuals\u000aand groups are discussed. It goes further to state that it is unacceptable to say that the judgments passed\u000aby the courts are in violation of human rights, that these judgments testify to the reality and are in keeping\u000awith the letter and spirit of the African Charter and the AU Charter and that any assumption contrary to that\u000ashall be tantamount to denying the courts of the member States of their functions.\u000a49. The State goes further to state that the international human rights instruments recognise the\u000a4\u000a\u000asovereignty of States and the rule of the natural law existing in these States and that any assumption to the\u000acontrary is itself a blatant violation of the law.\u000a50. The Respondent State further submits that the complaint is not in compliance with Article 56(3) of the\u000aAfrican Charter, which provides that a communication brought before the Commission should not be written\u000ain insulting or disparaging language. The State contends that the complainants' submissions, especially in\u000apara. 40 of the communication contained statements which had improper utterances against officials as\u000awell as the methods of the application of justice and the rule of law in the Sudan.\u000a51. The Respondent State also submits that the complaint is not in conformity with Article 56(6) of the\u000aAfrican Charter, which provides that a communication should be brought within a reasonable time after the\u000aexhaustion of local remedies. The State contends that the present communication was brought before the\u000aCommission after the expiration of 31 months of the court's judgement.\u000a52. That for these reasons the communication should be declared inadmissible by the African Commission.\u000a\u000aSummary of the complainants' reply to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a53. The complainant alleges that though the Supreme Court is the highest court in the Sudan, the Civil\u000aProcedures Act of Sudan provides that the "Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to determine: Objection\u000aby way of cassation against the decisions and orders of the Courts of Appeal concerning objections against\u000aadministrative decisions."\u000a54. The complainant also argues that the communication does not have to do with, nor were it brought\u000abefore the Shar'ia Courts; it is a civil suit which was properly brought before the civil law circuit.\u000a55. Also the complainant submits that the final decision of the High Court which dismissed their case was\u000ahanded to them by the registrar, more than three months after its pronouncement by the court. This delay\u000aprevented the petitioners from bringing an application for review of the Supreme Court's judgment within\u000athe prescribed period of 15 (fifteen days).\u000a56. On the contention of the Respondent State that they could bring their matter before the Constitutional\u000aCourt, the complainants state that the Sudan's Constitutional Bill of 2005, outlines the jurisdiction, functions\u000aand powers of the Constitutional Court. This Bill provides that the Constitutional Court has no jurisdiction to\u000areview judgements, decisions, proceedings, and orders passed by the judiciary. This means that the\u000aConstitutional Court lacks the competence to entertain matters that were already dealt with by other Courts.\u000a57. The complainant also alleges that the victims' ordeal with the Sudanese authorities has been going on\u000asince 1993, when the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning failed to pay the remaining balance of the\u000afunds. The victims then started proceedings in the courts in 2000, which was finally dismissed by the High\u000aCourt in June 2003, and according to the Complainants, the victims have exhausted all means possible at\u000atheir disposal to recover their outstanding funds to no avail.\u000a58. The complainant also allege that the judiciary of the Sudan is not independent of the government in the\u000adischarge of its duties. This it alleges is due to the fact that the country is ruled by a totalitarian military\u000aregime. That the government pursues a systematic policy of tight control and domination at all levels of the\u000aState apparatus including the judiciary.\u000a59. The complainant alleges that in view of the above facts, it has exhausted all possibilities for local\u000aremedy in the Sudanese courts and seek that the African Commission finds this communication admissible.\u000aAnalysis on admissibility\u000a\u000a60. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of\u000aArticle 56 of the African Charter. This Article provides seven requirements which must all be met before the\u000aCommission can declare a communication admissible. If one of the conditions/requirements is not met, the\u000aCommission will declare the communication inadmissible, unless the complainant provides sufficient\u000ajustifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\u000a61. In the present communication, the complainant claims that it has fulfilled all the requirements of Article\u000a56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that five requirements of\u000aadmissibility, that is, Articles 56(1), 56(2), 56(3), 56(5), and 56(6), have not been met.\u000a62. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that "Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...\u000areceived by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request\u000aanonymity..."\u000a5\u000a\u000a63. According to the Respondent State, the communication does not indicate the authors. The\u000acommunication received by the African Commission indicates that the author of the communication is the\u000aDarfur Relief and Documentation Centre which brought the communication on behalf of 33 Sudanese\u000anationals whose names are stated in the communication. This means that the author of the communication\u000aand the victims are clearly identified. The Commission therefore holds that the requirement under Article\u000a56(1) of the African Charter has been met* .\u000a64. The State also submits that the communication is incompatible with the Charter of the Organisation for\u000aAfrican Unity (OAU) and as such does not comply with Article 56(2), of the African Charter. This sub-Article\u000aprovides that "Communications...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are compatible\u000awith the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter." In the present case, there\u000ais evidence of prima facie violation of the African Charter in the refusal of the Ministry of Finance and\u000aEconomic Planning (an institution of the Sudanese government), to pay the outstanding balance of the\u000amoney due to the 33 Sudanese nationals in breach of the agreement between the Sudanese and Iraqi\u000agovernments to pay them this money as compensation for their time in Iranian prisons. Secondly in view of\u000athe compatibility requirements, Sudan is a State Party to the African Charter. Thirdly the Republic of Sudan\u000abecame party to the Charter on 18th February, 1986, the alleged violations in this communication falls\u000awithin the period of the Charter's application to Sudan. Lastly, the alleged violation took place within the\u000aterritorial sphere which the Charter applies. For these reasons, the Commission holds that the\u000acommunication has sufficiently fulfilled the requirement of Article 56(2) of the African Charter.\u000a65. In its submission, the State calls on the African Commission to declare the communication inadmissible\u000aon the ground that it does not comply with Article 56(3) of the African Charter which states that\u000a"communications ...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are not written in disparaging or\u000ainsulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African\u000aUnity (AU)".\u000a66. The Respondent State objects to the statements made by the Complainant in para. 40 of the complaint\u000aarguing that it is improper to describe any sovereign State as such. Paragraph 40 of the complaint states\u000athat "This Communication documents a situation of absolute misuse of government authority and executive\u000apowers to inflict gross injustice and suffering among a vulnerable segment of the Sudanese citizens. This\u000asituation is a classical example of the absence of accountability of public officials and for the lack of proper\u000aadministration of justice and the rule of law in Sudan."\u000a67. In its decision on admissibility in Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights/ Zimbabwe(ZLHR)9 , the African\u000aCommission stated inter alia that "in determining whether a certain remark is disparaging or insulting and\u000awhether it has dampened the integrity of the judiciary, the Commission has to satisfy itself whether the said\u000aremark or language is aimed at unlawfully and intentionally violating the dignity, reputation or integrity of a\u000ajudicial officer or body and whether it is used in a manner calculated to pollute the minds of the public or\u000aany reasonable man to cast aspersions on and weaken public confidence on the administration of justice.\u000aThe language must be aimed at undermining the integrity and status of the institution and bring it into\u000adisrepute. To this end, Article 56(3) must be interpreted bearing in mind Article 9(2) of the African Charter\u000awhich provides that "every individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the\u000alaw". A balance must be struck between the right to speak freely and the duty to protect state institutions to\u000aensure that while discouraging abusive language, the African Commission is not at the same time violating\u000aor inhibiting the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed in the African Charter, such as in this case, the right\u000ato freedom of expression."\u000a68. The decision taken in ZLHR should be distinguished from another decision of the African Commission\u000ain Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme/ Cameroon10 , where the African Commission held that the\u000aCommunication was inadmissible because of the complainant's use of language like "[President] Paul Biya\u000amust respond to crimes against humanity", "30 years of the criminal neo-colonial/regime", "regime of\u000atorturers", "government barbarisms" e.t.c., as this was considered as insulting language.\u000a69. The Respondent State in this communication does not expressly state that the communication was\u000ainsulting or disparaging but however noted that the language used is "improper" . In the opinion of the\u000aAfrican Commission, the language used in the communication, and especially in Para. 40, is not insulting or\u000adisparaging to the Government of Sudan and as such, is not contrary to Article 56(3). For this reason, the\u000aCommission holds that the proviso under Article 56(3) has been complied with.\u000a70. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that a communication would be admissible if it is "...not based\u000aexclusively on news disseminated by the mass media". There is nothing in this communication which has\u000ashown that it was based on news by the mass media and none of the parties have contested that point. To\u000a6\u000a\u000athis end the African commission holds that this proviso has been fulfilled.\u000a71. The Respondent State further submits that the communication does not comply with Article 56(5) of the\u000aAfrican Charter which requires that "communications...received by the Commission shall be considered: if\u000athey are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\u000aprolonged". The Commission has stated that the justification for this requirement is that a government\u000ashould be aware of a human rights violation in order to have a chance to remedy such violation, thus\u000aprotecting its reputation which may be tarnished by being called to plead its case before an international\u000abody. This requirement also precludes the African Commission from becoming a tribunal of first instance, a\u000afunction which it cannot fulfil practically or legally.\u000a72. In the present case, the Respondent State contends that the complainant has not exhausted local\u000aremedies available to it in the Sudan. The State submits that the complainant has not brought its case\u000abefore the Supreme Court for review and have also not taken the matter to the Constitutional Courts on\u000aappeal. Article 15 (2) of the Constitutional Court Act of Sudan (as amended in 2005), stipulates that\u000a"...there shall not be subject, to review of the Constitutional Court, the business of the Judiciary, the\u000ajudgements, decisions, proceedings and orders passed by the Courts thereof". This means that the\u000aConstitutional Court has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals arising from judgements, decisions,\u000aproceedings, and orders passed by the Judiciary.\u000a73. The author alleges that the matter was first brought before the Court of first instance, but the case was\u000adismissed, an appeal of this ruling was made to the Court of Appeal which ordered reconsideration of the\u000amatter in the court of first instance. The case was dismissed a second time by the court of first instance and\u000athis time the judgement was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The victims then brought the case before the\u000aHigh Court which approved the judgement of the Court of First Instance and dismissed the case. The\u000acomplainant claims that there is no other Court where they could take the case.\u000a74. The Respondent State has however pointed out that there is still an option of taking the case before the\u000aConstitutional Court of the Sudan, available to the Complainants. The Constitutional Court Act of Sudan\u000aprovides that "...The Court.... shall assume protection of the rights of a human being and the fundamental\u000afreedoms thereof" 11 This, according to the State, means that the complainant can still take its case on the\u000aalleged violation of the rights of the 33 Sudanese, to the Constitutional Court of Sudan for a remedy of the\u000acomplaint. The African Commission therefore holds that not all the local remedies which are available to the\u000acomplainants have been exhausted in accordance with Article 56(5) of the Charter, and as such the\u000acommunication has not fulfilled this provision.\u000a75. Regarding the requirement under Article 56(6) of the African Charter which provides that\u000a"Communications...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are submitted within a\u000areasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized\u000awith the matter,..." . The African Commission notes that the Charter does not provide for what constitutes "a\u000areasonable period of time," and neither has it defined reasonable time. For this reason, the African\u000aCommission would therefore treat each case on its own merits12 .\u000a76. Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter provides that the African Commission, in deciding matters\u000abrought before it, should draw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights. The African\u000aCommission in this communication would look at the jurisprudence of the European Court on Human\u000aRights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The European Convention on Human Rights\u000aand Fundamental Freedoms provides that the (European) >13 , after this period has elapsed, the European\u000aCourt on Human Rights will declare such Application inadmissible. The American Convention on Human\u000aRights also provides that to be declared admissible, "the petition or communication is lodged within a period\u000aof six months from the date on which the party alleging violation of his rights was notified of the final\u000ajudgment" 14 The Convention went further to provide circumstances where this provision will not be\u000aapplicable to include when "...there has been unwarranted delay in rendering a final judgment under the\u000aaforementioned remedies".\u000a77. The Inter American Commission on Human Rights has indicated that the six month period provided for\u000ain Article 46(1)(b) of the American Convention "has a twofold purpose: to ensure legal certainty and to\u000aprovide the person concerned with sufficient time to consider his position"15\u000a78. In the present communication, a period of twenty nine (29) months (2 years and 5 months) has elapsed\u000abetween the time when the High Court dismissed the matter (18th June 2003), and when the\u000acommunication was submitted to the African Commission (24th November 2005). The complainant\u000asubmitted this communication way beyond a time which could be considered reasonable, looking at the\u000aEuropean Court and the Inter- American Court jurisprudence. The complainants have also not given any\u000a7\u000a\u000acompelling reason why there was such a long wait before bringing the matter before the African\u000aCommission.\u000a79. The provision of the Charter regarding time limit in Article 56(5) is to make a party complaining of a\u000awrong done by a State, to be vigilant and to discourage tardiness from prospective complainants. However,\u000awhere there is a good and compelling reason why a complainant does not submit his complaint to the\u000aCommission for consideration, the Commission has a responsibility, for the sake of fairness and justice, to\u000agive such a complainant an opportunity to be heard.\u000a80. In the present case, there is no sufficient reason given as to why the communication could not be\u000asubmitted within a reasonable period. For this reason, the African Commission holds that the\u000acommunication does not fulfil the proviso of Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\u000a\u000aDecision of the Commission\u000a81. It must be reiterated that the African Charter provides that all the requirements in Article 56 must be\u000afulfilled before a communication will be declared admissible by the African Commission. The Commission\u000aholds that the provisions of sub-Articles 56(5) and 56(6) of Article 56 have not been fulfilled by the\u000acomplainant.\u000a82. In view of the above, the African Commission decides:\u000a1.\u000a2. to declare the communication inadmissible;\u000a3. to transmit its decision to the parties;\u000a4. to publish this decision in its 27th Activity Report.\u000a\u000aDone in Banjul, The Gambia during the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\u000aand Peoples' Rights held from 11th - 25th November 2009.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a* Editor's note:The English version of this decision is longer than the French version. In the French version\u000aparagraphs 62 and 63 have been merged, as well as paragraphs 80 and 81\u000a1 The Republic of Sudan ratified the African Charter on 18th February 1986 and is consequently a State\u000aparty to the African Charter.\u000a2 According to the Islamic Banking System the "rebeeh" is an annual benefit on the principal fund.

During the meetings held, a number of very serious concerns were expressed to the Special\u000aRapporteur, which left him under the impression that a credibility gap still remains to be bridged by the\u000aGovernment. More specifically, extremely serious concern was repeatedly expressed about the role of\u000asecurity agents, who are invariably described as putting human rights and fundamental freedoms in\u000ajeopardy.\u000a20. As he highlighted in paragraph 75 of his interim report, the Special Rapporteur finds it alarming that\u000asecurity forces continued a campaign of harassment, intimidation and persecution, targeting political\u000aopponents and human rights defenders, by means of arbitrary arrests, followed by protracted, at times\u000aincommunicado, arbitrary detention without judicial review. Practices such as reporting, whereby an\u000aindividual is forced to report to the police on a regular basis, constitute an obvious form of harassment\u000a8\u000a\u000awhich totally disrupts the daily life of the individual concerned.\u000a21. As for freedom of expression, the Special Rapporteur was informed that censorship had increased as of\u000aDecember 2000. It was reported that censorship is at times selective and discriminatory insofar as one\u000anewspaper is sometimes prevented from publishing articles that other newspapers are allowed to print.\u000aFrom information gathered, it would seem that the National Press Council often failed to mount a significant\u000adefence of freedom of expression. As a result of the generally held belief that no article is immune from\u000acensorship, people's interest in newspapers has consistently decreased, to the point that most newspapers\u000aare facing financial difficulties.\u000app. 6 and 7.\u000a4 E/CN.4/2003/42dated 6th January 2003' Para. 28\u000a× The state of emergency in force since December 1999 provided the basis for the imposition of security\u000ameasures, often arbitrarily implemented.

Overall, the role of the security apparatus as the main entity responsible\u000afor the human rights abuses as well as the impunity enjoyed by security officers remains an issue of serious\u000aconcern.\u000ap.8.\u000a5 See paragraphs 432-455, pp 111-115.\u000a6 See Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, at p.111 at Para. 432\u000a× 432.

aV313/05 Kenneth Good / Republic of Botswana\u000aSummary of the Complaint\u000a1. The complaint is submitted by INTERIGHTS, Anton Katz and Max du Plessis (Complainants) on behalf\u000aof Mr Kenneth Good (victim), against the Republic of Botswana (Respondent State).\u000a2. The complaint states that Mr Kenneth Good, an Australian national, teaching at the University of\u000aBotswana, had his employment terminated after his expulsion from Botswana on 31st May 2005.\u000a3. It is submitted that in February 2005, in his capacity as Professor of Political Studies at the University of\u000aBotswana, the victim co-authored an article concerning presidential succession in Botswana. The article\u000acriticised the Government, and concluded that Botswana is a poor example of African presidential\u000asuccession.\u000a4. The Complainants submit that, on 18th February 2005, the President of Botswana, exercising the powers\u000avested in him by section 7(f) of the Botswana Immigration Act, decided to declare the victim an undesirable\u000ainhabitant of, or visitor to, Botswana. The victim was not given reasons for this decision, nor was he given\u000aany opportunity to contest it.\u000a5. On 7th March 2005, the victim launched a constitutional challenge in the Botswana High Court. On 31st\u000aMay 2005, the High Court dismissed the application ruling that Section 7 (f) of the Botswana Immigration\u000aAct relates to what the President considers to be in the best interest of Botswana, and Sections 11(6) and\u000a36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the merits.\u000a6. On 31st May 2005, the victim was deported from Botswana to South Africa.\u000a7. On 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal of the Republic\u000aof Botswana. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing the victim's appeal.\u000aThe Court of Appeal held that the President, in making such declarations, is empowered to act in what he\u000aconsiders to be the best interest of the country, without judicial oversight.\u000a8. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana. No\u000afurther right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this court.\u000a\u000aComplaint\u000a9. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Articles 1, 2, 7 (1) (a), 9, 12 (4), and 18\u000aof the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a10. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 24th November 2005.\u000a11. During the 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2006, the African\u000aCommission was seized of the communication.\u000a12. On 15th December 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties accordingly\u000aand requested them to submit arguments on admissibility. The Secretariat of the African Commission\u000aforwarded a copy of the complaint to the Respondent State.\u000a13. On 13th March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received written submissions on\u000aadmissibility from the Complainants.\u000a14. By Note Verbale dated 5th April 2006, the Secretariat forwarded a copy of the Complainants'\u000asubmission on admissibility to the Respondent State and reminded the latter to submit its arguments on the\u000asame.\u000a15. On 18th April 2006, the Secretariat received an e-mail from one of the lawyers of the alleged victim\u000arequesting to be invited to make oral submission at the 39th Ordinary Session.\u000a16. On 6th May 2006, the Secretariat received the submission on admissibility from the Respondent State.\u000a17. On 10th May 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the Centre for\u000aHuman Rights of the University of Pretoria submitting an amicus curiae brief.\u000a18. On 20th May 2006, the Secretariat received further submission on admissibility from the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a19. At its 39th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the communication and decided to\u000adefer it to its 40th Ordinary Session.\u000a1\u000a\u000a20. By Note Verbale and by letter dated 14th July 2006, the Secretariat notified both parties of the decision\u000aof the Commission and informed them that they can make further submission on admissibility if they so\u000awished.\u000a21. On 3rd October 2006, the Secretariat received a fax from the Complainants forwarding a copy of a letter\u000aof appeal addressed by the victim to the President of the Republic of Botswana, and the response of the\u000aSenior Private Secretary to the President.\u000a22. On 4th October 2006, the Secretariat received the Complainants' response to the Respondent State's\u000afurther submission on admissibility.\u000a23. On 7th November 2006, the Secretariat received a letter from the Respondent State requesting the\u000aCommission to purge the Complainants' additional submissions from the record because the State was not\u000ainvited to make additional submission.\u000a24. At its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 15th to 29th November 2006, both parties\u000awere given audience before the Commission and the State requested to receive copy of the letter sent to\u000athe Complainants inviting further arguments, and to be given time to respond to the additional submissions\u000amade by the Complainants.\u000a25. The Commission decided to defer consideration of the communication to its 41st Ordinary Session and\u000ainstructed the Secretariat to forward a copy of the above letter to the Respondent State.\u000a26. By Note Verbale dated 12th February 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the above letter to the\u000aRespondent State and requested the latter to submit its observation on the same.\u000a27. On 25th April 2007, the Secretariat received the response of the Respondent State on the\u000aComplainants' further submissions.\u000a28. By Note Verbale dated 30th April 2007, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Respondent State's\u000aresponse.\u000a29. At its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the communication and decided to\u000adeclare it admissible.\u000a30. By Note Verbale of 20th June 2007 and letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\u000aCommission's decision.\u000a31. On 2nd October 2007 and 10th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' and\u000aRespondent State's submissions on the merits, respectively.\u000a32. By Note Verbale of 22nd October 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat acknowledged\u000areceipt of the Complainants' and Respondent State's submissions on the merits and forwarded each other's\u000asubmission to the other party.\u000a33. At the 42nd Ordinary Session the Secretariat received the Complainants' response to the Respondent\u000aState's submissions on the merits.\u000a34. During the same 42nd Ordinary Session, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection on the\u000aprocedure of the Commission and the Commission decided to defer the communication to allow the\u000aSecretariat prepare a decision on the preliminary objection.\u000a35. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed both\u000aparties of the Commission's decision.\u000a36. At its 44th Ordinary Session, the Commission dismissed the Respondent State's preliminary objections\u000aand requested that both parties submit within three months, their responses to the submissions of the other\u000aparty.\u000a37. By Note Verbale of 5th January 2009 and letter of the same date, both parties were informed of the\u000aCommission's decision and requested to make further submissions on the merits within three months.\u000a38. On 3rd February 2009, the Respondent State requested for a month extension of time to make further\u000asubmissions on the merits.\u000a39. By Note Verbale of 9th February 2009, the Secretariat granted the extension of time requested by the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a40. By letter of 10th February 2009, the Complainant was informed of the extension of time granted to the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a41. By a Note Verbale dated 27th March 2009, the Secretariat invited the Respondent State to forward its\u000afurther submissions on the merits.\u000a42. On 7th November 2009, the Respondent State made a complaint regarding the procedures followed by\u000athe Secretariat in inviting the parties to make further submissions on the merits.\u000a43. On 8th April 2009, the Respondent State made further submissions objecting against the Commission's\u000aapproach and application of the procedure laid down in Rule 119(2) [and] (3) of [its] Rules [of] Procedure\u000a2\u000a\u000aand requested the Commission to review its ruling.\u000a44. By Note Verbale dated 14th April 2009, the Secretariat notified the Respondent State of the\u000aCommission's decision to take a decision on the merits during its 45th Ordinary Session and further invited\u000athe State to make its submissions no later than 30th April 2009.\u000a45. By a Note Verbale of 16th April 2009, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State that the latter's\u000aconcerns and issues will be tabled before the Commission during its 45th Ordinary Session.\u000a46. By a letter and Note Verbale of 7th December 2009, the Complainants and Respondent State were\u000ainformed of the Commission's decision to defer consideration of the communication to its 47th Ordinary\u000aSession.\u000a\u000aLaw\u000aAdmissibility\u000aComplainants' submission\u000a\u000a47. The Complainants submit that the requirements set in Article 56 of the African Charter have been\u000asatisfied, as the author of the communication has been identified and relevant details of the Communication\u000ahave been provided to the Commission, including details of those individuals and organisations\u000arepresenting the victim. According to the Complainants, the communication is compatible with the\u000aConstitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. The communication is presented in a\u000apolite and respectful language, and is based on information provided by the victim and on court documents,\u000anot on media reports. The Complainants state that the present communication has not been submitted to\u000aany other international human rights body for investigation or settlement.\u000a48. The Complainants claim that on 7th March 2005, the victim launched an application challenging the\u000aconstitutionality of the Botswana Immigration Act. The application, which challenged the President's\u000adecision to expel him from Botswana, was dismissed by the High Court of Botswana in a unanimous\u000ajudgment. They submit that the High Court in its judgment found that the President's declaration under\u000aSection 7(f) of the Immigration Act relates to what the President considers to be in the best interests of\u000aBotswana and Sections 11(6) and 36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the\u000amerits.\u000a49. The Complainants submit further that on 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal\u000ato the Court of Appeal, in which he sought an order setting aside both the judgment appealed against and\u000athe decision of the President of 18th February 2005. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a\u000ajudgment dismissing the victim's appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the President in making such\u000adeclarations is empowered to act in what he considers to be the best interests of the country, without\u000ajudicial oversight and that the Parliament which decreed that the President's decisions are not subject to\u000adisclosure did not act ultra vires in doing so.\u000a50. The Complainants aver that both Courts found that the President, in making his declaration that the\u000avictim was an "undesirable inhabitant or visitor to Botswana", is empowered to act in what he considers to\u000abe the best interests of the country, without judicial oversight. The Courts ruled that in terms of the Act, the\u000aPresident's decisions are not subject to disclosure or challenge in a court of law and he did not act ultra\u000avires.\u000a51. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana and no\u000afurther right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this Court.\u000a52. As a result of the above, the Complainants argue that all domestic remedies available in the\u000aRespondent State have been exhausted for the purpose of Article 56(5). They also submit that the\u000acommunication is brought before the Commission within three months of having exhausted such domestic\u000aremedies, pursuant to Article 56(6).\u000aRespondent State's Submissions\u000a\u000a53. In its submissions, the Respondent State challenges the Commission's existence and its competence\u000ato hear the case. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the\u000aCommission was established within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and that the OAU ceased to\u000aexist in July 2001, and no provision was made for the continuance of the work of the Commission in the\u000a3\u000a\u000aConstitutive Act of the African Union (AU) that took over from the OAU.\u000a54. The State further submits that Article 5\u000a× Article 5 Organs of the Union\u000a1. The organs of the Union shall be: (a) The Assembly of the Union; (b) The Executive Council; (c) The\u000aPan-African Parliament; (d) The Court of Justice; (e) The Commission; (f) The Permanent Representatives\u000aCommittee; (g) The Specialised Technical Committees; (h) The Economic, Social and Cultural Council; (i)\u000aThe Financial Institutions;\u000a2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.\u000aof the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and that the\u000aAU did not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1) (d)\u000a× The functions of the Assembly shall be to:...d. Establish any organ of the Union;\u000aof the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The\u000aRespondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.\u000a55. However, the Respondent State does not challenge the existence of the African Charter, which it\u000aconsiders a "mere instrument of noble ideals which unfortunately is devoid of any operational structures...".\u000a56. With respect to the Commission's competence rationae materae (subject matter of the communication),\u000athe Respondent State holds that the communication concerns immigration matters which are not part of the\u000amandate of the Commission spelled out in Article 45 of the Charter. The State submits further that in terms\u000aof [popup=Article 13] Functions of the Executive Council\u000a1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the\u000aMember States, including the following:\u000a\u000a1. foreign trade;\u000a2. energy, industry and mineral resources;\u000a3. food, agricultural and animal resources, livestock production and forestry;\u000a4. water resources and irrigation;\u000a5. environmental protection, humanitarian action and disaster response and relief;\u000a6. transport and communications;\u000a7. insurance;\u000a8. education, culture, health and human resources development;\u000a9. science and technology;\u000a10. nationality, residency and immigration matters;\u000a11. social security, including the formulation of mother and child care policies, as well as policies\u000arelating to the disabled and the handicapped;\u000a12. establishment of a system of African awards, medals and prizes.\u000a2. The Executive Council shall be responsible to the Assembly. It shall consider issues referred to it and\u000amonitor the implementation of policies formulated by the Assembly.\u000a3. The Executive Council may delegate any of its powers and functions mentioned in paragraph 1 of this\u000aArticle to the Specialised Technical Committees established under Article 14 of this Act.[/popup] of the\u000aConstitutive Act, it is the Executive Council which is responsible for immigration matters.\u000a57. The Respondent State argues that in case the Commission finds itself to be in existence and to have\u000ajurisdiction over the matter, the communication should notwithstanding be declared inadmissible for\u000anon-compliance with Article 56 of the African Charter.\u000a58. It is the State's view that the communication is not compatible with the African Charter. It submits that\u000anot all the elements of the communication have been disclosed to the State, placing the latter "in an\u000auntenable position where it does not know the exact nature of the Complaint against it," and that therefore\u000athe communication is irregular and/or non-compliant with Rule 104(e) as read with Article 56(2) of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a59. The Respondent State also states that Article 23(1) of the African Charter recognises peoples' rights to\u000anational and international peace and security, and that Article 12(2) allows States Parties to restrict the right\u000ato freedom of movement by means of law for the "protection of national security, law and order...". The\u000a4\u000a\u000aState holds that the interpretation of these provisions is that "States must be left alone and allowed to deal\u000awith matters of peace and national security". The Respondent State submits that the matter before the\u000aCommission involves national security and that the Commission has no competence over it.\u000a60. The Respondent State further submits that the decision to expel the victim was taken by the President\u000ain accordance with the law as required under Article 12(4) of the African Charter.\u000a61. The Respondent State argues that the victim's expulsion was confirmed by the courts and that the\u000aState has the obligation under Article 26 of the Charter to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and\u000acannot interfere with their rulings.\u000a62. The Respondent State also states that the victim's appeal to courts in Botswana was dismissed with\u000acosts, which he has not yet paid, and that by instituting proceedings before the Commission he is just trying\u000ato escape his obligation in Botswana. The State concludes that the communication is frivolous and\u000avexatious, and that it should be rejected and held inadmissible.\u000a63. The Respondent State further submits that the victim did not avail himself of the possibility offered to\u000ahim to resort to the President to review the decision expelling him. It is therefore the State's submission that\u000alocal remedies have not been exhausted.\u000a64. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Respondent State prays the Commission to declare the\u000acommunication inadmissible.\u000aResponse of the Complainants to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility\u000a\u000a65. The Complainants submit that the fact that the OAU ceased to exist does not affect the existence of the\u000aCommission, and that the latter continues to exist de facto and de jure. De facto, the work of the\u000aCommission was not hindered or suspended as a result of the coming into force of the AU Constitutive Act:\u000ait continued considering communications; holding sessions; undertaking visits to State Parties, including the\u000aRespondent State, which continues to collaborate with it. De jure, the AU Assembly, by its decision, ruled\u000athat the Commission "shall henceforth operate within the framework of the African Union".\u000a66. The Complainants argue that the African Charter established the Commission and the fact that the\u000aAfrican Charter is still in force, as the Respondent State did acknowledge, is tantamount to recognising the\u000aexistence of the African Commission.\u000a67. With respect to the disclosure of documents to the State, the Complainants argue that the\u000acommunication is not based on media reports but on the information provided by the victim and on court\u000adocuments, and that only two judgments have been enclosed because they are the only ones relevant at\u000athe particular stage of the proceedings and from the point of view of exhaustion of domestic remedies.\u000a68. The Complainants also challenge the argument of the Respondent State that the Commission does not\u000ahave jurisdiction over immigration matters. They submit that that Article 45(2) mandates the Commission to\u000aprotect human rights generally, without leaving out the rights of immigrants or people facing deportation,\u000anoting that Article 12 of the Charter makes clear reference to migration.\u000a69. The Complainants finally submit that the other points of the State's submission relate to the merits and\u000ashould not be considered at this stage of the procedure, adding that the communication meets all the\u000aadmissibility requirements and should be declared admissible.\u000aRespondent State's reaction to the Complainant's response to its submissions\u000a\u000a70. In an oral submission during the 40th Ordinary Session of the Commission, and by letter dated 22nd\u000aMarch 2007, the Respondent State submitted that the additional submission on admissibility by the\u000aComplainants should be purged from the record of proceedings because the invitation to make additional\u000asubmission was a misuse of the procedure under Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure. It is\u000athe Respondent State's view that no reason was given for inviting the Complainants to submit and that the\u000aletter was signed by a Finance and Administration Officer (FAO), who is not a member of the Commission,\u000aand in inviting the Complainants to submit, the FAO unlawfully participated in the deliberations or decisions\u000aof the Commission.\u000a71. The Respondent State goes on to reiterate its statement that the Commission is an emanation of the\u000aCharter, which established it to work within the OAU. The dissolution of the OAU, the State submits,\u000adeprived the Commission of the legitimacy and authority as mechanism for the settling of disputes.\u000aAccording to the Respondent State, in the absence of an amendment to Article 30 of the African Charter to\u000aenable the Commission to operate within the AU, and without an AU decision integrating the Commission\u000aas an organ of the AU, the African Commission lacks legal basis to continue performing its mandate under\u000a5\u000a\u000athe African Charter.\u000aDecision of the Commission on the Respondent State's challenge of its existence and competence\u000a\u000a72. Considering that the Respondent State contests the existence of the African Commission and its\u000ajurisdiction to hear the matter complained of, the Commission will deal with those two points before dealing\u000awith the admissibility of the communication.\u000a73. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the Commission was\u000aestablished within the OAU, and that the OAU ceased to exist in July 2001 and no provision was made for\u000athe continuance of the work of the Commission in the Constitutive Act of the African Union that took over\u000afrom the OAU.\u000a74. According to the Respondent State, Article 5\u000a× 1. The organs of the Union shall be:\u000a1. The Assembly of the Union;\u000a2. The Executive Council;\u000a3. The Pan-African Parliament;\u000a4. The Court of Justice;\u000a5. The Commission;\u000a6. The Permanent Representatives Committee;\u000a7. The Specialised Technical Committees;\u000a8. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council;\u000a9. The Financial Institutions;\u000a\u000a2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.\u000aof the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and the AU\u000adid not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1)(d)\u000a× 1. The functions of the Assembly shall be to: (d) establish any organ of the Union\u000aof the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The\u000aRespondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.\u000a75. In terms of Article 30 of the African Charter, "An African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, ...\u000ashall be established within the Organisation of African Unity to promote human and peoples' rights and\u000aensure their protection in Africa". It is the Commission's view that having been established by the African\u000aCharter, the termination of a treaty other than the Charter cannot affect its existence.\u000a76. The Commission would like to emphasise that although it was established by the African Charter and\u000anot a direct emanation of the OAU Charter, it was operating within the framework of the OAU, the latter\u000abeing the main political organisation on the continent. As an organisation working within the framework of\u000athe OAU, the Commission relied on the OAU for its funding and its staffing,1 and for the execution of its\u000adecisions against Members States found to be in violation of the Charter2 . With the coming into force of the\u000aConstitutive Act, all the "assets and liabilities" of the OAU "... and all matters relating thereto'' including\u000arelevant institutions established within the OAU, were devolved to the AU3 . That is why, the Heads of State\u000aand Government of the AU, at their first Ordinary Session held in Durban, South Africa, from 8th to 10th July\u000a2002, accepted to take over the obligations the OAU used to bear vis-?-vis the African Commission. In its\u000adecision on the Interim Period, the Assembly of the African Union decided that "the African Commission on\u000aHuman and Peoples' Rights and the African Committee of Experts on Rights and Welfare of the Child shall\u000ahenceforth operate within the framework of the African Union"4 .\u000a77. As a matter of fact, the AU assumed towards the Commission the same obligations as previously borne\u000aby the OAU. The AU appoints the 11 Members of the Commission, provides staff to the Secretariat, funds\u000athe day-to-day work of the Commission, and adopts the reports submitted by the Commission. Moreover,\u000aMember States of the AU (which are also State Parties to the African Charter), including the Respondent\u000aState, continue to cooperate with the African Commission, by submitting their reports under Article 62 of the\u000aCharter, by hosting sessions and missions of the Commission, and by actively participating in the\u000acommunication procedures when complaints are brought against them before the Commission.\u000a78. The Commission takes note of the fact that, although it challenges the existence of the Commission as\u000a6\u000a\u000aa monitoring body, the Respondent State does not contest the existence of the Charter itself. The\u000aCommission observes that, unlike some other international human rights systems where the substantive\u000arights and their monitoring bodies are dealt within two complementary but different instruments, in the\u000aAfrican system, the same instrument, the African Charter, makes provisions for substantive rights and\u000aorganises their monitoring mechanism5 . Under the Charter, therefore, States Parties are not given the\u000aoption of recognising the substantive rights without accepting the jurisdiction of the African Commission,\u000awhich was established to promote and protect those rights.\u000a79. The Commission concludes that the termination of the OAU Charter and subsequent dissolution of the\u000aOAU does not affect its existence. The Commission is still in existence and performs its activities within the\u000aframework of the AU.\u000a80. Regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission over immigration matters, the Commission is of the view\u000athat there is no provision in the African Charter or in the Constitutive Act excluding the jurisdiction of the\u000aAfrican Commission over such matters. The jurisdiction of the Commission is founded by Article 45 of the\u000aAfrican Charter which reads: "The functions of the Commission shall be [to]: 2. Ensure the protection of\u000ahuman and peoples' rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter."\u000a81. This provision should be read together with the relevant substantive provisions of the Charter to find out\u000awhether, under its protection mandate, the Commission has jurisdiction over a given matter. Regarding\u000aspecifically immigration matters, Article 12 of the Charter states that:\u000a1. "Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a\u000a2.\u000aState provided he abides by the law.\u000a3. Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his\u000acountry. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of\u000anational security, law and order, public health or morality.\u000a4. Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries\u000ain accordance with the law of those countries and international conventions.\u000a5. A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be\u000aexpelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law.\u000a6. The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is\u000aaimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups."\u000a82. It appears from the provision of Article 45(2), read together with Article 12, that the Commission has\u000ajurisdiction when some human rights related to immigration are involved. The mandate of the Commission\u000ain that case is to make sure that, immigration policies and practices do not infringe upon those rights.\u000aHence, the Commission finds that it has jurisdiction over immigration matters.\u000a83. The Commission is of the view that the competence given to it over immigration matters under Article\u000a45(2) and Article 12 of the Charter, does not overlap with the mandate of the Executive Council, under\u000aArticle 13(1)(j)\u000a× 1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to\u000athe Member States, including the following: (j) nationality, residency and immigration matters;\u000aof the Constitutive Act, over the same matters because the two bodies do not perform the same kind of\u000aactivity. While the Commission is an international quasi-judicial institution established to promote and\u000aprotect the rights enshrined in the African Charter, the Executive Council is a political organ, which\u000a"coordinate[s] and take[s] decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the member states [of the\u000aAfrican Union], including...nationality, residency and immigration matters"6 .\u000a84. Having dealt with the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent State regarding the existence\u000aand jurisdiction of the Commission, the latter will now proceed to make a determination on the admissibility\u000aor otherwise of this communication.\u000aThe Commission's analysis on admissibility\u000a\u000a85. The admissibility of communications submitted before the African Commission in accordance with\u000aArticle 55 is governed by the requirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. In terms of Article 56:\u000a"Communications relating to human and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55 received by the\u000aCommission, shall be considered if they:\u000a\u000a7\u000a\u000a1. Indicate their authors even if the latter requests anonymity,\u000a2. Are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter,\u000a3. Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its\u000ainstitutions or to the Organisation of African Unity,\u000a4. Are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media,\u000a5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\u000aprolonged,\u000a6. Are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the\u000adate the Commission is seized with the matter, and\u000a7. Do not deal with cases which have been settled by those States involved in accordance with the\u000aprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or\u000athe provisions of the present Charter."\u000a86. The African Commission is of the view that this communication establishes a prima facie violation of the\u000aprovisions of the African Charter, and is compatible with both the Constitutive Act of the African Union and\u000athe African Charter. The African Commission also does not believe that there has been any use of a\u000adisparaging or insulting language against the Government of the Republic of Botswana or any of its\u000ainstitutions or the African Union.\u000a87. Regarding the disclosure of documents, the Commission finds that the documents submitted by the\u000aComplainants in support of the claim sufficiently prove that the communication is not based on fiction or on\u000anews disseminated by the mass media. The Commission concurs, therefore, that the condition of Article\u000a56(4) has been met. The Commission also notes that all the documents submitted by the Complainants\u000ahave been disclosed to the Respondent State.\u000a88. The Commission recalls its established jurisprudence whereby the exhaustion of local remedies\u000areferred to in Article 56(5) 'entails remedy sought from the courts of a judicial nature.'7 Such a judicial\u000aremedy shall be effective and shall not be subordinated to the discretionary power of public authorities8 .\u000aThe Commission has also affirmed on several occasions that it is not necessary, for the sake of meeting\u000athe condition of Article 56(5), to seek 'remedies from a source which does not operate impartially and have\u000ano obligation to decide according to legal principles' 9 .\u000a89. In the present communication, the victim challenged the decision expelling him from Botswana before\u000athe domestic courts. His application before the High Court of Botswana was dismissed, as was a further\u000aappeal that he filed with the Court of Appeal, the highest judicial authority in Botswana. The Commission\u000afinds therefore that all local remedies have been exhausted. The Commission is of the view that the\u000apresidential review referred to by the Respondent State is not of a judicial nature and is subject to the\u000adiscretionary power of the President, the very authority that ordered the expulsion of the victim. The\u000aCommission considers that such a remedy is not effective and the victim is not obliged to utilise it.\u000a90. The Commission further finds that the other arguments10 submitted by the State against the\u000aadmissibility of the communication are based on substantive rights protected under the Charter, including\u000athe rights, the violation of which is complained of by the applicant, to such an extent that dealing with them\u000aat this stage of the procedure would be pushing the Commission to jump the gun to consider the\u000acommunication on the merits. The Commission therefore will not pronounce on them but would rather deal\u000awith them at the appropriate stage.\u000a91. From the above submissions, this Commission is of the view that the present communication\u000asufficiently complies with the requirements under Article 56, relating to the admissibility of communications\u000abefore the African Commission and thus decides to declare the communication admissible.\u000aMerits\u000aRespondent State's preliminary objection to the Commission's procedure\u000a\u000a92. At the 42nd Ordinary Session of the Commission, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection\u000aregarding the Commission's procedure in the handling of complaints/communications. The main thrust of\u000athe State's objection is that the Commission's procedure relating to the handling of communications was\u000anot followed with regards to the present communication. According to the State, Rule 119 of the\u000aCommission's Rules of Procedure was not respected, and as a result, both parties to the communication,\u000athe Respondent State and the Complainants, made submissions to the Commission at almost the same\u000a8\u000a\u000atime, making it difficult to respond to issues raised by either party.\u000a93. The Respondent State submits that the Commission had asked both parties to submit their arguments\u000aon the merits, giving both parties the same deadline. Both parties sent their arguments to the Secretariat of\u000athe Commission at almost the same time, and the Commission then forwarded the submissions of either\u000aparty to the other for comments, if any.\u000a94. The Respondent State contends that this procedure deprives it from properly addressing the issues\u000araised by the Complainants as it was not availed a copy of the Complainants' submission prior to the\u000aRespondent State making its own submission. In the words of the Respondent State "it prejudices\u000aBotswana greatly in that the applicant has effectively been afforded an undue opportunity to strengthen his\u000acase, to the extent that the submissions filed by him raise very many new matters of fact and law which our\u000aarguments, as is to be expected, do not deal with". The Respondent State concluded that the\u000aComplainants' supplementary submissions on the merits be purged off the record.\u000a95. Referring to Rule 119 of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure, the State maintains that it was\u000asupposed to have submitted first and the Complainants given the opportunity to reply within a time fixed by\u000athe Commission, in accordance with Rule 119 (3).\u000a96. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue raised by the Respondent State before\u000aproceeding to make a determination on the merits of the communication.\u000aAfrican Commission's decision on the preliminary objection\u000a\u000a97. In the present communication, after declaring the case admissible at the Commission's 41st Ordinary\u000aSession, the Secretariat, by Note Verbale of 20th June 2007, and letter of the same date, informed both\u000aparties and requested them to submit their arguments on the merits within three months from the date of\u000anotification. On 5th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' submissions on the merits of\u000athe communication. On 12th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on\u000athe merits. On 22nd October 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the submissions of the Respondent State to\u000athe Complainants, and the Complainants to the Respondent State.\u000a98. The purpose of requiring parties to make submissions to the Commission is so that they appreciate the\u000aconcerns of each other and try to address them as best as they can. That is why the Commission adopted\u000aRules of Procedure governing, among other things, the receipt and consideration of communications.\u000a99. Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure seek to guide the Commission regarding the\u000aprocedure to adopt after a communication has been declared admissible. In terms of Rule 119 (1) "if the\u000aCommission decides that a communication is admissible...its decision and text of the relevant documents\u000ashall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned...The author of the communication\u000ashall also be informed of the Commission's decision...". Rule 119 (2) provides further that the State Party\u000a"... shall within the ensuing three months, submit in writing to the Commission, ...measures it was able to\u000atake to remedy the situation".\u000a100. From the above two paragraphs of Rule 119, it is the view of the Commission that when a\u000acommunication is declared admissible, both parties must be notified of the decision. While the African\u000aCharter obliges the Commission to submit its decisions and other relevant texts relating to its decision on\u000aadmissibility to the State Party, it simply requires the Commission to inform the author of the\u000acommunication. This presupposes that the Respondent State is the one that is expected to make\u000asubmissions on the merits, to, in the words of the Charter, provide "explanations or statements elucidating\u000athe issue under consideration and indicating, if possible, measures it was able to take to remedy the\u000asituation".\u000a101. This interpretation is supported when one turns to Rule 119 (3) which provides that 'all explanations or\u000astatements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be communicated... to the author\u000aof the communication, who may submit in writing additional information and observations within a time limit\u000afixed by the Commission'.\u000a102. It is clear from the above, that after declaring a communication admissible, both parties are informed\u000aof the decision, but the Respondent State is further requested to make submissions on the matter being\u000aconsidered. After the State would have submitted, then the submission is availed to the author of the\u000acommunication for his/her comments. The Respondent State seems to be satisfied that the Note Verbale of\u000a20th June inviting it to make submissions on the merits "was the correct step".\u000a103. However, the Respondent State contends that if the Complainants were also invited to make\u000asubmissions on the merits "that was a defective step and clearly the Commission will be guilty of breaking\u000a9\u000a\u000aits own procedural rules".\u000a104. The procedure of letting one party submit first and inviting the other to respond will give both parties\u000athe opportunity to address the issues or concerns of the other. This exchange of submissions between the\u000aState and the author of the communication can continue until the Commission is satisfied that it has had\u000aenough information to make a decision on the matter.\u000a105. The African Commission thus concurs with the Respondent State that when parties are asked to\u000asubmit at the same time, it does not give both of them the opportunity to respond to issues that are raised\u000aby the other party.\u000a106. This notwithstanding, the practice of the Commission is clear. Where it receives submissions from one\u000aparty, it sends the same to the other party for their comments. Thus, even if the parties make submissions\u000aat the same time, the other party is not prejudiced in any way because they are still given an opportunity to\u000arespond to the submissions before the Commission can make a determination. This was the situation with\u000arespect to the present communication.\u000a107. The Secretariat received the State's submissions on 12th October 2007 and sent same to the\u000aComplainants on 22nd October 2007. Thus, the Respondent State was sent the Complainant's submissions\u000aand the Complainants were sent the State's submissions, and both parties were entitled to send comments,\u000aif any.\u000a108. Thus, even though Rule 119 was not followed to the letter, the Respondent State has not indicated\u000ahow it was prejudiced by this lapse, to the advantage of the Complainants. The Respondent State has been\u000agiven an equal opportunity to respond to the submissions of the Complainants just as the Complainants\u000ahave been given an opportunity to respond to the State's submissions.\u000a109. The Commission accordingly takes note of the fact that Rule 119 of its Rules of Procedure was not\u000afollowed to the letter, and undertakes to ensure that it is complied with in the future. It holds that since the\u000aRespondent State has been given time to respond to the Complainants' submission, its argument that the\u000aComplainants' submissions on the matter be purged from the record cannot stand. The African Commission\u000aaccordingly requests both parties to submit their responses, within three months, on the arguments made\u000aby either party.\u000a\u000aComplainants' submissions on the merits\u000a\u000a110. The Complainants allege that the existence and application of the Botswana Immigration Act has\u000aviolated Articles 1, 2, 7(1) (a), 9, 12(4) and 18 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 1\u000a\u000a111. With respect to the alleged violation of Article 1 of the African Charter, Complainants submit that the\u000aCharter was adopted and acceded to voluntarily by African States and that once ratified, States Parties to\u000athe Charter are legally bound by its provisions, adding that States wishing not to be bound ought to have\u000arefrained from ratifying.\u000a112. The Complainants refer to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which states\u000athat "a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\u000athe terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose". The Complainants also\u000amake reference to Legal Resources Foundation v Zambia11 where the Commission stated that the African\u000aCharter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each other. The African Charter must\u000aalso be interpreted, in light of international norms and consistently with the approach of the other regional\u000aand international human rights bodies.\u000a113. The Complainants assert that the fact that the African Charter has not been incorporated into\u000aBotswana domestic law may preclude persons in Botswana from relying on the provisions of the Charter\u000abefore local courts but does not affect recourse to the Commission under the African Charter. States are\u000abound by their ratification of the African Charter whether monist or dualist and even where it revokes the\u000adomestic effect of the Charter12 . Consequently, they argue, all the provisions of the African Charter\u000aaddressed below indicate the Respondent State's failure to respect the African Charter and to ensure its full\u000aimplementation in violation of Article 1 of the same.\u000a\u000a10\u000a\u000aAlleged Violation of Articles 7(1)(a)&12(4)\u000a\u000a114. The Complainants allege that the victim was deprived by law from accessing information relating to\u000athe reasons for his being declared a threat to national security, which in turn denied judicial authorities the\u000aright to review the President's decisions. Together, these denials, according to the Complainants, amount\u000ato a clear violation of the right to appeal to competent judicial organs, a situation that affects the right to be\u000aheard. In this regard, they contend that the right to be heard entails the right to challenge in a court of law,\u000adecisions that affect the individual's fundamental rights13 .\u000a115. Depending on Sections 7(f), 11(6) and 36 of the Botswana Immigration Act, the Complainants aver\u000athat the courts that determined the victim's application and appeal prior to and following his expulsion,\u000afound that he had no right to any information regarding the President's decision, and that the courts had no\u000apower to question the reason for his expulsion and that there was no legal limit to the unfettered discretion\u000aof the President.\u000a116. According to the Complainants, the victim was not afforded any meaningful opportunity to challenge\u000ahis expulsion either by way of hearing before the expulsion order was made, or by way of appeal after the\u000aorder was made. He was not provided with the reasons for his expulsion and was accordingly not afforded\u000aan opportunity to challenge those reasons or provide evidence which might contradict them. He was neither\u000agiven any remedy in respect of the violations of his rights. These decisions and the underlying provisions of\u000aSections 11(6) and 36 of the Immigration Act, according to the Complainants, are inconsistent with basic\u000aprinciples of due process enshrined in Article 7 of the African Charter.\u000a117. The Complainants aver that any decision passed "in accordance with the law" as provided under\u000aArticle 12(4) of the African Charter should fulfil the following three requirements: one, it should be provided\u000ain a clear and accessible law to offer predictability and to guard against arbitrariness; two, it "...must be\u000amade by a court or an administrative authority on the basis of a law affording protection against arbitrary\u000aexpulsion through the establishment of corresponding procedural guarantees"14 In relation with this they\u000arefer to the Commission's decision in Modise v Botswana15 where the Commission stated that "in\u000aaccordance with law" requires not only strict conformity with national law, but also with the principles of the\u000aAfrican Charter and other international norms. Third, he contends that the procedural guarantees under\u000aArticle 12(4) enshrine the right to meaningful judicial oversight of administrative decisions.\u000a118. With regard to the issue of national security, the Complainants submit that while the victim's case\u000araises no genuine issue of "national security", it is noted that, even where such legitimate concerns do\u000aarise, they do not provide a basis to set aside the rights protected in the African Charter. They argue that\u000awhile legitimate security concerns can be taken into account in interpreting the African Charter, they cannot\u000aerode the essence of the rights protected, including the right protected under Article 12(4). The\u000aComplainants refer to Commission nationale des droits de l'Homme et des libertés v Chad16 where the\u000aCommission stated that the African Charter does not allow States Parties to derogate from their treaty\u000aobligations even during emergency situations. They also refer to Amnesty International v Zambia17 where\u000athe Commission found a violation of Article 12(4) where the national court did not consider Zambia's\u000aobligations under the African Charter and failed to rule on the ground that the Complainant was likely to\u000a"endanger peace and good order in Zambia". According to the Commission, "there was no judicial inquiry\u000aon the basis in law and in terms of administrative justice for relying on this 'opinion' of the Minister of Home\u000aAffairs for the action taken".\u000a119. The Complainants contend that the President did not give reasons for the victim's deportation, neither\u000adid he explain or justify his decision and considerations of national security. The President, according to the\u000aComplainants, applied a law which afforded him an apparently limitless power to make a declaration which\u000ahas the effect of causing an individual to become [[span class="JQ-quotes"]]"a prohibited immigrant". This\u000apower is attended by a blanket denial of information as to the basis for its exercise. A law of this breadth\u000aand potentially all encompassing scope, the Complainants argue, lacks the clarity and precision required of\u000a>\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000a

aV328/06 Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda\u000av Republic of Angola\u000aSummary of facts:\u000a1. The Complaint is brought by the Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda - FLEC (the\u000aComplainant) on behalf of the people of Cabinda (Victims) against the Republic of Angola1 (the\u000aRespondent State or Angola).\u000a2. The Complainant submits that Cabinda, formerly known as the Portuguese Congo, consists of a territory\u000aof approximately 2800 square miles. The Complainant further submits that in 1885 the independent rulers\u000aof Cabinda city and its environs entered into a treaty, the Treaty of Simulambuco, with the Government of\u000athe Kingdom of Portugal establishing a Protectorate over much of present day Cabinda.\u000a3. In 1975, the Complainant alleges, the Alvor Conference in Portugal, between the colonial power and\u000aUNITA, MPLA, and FNLA (all of which were liberation movements) declared the annexation of Cabinda by\u000aAngola without any Cabindan participation. Following this event, Angola has exercised sovereignty over\u000aCabinda despite protestations by the people of Cabinda, through groups dedicated to the idea of a distinct\u000aidentity for the people of Cabinda.\u000a4. The Complainant alleges that since 2002, following attempts by groups in Cabinda to stake a claim to\u000aautonomy for the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has undertaken a massive military campaign\u000aagainst Cabinda and that when this failed, the state entered into ad hoc negotiations with Cabindan factions\u000ain an attempt to confuse issues. These negotiations, the Complainant alleges, excluded the Chairman of\u000aFLEC, Mr. Nzita Tiago - "the only universally recognized Cabindan authority" - and resulted in a 2006\u000aPeace Accord that was contested by both Cabinda and the democratic opposition in Angola, the UNITA.\u000a5. The Complainant further alleges that following the rejection of the 2006 Peace Accord by the majority of\u000aCabindans, fractions in Cabinda continued to demand local autonomy over the wealth of Cabinda. The\u000aComplainant states that the Respondent State has responded to the demands by maintaining a large\u000amilitary force in Cabinda, which has committed numerous documented human rights violations therein.2\u000a6. The Complainant claims that in 2006 the Angolan Forces (FAA) committed dozens of human rights and\u000ahumanitarian violations such as: the bombardment of civilian dwellings in the Mayombe (Piading) region;\u000asummary execution of Cabinda patriots in Buco, Zao and beatings and torture of Mpalabanda members in\u000aCaio Poba.\u000a7. It is the Complainant further claim that in July 2006 Angola banned the only independent human rights\u000aorganization in Cabinda, Mpalabnda (Associacao Civica de Cabinda) through the instrumentality of a court\u000aorder, allegedly for inciting violence and hatred, and carrying out political activities rather than being a civil\u000asociety organization.\u000a8. Furthermore, the Complainant avers, Government of the Respondent State is exercising economic\u000aexploitation of Cabindan resources since the people of Cabinda are not allowed to have any say in the\u000agrant of licences and concessions over their resources. The Complainant claims that the people of Cabinda\u000ahave been suffering comparatively higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, disease and\u000aintense poverty since the Government of the Respondent State took over Cabinda's natural resources such\u000aas offshore oil, onshore mineral and oil resources.\u000a9. The Complainant further alleges that the Government of the Respondent State has economically\u000adominated the Cabindan people by denying them their status as a people and by extracting more than\u000aninety per cent (90%) of their economic patrimony while returning less than ten per cent (10%) to Cabinda.\u000aBy this act, the Complainant alleges, the Respondent State has perpetrated neo-colonialism.\u000a10. The Complainant also contends that although Cabindans are culturally and linguistically separate from\u000aAngola and have overwhelmingly identified themselves as 'Cabindans', not Angolans, the people of\u000aCabinda have been denied their right to self-determination by Angola.\u000a11. The Complainant submits that despite over 30 years of conflict over the status of Cabinda, the\u000aRespondent State has refused to hold a referendum on the issue of Cabindan question. The Complainant\u000aalleges that the Respondent State does not permit Cabinda to determine its own economic and social\u000adevelopment. The Complainant states that all economic decisions are made in Luanda, the capital city of\u000athe Respondent State and not in Cabinda, even though Cabinda has maintained a government in exile\u000asince 1963 and has had an active self-defence force and civil administration inside Cabinda since 1975.\u000a1\u000a\u000aArticles alleged to have been violated\u000a12. The Complainant alleges that in relation to the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has violated\u000aArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\u000aPrayers of the Complainant\u000a13. The Complainant requests the African Commission on Human and Peoples Right (African Commission\u000aor Commission):\u000a1. To appoint a Special Rapporteur to undertake fact finding and make recommendations on the\u000aissues it has raised.\u000a2. Make its good offices available for further engagement on the issues raised\u000a3. Award $US 50000 against the Respondent State to cover the Complainant's legal fees and costs.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a14. This Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights (the Secretariat) on 29 September 2006. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt by letter\u000adated 2 October 2006, informing the Complainant that the Communication would be scheduled for\u000aconsideration on seizure by the African Commission at its 40th Ordinary Session held in November 2006 in\u000aBanjul, The Gambia.\u000a15. At its 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission decided to be seized of the Communication.\u000a16. On 8 January 2007, the African Commission further received a press statement issued by FLEC on the\u000acurrent struggle for the control of petroleum in Cabinda, alleging continuous violations of the African\u000aCharter by the Angolan Government and other actors for which the State is responsible.\u000a17. By a letter dated 8 February 2007 and Note Verbale dated 28 February 2007, the Secretariat informed\u000athe Parties of the Commission's decision on seizure and requested the Parties to submit their arguments on\u000athe Admissibility of the Communication within two months. A copy of the Complaint was also transmitted to\u000athe Respondent State.\u000a18. On 25 April 2007, the Secretariat sent reminders to the Parties to submit their arguments on\u000aAdmissibility by 10 May 2007 in time for the 41st Session of the African Commission. At its 41st Ordinary\u000aSession in May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission considered the Communication and deferred it\u000apending the receipt of Arguments on Admissibility from the Parties. The Parties were notified accordingly\u000aon 20 June 2007.\u000a19. On 15 August 2007, the Complainant's brief with its Arguments on Admissibility and an updated\u000astatement of facts was received at the Secretariat. These were transmitted along with a Note Verbale to the\u000aRespondent State on 20 August 2007 together with a request for the latter to submit its response to the\u000aComplainant's submission on Admissibility.\u000a20. During its 42nd Ordinary Session in November 2007, the African Commission considered the\u000aCommunication and decided to give the Respondent State one last chance to make its submissions on the\u000aAdmissibility of the Communication. The Parties were notified accordingly on 19 December 2007.\u000a21. During its 43rd and 44th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the consideration of the\u000aCommunication pending the submission on Admissibility by the Respondent State, the parties were\u000aaccordingly informed.\u000a22. On 27 April 2009 the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to make its submissions on\u000aAdmissibility.\u000a23. On 21 July 2009, the African Commission received supplementary information to the Communication by\u000athe Complainant.\u000a24. During its 45th and 46th Ordinary Sessions respectively, the African Commission considered the\u000aCommunication and deferred its decision on Admissibility pending the Respondent State's submission on\u000aAdmissibility\u000a2\u000a\u000a25. On 12 January 2010, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant urging the African\u000aCommission to take immediate action and to appoint a Special Rapporteur for Cabinda.\u000a26. During its 47th, 48th, 49th and 50th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the\u000aconsideration of the Communication, and the Parties were accordingly informed. At its 10th Extraordinary\u000aSession held in December 2011, the Commission considered the Communication and declared it\u000aAdmissible. The Parties were accordingly informed and invited to submit their Arguments on the Merit.\u000a27. Between January and March 2012, the Secretariat received submissions from three different\u000aorganisations representing different groups in Cabinda (joint submission by the Front de Liberation de\u000aL'Etat du Cabinda (FLEC) et Union Nationale de Liberation du Cabinda (UNLC), and individual submissions\u000aby the "Original FLEC" and the Mouvement Pour Le Rassemblement Du Peuple Cabindais et Pour Sa\u000aSouverainete "MRPCS). On 29 March 2012, the Secretariat received a Submission on the Merit from Dr\u000aJonathan Levy acting in his capacity as legal representative of the Complainant.3 The Complainant's\u000aSubmission on the Merit was accordingly transmitted to the Respondent State.\u000a28. On 24 April 2012, the Respondent State's Note Verbale forwarding the latter's Arguments on the Merit\u000awas received at the Secretariat and transmitted to Complainant through its legal representative.\u000a29. On 12 July 2012, the Complainant through its legal representative forwarded its Supplementary\u000aSubmission on the Merit. On 10, 12 and 28 September 2012, the Secretariat received the same copy of an\u000aupdated and amended Submission on the Merit from the Respondent State.\u000a30. On 18 June 2013, the Secretariat received additional Submissions from the "Collectif des organisations\u000acabindaises" also known as the "Original FLEC". This submission was followed by a letter protesting\u000anotification that the submission has been made out of time and a request for reopening of the procedure for\u000asubmission of additional documents by both parties.\u000a31. At its 54th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2013, the Commission considered\u000athe Communication on the Merit based on all the documents submitted by the Parties and the various\u000aAmicus briefs.\u000a\u000aThe Law\u000aAdmissibility\u000aSubmission of the Complainant on Admissibility\u000a\u000a32. Although the Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication,\u000athe Respondent State failed to submit any arguments on the admissibility of the Communication despite an\u000ainvitation and repeated reminders to do so. Accordingly, the Commission addresses the question of\u000aAdmissibility on the basis of the Complainant's arguments on Admissibility.\u000a33. The Complainant submits that the Communication meets all the Admissibility requirements set out in\u000aArticle 56 of the African Charter. Regarding Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that\u000athe Communication is submitted by FLEC on behalf of the people of Cabinda.\u000a34. Concerning Article 56 (2) of Charter, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State has violated\u000aArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter. The Complainant further submits that although the\u000aCommunication alleges serious violations of the economic and peoples" rights of the people of Cabinda by\u000athe Government of Angola, the Complainant does not request the African Commission to take up any\u000amatter that would interfere with the sovereignty of Angola or adjudication of Angolan territorial claims in\u000aCabinda. The Complainant states that they are mindful that the African Commission must respect Articles\u000a3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act regarding territorial sovereignty and respecting existing borders.\u000a35. With regards to Article 56 (3) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that the language used in\u000athe Communication is neutral legal language. In relation to Article 56 (4) of the African Charter, the\u000aComplainant submits that the Communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated through the\u000amass media, but rather on primary information provided by FLEC and other organizations directly involved\u000ain the matter.\u000a36. On the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56 (5) of the African Charter, the\u000aComplainant requests the Commission to wave this condition on the basis that exhaustion of domestic\u000aremedies is futile and legally impossible on the grounds that there is unrest and armed conflict involving the\u000aParties and this creates difficulties for the commencement of legal proceedings by the Complainant. The\u000aComplainant avers further that the only independent civil society organisation which could have brought a\u000a3\u000a\u000alegal action on behalf of the Complainant has been disbanded and banned by judicial order instigated by\u000athe Respondent State. It is also the Complainant's submission that it cannot pursue legal action in the\u000aRespondent State because it (the Complainant) has been branded a terrorist organisation since the signing\u000aof a 2006 Peace Accord between the Respondent States and elements in Cabinda.\u000a37. As to Article 56 (6) of the African Charter, the Complainants aver that the Communication has been\u000asubmitted in a timely manner. Lastly, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with the\u000arequirement of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter because the Communication does not deal with a case\u000awhich has been settled by the Respondent State.\u000aThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\u000a\u000a38. Article 56 of the African Charter lists seven Admissibility requirements that have to be cumulatively\u000afulfilled for a Communication to be declared Admissible. In the present Communication, while the\u000aComplainant has clearly stated its arguments as to why the Communication meets each of the seven\u000arequirements stipulated under Article 56, the Respondent State has not made any submission to contest or\u000arefute those claims.\u000a39. From the time when the African Commission was seized with the Communication during its 40th\u000aOrdinary Session in November 2006 to date, ten (10) reminders were sent to the Respondent State\u000arequesting the latter to submit its arguments on Admissibility to no avail.4\u000a40. As the African Commission has stated in the case of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in\u000aAfrica v. Republic of Angola5 "in the face of the state's failure to address itself to the complaint filed against\u000ait, the African Commission has no option but to proceed with its consideration of the Communication in\u000aaccordance with its Rules of Procedure." In the same decision, the African Commission re-affirmed its\u000aposition by ruling that "... it would proceed to consider Communications on the basis of the submission of\u000athe Complainants and information at its disposal, even if the State fails to submit."6\u000a41. In the case at hand, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with all the seven\u000arequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter, except the one relating to the exhaustion of local\u000aremedies under Article 56 (5), for which the Complainant asks for waiver.\u000a42. In the absence of any submissions from the Respondent State to the contrary, the African Commission\u000ahas considered the Complainant's Submission and is convinced that all the requirements under Article 56,\u000aexcept Article 56(5) are met. The Commission proceeds to consider the legitimacy of the request for waiver\u000abased on Article 56(5) of the Charter and relevant jurisprudence.\u000a43. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that Communications should be "sent after exhausting local\u000aremedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged". This requirement is based on\u000athe principle that "the respondent state must first have an opportunity to redress by its own means within\u000athe framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual".7\u000a44. The Commission has stressed that the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies "does not mean\u000athat complainants are required to exhaust any local remedy which is found to be, as a practical matter,\u000aunavailable or ineffective."8 The jurisprudence of the Commission, in determining compliance with this\u000arequirement, sets out "[t]hree major criteria, that is: the local remedy must be available, effective and\u000asufficient."9\u000a45. The initial burden is on the Complainant to prove that they have met the requirement set in Article 56\u000a(5) or that those remedies are unavailable in the particular case. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the\u000aRespondent State if it contests the allegations of the former.\u000a46. In the present case, the Complainant avers that it has no legal standing under Angolan law and its\u000arepresentatives would face arrest and possible execution under Angolan national security laws if they try to\u000apursue legal remedies in Angola, adding that members of FLEC are considered terrorists in Angolan\u000aterritory and hence any attempt to take the case before Angolan courts would be futile, if not impossible,\u000aand would subject members of the Complainant organisation to arbitrary arrest, detention or execution as\u000aterrorists.\u000a47. The Complainant also submits that the only independent human rights organisation in Cabinda,\u000aMpalabanda, that could have taken their case before a court of law was banned on 20 July 2006 for\u000aallegedly inciting violence and hatred, and being involved in political activities. Furthermore, the\u000aComplainant argues that the principal members of FLEC (the Complainant) are outside Angolan\u000ajurisdiction, thus they request for the waiver of the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a48. These claims, which are not contested by the Respondent State, show the apparent existence of fear of\u000a4\u000a\u000apersecution on the part of the Complainant.\u000a49. In a number of cases the African Commission has used the standard of constructive exhaustion of local\u000aremedies to provide an exception to the rule. Fear of persecution is one of the exceptions to the\u000arequirement of exhaustion of local remedies. In Sir Dawda K Jawara v The Gambia10 the African\u000aCommission reasoned that "the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but\u000aalso in practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the\u000aapplicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of\u000ahis relatives), local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him".\u000a50. In Rights International v Nigeria11 and John D Ouoko v Kenya12 , the African Commission reasoned that\u000athe existence of apparent fear of persecution on the part of the victims, to return to their countries to\u000aexhaust local remedies would make the remedies not available to such persons and hence exempt them\u000afrom the requirement to exhaust those remedies.\u000a51. In the present Communication, the fact that the Complainant has no legal standing before Angolan\u000acourts, that most of its members live abroad and are considered terrorists by the Government, leads to the\u000aconclusion that the chances of the Complainant exhausting local remedies have been practically rendered\u000aimpossible by fear of prosecution.\u000a52. Therefore, the African Commission holds that local remedies were not available to the Complainant and\u000ahence rules that the Communication is in line with the requirement under Article 56(5) of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a53. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance\u000awith Article 56 of the African Charter.\u000aConsideration of the Merits\u000aSummary of Complaint's Submission\u000a\u000a54. The Complainant emphasises that the present Communication concerns itself strictly with a claim for\u000aeconomic self-determination of the people of Cabinda and in particular with the disposition and exploitation\u000aof onshore oil, mineral and natural resources.\u000a55. The Complainant states further that the Communication excludes the matter of offshore resource\u000aallocation and relates only to the extraction of onshore resources which has remained dormant due largely\u000ato FLEC's armed opposition to any such exploitation. The Complainant contends that it does not recognise\u000agrants of resource extraction licences and concessions made by the Respondent State and asserts that it\u000areserves the right to make its own arrangements with resource extraction companies upon the\u000a"decolonisation" of Cabinda.\u000a56. Based on its contention that it has been recognised as the legitimate representative of the Cabinda\u000apeople since 1974, the Complainant requests that the Commission to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the\u000aissue of Cabinda's economic self-determination on the grounds that the Respondent State has violated\u000aArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\u000a57. The Complainant argues that as an incident of the right to property under Article 14 of the African\u000aCharter, the natural resources of Cabinda remain the property of the people of Cabinda and must be\u000aadministered largely for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. Accordingly, the grant of licences and\u000aconcession for the extraction of onshore natural resources by the Respondent State is a violation of Article\u000a14 of the African Charter.\u000a58. It is the further contention of the Complainant that although a state can grant resource extraction rights\u000ain the name of its people, a grant made in cases where one people dominate another or a grant made or\u000aadministered in an irresponsible manner would be illegitimate. The Complainant argues that historically,\u000aCabinda has always maintained a separate identity, linguistically and otherwise, and the people of Cabinda\u000awere neither consulted on the 'unilateral termination of Portuguese colonial protectorate' nor did they ratify\u000a'the Angolan occupation' of Cabinda.\u000a59. The Complainant states that since 1974 it has 'maintained a civil government inside portions of\u000aCabinda' and many of the areas of resource extraction 'are in or near the FLEC zone'. Further, that since\u000athe people of Cabinda are distinct, the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource\u000aextraction licences or concessions in violation of the right to property of the people of Cabinda as contained\u000ain Article 14 of the African Charter.\u000a60. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that\u000a5\u000a\u000a'revenue from onshore resource extraction will flow to Luanda just as offshore revenue does now'. The\u000aComplainant argues that a 2006 Cabinda Peace Accord which promised a 50% return of oil revenue to\u000aCabinda 'has not been realised or audited' and only '10% or less will return to Cabinda'. The Complainant\u000aalleges further that any attempt to question the allocation of revenue has resulted in summary\u000aimprisonment 'as in the case of Global Witness Investigatory' staff who was arrested and charged by\u000aAngolan Police after meeting with local representatives of civil society in Cabinda.\u000a61. The Complainant alleges further that in spite of the abundant oil resources in Cabinda unemployment is\u000ahigh and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in Cabinda than in most areas of Angola. The\u000aComplainant adds that Cabinda's resources have 'subsidised the government of Angola' and the 'Angolan\u000aadministration has little concern for providing public goods and incentives to facilitate investment in welfare\u000aenhancing improvements for the population at large'. Thus, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent\u000aState has violated Article 19 of the African Charter.\u000a62. Regarding the alleged violation of Article 20 of the Charter, the Complainant emphasises that the\u000apeople of Cabinda are geographically, politically, linguistically and culturally distinct from Angolans so that\u000athey are have a right to social and economic development. The Complainant contends that the people of\u000aCabinda are unable to exercise this right because organisations which 'espouse a uniquely Cabindan point\u000aof view' have been banned by the government of Angola. Complainant alleges further that Cabindans who\u000acampaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested as 'FLEC sympathisers' while foreigners\u000awho have identified corruption in Cabinda have been sent to jail. Accordingly the Complainant claims that\u000athe Respondent State has violated Article 20 of the African Charter.\u000a63. On Article 21 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that grants and concessions (what it\u000aterms onshore oil and mineral rights offerings) have been made by the Respondent State 'without input\u000afrom the Cabindans' and that all decisions regarding natural resources are made from Luanda, the Capital\u000aof Angola. The Complainant contends that the Cabinda people and FLEC as the representative of the\u000aCabinda people have not been adequately consulted about the management of 'their onshore resources.\u000aRather, exploration and exploitation activities have been undertaken under the watch of the Angolan Armed\u000aForces. Thus, the Complainant disputes the legal right of the Respondent State to exploit and dispose\u000aonshore resources in Cabinda and alleges that such activities amount to spoliation which is in violation of\u000aArticle 21 of the African Charter and therefore should be redressed by the Respondent State.\u000a64. On the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Complainant asserts that the people of\u000aCabinda are a distinct people with a right to economic and social development and contends that the\u000acurrent policy of the Respondent State is one of 'Angolanisation of Cabinda' involving discriminating against\u000aand arresting individuals and groups that claim a Cabindan identity. Accordingly, the Complainant alleges\u000athat the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\u000a65. Regarding Article 24 of the African Charter, the Complainant alleges that the environment in Cabinda is\u000anot conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. While it claims it does not seek an ideal\u000aenvironment, the Complainant argues that it seeks an environment that permits 'some measure of equity for\u000athe people of Cabinda'. The Complainant contends that the operations of companies such as Chevron take\u000aplace in conditions that harm human health and the environment because the Respondent State has failed\u000ato enforce compliance with environmental rules.\u000a66. The Complainant alleges further that the absence of viable civil society in Cabinda following the ban on\u000athe Mpalabanda organisation ensures that the activities of oil companies are not monitored and no\u000acompensation is paid in the event of damage to the environment. The Complainant therefore argues that\u000athe Respondent State has violated the right of the people of Cabinda to a satisfactory environment as\u000aguaranteed in Article 24 of the African Charter.\u000a67. In support of all its allegations, the Complaint has submitted five documents as exhibits. They include a\u000a"Republic of Kabinda January 8 2010 Committee Report on the Togolese Incident"; a 1974 joint\u000acommuniqué between Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA) and the Complainant (FLEC);\u000aa Human Rights Watch report titled "They Put me in the Hole - Military Detention, Torture and Lack of Due\u000aProcess in Cabinda"; a 2008 Chevron Alternative Annual Report titled "Chevron in Angola" and an Amnesty\u000aInternational Public Statement titled "Angola: Human rights organization banned". Also submitted in support\u000aof the Complainant's case are historical accounts presented by different bodies acting on behalf of the\u000apeoples of Cabinda.\u000a\u000a6\u000a\u000aSummary of Respondent State's Submission\u000a\u000a68. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State argues first that the Communication should not\u000ahave been declared admissible because that it failed to meet the requirements for admissibility as set out in\u000athe African Charter. The Respondent State argues that Article 57 of the African Charter requires that prior\u000ato the consideration of a Communication on the merit, the Chairperson of the Commission ought to present\u000athe Complaint before the Respondent State, setting out procedural matters and indicating whether the\u000aComplaint conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other African Union (AU) instruments\u000arelevant to the matter. The Respondent State contends that this requirement had not been met with respect\u000ato the present Communication.\u000a69. The Respondent State argues further that the Communication is not admissible for failure to comply\u000awith the requirements of Articles 50 and 56(5) of the African Charter regarding exhaustion of local\u000aremedies. The Respondent State also alleges that the Commission failed to comply with Rule 6 (3) of its\u000aown Rules of Procedure which prohibits "unrecognised National Liberation Movements from submitting\u000amatters for inclusion in the agenda of sessions of the Commission". The Respondent State insists that the\u000aComplainant is not qualified to submit this Communication to the African Commission's Session as it is\u000aneither a State Party nor a party entitled to bring "Other Communications" before the Commission.\u000a70. Citing Articles 3(b)13 and 4(b)14 of the AU Constitutive Act, the Respondent State argues that the\u000apresent Communication cannot proceed as it challenges the existing borders of an AU Member State and\u000athreatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Respondent State.\u000a71. With respect to the merits of the Communication, the Respondent State supplied its version of the\u000ahistory of Angola emphasising that both the Alvor Accord of 1975 and the Constitution of Angola endow it\u000awith sovereignty over the territory now known as Angola, including the Province of Cabinda. The\u000aRespondent State argues therefore that the right to self-determination has been exercised by the collective\u000a"peoples" of Angola and does not avail minorities and ethnic groups because it can only be available to\u000astates emerging from colonial boundaries in recognition of the principle of "uti possidetis juris".\u000a72. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 14 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends\u000athat the right to property is also enshrined in Articles 14 and 37 of its own Constitution. The Respondent\u000aState argues that the right to property in its Constitution is guaranteed in the interest of individuals,\u000acorporate bodies and local communities which "implies all the people of Angola"\u000a73. The Respondent State argues further that the Complainant has not demonstrated that the government\u000aof Angola does not manage the resources of Cabinda for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. The\u000aRespondent State avers that the government administers all its natural resources in an equitable and\u000abalanced manner as a common asset for the economic, social and cultural development of the country and\u000ain the national interest.\u000a74. The Respondent State insists that the government of the Province of Cabinda receives a share of the\u000aAngolan State General Budget just like every other provincial government in Angola. Further, that by Article\u000a7 of the Angolan State General Budget Act (no 26/10) the Provinces of Cabinda and Zaire receive amounts\u000aequal to 10 percent of earnings from petroleum resources in addition to other expenditures and costs for\u000athe construction of schools, roads, bridges, harbours, hospitals and other socio-economic infrastructure.\u000aThus, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 14 of the African Charter since its\u000aaffairs are run "in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws".\u000a75. As regards the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\u000aArticle 21 of its own Constitution provides for the principle of equality and that principle is implemented in all\u000aits 18 provinces. The Respondent State argues that as a result of its domestic constitutional obligation it\u000a"cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country based on the premise that revenue should\u000abe spent only in areas where it is generated". The Respondent State cites the example of its on-going\u000a"Strategy to Fight Poverty" which aims to achieve a "50% reduction by 2015 in the number of people with\u000aless than USD1.00 per day".\u000a76. The Respondent State insists further that as compared to other provinces, the Province of Cabinda\u000aenjoys a special status in view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget. The\u000aRespondent State also asserts that as contained in recent United Nations Development Programme\u000a(UNDP) and United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports, there is an overall improvement\u000ain areas such as child health care and health care generally. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends,\u000ait has not violated Article 19 of the African Charter as it relates to the Province of Cabinda.\u000a77. As regards the alleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends that\u000a7\u000a\u000athe right has collectively been fulfilled by all the Angolan people through the attainment of independence on\u000a11 November 1975 and by the conduct of free democratic elections in 1992 and 2008 respectively. The\u000aRespondent State asserts that according to available records a total of 7, 213, 281 voters representing\u000a87.36% of the population of Angola went to the polls in the 2008 Legislative elections in Angola. Out of the\u000a220 deputies elected in the 2008 Legislative elections, 5 came from Cabinda as representatives of the\u000aCabinda Province. Accordingly, the Respondent State argues that the people of Cabinda are represented\u000ain the National Assembly of the Republic of Angola by those deputies. In support of these assertions, the\u000aRespondent State attaches reports of the 2008 and 2012 elections as released by its National Electoral\u000aCommission.\u000a78. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends that as with other of its provinces, the Province of Cabinda\u000ahas its own political and administrative structures which are defined by law. The Respondent State argues\u000athat "like most African peoples, Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society" and Article 87 of its\u000aConstitution guarantees the right to respect, appreciation and preservation of the cultural, linguistic and\u000aartistic identity of the Angolan people. As such, the Respondent State concludes that it has not violated\u000aArticle 20 of the African Charter.\u000a79. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\u000aArticles 94 and 95 of its own Constitution create and separate public and private domains of property rights.\u000aIt asserts that natural resources fall under the public domain and property in the public domain is\u000aconstitutionally intended to "serve national interests instead of local interests alone" since it is expected to\u000a"benefit the Angolan people as a whole, with no exception". The Respondent State points out that the\u000aComplainant itself agrees that some percentage of oil revenue is already set aside specially for the\u000aProvince of Cabinda.\u000a80. The Respondent State contends further that Angola operates a unitary system of government in which\u000aall provinces are on equal footing such that all public resources should serve the entire population of the\u000astate but it was in spite of this fact that the Province of Cabinda has been given special attention as a result\u000aof its contribution to national oil production.\u000a81. The Respondent State challenges the Complainant's claim that it (FLEC) is Cabinda's representative\u000aand argues that the Complainant "lacks moral, legal and any other form of legitimacy" therefore it cannot\u000aspeak on behalf of the people of Cabinda. The Respondent State insists that as a sovereign state, Angola\u000ahas the legitimacy and the right to explore the natural resources in its territory, including those found in any\u000aof its 18 provinces. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 21 of the African Charter.\u000a82. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\u000athe Complainant has failed to produce any evidence to sustain a claim that the rights of the people of\u000aCabinda have been violated. The Respondent State asserts that since Cabinda is part of a single,\u000aindivisible and inalienable territory (Angola) it finds no reason or basis to defend a claim that Cabinda is\u000abeing "Angolanised".\u000a83. The Respondent State contends that its citizens are Angolans by origin both according to its domestic\u000alaw and in international law. It being the case, that there is no such thing as the State of Cabinda in Africa\u000abut a Cabinda that is a province "which is an integral part of the Angolan State", the Respondent State\u000aargues that it retains a right to punish by law, "every deed, action or attempt to divide the Angolan State".\u000aThe Respondent State therefore argues that it has not violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\u000a84. On the alleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that it takes\u000athe characteristics of Cabinda's oil fields and forests into account and has taken measures with a view to\u000apreserving the environment. The Respondent State cites the enactment of legislation at national and local\u000alevels based on an entrenched right to a healthy and unpolluted environment in Article 39 of its\u000aConstitution. The Respondent State contends further that it has a Basic Environment Act in addition to a\u000anumber of other statutes and institutions such as a Multi-Sector Technical Commission and the National\u000aEnvironment Authority which address the issues arising from oil exploration.\u000a85. The Respondent State claims further that by a Presidential Decree of 2011, oil companies are required\u000ato account for any harm stemming from oil spills, while paying greater attention to fishermen and their\u000afamilies. The Respondent State admits that there have been oil spills in the Province of Cabinda but that its\u000aMinistry of Environment's National Environment Surveillance Service has kept track of at least six of these\u000aspills, compelling oil companies to compensate fishermen and to replace items that had been lost or\u000adamaged.\u000a86. The Respondent State asserts further that it has legislation which compels concessionaires and their\u000aassociates to take preventive and practical measures to address environmental damage. Such measures\u000a8\u000a\u000ainclude the generation of evaluation studies and environment impact audits, landscape and structural\u000areplenishment plans and standing contract mechanisms for environmental management and auditing.\u000a87. The Respondent State submits that following an accident in the Gulf of Mexico, its Ministry of\u000aEnvironment has audited oil rigs in the Angolan sea "with a view to preventing a repetition of what\u000ahappened in ... the Western Hemisphere". It also claims that its Ministry of Environment has "been holding\u000apublic consultation on environment impact evaluation in the Cabinda South Block in terms of Decree No\u000a51". The Respondent State contends that these measures are not restricted to the oil sector but are\u000aextended to other resources. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter.\u000a88. In proof of its assertion, the Respondent State attached the results of its 2008 and 2012 Legislative\u000aelections result but no other documents apart from a "Memorandum of Understanding and Integration of\u000aFLEC Members" which states that the Respondent State has spent huge sums of money to register and\u000ademobilise former FLEC soldiers. The Respondent State concludes by insisting that the Communication\u000ashould be considered inadmissible "for lacking a legal basis and probable cause".\u000aComplainant's Supplementary Submission\u000a\u000a89. In its supplementary submission in reply to the Respondent State's arguments on the merit, the\u000aComplainant reaffirmed and expanded on its version of the history of Cabinda in order to show that the\u000aterritory of Cabinda was historically administered separately from mainland Angola and had a people with\u000adistinct linguistic, cultural and political identity.\u000aAmicus Submissions\u000a\u000a90. Between January and March 2012 and again in June 2013, a number of submissions were made by a\u000anumber of organisations representing different interests of the Cabinda people. With the consent of the\u000alegal representative of the Complainant, those submissions are considered as amicus briefs. In all their\u000asubmissions, the different groups advance the Complainant's version of historical facts and insist that the\u000apeople of Cabinda are victims of unlawful, aggressive and unilateral invasion by the government of the\u000aRespondent State. The groups submit that as a result of these historical facts and considering that the\u000apeople of Cabinda were not consulted before their territory was ceded to Angola, the actions of the\u000aRespondent State amount to colonialism or neo-colonialism such that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\u000aself-determination.\u000aThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\u000a91. Although it did not submit its observations on the Admissibility of the Communication despite the receipt\u000aof a formal invitation and reminders to that effect from the Secretariat,15 the first part of the Respondent\u000aState's submission on the Merit challenges the Admissibility of the Communication and raises issues that\u000aamount to a preliminary objection to the consideration of the Communication. Before analysing the merits of\u000athis Communication, the Commission considers it necessary to address some of the concerns raised by the\u000aRespondent State even though most of those issues ought to have been raised at the admissibility stage.\u000a92. The Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that Article 57 of the African Charter requires\u000athat a Communication to be considered by the Commission should first be presented to the concerned\u000aState Party by the Chairperson of the African Commission, setting out procedural matters and indicating\u000awhether the Communication conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other AU instruments.\u000aArticle 57 reads as follows: Prior to any substantive consideration, all communications shall be brought to\u000athe knowledge of the State concerned by the Chairman of the Commission\u000a93. The Commission affirms that Article 57 of the Charter obligates it to notify a State Party of the existence\u000aof a Complaint against such a State Party so that the State Party can participate in the proceedings. The\u000aCommission recalls that notice of this Communication was transmitted to the Respondent State by Note\u000aVerbale dated 28 February 2007. As indicated in paragraphs 16 to 20 and paragraphs 24 to 27 of the\u000aAdmissibility decision, the Secretariat through several subsequent correspondences transmitted to the\u000aRespondent State the original Complaint and all other documents filed by the Complainant regarding this\u000aCommunication. Further, as noted in paragraph 39 above, at least ten (10) reminders were sent to the\u000aRespondent State to respond to the Admissibility arguments but these did not yield any response from the\u000aRespondent State. Accordingly, the African Commission notes that it has satisfied its duty to the\u000aRespondent State as required by Article 57 of the African Charter.\u000a9\u000a\u000a94. The Respondent State further contends that the African Commission has failed to comply with Rule\u000a6(3)16 of its own Rules of Procedure. The Commission notes that the provisions cited by the Respondent\u000aState relating to the Provisional Agenda of the Commission's sessions are now contained in Rule 32 of the\u000aCommission's Rules of Procedure. The Commission recalls that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure\u000aprovides as follows: The provisional Agenda shall include but not be limited to, items on "Communications\u000afrom States" and "Other Communications" in accordance with the provisions of Articles 48, 49 and 55 of the\u000aCharter.\u000a95. The Commission reaffirms that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure permits "Other Communications"17\u000asuch as the one now being considered to be included in the Agenda of the Commission's Session. In line\u000awith that provision, the present Communication is properly before the Commission as it has duly been\u000aincluded in the Agenda of the Session.\u000a96. The Respondent State contends further that the present Communication ought to have been declared\u000ainadmissible because it fails to comply with certain aspects of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\u000aCommission recalls that the Respondent State was contacted at every stage and given ample opportunity\u000ato present its position and arguments regarding the admissibility of this Communication but the Respondent\u000aState did not take advantage of the opportunity.\u000a97. The Commission notes further that in the event that a State Party fails to submit its observations on\u000aadmissibility within 60 days from the receipt of the Complainant's submission from the Secretariat as set out\u000ain Rule 105(2) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, this Commission is authorised to proceed to make\u000aa decision on the admissibility of the Communication. In such cases, the Commission examines the\u000aadmissibility submissions of the Complainant against the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\u000aCommission notes that in relation to the present Communication, this procedure has been followed to the\u000aletter. Accordingly, the Commission cannot revisit its admissibility decision in respect of the\u000aCommunication.\u000a98. Notwithstanding the fact that its Admissibility decision in respect of the Communication will not be\u000areviewed, the Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that the present Communication should\u000ahave been declared inadmissible on the grounds that it contradicts Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU\u000aConstitutive Act. In that regard, the Commission recalls the Complainant's submission that the present\u000aCommunication does not seek a decision on political self-determination or a right to secede from the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a99. In its correspondences and submissions to the Secretariat, the Complainant has maintained that its\u000aclaim is strictly restricted to a request for a decision on economic self-determination and a determination of\u000athe right of the people of Cabinda to enjoy the use of natural resources located within the Province of\u000aCabinda. The Commission has also considered the prayers of the Complainant and notes that the claims\u000aas formulated do not contradict the provisions of Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act. The\u000aCommission does not consider itself bound to pronounce on the amicus briefs which seek to introduce\u000asecessionist dimensions to the Communication. Accordingly, the Commission proceeds to determine the\u000aCommunication based on the submissions of the Parties.\u000aAlleged violation of article 14\u000a\u000a100. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right to property of the people of\u000aCabinda contrary to Article 14 of the African Charter. Article 14 of the African Charter provides as follows:\u000aThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\u000ain the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\u000a101. The Complainant contends that an incident of the right to property as guaranteed in the African\u000aCharter is that the natural resources of Cabinda must be administered largely for the benefit of the people\u000aof Cabinda since the people of Cabinda claim a distinct identity from the rest of Angola. It is also the\u000aComplainant's argument that the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource licences\u000aand concessions on Cabinda resources.\u000a102. The Respondent State submits that its Constitution provides for the right to property and that the\u000aconstitutional right is available to all the peoples of Angola. However, the State argues that certain items\u000aare classified in its Constitution as property in the public domain intended to serve the wider national\u000ainterest rather than the interest of a smaller unit within the state. The Respondent State further challenges\u000athe Complainant's argument that the Government of Angola has not managed natural resources for the\u000abenefit of Cabinda people.\u000a10\u000a\u000a103. Generally, this Commission has stated in its jurisprudence that the role of the State in relation to the\u000aright to property is "to respect and protect this right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the\u000aexercise of this right in order for it to be accessible to everyone.18 One way of fulfilling Charter obligation on\u000athe right to property is therefore to adopt legislation which recognises the principle of ownership and\u000apeaceful enjoyment of property. The inclusion of the right to property in the Angolan Constitution is\u000atherefore in compliance with the Respondent State's Charter duty.\u000a104. With regards to the general question whether a "people" can be bearers of the right to property under\u000athe African Charter, this Commission has previously answered in the affirmative in relation to indigenous\u000apeoples in Africa.19 The African Commission reaffirms that a collective or communal right to property exists\u000aas a component of the right to property in Article 14 of the African Charter. Similar to the individual right to\u000aproperty, the communal right to property entails a state duty to recognise and protect peaceful enjoyment of\u000aownership by a group or people subject to limitation by a state in the interest of public need or in the\u000ageneral interest and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\u000a105. The Commission has also expressed the opinion that natural resources located in land owned or\u000aoccupied by a people can be the subject of ownership in the context of the right to property under the\u000aAfrican Charter.20 In the Commission's view, protection of communal property rights to natural resources as\u000aa component of land right enjoyed by indigenous peoples is not alien to the African Charter or to\u000ainternational human rights generally.21 One justification for the protection of this aspect of the right is the\u000astrong traditional attachment to their cultural land that indigenous peoples hold on to such that their survival\u000adepends on the resources they traditionally extract from the land.22\u000a106. The Commission notes that the Complainant does not claim that the people of Cabinda are indigenous\u000apeoples with strong attachment to their land and their culture. The basis of the Complainant's claim is that\u000aCabinda existed as a distinct Portuguese protectorate prior to 1975 when it was declared to be part of an\u000aindependent Angola without the consent of the people of Cabinda. The Commission does not believe that\u000adistinct pre-colonial history on its own currently suffices to sustain a claim for special protection of a\u000adistinctive overriding communal right to property under the Charter.\u000a107. In the absence of evidence that land in Cabinda is communally owned in a traditional context and that\u000athe people of Cabinda had and continue to hold on to strong attachment to their land as part of a distinct\u000aculture which requires dependence on land and its resources for the survival of the people of Cabinda, the\u000aright to property can be validly limited by the State in the overall public interest of the entire state and in\u000aaccordance with appropriate laws.\u000a108. In line with its obligation under International law, the African Charter and its domestic laws generally,\u000athe Respondent State can only limit the right to property under certain laid down conditions. The\u000aComplainant has not claimed or adduced evidence to show that the limitation of the right in relation to the\u000apeople of Cabinda was not done in the public interest and according to appropriate laws.\u000a109. The Commission recalls the Complainant's argument that an incident of the right to property under the\u000aCharter is that the people of Cabinda are entitled to be the main beneficiaries of the natural resources and\u000athat the Respondent State cannot unilaterally dispose of the natural resources of the people of Cabinda\u000awithout their involvement in decisions on such disposal. The Commission agrees with the Complainant that\u000aas an aspect of the right to property under the Charter, the people of Cabinda are entitled to benefit from\u000athe natural resource found in their lands. However, the Commission believes that the enjoyment of that\u000aaspect of the right should not be to the detriment of other communities and groups in the State. The\u000aCommission notes further that the Respondent State's submission that the people of Cabinda (along with\u000athe province of Zaire23 ) enjoy a fair and equitable share of the proceeds of the petroleum resources of the\u000aState has not been challenged despite the Complainant's claim that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\u000aan additional 50% of proceeds from natural resources.\u000a110. The Commission finds that the Complainant has failed to show that the people of Cabinda have a\u000astrong and profound cultural or ancestral attachment to their land and the natural resources under the land\u000asuch that their survival depends on its protection. The Complainant has also failed to show that the\u000aRespondent State has denied the people of Cabinda a right to share equitably in the benefits accruing from\u000atheir natural resources. Accordingly, the African Commission finds no violation in relation to Article 14 of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a111. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of the Charter because\u000athe people of Cabinda have not enjoyed the right to equality as a people entitled to the same respect and\u000arights as other peoples in Angola. Article 19 provides that: All peoples shall be equal; they shall enjoy the\u000asame respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by another.\u000a112. It is the Complainant's submission that Article 19 of the Charter has been violated in relation to the\u000apeople of Cabinda because it anticipates that revenue from onshore resource extraction will "flow to\u000aLuanda just as offshore revenue does now". The Complainant alleges further that despite the resources\u000aextracted from Cabinda, unemployment is high and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in\u000aCabinda than in most other areas of Angola. Thus, it claims the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of\u000athe African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\u000a113. In response to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the Charter, the Respondent State contends that its\u000aConstitution provides for the principle of equality and this is implemented in all its 18 provinces. The\u000aRespondent State argues further that 'it cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country\u000abased on the premise that revenue should only be spent in areas where it is generated. The Respondent\u000aState submits that while it is developing the entire country, the Province of Cabinda enjoys a "special status\u000ain view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget". Thus, it claims that it has not violated\u000aArticle 19 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\u000a114. The Commission reaffirms its position that distinct and identifiable groups of "peoples" and\u000acommunities exist within the State Parties to the African Charter and each set of "peoples" and\u000acommunities is entitled to enjoy internal legal equality vis-?-vis other "peoples" and communities within the\u000asame state.24 The Commission notes that a claim of unequal treatment in violation of Article 19 of the\u000aCharter requires evidence that a given group or set of peoples who is in a position similar to another group\u000aor set of people has been or is being treated differently or that a given group or set of peoples who is in a\u000aposition different to another group or set of people is treated similarly such that the "peoples" complaining\u000asuffer unfair and unjustifiable disadvantage that amounts to discrimination.\u000a115. In its submission, the Complainant contends that the bulk of the anticipated revenue from the\u000aresources in Cabinda will "flow to Luanda while only 10% or less will get to Cabinda". The Complainant\u000adoes not elaborate to show whether any single group of people in the Respondent State enjoys a greater\u000ashare of allocation than the People of Cabinda. The Complainant also provides no documentary or other\u000aevidence in support of its claim. The Complainant does not produce the 2006 Peace Accord which it refers\u000ato in its submission. However, the Respondent State does not contest the claims but admits them partially\u000ato the extent that the Respondent State submits that the Province of Cabinda enjoys a special status since\u000ait receives up to 10% of oil revenue.\u000a116. The Commission notes the Respondent State's submission that the 10% special revenue that accrues\u000ato Cabinda is in addition to other infrastructural costs that the Government funds in the Province of\u000aCabinda. Although the Respondent State has also failed to adduce any documentary or other evidence in\u000asupport of this claim, the Complainant has not contested the Respondent State's claim that only the\u000aProvince of Cabinda (along with the Province of Zaire) enjoy the "special status". Accordingly, the\u000aCommission will make its decision on the basis of the unchallenged submissions of the Parties.\u000a117. Generally, the Commission holds the view that real or substantive equality requires that groups who\u000ahave suffered previous disadvantages or continue to suffer disadvantages within a state are entitled to\u000asome advantageous treatment especially where such groups bear an unequal part of the burden for the\u000aexploration of natural resources in that state.25 However, the Commission also notes the Respondent\u000aState's argument that it cannot implement measures that aim at spending revenue only in areas where it is\u000agenerated.\u000a118. The Commissions takes the view that the principle of equality requires the striking of a balance\u000abetween a group's claim to advantageous treatment or affirmative action and the legitimate expectation of\u000aother groups within the state to share in the resources of that state. Accordingly, the Commission believes\u000athat a proper interpretation of equality in the present circumstance is one which recognises the right of the\u000apeople of Cabinda to receive some advantage without endangering the survival of other peoples within the\u000astate or threatening the continued corporate existence of the Respondent State.\u000a119. Although the Complainant contends that the people of Cabinda suffer unequal treatment as compared\u000ato the rest of Angola in terms of comparatively higher levels of unemployment, poverty, infant mortality and\u000adisease, no tangible evidence or data has been adduced to support these claims. As this Commission had\u000a12\u000a\u000apreviously observed, a Complainant that has made general claims and allegations needs to substantiate\u000asuch claims and allegations with either documentary evidence or sworn affidavits or the corroborating\u000atestimony of others.26 In the absence of evidence to support the claim of unequal treatment, the\u000aCommission does not find a violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a120. Basing its argument on an acclaimed geographical, political, linguistic and cultural distinction from the\u000arest of Angola, the Complainant claims that the Respondent State has violated the right of the people of\u000aCabinda to social and economic development as guaranteed in Article 20 of the African Charter. The\u000aComplainant submits that the people of Cabinda are unable to exercise the right because organisations\u000athat "espouse a uniquely Cabindan point of view" are banned by the Government of Angola.\u000a121. The Complainant alleges further that the enjoyment of the right to social and economic development is\u000arestricted because people who campaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested. On these\u000agrounds, the Complainant alleges that the right of the people of Cabinda to social and economic\u000adevelopment had been violated.\u000a122. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 20 of the African Charter in relation to\u000athe people of Cabinda because the right to self-determination had been collectively fulfilled by the entire\u000apeople of Angola at independence in 1975. The Respondent State submits further the periodic democratic\u000aelections take place in Angola and as citizens of Angola, the people of Cabinda have participated fully at\u000asuch elections, producing 5 out of 220 deputies elected to the Angolan Parliament.\u000a123. It is the Respondent State's further contention that Cabinda also has its own political and\u000aadministrative structures defined by Angolan law. On these grounds and in view of Article 87 of its\u000aConstitution which acknowledges that Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society where the different\u000aidentities are to be appreciated and respected, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated\u000aArticle 20 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\u000a124. The Commission recalls that Article 20 of the Charter has a particular historical context in the sense\u000athat it is one of the provisions of the Charter that was aimed at addressing the situation of Africans who\u000aremained under colonial domination at the time the Charter was drafted. Article 20 of the Charter provides\u000athat :\u000a\u000a1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and inalienable\u000aright to self-determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\u000aeconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\u000a2. Colonised or oppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination\u000aby resorting to any means recognised by the international community.\u000a3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the State Parties to the present Charter in their\u000aliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\u000a125. The Commission notes the argument of the Complainant regarding the alleged violation of Article 20\u000aof the Charter. In view of its opinion that the right to self-determination, the right of colonised and oppressed\u000apeople to free themselves from domination and the right to assistance in liberation struggle are reserved for\u000acolonised peoples, the Commission does not agree with the Complainant that a distinct pre-colonial history\u000aby itself entitles the people of Cabinda to unilaterally claim those rights contained vis-?-vis the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a126. As the Commission has noted in its earlier jurisprudence, in post-colonial Africa, the right to self\u000adetermination can be enjoyed within the existing territories and with full respect for the sovereignty and\u000aterritorial integrity of State Parties to the Charter.27 The Commission also believes that the right to pursue\u000aeconomic and social development is attainable within the framework of an existing state insofar as different\u000agroups and communities are represented in decision-making institutions of the given state. Accordingly, the\u000aCommission does not find any violation of Article 20 of the Charter.\u000a\u000a13\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a127. In relation to Article 21, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right of\u000athe people of Cabinda to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources because the Respondent\u000aState has made grants and concessions on Cabinda's onshore oil resources "without input from the\u000aCabindans". The Complainant contends that the acts the Respondent State in this regard amount to\u000aspoliation under Article 21 of the Charter and should attract a right to lawful recovery and to an adequate\u000acompensation. Article 21 of the African Charter states as follows:\u000a\u000a1. All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in\u000athe exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it.\u000a2. In all cases of spoliation, the disposed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its\u000aproperty as well as to an adequate compensation.\u000a3. The free disposal of wealth and natural resources shall be exercised without prejudice to the\u000aobligation of promoting international economic cooperation based on mutual respect, equitable\u000aexchange and the principles of international law.\u000a4. State Parties to the present Charter shall individually and collectively exercise the right to free\u000adisposal of their wealth and natural resources with a view to strengthening African Unity and\u000asolidarity.\u000a5. State Parties to the present Charter shall undertake to eliminate all forms of foreign exploitation\u000aparticularly that practiced by all international monopolies so as to enable their peoples to fully\u000abenefit from the advantages derived from their national resources.\u000a128. The Respondent State argues that by Articles 94 and 95 of its Constitution, natural resources fall in\u000athe category of items classified as property in the public domain which are reserved to serve national rather\u000anarrow local interests. The Respondent State submits further the Province of Cabinda already receives\u000aspecial attention for its contribution to oil revenues. Asserting its sovereign authority and legitimacy to\u000aexplore natural resources in Angolan territory, the Respondent State challenges the authority and\u000alegitimacy of the Complainant to speak on behalf of the people of Cabinda with regards to the exploitation\u000aof natural resources.\u000a129. The Commission recalls its jurisprudence which traces the origin of Article 21 to the colonial era when\u000ahuman and material resources in Africa were exploited for the benefit of powers from outside the\u000acontinent.28 However, the Commission has also held that the rights in Article 21 of the Charter are still\u000aapplicable in post-colonial Africa in favour of groups within states to the extent that it triggers an obligation\u000aon the part of the State Parties to protect their citizens from exploitation by external economic powers29 and\u000ato ensure that groups and communities, directly or through their representatives, are involved in decisions\u000arelating to the disposal of their wealth.30 Nevertheless, the Commission also recognises the right of State\u000aParties to supervise the disposal of wealth in the general interest of the state and its communities.31\u000a130. The Commission notes that in relation to Article 21 of the Charter, the Complaint invokes a right of the\u000apeople of Cabinda to dispose of their wealth and natural resources as well as to receive compensation for\u000aresources already exploited. In this regard, the Commission notes that the term "peoples" in Article 21 of\u000athe Charter can mean either the entire peoples of a given state or a "peoples" within the state. The\u000aCommission believes that in the first context, Article 21 of the African Charter empowers a State Party to\u000aexercise the guaranteed right free from interference from any other African or non-African state. This has to\u000abe the explanation for sub-Articles 4 and 5 of Article 21 which speak to State Parties.\u000a131. However, the Commission believes that a "peoples" within an existing state can be beneficiaries of the\u000aright in Article 21 to the extent that it imposes a duty on the Respondent State to ensure that resources are\u000aeffectively managed for the sole and equal benefit of the entire peoples of the state. Accordingly, the\u000aAfrican Commission is of the view that one aspect of the right in Article 21 of the African Charter is the duty\u000aof the State to involve representatives of its peoples in decisions concerning the management of national\u000awealth and natural resources.\u000a132. The Respondent State has shown that elected representatives of the people of Cabinda are in the\u000aAngolan Parliament which exercises oversight supervision of the management of natural resources. As this\u000aCommission noted in SERAC v Nigeria,32 the State has the right to exploit natural resources in its territory.\u000aHowever, the Commission believes that Article 21 of the African Charter presupposes that that right is held\u000a14\u000a\u000ain trust for the people. The Respondent State's submission that it effectively manages natural resources for\u000athe benefit of all peoples in Angola has not been challenged. The Commission therefore finds no violation\u000aof Article 21 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a133. The Complainant's allegation that the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter\u000awith regards to the people of Cabinda is based exclusively on the argument that the Respondent State\u000apursues a policy of "Angolanisation of Cabinda". In the absence of any other argument or evidence in\u000asupport, the African Commission finds no violation.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a134. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated Article 24 of the African Charter in\u000arelation to the people of Cabinda because, as a result of oil exploitation activities authorised by the State,\u000athe environment in Cabinda is not conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. The\u000aComplainant argues further that the operations of companies such as Chevron which are authorised by the\u000aRespondent State take place in conditions that harm both human health and the environment and this has\u000ahappened because in the absence of viable civil society monitoring, the Respondent State has failed to\u000aenforce compliance with environmental rules.\u000a135. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter in relation to\u000athe people of Cabinda since it has taken measures aimed at preserving the environment. The Respondent\u000aState cites national legislations that it has adopted to address the challenge of environmental pollution. The\u000aRespondent State submits further that it has compelled oil companies operating in the area to account for\u000aharm occasioned by oil spills, with emphasis on demanding compensation for fishermen and their families.\u000aThe Respondent also claims that it has set up a National Environment Surveillance Service that has kept\u000atrack of at least six oil spills in the area while its Ministry of Environment has audited rigs in the Angolan sea\u000ato prevent further spills. In effect, the Respondent State contends that it has taken action to address the\u000aconcerns of the Complainant.\u000a136. The African Commission notes that apart from the fact that it did not adduce any evidence in support\u000aof the general allegation that the right to a satisfactory environment has been violated by the Respondent\u000aState, the Complainant has not disputed or challenged the claims of the Respondent State. In the absence\u000aof any evidence to support the alleged violation, the African Commission finds no violation of Article 24 of\u000athe African Charter.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission\u000a137. In view of the above, the African Commission finds no violations of Articles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24\u000aof the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\u000aDone in Banjul, the Gambia during the 54th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\u000aand Peoples Rights, 22 October to 5 November 2013.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 Angola ratified the African Charter on 2 March 1990.\u000a2 The alleged violations include extrajudicial/summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, sexual\u000aviolence, denial of civilians' freedom of movement, torture and other mistreatment.\u000a3 By email to the Secretariat dated 17 Feb 2012, Dr Levy advised the Secretariat to consider submission\u000afrom Cabindan groups other himself as amicus briefs.\u000a4 Notes Verbale were sent to the Republic of Angola on 28 February 2007, 10 May 2007, 20 August 2007,\u000a19 December 2007, 25 March 2009, 27 April 2009, 23 June 2010, 30 September 2010, 7 December 2010\u000aand 11 August 2011.\u000a5 Communication 292/04 - Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa v.

Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\u000apeoples is at stake.123 Hence the need to protect the lands and resources they have traditionally used to\u000aprevent their extinction as a people. That is, the aim and purpose of the special measures required on\u000abehalf of the members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they may continue living\u000atheir traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure, economic system,\u000acustoms, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by States.\u000a.\u000a22 Ibid\u000a23 The Respondent State submits that the Province of Zaire also contributes significantly to the natural\u000aresources of Angola and accordingly, together with the Cabinda Province, enjoy certain privileges over and\u000aabove other provinces.\u000a24 COHRE case, para 223\u000a25 This is consistent with international best practices. See for instance, the Saramaka decision, para 103\u000a× Furthermore, the State's argument that it would be discriminatory to pass legislation that recognizes\u000acommunal forms of land ownership is also without merit. It is a wellestablished principle of international law\u000athat unequal treatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\u000adiscrimination. Legislation that recognizes said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory. In the\u000acontext of members of indigenous and tribal peoples, this Court has already stated that special measures\u000aare necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions and customs (supra paras.\u000a78-86, 91, and 96). Thus, the State's arguments regarding its inability to create legislation in this area due\u000ato the alleged complexity of the issue or the possible discriminatory nature of such legislation are without\u000amerit.\u000a26 Communication 308/05 - Majuru v Zimbabwe (2008) ACHPR, para 92\u000a27 Communication 75/92 - Katangese Peoples' Congress v Zaire (1995) ACHPR para 4\u000a28 Communication 155/96 - Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) & Center for Economic\u000aand Social Rights (CESR) v Nigeria (SERAC v Nigeria) (2001) para 56\u000a16\u000a\u000a29 SERAC v Nigeria, paras 57-58\u000a30 Endorois v Kenya, para 268\u000a31 Ibid\u000a32 155/96 para 54\u000a\u000a17\u000a\u000a

aV328/06 Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda\u000av Republic of Angola\u000aSummary of facts:\u000a1. The Complaint is brought by the Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda - FLEC (the\u000aComplainant) on behalf of the people of Cabinda (Victims) against the Republic of Angola1 (the\u000aRespondent State or Angola).\u000a2. The Complainant submits that Cabinda, formerly known as the Portuguese Congo, consists of a territory\u000aof approximately 2800 square miles. The Complainant further submits that in 1885 the independent rulers\u000aof Cabinda city and its environs entered into a treaty, the Treaty of Simulambuco, with the Government of\u000athe Kingdom of Portugal establishing a Protectorate over much of present day Cabinda.\u000a3. In 1975, the Complainant alleges, the Alvor Conference in Portugal, between the colonial power and\u000aUNITA, MPLA, and FNLA (all of which were liberation movements) declared the annexation of Cabinda by\u000aAngola without any Cabindan participation. Following this event, Angola has exercised sovereignty over\u000aCabinda despite protestations by the people of Cabinda, through groups dedicated to the idea of a distinct\u000aidentity for the people of Cabinda.\u000a4. The Complainant alleges that since 2002, following attempts by groups in Cabinda to stake a claim to\u000aautonomy for the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has undertaken a massive military campaign\u000aagainst Cabinda and that when this failed, the state entered into ad hoc negotiations with Cabindan factions\u000ain an attempt to confuse issues. These negotiations, the Complainant alleges, excluded the Chairman of\u000aFLEC, Mr. Nzita Tiago - "the only universally recognized Cabindan authority" - and resulted in a 2006\u000aPeace Accord that was contested by both Cabinda and the democratic opposition in Angola, the UNITA.\u000a5. The Complainant further alleges that following the rejection of the 2006 Peace Accord by the majority of\u000aCabindans, fractions in Cabinda continued to demand local autonomy over the wealth of Cabinda. The\u000aComplainant states that the Respondent State has responded to the demands by maintaining a large\u000amilitary force in Cabinda, which has committed numerous documented human rights violations therein.2\u000a6. The Complainant claims that in 2006 the Angolan Forces (FAA) committed dozens of human rights and\u000ahumanitarian violations such as: the bombardment of civilian dwellings in the Mayombe (Piading) region;\u000asummary execution of Cabinda patriots in Buco, Zao and beatings and torture of Mpalabanda members in\u000aCaio Poba.\u000a7. It is the Complainant further claim that in July 2006 Angola banned the only independent human rights\u000aorganization in Cabinda, Mpalabnda (Associacao Civica de Cabinda) through the instrumentality of a court\u000aorder, allegedly for inciting violence and hatred, and carrying out political activities rather than being a civil\u000asociety organization.\u000a8. Furthermore, the Complainant avers, Government of the Respondent State is exercising economic\u000aexploitation of Cabindan resources since the people of Cabinda are not allowed to have any say in the\u000agrant of licences and concessions over their resources. The Complainant claims that the people of Cabinda\u000ahave been suffering comparatively higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, disease and\u000aintense poverty since the Government of the Respondent State took over Cabinda's natural resources such\u000aas offshore oil, onshore mineral and oil resources.\u000a9. The Complainant further alleges that the Government of the Respondent State has economically\u000adominated the Cabindan people by denying them their status as a people and by extracting more than\u000aninety per cent (90%) of their economic patrimony while returning less than ten per cent (10%) to Cabinda.\u000aBy this act, the Complainant alleges, the Respondent State has perpetrated neo-colonialism.\u000a10. The Complainant also contends that although Cabindans are culturally and linguistically separate from\u000aAngola and have overwhelmingly identified themselves as 'Cabindans', not Angolans, the people of\u000aCabinda have been denied their right to self-determination by Angola.\u000a11. The Complainant submits that despite over 30 years of conflict over the status of Cabinda, the\u000aRespondent State has refused to hold a referendum on the issue of Cabindan question. The Complainant\u000aalleges that the Respondent State does not permit Cabinda to determine its own economic and social\u000adevelopment. The Complainant states that all economic decisions are made in Luanda, the capital city of\u000athe Respondent State and not in Cabinda, even though Cabinda has maintained a government in exile\u000asince 1963 and has had an active self-defence force and civil administration inside Cabinda since 1975.\u000a1\u000a\u000aArticles alleged to have been violated\u000a12. The Complainant alleges that in relation to the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has violated\u000aArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\u000aPrayers of the Complainant\u000a13. The Complainant requests the African Commission on Human and Peoples Right (African Commission\u000aor Commission):\u000a1. To appoint a Special Rapporteur to undertake fact finding and make recommendations on the\u000aissues it has raised.\u000a2. Make its good offices available for further engagement on the issues raised\u000a3. Award $US 50000 against the Respondent State to cover the Complainant's legal fees and costs.\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a14. This Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and\u000aPeoples' Rights (the Secretariat) on 29 September 2006. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt by letter\u000adated 2 October 2006, informing the Complainant that the Communication would be scheduled for\u000aconsideration on seizure by the African Commission at its 40th Ordinary Session held in November 2006 in\u000aBanjul, The Gambia.\u000a15. At its 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission decided to be seized of the Communication.\u000a16. On 8 January 2007, the African Commission further received a press statement issued by FLEC on the\u000acurrent struggle for the control of petroleum in Cabinda, alleging continuous violations of the African\u000aCharter by the Angolan Government and other actors for which the State is responsible.\u000a17. By a letter dated 8 February 2007 and Note Verbale dated 28 February 2007, the Secretariat informed\u000athe Parties of the Commission's decision on seizure and requested the Parties to submit their arguments on\u000athe Admissibility of the Communication within two months. A copy of the Complaint was also transmitted to\u000athe Respondent State.\u000a18. On 25 April 2007, the Secretariat sent reminders to the Parties to submit their arguments on\u000aAdmissibility by 10 May 2007 in time for the 41st Session of the African Commission. At its 41st Ordinary\u000aSession in May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission considered the Communication and deferred it\u000apending the receipt of Arguments on Admissibility from the Parties. The Parties were notified accordingly\u000aon 20 June 2007.\u000a19. On 15 August 2007, the Complainant's brief with its Arguments on Admissibility and an updated\u000astatement of facts was received at the Secretariat. These were transmitted along with a Note Verbale to the\u000aRespondent State on 20 August 2007 together with a request for the latter to submit its response to the\u000aComplainant's submission on Admissibility.\u000a20. During its 42nd Ordinary Session in November 2007, the African Commission considered the\u000aCommunication and decided to give the Respondent State one last chance to make its submissions on the\u000aAdmissibility of the Communication. The Parties were notified accordingly on 19 December 2007.\u000a21. During its 43rd and 44th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the consideration of the\u000aCommunication pending the submission on Admissibility by the Respondent State, the parties were\u000aaccordingly informed.\u000a22. On 27 April 2009 the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to make its submissions on\u000aAdmissibility.\u000a23. On 21 July 2009, the African Commission received supplementary information to the Communication by\u000athe Complainant.\u000a24. During its 45th and 46th Ordinary Sessions respectively, the African Commission considered the\u000aCommunication and deferred its decision on Admissibility pending the Respondent State's submission on\u000aAdmissibility\u000a2\u000a\u000a25. On 12 January 2010, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant urging the African\u000aCommission to take immediate action and to appoint a Special Rapporteur for Cabinda.\u000a26. During its 47th, 48th, 49th and 50th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the\u000aconsideration of the Communication, and the Parties were accordingly informed. At its 10th Extraordinary\u000aSession held in December 2011, the Commission considered the Communication and declared it\u000aAdmissible. The Parties were accordingly informed and invited to submit their Arguments on the Merit.\u000a27. Between January and March 2012, the Secretariat received submissions from three different\u000aorganisations representing different groups in Cabinda (joint submission by the Front de Liberation de\u000aL'Etat du Cabinda (FLEC) et Union Nationale de Liberation du Cabinda (UNLC), and individual submissions\u000aby the "Original FLEC" and the Mouvement Pour Le Rassemblement Du Peuple Cabindais et Pour Sa\u000aSouverainete "MRPCS). On 29 March 2012, the Secretariat received a Submission on the Merit from Dr\u000aJonathan Levy acting in his capacity as legal representative of the Complainant.3 The Complainant's\u000aSubmission on the Merit was accordingly transmitted to the Respondent State.\u000a28. On 24 April 2012, the Respondent State's Note Verbale forwarding the latter's Arguments on the Merit\u000awas received at the Secretariat and transmitted to Complainant through its legal representative.\u000a29. On 12 July 2012, the Complainant through its legal representative forwarded its Supplementary\u000aSubmission on the Merit. On 10, 12 and 28 September 2012, the Secretariat received the same copy of an\u000aupdated and amended Submission on the Merit from the Respondent State.\u000a30. On 18 June 2013, the Secretariat received additional Submissions from the "Collectif des organisations\u000acabindaises" also known as the "Original FLEC". This submission was followed by a letter protesting\u000anotification that the submission has been made out of time and a request for reopening of the procedure for\u000asubmission of additional documents by both parties.\u000a31. At its 54th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2013, the Commission considered\u000athe Communication on the Merit based on all the documents submitted by the Parties and the various\u000aAmicus briefs.\u000a\u000aThe Law\u000aAdmissibility\u000aSubmission of the Complainant on Admissibility\u000a\u000a32. Although the Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication,\u000athe Respondent State failed to submit any arguments on the admissibility of the Communication despite an\u000ainvitation and repeated reminders to do so. Accordingly, the Commission addresses the question of\u000aAdmissibility on the basis of the Complainant's arguments on Admissibility.\u000a33. The Complainant submits that the Communication meets all the Admissibility requirements set out in\u000aArticle 56 of the African Charter. Regarding Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that\u000athe Communication is submitted by FLEC on behalf of the people of Cabinda.\u000a34. Concerning Article 56 (2) of Charter, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State has violated\u000aArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter. The Complainant further submits that although the\u000aCommunication alleges serious violations of the economic and peoples" rights of the people of Cabinda by\u000athe Government of Angola, the Complainant does not request the African Commission to take up any\u000amatter that would interfere with the sovereignty of Angola or adjudication of Angolan territorial claims in\u000aCabinda. The Complainant states that they are mindful that the African Commission must respect Articles\u000a3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act regarding territorial sovereignty and respecting existing borders.\u000a35. With regards to Article 56 (3) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that the language used in\u000athe Communication is neutral legal language. In relation to Article 56 (4) of the African Charter, the\u000aComplainant submits that the Communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated through the\u000amass media, but rather on primary information provided by FLEC and other organizations directly involved\u000ain the matter.\u000a36. On the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56 (5) of the African Charter, the\u000aComplainant requests the Commission to wave this condition on the basis that exhaustion of domestic\u000aremedies is futile and legally impossible on the grounds that there is unrest and armed conflict involving the\u000aParties and this creates difficulties for the commencement of legal proceedings by the Complainant. The\u000aComplainant avers further that the only independent civil society organisation which could have brought a\u000a3\u000a\u000alegal action on behalf of the Complainant has been disbanded and banned by judicial order instigated by\u000athe Respondent State. It is also the Complainant's submission that it cannot pursue legal action in the\u000aRespondent State because it (the Complainant) has been branded a terrorist organisation since the signing\u000aof a 2006 Peace Accord between the Respondent States and elements in Cabinda.\u000a37. As to Article 56 (6) of the African Charter, the Complainants aver that the Communication has been\u000asubmitted in a timely manner. Lastly, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with the\u000arequirement of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter because the Communication does not deal with a case\u000awhich has been settled by the Respondent State.\u000aThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\u000a\u000a38. Article 56 of the African Charter lists seven Admissibility requirements that have to be cumulatively\u000afulfilled for a Communication to be declared Admissible. In the present Communication, while the\u000aComplainant has clearly stated its arguments as to why the Communication meets each of the seven\u000arequirements stipulated under Article 56, the Respondent State has not made any submission to contest or\u000arefute those claims.\u000a39. From the time when the African Commission was seized with the Communication during its 40th\u000aOrdinary Session in November 2006 to date, ten (10) reminders were sent to the Respondent State\u000arequesting the latter to submit its arguments on Admissibility to no avail.4\u000a40. As the African Commission has stated in the case of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in\u000aAfrica v. Republic of Angola5 "in the face of the state's failure to address itself to the complaint filed against\u000ait, the African Commission has no option but to proceed with its consideration of the Communication in\u000aaccordance with its Rules of Procedure." In the same decision, the African Commission re-affirmed its\u000aposition by ruling that "... it would proceed to consider Communications on the basis of the submission of\u000athe Complainants and information at its disposal, even if the State fails to submit."6\u000a41. In the case at hand, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with all the seven\u000arequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter, except the one relating to the exhaustion of local\u000aremedies under Article 56 (5), for which the Complainant asks for waiver.\u000a42. In the absence of any submissions from the Respondent State to the contrary, the African Commission\u000ahas considered the Complainant's Submission and is convinced that all the requirements under Article 56,\u000aexcept Article 56(5) are met. The Commission proceeds to consider the legitimacy of the request for waiver\u000abased on Article 56(5) of the Charter and relevant jurisprudence.\u000a43. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that Communications should be "sent after exhausting local\u000aremedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged". This requirement is based on\u000athe principle that "the respondent state must first have an opportunity to redress by its own means within\u000athe framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual".7\u000a44. The Commission has stressed that the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies "does not mean\u000athat complainants are required to exhaust any local remedy which is found to be, as a practical matter,\u000aunavailable or ineffective."8 The jurisprudence of the Commission, in determining compliance with this\u000arequirement, sets out "[t]hree major criteria, that is: the local remedy must be available, effective and\u000asufficient."9\u000a45. The initial burden is on the Complainant to prove that they have met the requirement set in Article 56\u000a(5) or that those remedies are unavailable in the particular case. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the\u000aRespondent State if it contests the allegations of the former.\u000a46. In the present case, the Complainant avers that it has no legal standing under Angolan law and its\u000arepresentatives would face arrest and possible execution under Angolan national security laws if they try to\u000apursue legal remedies in Angola, adding that members of FLEC are considered terrorists in Angolan\u000aterritory and hence any attempt to take the case before Angolan courts would be futile, if not impossible,\u000aand would subject members of the Complainant organisation to arbitrary arrest, detention or execution as\u000aterrorists.\u000a47. The Complainant also submits that the only independent human rights organisation in Cabinda,\u000aMpalabanda, that could have taken their case before a court of law was banned on 20 July 2006 for\u000aallegedly inciting violence and hatred, and being involved in political activities. Furthermore, the\u000aComplainant argues that the principal members of FLEC (the Complainant) are outside Angolan\u000ajurisdiction, thus they request for the waiver of the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies.\u000a48. These claims, which are not contested by the Respondent State, show the apparent existence of fear of\u000a4\u000a\u000apersecution on the part of the Complainant.\u000a49. In a number of cases the African Commission has used the standard of constructive exhaustion of local\u000aremedies to provide an exception to the rule. Fear of persecution is one of the exceptions to the\u000arequirement of exhaustion of local remedies. In Sir Dawda K Jawara v The Gambia10 the African\u000aCommission reasoned that "the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but\u000aalso in practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the\u000aapplicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of\u000ahis relatives), local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him".\u000a50. In Rights International v Nigeria11 and John D Ouoko v Kenya12 , the African Commission reasoned that\u000athe existence of apparent fear of persecution on the part of the victims, to return to their countries to\u000aexhaust local remedies would make the remedies not available to such persons and hence exempt them\u000afrom the requirement to exhaust those remedies.\u000a51. In the present Communication, the fact that the Complainant has no legal standing before Angolan\u000acourts, that most of its members live abroad and are considered terrorists by the Government, leads to the\u000aconclusion that the chances of the Complainant exhausting local remedies have been practically rendered\u000aimpossible by fear of prosecution.\u000a52. Therefore, the African Commission holds that local remedies were not available to the Complainant and\u000ahence rules that the Communication is in line with the requirement under Article 56(5) of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a53. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance\u000awith Article 56 of the African Charter.\u000aConsideration of the Merits\u000aSummary of Complaint's Submission\u000a\u000a54. The Complainant emphasises that the present Communication concerns itself strictly with a claim for\u000aeconomic self-determination of the people of Cabinda and in particular with the disposition and exploitation\u000aof onshore oil, mineral and natural resources.\u000a55. The Complainant states further that the Communication excludes the matter of offshore resource\u000aallocation and relates only to the extraction of onshore resources which has remained dormant due largely\u000ato FLEC's armed opposition to any such exploitation. The Complainant contends that it does not recognise\u000agrants of resource extraction licences and concessions made by the Respondent State and asserts that it\u000areserves the right to make its own arrangements with resource extraction companies upon the\u000a"decolonisation" of Cabinda.\u000a56. Based on its contention that it has been recognised as the legitimate representative of the Cabinda\u000apeople since 1974, the Complainant requests that the Commission to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the\u000aissue of Cabinda's economic self-determination on the grounds that the Respondent State has violated\u000aArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\u000a57. The Complainant argues that as an incident of the right to property under Article 14 of the African\u000aCharter, the natural resources of Cabinda remain the property of the people of Cabinda and must be\u000aadministered largely for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. Accordingly, the grant of licences and\u000aconcession for the extraction of onshore natural resources by the Respondent State is a violation of Article\u000a14 of the African Charter.\u000a58. It is the further contention of the Complainant that although a state can grant resource extraction rights\u000ain the name of its people, a grant made in cases where one people dominate another or a grant made or\u000aadministered in an irresponsible manner would be illegitimate. The Complainant argues that historically,\u000aCabinda has always maintained a separate identity, linguistically and otherwise, and the people of Cabinda\u000awere neither consulted on the 'unilateral termination of Portuguese colonial protectorate' nor did they ratify\u000a'the Angolan occupation' of Cabinda.\u000a59. The Complainant states that since 1974 it has 'maintained a civil government inside portions of\u000aCabinda' and many of the areas of resource extraction 'are in or near the FLEC zone'. Further, that since\u000athe people of Cabinda are distinct, the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource\u000aextraction licences or concessions in violation of the right to property of the people of Cabinda as contained\u000ain Article 14 of the African Charter.\u000a60. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that\u000a5\u000a\u000a'revenue from onshore resource extraction will flow to Luanda just as offshore revenue does now'. The\u000aComplainant argues that a 2006 Cabinda Peace Accord which promised a 50% return of oil revenue to\u000aCabinda 'has not been realised or audited' and only '10% or less will return to Cabinda'. The Complainant\u000aalleges further that any attempt to question the allocation of revenue has resulted in summary\u000aimprisonment 'as in the case of Global Witness Investigatory' staff who was arrested and charged by\u000aAngolan Police after meeting with local representatives of civil society in Cabinda.\u000a61. The Complainant alleges further that in spite of the abundant oil resources in Cabinda unemployment is\u000ahigh and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in Cabinda than in most areas of Angola. The\u000aComplainant adds that Cabinda's resources have 'subsidised the government of Angola' and the 'Angolan\u000aadministration has little concern for providing public goods and incentives to facilitate investment in welfare\u000aenhancing improvements for the population at large'. Thus, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent\u000aState has violated Article 19 of the African Charter.\u000a62. Regarding the alleged violation of Article 20 of the Charter, the Complainant emphasises that the\u000apeople of Cabinda are geographically, politically, linguistically and culturally distinct from Angolans so that\u000athey are have a right to social and economic development. The Complainant contends that the people of\u000aCabinda are unable to exercise this right because organisations which 'espouse a uniquely Cabindan point\u000aof view' have been banned by the government of Angola. Complainant alleges further that Cabindans who\u000acampaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested as 'FLEC sympathisers' while foreigners\u000awho have identified corruption in Cabinda have been sent to jail. Accordingly the Complainant claims that\u000athe Respondent State has violated Article 20 of the African Charter.\u000a63. On Article 21 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that grants and concessions (what it\u000aterms onshore oil and mineral rights offerings) have been made by the Respondent State 'without input\u000afrom the Cabindans' and that all decisions regarding natural resources are made from Luanda, the Capital\u000aof Angola. The Complainant contends that the Cabinda people and FLEC as the representative of the\u000aCabinda people have not been adequately consulted about the management of 'their onshore resources.\u000aRather, exploration and exploitation activities have been undertaken under the watch of the Angolan Armed\u000aForces. Thus, the Complainant disputes the legal right of the Respondent State to exploit and dispose\u000aonshore resources in Cabinda and alleges that such activities amount to spoliation which is in violation of\u000aArticle 21 of the African Charter and therefore should be redressed by the Respondent State.\u000a64. On the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Complainant asserts that the people of\u000aCabinda are a distinct people with a right to economic and social development and contends that the\u000acurrent policy of the Respondent State is one of 'Angolanisation of Cabinda' involving discriminating against\u000aand arresting individuals and groups that claim a Cabindan identity. Accordingly, the Complainant alleges\u000athat the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\u000a65. Regarding Article 24 of the African Charter, the Complainant alleges that the environment in Cabinda is\u000anot conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. While it claims it does not seek an ideal\u000aenvironment, the Complainant argues that it seeks an environment that permits 'some measure of equity for\u000athe people of Cabinda'. The Complainant contends that the operations of companies such as Chevron take\u000aplace in conditions that harm human health and the environment because the Respondent State has failed\u000ato enforce compliance with environmental rules.\u000a66. The Complainant alleges further that the absence of viable civil society in Cabinda following the ban on\u000athe Mpalabanda organisation ensures that the activities of oil companies are not monitored and no\u000acompensation is paid in the event of damage to the environment. The Complainant therefore argues that\u000athe Respondent State has violated the right of the people of Cabinda to a satisfactory environment as\u000aguaranteed in Article 24 of the African Charter.\u000a67. In support of all its allegations, the Complaint has submitted five documents as exhibits. They include a\u000a"Republic of Kabinda January 8 2010 Committee Report on the Togolese Incident"; a 1974 joint\u000acommuniqué between Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA) and the Complainant (FLEC);\u000aa Human Rights Watch report titled "They Put me in the Hole - Military Detention, Torture and Lack of Due\u000aProcess in Cabinda"; a 2008 Chevron Alternative Annual Report titled "Chevron in Angola" and an Amnesty\u000aInternational Public Statement titled "Angola: Human rights organization banned". Also submitted in support\u000aof the Complainant's case are historical accounts presented by different bodies acting on behalf of the\u000apeoples of Cabinda.\u000a\u000a6\u000a\u000aSummary of Respondent State's Submission\u000a\u000a68. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State argues first that the Communication should not\u000ahave been declared admissible because that it failed to meet the requirements for admissibility as set out in\u000athe African Charter. The Respondent State argues that Article 57 of the African Charter requires that prior\u000ato the consideration of a Communication on the merit, the Chairperson of the Commission ought to present\u000athe Complaint before the Respondent State, setting out procedural matters and indicating whether the\u000aComplaint conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other African Union (AU) instruments\u000arelevant to the matter. The Respondent State contends that this requirement had not been met with respect\u000ato the present Communication.\u000a69. The Respondent State argues further that the Communication is not admissible for failure to comply\u000awith the requirements of Articles 50 and 56(5) of the African Charter regarding exhaustion of local\u000aremedies. The Respondent State also alleges that the Commission failed to comply with Rule 6 (3) of its\u000aown Rules of Procedure which prohibits "unrecognised National Liberation Movements from submitting\u000amatters for inclusion in the agenda of sessions of the Commission". The Respondent State insists that the\u000aComplainant is not qualified to submit this Communication to the African Commission's Session as it is\u000aneither a State Party nor a party entitled to bring "Other Communications" before the Commission.\u000a70. Citing Articles 3(b)13 and 4(b)14 of the AU Constitutive Act, the Respondent State argues that the\u000apresent Communication cannot proceed as it challenges the existing borders of an AU Member State and\u000athreatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Respondent State.\u000a71. With respect to the merits of the Communication, the Respondent State supplied its version of the\u000ahistory of Angola emphasising that both the Alvor Accord of 1975 and the Constitution of Angola endow it\u000awith sovereignty over the territory now known as Angola, including the Province of Cabinda. The\u000aRespondent State argues therefore that the right to self-determination has been exercised by the collective\u000a"peoples" of Angola and does not avail minorities and ethnic groups because it can only be available to\u000astates emerging from colonial boundaries in recognition of the principle of "uti possidetis juris".\u000a72. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 14 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends\u000athat the right to property is also enshrined in Articles 14 and 37 of its own Constitution. The Respondent\u000aState argues that the right to property in its Constitution is guaranteed in the interest of individuals,\u000acorporate bodies and local communities which "implies all the people of Angola"\u000a73. The Respondent State argues further that the Complainant has not demonstrated that the government\u000aof Angola does not manage the resources of Cabinda for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. The\u000aRespondent State avers that the government administers all its natural resources in an equitable and\u000abalanced manner as a common asset for the economic, social and cultural development of the country and\u000ain the national interest.\u000a74. The Respondent State insists that the government of the Province of Cabinda receives a share of the\u000aAngolan State General Budget just like every other provincial government in Angola. Further, that by Article\u000a7 of the Angolan State General Budget Act (no 26/10) the Provinces of Cabinda and Zaire receive amounts\u000aequal to 10 percent of earnings from petroleum resources in addition to other expenditures and costs for\u000athe construction of schools, roads, bridges, harbours, hospitals and other socio-economic infrastructure.\u000aThus, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 14 of the African Charter since its\u000aaffairs are run "in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws".\u000a75. As regards the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\u000aArticle 21 of its own Constitution provides for the principle of equality and that principle is implemented in all\u000aits 18 provinces. The Respondent State argues that as a result of its domestic constitutional obligation it\u000a"cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country based on the premise that revenue should\u000abe spent only in areas where it is generated". The Respondent State cites the example of its on-going\u000a"Strategy to Fight Poverty" which aims to achieve a "50% reduction by 2015 in the number of people with\u000aless than USD1.00 per day".\u000a76. The Respondent State insists further that as compared to other provinces, the Province of Cabinda\u000aenjoys a special status in view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget. The\u000aRespondent State also asserts that as contained in recent United Nations Development Programme\u000a(UNDP) and United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports, there is an overall improvement\u000ain areas such as child health care and health care generally. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends,\u000ait has not violated Article 19 of the African Charter as it relates to the Province of Cabinda.\u000a77. As regards the alleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends that\u000a7\u000a\u000athe right has collectively been fulfilled by all the Angolan people through the attainment of independence on\u000a11 November 1975 and by the conduct of free democratic elections in 1992 and 2008 respectively. The\u000aRespondent State asserts that according to available records a total of 7, 213, 281 voters representing\u000a87.36% of the population of Angola went to the polls in the 2008 Legislative elections in Angola. Out of the\u000a220 deputies elected in the 2008 Legislative elections, 5 came from Cabinda as representatives of the\u000aCabinda Province. Accordingly, the Respondent State argues that the people of Cabinda are represented\u000ain the National Assembly of the Republic of Angola by those deputies. In support of these assertions, the\u000aRespondent State attaches reports of the 2008 and 2012 elections as released by its National Electoral\u000aCommission.\u000a78. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends that as with other of its provinces, the Province of Cabinda\u000ahas its own political and administrative structures which are defined by law. The Respondent State argues\u000athat "like most African peoples, Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society" and Article 87 of its\u000aConstitution guarantees the right to respect, appreciation and preservation of the cultural, linguistic and\u000aartistic identity of the Angolan people. As such, the Respondent State concludes that it has not violated\u000aArticle 20 of the African Charter.\u000a79. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\u000aArticles 94 and 95 of its own Constitution create and separate public and private domains of property rights.\u000aIt asserts that natural resources fall under the public domain and property in the public domain is\u000aconstitutionally intended to "serve national interests instead of local interests alone" since it is expected to\u000a"benefit the Angolan people as a whole, with no exception". The Respondent State points out that the\u000aComplainant itself agrees that some percentage of oil revenue is already set aside specially for the\u000aProvince of Cabinda.\u000a80. The Respondent State contends further that Angola operates a unitary system of government in which\u000aall provinces are on equal footing such that all public resources should serve the entire population of the\u000astate but it was in spite of this fact that the Province of Cabinda has been given special attention as a result\u000aof its contribution to national oil production.\u000a81. The Respondent State challenges the Complainant's claim that it (FLEC) is Cabinda's representative\u000aand argues that the Complainant "lacks moral, legal and any other form of legitimacy" therefore it cannot\u000aspeak on behalf of the people of Cabinda. The Respondent State insists that as a sovereign state, Angola\u000ahas the legitimacy and the right to explore the natural resources in its territory, including those found in any\u000aof its 18 provinces. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 21 of the African Charter.\u000a82. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\u000athe Complainant has failed to produce any evidence to sustain a claim that the rights of the people of\u000aCabinda have been violated. The Respondent State asserts that since Cabinda is part of a single,\u000aindivisible and inalienable territory (Angola) it finds no reason or basis to defend a claim that Cabinda is\u000abeing "Angolanised".\u000a83. The Respondent State contends that its citizens are Angolans by origin both according to its domestic\u000alaw and in international law. It being the case, that there is no such thing as the State of Cabinda in Africa\u000abut a Cabinda that is a province "which is an integral part of the Angolan State", the Respondent State\u000aargues that it retains a right to punish by law, "every deed, action or attempt to divide the Angolan State".\u000aThe Respondent State therefore argues that it has not violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\u000a84. On the alleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that it takes\u000athe characteristics of Cabinda's oil fields and forests into account and has taken measures with a view to\u000apreserving the environment. The Respondent State cites the enactment of legislation at national and local\u000alevels based on an entrenched right to a healthy and unpolluted environment in Article 39 of its\u000aConstitution. The Respondent State contends further that it has a Basic Environment Act in addition to a\u000anumber of other statutes and institutions such as a Multi-Sector Technical Commission and the National\u000aEnvironment Authority which address the issues arising from oil exploration.\u000a85. The Respondent State claims further that by a Presidential Decree of 2011, oil companies are required\u000ato account for any harm stemming from oil spills, while paying greater attention to fishermen and their\u000afamilies. The Respondent State admits that there have been oil spills in the Province of Cabinda but that its\u000aMinistry of Environment's National Environment Surveillance Service has kept track of at least six of these\u000aspills, compelling oil companies to compensate fishermen and to replace items that had been lost or\u000adamaged.\u000a86. The Respondent State asserts further that it has legislation which compels concessionaires and their\u000aassociates to take preventive and practical measures to address environmental damage. Such measures\u000a8\u000a\u000ainclude the generation of evaluation studies and environment impact audits, landscape and structural\u000areplenishment plans and standing contract mechanisms for environmental management and auditing.\u000a87. The Respondent State submits that following an accident in the Gulf of Mexico, its Ministry of\u000aEnvironment has audited oil rigs in the Angolan sea "with a view to preventing a repetition of what\u000ahappened in ... the Western Hemisphere". It also claims that its Ministry of Environment has "been holding\u000apublic consultation on environment impact evaluation in the Cabinda South Block in terms of Decree No\u000a51". The Respondent State contends that these measures are not restricted to the oil sector but are\u000aextended to other resources. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter.\u000a88. In proof of its assertion, the Respondent State attached the results of its 2008 and 2012 Legislative\u000aelections result but no other documents apart from a "Memorandum of Understanding and Integration of\u000aFLEC Members" which states that the Respondent State has spent huge sums of money to register and\u000ademobilise former FLEC soldiers. The Respondent State concludes by insisting that the Communication\u000ashould be considered inadmissible "for lacking a legal basis and probable cause".\u000aComplainant's Supplementary Submission\u000a\u000a89. In its supplementary submission in reply to the Respondent State's arguments on the merit, the\u000aComplainant reaffirmed and expanded on its version of the history of Cabinda in order to show that the\u000aterritory of Cabinda was historically administered separately from mainland Angola and had a people with\u000adistinct linguistic, cultural and political identity.\u000aAmicus Submissions\u000a\u000a90. Between January and March 2012 and again in June 2013, a number of submissions were made by a\u000anumber of organisations representing different interests of the Cabinda people. With the consent of the\u000alegal representative of the Complainant, those submissions are considered as amicus briefs. In all their\u000asubmissions, the different groups advance the Complainant's version of historical facts and insist that the\u000apeople of Cabinda are victims of unlawful, aggressive and unilateral invasion by the government of the\u000aRespondent State. The groups submit that as a result of these historical facts and considering that the\u000apeople of Cabinda were not consulted before their territory was ceded to Angola, the actions of the\u000aRespondent State amount to colonialism or neo-colonialism such that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\u000aself-determination.\u000aThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\u000a91. Although it did not submit its observations on the Admissibility of the Communication despite the receipt\u000aof a formal invitation and reminders to that effect from the Secretariat,15 the first part of the Respondent\u000aState's submission on the Merit challenges the Admissibility of the Communication and raises issues that\u000aamount to a preliminary objection to the consideration of the Communication. Before analysing the merits of\u000athis Communication, the Commission considers it necessary to address some of the concerns raised by the\u000aRespondent State even though most of those issues ought to have been raised at the admissibility stage.\u000a92. The Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that Article 57 of the African Charter requires\u000athat a Communication to be considered by the Commission should first be presented to the concerned\u000aState Party by the Chairperson of the African Commission, setting out procedural matters and indicating\u000awhether the Communication conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other AU instruments.\u000aArticle 57 reads as follows: Prior to any substantive consideration, all communications shall be brought to\u000athe knowledge of the State concerned by the Chairman of the Commission\u000a93. The Commission affirms that Article 57 of the Charter obligates it to notify a State Party of the existence\u000aof a Complaint against such a State Party so that the State Party can participate in the proceedings. The\u000aCommission recalls that notice of this Communication was transmitted to the Respondent State by Note\u000aVerbale dated 28 February 2007. As indicated in paragraphs 16 to 20 and paragraphs 24 to 27 of the\u000aAdmissibility decision, the Secretariat through several subsequent correspondences transmitted to the\u000aRespondent State the original Complaint and all other documents filed by the Complainant regarding this\u000aCommunication. Further, as noted in paragraph 39 above, at least ten (10) reminders were sent to the\u000aRespondent State to respond to the Admissibility arguments but these did not yield any response from the\u000aRespondent State. Accordingly, the African Commission notes that it has satisfied its duty to the\u000aRespondent State as required by Article 57 of the African Charter.\u000a9\u000a\u000a94. The Respondent State further contends that the African Commission has failed to comply with Rule\u000a6(3)16 of its own Rules of Procedure. The Commission notes that the provisions cited by the Respondent\u000aState relating to the Provisional Agenda of the Commission's sessions are now contained in Rule 32 of the\u000aCommission's Rules of Procedure. The Commission recalls that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure\u000aprovides as follows: The provisional Agenda shall include but not be limited to, items on "Communications\u000afrom States" and "Other Communications" in accordance with the provisions of Articles 48, 49 and 55 of the\u000aCharter.\u000a95. The Commission reaffirms that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure permits "Other Communications"17\u000asuch as the one now being considered to be included in the Agenda of the Commission's Session. In line\u000awith that provision, the present Communication is properly before the Commission as it has duly been\u000aincluded in the Agenda of the Session.\u000a96. The Respondent State contends further that the present Communication ought to have been declared\u000ainadmissible because it fails to comply with certain aspects of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\u000aCommission recalls that the Respondent State was contacted at every stage and given ample opportunity\u000ato present its position and arguments regarding the admissibility of this Communication but the Respondent\u000aState did not take advantage of the opportunity.\u000a97. The Commission notes further that in the event that a State Party fails to submit its observations on\u000aadmissibility within 60 days from the receipt of the Complainant's submission from the Secretariat as set out\u000ain Rule 105(2) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, this Commission is authorised to proceed to make\u000aa decision on the admissibility of the Communication. In such cases, the Commission examines the\u000aadmissibility submissions of the Complainant against the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\u000aCommission notes that in relation to the present Communication, this procedure has been followed to the\u000aletter. Accordingly, the Commission cannot revisit its admissibility decision in respect of the\u000aCommunication.\u000a98. Notwithstanding the fact that its Admissibility decision in respect of the Communication will not be\u000areviewed, the Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that the present Communication should\u000ahave been declared inadmissible on the grounds that it contradicts Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU\u000aConstitutive Act. In that regard, the Commission recalls the Complainant's submission that the present\u000aCommunication does not seek a decision on political self-determination or a right to secede from the\u000aRespondent State.\u000a99. In its correspondences and submissions to the Secretariat, the Complainant has maintained that its\u000aclaim is strictly restricted to a request for a decision on economic self-determination and a determination of\u000athe right of the people of Cabinda to enjoy the use of natural resources located within the Province of\u000aCabinda. The Commission has also considered the prayers of the Complainant and notes that the claims\u000aas formulated do not contradict the provisions of Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act. The\u000aCommission does not consider itself bound to pronounce on the amicus briefs which seek to introduce\u000asecessionist dimensions to the Communication. Accordingly, the Commission proceeds to determine the\u000aCommunication based on the submissions of the Parties.\u000aAlleged violation of article 14\u000a\u000a100. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right to property of the people of\u000aCabinda contrary to Article 14 of the African Charter. Article 14 of the African Charter provides as follows:\u000aThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\u000ain the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\u000a101. The Complainant contends that an incident of the right to property as guaranteed in the African\u000aCharter is that the natural resources of Cabinda must be administered largely for the benefit of the people\u000aof Cabinda since the people of Cabinda claim a distinct identity from the rest of Angola. It is also the\u000aComplainant's argument that the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource licences\u000aand concessions on Cabinda resources.\u000a102. The Respondent State submits that its Constitution provides for the right to property and that the\u000aconstitutional right is available to all the peoples of Angola. However, the State argues that certain items\u000aare classified in its Constitution as property in the public domain intended to serve the wider national\u000ainterest rather than the interest of a smaller unit within the state. The Respondent State further challenges\u000athe Complainant's argument that the Government of Angola has not managed natural resources for the\u000abenefit of Cabinda people.\u000a10\u000a\u000a103. Generally, this Commission has stated in its jurisprudence that the role of the State in relation to the\u000aright to property is "to respect and protect this right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the\u000aexercise of this right in order for it to be accessible to everyone.18 One way of fulfilling Charter obligation on\u000athe right to property is therefore to adopt legislation which recognises the principle of ownership and\u000apeaceful enjoyment of property. The inclusion of the right to property in the Angolan Constitution is\u000atherefore in compliance with the Respondent State's Charter duty.\u000a104. With regards to the general question whether a "people" can be bearers of the right to property under\u000athe African Charter, this Commission has previously answered in the affirmative in relation to indigenous\u000apeoples in Africa.19 The African Commission reaffirms that a collective or communal right to property exists\u000aas a component of the right to property in Article 14 of the African Charter. Similar to the individual right to\u000aproperty, the communal right to property entails a state duty to recognise and protect peaceful enjoyment of\u000aownership by a group or people subject to limitation by a state in the interest of public need or in the\u000ageneral interest and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\u000a105. The Commission has also expressed the opinion that natural resources located in land owned or\u000aoccupied by a people can be the subject of ownership in the context of the right to property under the\u000aAfrican Charter.20 In the Commission's view, protection of communal property rights to natural resources as\u000aa component of land right enjoyed by indigenous peoples is not alien to the African Charter or to\u000ainternational human rights generally.21 One justification for the protection of this aspect of the right is the\u000astrong traditional attachment to their cultural land that indigenous peoples hold on to such that their survival\u000adepends on the resources they traditionally extract from the land.22\u000a106. The Commission notes that the Complainant does not claim that the people of Cabinda are indigenous\u000apeoples with strong attachment to their land and their culture. The basis of the Complainant's claim is that\u000aCabinda existed as a distinct Portuguese protectorate prior to 1975 when it was declared to be part of an\u000aindependent Angola without the consent of the people of Cabinda. The Commission does not believe that\u000adistinct pre-colonial history on its own currently suffices to sustain a claim for special protection of a\u000adistinctive overriding communal right to property under the Charter.\u000a107. In the absence of evidence that land in Cabinda is communally owned in a traditional context and that\u000athe people of Cabinda had and continue to hold on to strong attachment to their land as part of a distinct\u000aculture which requires dependence on land and its resources for the survival of the people of Cabinda, the\u000aright to property can be validly limited by the State in the overall public interest of the entire state and in\u000aaccordance with appropriate laws.\u000a108. In line with its obligation under International law, the African Charter and its domestic laws generally,\u000athe Respondent State can only limit the right to property under certain laid down conditions. The\u000aComplainant has not claimed or adduced evidence to show that the limitation of the right in relation to the\u000apeople of Cabinda was not done in the public interest and according to appropriate laws.\u000a109. The Commission recalls the Complainant's argument that an incident of the right to property under the\u000aCharter is that the people of Cabinda are entitled to be the main beneficiaries of the natural resources and\u000athat the Respondent State cannot unilaterally dispose of the natural resources of the people of Cabinda\u000awithout their involvement in decisions on such disposal. The Commission agrees with the Complainant that\u000aas an aspect of the right to property under the Charter, the people of Cabinda are entitled to benefit from\u000athe natural resource found in their lands. However, the Commission believes that the enjoyment of that\u000aaspect of the right should not be to the detriment of other communities and groups in the State. The\u000aCommission notes further that the Respondent State's submission that the people of Cabinda (along with\u000athe province of Zaire23 ) enjoy a fair and equitable share of the proceeds of the petroleum resources of the\u000aState has not been challenged despite the Complainant's claim that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\u000aan additional 50% of proceeds from natural resources.\u000a110. The Commission finds that the Complainant has failed to show that the people of Cabinda have a\u000astrong and profound cultural or ancestral attachment to their land and the natural resources under the land\u000asuch that their survival depends on its protection. The Complainant has also failed to show that the\u000aRespondent State has denied the people of Cabinda a right to share equitably in the benefits accruing from\u000atheir natural resources. Accordingly, the African Commission finds no violation in relation to Article 14 of the\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a111. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of the Charter because\u000athe people of Cabinda have not enjoyed the right to equality as a people entitled to the same respect and\u000arights as other peoples in Angola. Article 19 provides that: All peoples shall be equal; they shall enjoy the\u000asame respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by another.\u000a112. It is the Complainant's submission that Article 19 of the Charter has been violated in relation to the\u000apeople of Cabinda because it anticipates that revenue from onshore resource extraction will "flow to\u000aLuanda just as offshore revenue does now". The Complainant alleges further that despite the resources\u000aextracted from Cabinda, unemployment is high and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in\u000aCabinda than in most other areas of Angola. Thus, it claims the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of\u000athe African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\u000a113. In response to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the Charter, the Respondent State contends that its\u000aConstitution provides for the principle of equality and this is implemented in all its 18 provinces. The\u000aRespondent State argues further that 'it cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country\u000abased on the premise that revenue should only be spent in areas where it is generated. The Respondent\u000aState submits that while it is developing the entire country, the Province of Cabinda enjoys a "special status\u000ain view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget". Thus, it claims that it has not violated\u000aArticle 19 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\u000a114. The Commission reaffirms its position that distinct and identifiable groups of "peoples" and\u000acommunities exist within the State Parties to the African Charter and each set of "peoples" and\u000acommunities is entitled to enjoy internal legal equality vis-?-vis other "peoples" and communities within the\u000asame state.24 The Commission notes that a claim of unequal treatment in violation of Article 19 of the\u000aCharter requires evidence that a given group or set of peoples who is in a position similar to another group\u000aor set of people has been or is being treated differently or that a given group or set of peoples who is in a\u000aposition different to another group or set of people is treated similarly such that the "peoples" complaining\u000asuffer unfair and unjustifiable disadvantage that amounts to discrimination.\u000a115. In its submission, the Complainant contends that the bulk of the anticipated revenue from the\u000aresources in Cabinda will "flow to Luanda while only 10% or less will get to Cabinda". The Complainant\u000adoes not elaborate to show whether any single group of people in the Respondent State enjoys a greater\u000ashare of allocation than the People of Cabinda. The Complainant also provides no documentary or other\u000aevidence in support of its claim. The Complainant does not produce the 2006 Peace Accord which it refers\u000ato in its submission. However, the Respondent State does not contest the claims but admits them partially\u000ato the extent that the Respondent State submits that the Province of Cabinda enjoys a special status since\u000ait receives up to 10% of oil revenue.\u000a116. The Commission notes the Respondent State's submission that the 10% special revenue that accrues\u000ato Cabinda is in addition to other infrastructural costs that the Government funds in the Province of\u000aCabinda. Although the Respondent State has also failed to adduce any documentary or other evidence in\u000asupport of this claim, the Complainant has not contested the Respondent State's claim that only the\u000aProvince of Cabinda (along with the Province of Zaire) enjoy the "special status". Accordingly, the\u000aCommission will make its decision on the basis of the unchallenged submissions of the Parties.\u000a117. Generally, the Commission holds the view that real or substantive equality requires that groups who\u000ahave suffered previous disadvantages or continue to suffer disadvantages within a state are entitled to\u000asome advantageous treatment especially where such groups bear an unequal part of the burden for the\u000aexploration of natural resources in that state.25 However, the Commission also notes the Respondent\u000aState's argument that it cannot implement measures that aim at spending revenue only in areas where it is\u000agenerated.\u000a118. The Commissions takes the view that the principle of equality requires the striking of a balance\u000abetween a group's claim to advantageous treatment or affirmative action and the legitimate expectation of\u000aother groups within the state to share in the resources of that state. Accordingly, the Commission believes\u000athat a proper interpretation of equality in the present circumstance is one which recognises the right of the\u000apeople of Cabinda to receive some advantage without endangering the survival of other peoples within the\u000astate or threatening the continued corporate existence of the Respondent State.\u000a119. Although the Complainant contends that the people of Cabinda suffer unequal treatment as compared\u000ato the rest of Angola in terms of comparatively higher levels of unemployment, poverty, infant mortality and\u000adisease, no tangible evidence or data has been adduced to support these claims. As this Commission had\u000a12\u000a\u000apreviously observed, a Complainant that has made general claims and allegations needs to substantiate\u000asuch claims and allegations with either documentary evidence or sworn affidavits or the corroborating\u000atestimony of others.26 In the absence of evidence to support the claim of unequal treatment, the\u000aCommission does not find a violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a120. Basing its argument on an acclaimed geographical, political, linguistic and cultural distinction from the\u000arest of Angola, the Complainant claims that the Respondent State has violated the right of the people of\u000aCabinda to social and economic development as guaranteed in Article 20 of the African Charter. The\u000aComplainant submits that the people of Cabinda are unable to exercise the right because organisations\u000athat "espouse a uniquely Cabindan point of view" are banned by the Government of Angola.\u000a121. The Complainant alleges further that the enjoyment of the right to social and economic development is\u000arestricted because people who campaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested. On these\u000agrounds, the Complainant alleges that the right of the people of Cabinda to social and economic\u000adevelopment had been violated.\u000a122. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 20 of the African Charter in relation to\u000athe people of Cabinda because the right to self-determination had been collectively fulfilled by the entire\u000apeople of Angola at independence in 1975. The Respondent State submits further the periodic democratic\u000aelections take place in Angola and as citizens of Angola, the people of Cabinda have participated fully at\u000asuch elections, producing 5 out of 220 deputies elected to the Angolan Parliament.\u000a123. It is the Respondent State's further contention that Cabinda also has its own political and\u000aadministrative structures defined by Angolan law. On these grounds and in view of Article 87 of its\u000aConstitution which acknowledges that Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society where the different\u000aidentities are to be appreciated and respected, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated\u000aArticle 20 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\u000a124. The Commission recalls that Article 20 of the Charter has a particular historical context in the sense\u000athat it is one of the provisions of the Charter that was aimed at addressing the situation of Africans who\u000aremained under colonial domination at the time the Charter was drafted. Article 20 of the Charter provides\u000athat :\u000a\u000a1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and inalienable\u000aright to self-determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\u000aeconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\u000a2. Colonised or oppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination\u000aby resorting to any means recognised by the international community.\u000a3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the State Parties to the present Charter in their\u000aliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\u000a125. The Commission notes the argument of the Complainant regarding the alleged violation of Article 20\u000aof the Charter. In view of its opinion that the right to self-determination, the right of colonised and oppressed\u000apeople to free themselves from domination and the right to assistance in liberation struggle are reserved for\u000acolonised peoples, the Commission does not agree with the Complainant that a distinct pre-colonial history\u000aby itself entitles the people of Cabinda to unilaterally claim those rights contained vis-?-vis the Respondent\u000aState.\u000a126. As the Commission has noted in its earlier jurisprudence, in post-colonial Africa, the right to self\u000adetermination can be enjoyed within the existing territories and with full respect for the sovereignty and\u000aterritorial integrity of State Parties to the Charter.27 The Commission also believes that the right to pursue\u000aeconomic and social development is attainable within the framework of an existing state insofar as different\u000agroups and communities are represented in decision-making institutions of the given state. Accordingly, the\u000aCommission does not find any violation of Article 20 of the Charter.\u000a\u000a13\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a127. In relation to Article 21, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right of\u000athe people of Cabinda to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources because the Respondent\u000aState has made grants and concessions on Cabinda's onshore oil resources "without input from the\u000aCabindans". The Complainant contends that the acts the Respondent State in this regard amount to\u000aspoliation under Article 21 of the Charter and should attract a right to lawful recovery and to an adequate\u000acompensation. Article 21 of the African Charter states as follows:\u000a\u000a1. All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in\u000athe exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it.\u000a2. In all cases of spoliation, the disposed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its\u000aproperty as well as to an adequate compensation.\u000a3. The free disposal of wealth and natural resources shall be exercised without prejudice to the\u000aobligation of promoting international economic cooperation based on mutual respect, equitable\u000aexchange and the principles of international law.\u000a4. State Parties to the present Charter shall individually and collectively exercise the right to free\u000adisposal of their wealth and natural resources with a view to strengthening African Unity and\u000asolidarity.\u000a5. State Parties to the present Charter shall undertake to eliminate all forms of foreign exploitation\u000aparticularly that practiced by all international monopolies so as to enable their peoples to fully\u000abenefit from the advantages derived from their national resources.\u000a128. The Respondent State argues that by Articles 94 and 95 of its Constitution, natural resources fall in\u000athe category of items classified as property in the public domain which are reserved to serve national rather\u000anarrow local interests. The Respondent State submits further the Province of Cabinda already receives\u000aspecial attention for its contribution to oil revenues. Asserting its sovereign authority and legitimacy to\u000aexplore natural resources in Angolan territory, the Respondent State challenges the authority and\u000alegitimacy of the Complainant to speak on behalf of the people of Cabinda with regards to the exploitation\u000aof natural resources.\u000a129. The Commission recalls its jurisprudence which traces the origin of Article 21 to the colonial era when\u000ahuman and material resources in Africa were exploited for the benefit of powers from outside the\u000acontinent.28 However, the Commission has also held that the rights in Article 21 of the Charter are still\u000aapplicable in post-colonial Africa in favour of groups within states to the extent that it triggers an obligation\u000aon the part of the State Parties to protect their citizens from exploitation by external economic powers29 and\u000ato ensure that groups and communities, directly or through their representatives, are involved in decisions\u000arelating to the disposal of their wealth.30 Nevertheless, the Commission also recognises the right of State\u000aParties to supervise the disposal of wealth in the general interest of the state and its communities.31\u000a130. The Commission notes that in relation to Article 21 of the Charter, the Complaint invokes a right of the\u000apeople of Cabinda to dispose of their wealth and natural resources as well as to receive compensation for\u000aresources already exploited. In this regard, the Commission notes that the term "peoples" in Article 21 of\u000athe Charter can mean either the entire peoples of a given state or a "peoples" within the state. The\u000aCommission believes that in the first context, Article 21 of the African Charter empowers a State Party to\u000aexercise the guaranteed right free from interference from any other African or non-African state. This has to\u000abe the explanation for sub-Articles 4 and 5 of Article 21 which speak to State Parties.\u000a131. However, the Commission believes that a "peoples" within an existing state can be beneficiaries of the\u000aright in Article 21 to the extent that it imposes a duty on the Respondent State to ensure that resources are\u000aeffectively managed for the sole and equal benefit of the entire peoples of the state. Accordingly, the\u000aAfrican Commission is of the view that one aspect of the right in Article 21 of the African Charter is the duty\u000aof the State to involve representatives of its peoples in decisions concerning the management of national\u000awealth and natural resources.\u000a132. The Respondent State has shown that elected representatives of the people of Cabinda are in the\u000aAngolan Parliament which exercises oversight supervision of the management of natural resources. As this\u000aCommission noted in SERAC v Nigeria,32 the State has the right to exploit natural resources in its territory.\u000aHowever, the Commission believes that Article 21 of the African Charter presupposes that that right is held\u000a14\u000a\u000ain trust for the people. The Respondent State's submission that it effectively manages natural resources for\u000athe benefit of all peoples in Angola has not been challenged. The Commission therefore finds no violation\u000aof Article 21 of the Charter.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a133. The Complainant's allegation that the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter\u000awith regards to the people of Cabinda is based exclusively on the argument that the Respondent State\u000apursues a policy of "Angolanisation of Cabinda". In the absence of any other argument or evidence in\u000asupport, the African Commission finds no violation.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter\u000a\u000a134. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated Article 24 of the African Charter in\u000arelation to the people of Cabinda because, as a result of oil exploitation activities authorised by the State,\u000athe environment in Cabinda is not conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. The\u000aComplainant argues further that the operations of companies such as Chevron which are authorised by the\u000aRespondent State take place in conditions that harm both human health and the environment and this has\u000ahappened because in the absence of viable civil society monitoring, the Respondent State has failed to\u000aenforce compliance with environmental rules.\u000a135. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter in relation to\u000athe people of Cabinda since it has taken measures aimed at preserving the environment. The Respondent\u000aState cites national legislations that it has adopted to address the challenge of environmental pollution. The\u000aRespondent State submits further that it has compelled oil companies operating in the area to account for\u000aharm occasioned by oil spills, with emphasis on demanding compensation for fishermen and their families.\u000aThe Respondent also claims that it has set up a National Environment Surveillance Service that has kept\u000atrack of at least six oil spills in the area while its Ministry of Environment has audited rigs in the Angolan sea\u000ato prevent further spills. In effect, the Respondent State contends that it has taken action to address the\u000aconcerns of the Complainant.\u000a136. The African Commission notes that apart from the fact that it did not adduce any evidence in support\u000aof the general allegation that the right to a satisfactory environment has been violated by the Respondent\u000aState, the Complainant has not disputed or challenged the claims of the Respondent State. In the absence\u000aof any evidence to support the alleged violation, the African Commission finds no violation of Article 24 of\u000athe African Charter.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission\u000a137. In view of the above, the African Commission finds no violations of Articles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24\u000aof the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\u000aDone in Banjul, the Gambia during the 54th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\u000aand Peoples Rights, 22 October to 5 November 2013.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 Angola ratified the African Charter on 2 March 1990.\u000a2 The alleged violations include extrajudicial/summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, sexual\u000aviolence, denial of civilians' freedom of movement, torture and other mistreatment.\u000a3 By email to the Secretariat dated 17 Feb 2012, Dr Levy advised the Secretariat to consider submission\u000afrom Cabindan groups other himself as amicus briefs.\u000a4 Notes Verbale were sent to the Republic of Angola on 28 February 2007, 10 May 2007, 20 August 2007,\u000a19 December 2007, 25 March 2009, 27 April 2009, 23 June 2010, 30 September 2010, 7 December 2010\u000aand 11 August 2011.\u000a5 Communication 292/04 - Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa v.

Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\u000apeoples is at stake.123 Hence the need to protect the lands and resources they have traditionally used to\u000aprevent their extinction as a people. That is, the aim and purpose of the special measures required on\u000abehalf of the members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they may continue living\u000atheir traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure, economic system,\u000acustoms, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by States.\u000a.\u000a22 Ibid\u000a23 The Respondent State submits that the Province of Zaire also contributes significantly to the natural\u000aresources of Angola and accordingly, together with the Cabinda Province, enjoy certain privileges over and\u000aabove other provinces.\u000a24 COHRE case, para 223\u000a25 This is consistent with international best practices. See for instance, the Saramaka decision, para 103\u000a× Furthermore, the State's argument that it would be discriminatory to pass legislation that recognizes\u000acommunal forms of land ownership is also without merit. It is a wellestablished principle of international law\u000athat unequal treatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\u000adiscrimination. Legislation that recognizes said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory. In the\u000acontext of members of indigenous and tribal peoples, this Court has already stated that special measures\u000aare necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions and customs (supra paras.\u000a78-86, 91, and 96). Thus, the State's arguments regarding its inability to create legislation in this area due\u000ato the alleged complexity of the issue or the possible discriminatory nature of such legislation are without\u000amerit.\u000a26 Communication 308/05 - Majuru v Zimbabwe (2008) ACHPR, para 92\u000a27 Communication 75/92 - Katangese Peoples' Congress v Zaire (1995) ACHPR para 4\u000a28 Communication 155/96 - Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) & Center for Economic\u000aand Social Rights (CESR) v Nigeria (SERAC v Nigeria) (2001) para 56\u000a16\u000a\u000a29 SERAC v Nigeria, paras 57-58\u000a30 Endorois v Kenya, para 268\u000a31 Ibid\u000a32 155/96 para 54\u000a\u000a17\u000a\u000a

aV334/06 Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and\u000aInterights v. Egypt\u000aSummary of the Complaint\u000a1. This communication is brought before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the\u000aAfrican Commission or the Commission) on behalf of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdalla\u000aAbu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy (the Victims), by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal\u000aRights and Interights (the Complainants).\u000a2. The Respondent State is Egypt, a State Party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the\u000aAfrican Charter or the Charter).\u000a3. The Complainants state that the Victims were tried and sentenced to death after being accused of\u000abombings which took place on 6 October 2004 and 23 July 2005 on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.\u000a4. The Complainants submit that on the night of 7 October 2004, three bombings took place in the Taba\u000aHilton Hotel and in two tourist resorts (Al-Badia and Gozor Al-Qamer) near Nuweiba, on the Sinai Peninsula\u000a("the Taba bombings"). They further state that as a result of the attacks, 34 people died and at least 157\u000awere injured. The Complainants say that the Victims were Egyptian, Israeli and other foreign tourists and\u000aworkers.\u000a5. They allege that the security forces of the Respondent State responded with a campaign of mass arrests\u000aand detentions in Northern Sinai, from where the perpetrators of the attacks were believed to have\u000aoriginated. According to the Complainants, among those taken into custody was the First Victim, Mohamed\u000aGayez Sabbah.\u000a6. The Complainants also state that on 23 July 2005, a series of new bombings took place in the city of\u000aSharm El-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula, and that following those attacks, the security forces again\u000aarrested a large number of Egyptian citizens, including Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani al-Nakhlawy (the\u000aSecond Victim) and Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer (the third victim), on 12 August and 28 September 2005,\u000arespectively.\u000a7. According to the Complainants, agents of the State Security Intelligence (the SSI) subjected the victims\u000ato various forms of torture and ill-treatment during their detention, in order to "confess" before the State\u000aSecurity Prosecutor for their involvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants state that the victims\u000awere held incommunicado for a long period of time without access to a lawyer.\u000a8. The Complainants state that the victims were denied necessary medical attention as well forensic\u000amedical examination during interrogation sessions. They allege that the victims were charged with crimes in\u000arelation to the Taba bombings and were tried by the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in a trial\u000acharacterized by procedural and substantive anomalies. They further allege that the court's decision was\u000abased substantially on the 'confessions' obtained through torture and prolonged ill-treatment.\u000a9. They state that on 30 November 2006, the victims were sentenced to death by hanging. The\u000aComplainants state that the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, was arrested on 22 October 2004\u000apursuant to an Administrative Order issued under Law 162/1958 of the State of Emergency (the Emergency\u000aLaw).1 The Complainants allege that the first victim was held incommunicado detention by SSI agents until\u000aMarch 2005. They state that SSI agents blindfolded and bound the first victim, and occasionally hung him\u000afrom the ceiling by his arms and legs.\u000a10. The Complainants state that the First Victim was held in these conditions for 96 days, being untied only\u000aduring his interrogation by the State Security Prosecutor.\u000a11. They further allege that SSI agents applied electrical shocks to several parts of his body. They state\u000athat beatings and torture took place before and after his interrogation sessions by State Security\u000aProsecutors which started on 3 November 2004 and that most of the interrogation sessions took place\u000aaround midnight and lasted for several hours each.\u000a12. They allege that despite the fact that the First Victim was tortured before these sessions, the\u000ainterrogation sheet completed by the State Security Prosecutor in respect of the First Victim indicated that\u000athere were no visible injuries on his body.\u000a13. According to the Complainants, during the first interrogation session, the First Victim denied\u000ainvolvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants submit that it was during the second session, held\u000aon 4 November 2004 that the First Victim "confessed" to the State Security Prosecutor. The Complainants\u000a1\u000a\u000aalso aver that the First Victim was held incommunicado, without access to his family, legal counsel, medical\u000acare or a court until 24 March 2005. Requests for access to a defence lawyer by the first victim were\u000aignored.\u000a14. The Complainants allege that a plea submitted by a group of human rights lawyers to the Public\u000aProsecutor's Office, which exercises oversight over the State Security Prosecutor's Office, requesting\u000apermission to represent the victims together with others whose names had been printed in the local press\u000aas the chief suspects in the investigation of the Taba bombings, went unanswered.2\u000a15. Thus according to the Complainants, from the date of arrest on 22 October 2004 to 24 March 2005, the\u000aFirst Victim was denied access to counsel and that it was on 24 March 2005 that a lawyer attended the final\u000ainterrogation hearing during which the First Victim retracted his "confessions".\u000a16. The Complainants assert that the First Victim also requested medical attention and a forensic\u000aexamination in relation to his allegations of torture while in detention but the request for a forensic\u000aexamination was rejected by the Public Prosecutor's Office according to the viciously circular logic that only\u000aa legal representative (which he was also denied) could make such a claim.\u000a17. According to the Complainants, the charges against the victims and two other individuals in relation to\u000athe Taba bombings were referred to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in Ismailiya on 30 March\u000a2005, and listed as case No. 40/20053 . They state that the trial started on 2 July 2005 and it was at this\u000atime that the First Victim appeared before a judge for the first time since his arrest, eight months earlier.\u000aThe Complainants also assert that during the first hearing on 2 July 2005 the First Victim informed the court\u000athat he had been tortured by SSI officers before and after interrogation sessions, in an attempt to force him\u000ato confess.\u000a18. The Complainants further state that the First Victim told the prosecutor about his torture and requested\u000amedical attention, but the prosecutor denied his requests.\u000a19. The Complainants state that it was during this hearing that the First Victim and his defence counsel\u000arequested that he be examined by a forensic expert. According to the Complainants, the court itself\u000aexamined the First Victim in camera, in the presence of his defence counsel as well as a lawyer attending\u000athe hearing on behalf of Human Rights Watch. They state that he was stripped of his clothes for the court to\u000aexamine whether there were any physical signs of torture and that the court found "... brown spots on his\u000aarms."4 The Complainants further state that, as a result, the court granted the application for a medical\u000aexamination, and adjourned the trial to 24 July 2005.\u000a20. The Complainants aver that the Forensic Medical Authority (FMA) examination took place eight months\u000aafter the victim's alleged torture and that the report, dated 5 July 2005, noted injuries that were consistent\u000awith the First Victim having been subjected to torture, including "healings" and "dark discolorations" on his\u000aright and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint.5\u000a21. The Complainants also state that the two Government examiners concluded that "due to the long lapse\u000aof time and the fact that the marks were not examined at the time they occurred, it was not possible to\u000adetermine with certitude the reason, manner or time of such marks."6 According to the Complainants,\u000afurther charges were preferred against the First Victim during his trial on 25 March 2006, in relation to the\u000aTaba bombings.\u000a22. The Complainants submit that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, was\u000aarrested on 12 August 2005 and placed under administrative detention pursuant to a decree of the Minister\u000aof Interior issued under the Emergency Law.\u000a23. The Complainants further submit that the Second Victim was also tortured by SSI officers during the\u000ainitial period of his detention and interrogation, including the use of electric shocks, beatings and\u000asuspension from the roof in painful positions. They state that the Second Victim was only informed of the\u000acharges against him on 22 August 2005, when he first appeared before the State Security Prosecutor for\u000ainterrogation.\u000a24. The Complainants assert that during the interrogation session, the Second Victim agreed to sign a\u000awritten confession recounting his role in the Taba bombings. They state that during this session, the State\u000aSecurity Prosecutor indicated on the interrogation sheet that there were no visible injuries on the body of\u000athe Second Victim.\u000a25. According to the Complainants, the Second Victim was denied access to a lawyer during the\u000ainterrogation sessions, which spanned a period of seven months and that during the session held on 19\u000aMarch 2006, the second victim insisted on summoning lawyers to represent him and to that effect\u000asubmitted the names and mobile phone numbers of two human rights lawyers.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000a26. The Complainants further submit that on 25 March 2006, the State Security Prosecutor presented a\u000a"complementary indictment" in relation to the Taba bombings in which the First Victim had been charged\u000a(Case No. 40/2005).\u000a27. The Complainants state that the Second Victim also retracted his "confessions" before the court on 26\u000aMarch 2006 when he informed the court that he had been tortured during his detention. The Complainants\u000asay that the court granted the Second Victim's request for a medical examination which took place two\u000amonths later, nine months after the second victim's alleged torture. They state that the forensic medical\u000areport, dated 27 May 2006, noted "darker intersecting discolorations all over the back" as well as an\u000aunhealed fracture in one of the toes of his left foot. The Complainants submit that despite the findings, the\u000aReport concluded that, due to the time lapse, it was not possible to determine precisely the cause or date7\u000aof the discolorations.\u000a28. The Complainants state that the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, was detained on 28\u000aSeptember 2005 under an Administrative Detention Decree issued under the Emergency Law.\u000a29. According to the Complainants, the period of their arrest was between 12 August and 28 September\u000a2005. The Complainants submit that the Third Victim was first interrogated by the State Security Prosecutor\u000aon 20 November 2005, 50 days after his arrest, at which point he was informed of the charges against him.\u000a30. They state that on 25 March 2006 the Third Victim was referred to the Supreme State Security\u000aEmergency Court, as a result of the referral of the complementary indictment by the State Security\u000aProsecutor.\u000a31. They state that he had not been brought before a judge at any point during his six-month period of\u000apre-trial detention. According to the Complainants, he too was held in incommunicado detention without\u000aaccess to family members, lawyers or medical care.\u000a32. The Complainants state that all the victims informed the court during the trial that they were subjected\u000ato beatings, electric shocks and different forms of cruel and degrading treatment, and that their requests for\u000areferral to the Forensic Medical Authority were consistently denied by the Prosecution Office, but on a\u000areferral by the court the examination confirmed the presence of several injuries but was unable to decisively\u000aconclude the cause of injuries due to the long period of time that had elapsed.\u000a33. The Complainants allege that the repeated requests of the victims to obtain official copies of the\u000atranscript of the hearing of the trial were reportedly denied by the court.\u000a34. The Complainants aver that despite the obvious anomaly of the trial of the Victims and the objections\u000araised by the defence with respect to procedural impropriety, the court proceeded with the trial and\u000aadjourned on September 2006 to 30 November 2006 to seek the Mufti's (Religious Adviser's) view on the\u000aproceedings in order to deliver its judgement. They state that according to Article 381 of the Criminal\u000aProcedure Code, the court is only obliged to seek the Mufti's view when it intends to issue a death\u000asentence, indicating that the court had already reached verdict to sentence the Victims to death.\u000a35. According to the Complainants the victims were charged with; belonging to a group established in\u000aviolation of the provisions of the law and with the intention of flouting the provisions of the constitution and\u000athe relevant laws as well as violating personal freedoms and targeting foreign tourists and the police as well\u000aas tourist installations; premeditated murder, attempted premeditated murder, damaging property, illegal\u000amanufacture and possession of explosives and car robbery.\u000a\u000aArticles alleged to have been violated\u000a36. The Complainants submit that the rights of the victims under Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the\u000aAfrican Charter have been violated.\u000aPrayers\u000a37. The Complainants seek the following reliefs:\u000aa. Recognition by the African Commission that the rights in the above mentioned articles in the Charter\u000ahave been violated;\u000ab. An order for compensation in respect of the violations of the rights of the victims;\u000ac. Harmonisation of the Respondent State's legislations in line with the Guidelines and Principles of the\u000aRights to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance adopted by the African Commission;\u000ad. Ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are implemented to avoid the reoccurrence of similar human\u000arights violations.\u000a3\u000a\u000aProcedure\u000a38. The Complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples'\u000aRights (the Secretariat) during the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November\u000a2006, in Banjul, The Gambia. A provisional measure was requested to be taken under Rule 111 of the\u000aAfrican Commission's Rules of Procedure.\u000a39. The African Commission decided to be seized of the communication at its 40th Ordinary Session, held\u000afrom 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a40. The African Commission requested for provisional measures under Rule 111(1) of its Rules of\u000aProcedure, via a letter dated 5 December 2006 addressed to the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\u000a41. By letter dated 21 December 2006, the Complainants were informed that the African Commission had\u000adecided at its 40th Ordinary Session to be seized of the communication and that a request for Provisional\u000aMeasures had been sent to the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and requested the Complainants\u000ato send their submissions on admissibility to the Secretariat by 21 march 2007.\u000a42. By Note Verbale dated 21 December 2006, the African Commission informed the Respondent State its\u000adecision to be seized of the communication and brought to the attention of the Government to the request\u000afor provisional measures that was previously sent, and requested that the submissions on admissibility of\u000athe Respondent State be sent to the Secretariat by 21 March 2007.\u000a43. On 22 March 2007, the Secretariat received the submissions on admissibility of the Complainants.\u000a44. On 23 March 2007, the Secretariat received the submission on admissibility of the Respondent State in\u000aArabic language.\u000a45. By Note Verbale and letter dated 29 March 2007, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the\u000asubmissions on admissibility of both parties and forwarded the submission to the other party.\u000a46. By letter dated 19 April 2007, the Secretariat transmitted to the Complainants the translated version\u000a(from Arabic to English) of the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility.\u000a47. By letter dated 20 April 2007, the Complainants acknowledged receipt of the African Commission's\u000aletter dated 19 April 2007, but informed the Secretariat that it had not received the previous letter dated 29\u000aMarch 2007 by which the submissions on admissibility in original Arabic language were forwarded.\u000a48. On 20 April 2007, the Secretariat forwarded again the original Arabic version of the Respondent State's\u000asubmissions on admissibility to the Complainants.\u000a49. During its 41st Ordinary Session, held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, both parties made oral\u000asubmissions before the African Commission to clarify on their written submissions on the admissibility of\u000athe communication. The representative of the Respondent State also submitted in writing what was\u000apresented orally before the Commission on this occasion and this document was added to the file.\u000a50. At its 41st Ordinary Session, held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission declared\u000athe communication admissible.\u000a51. By Note Verbale dated 8 June 2007, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of its decision on\u000aadmissibility; the Complainants were also informed in a letter dated 6 June 2007. Both parties were invited\u000ato make their submission on the merits.\u000a52. On 7 June 2007, the Secretariat received from the Complainants a letter addressed to the Chairperson\u000arequesting for renewal of the Provisional Measures under Rule 111(1).\u000a53. By letter dated 7 June 2007 addressed to H.E. President Hosni Moubarak, a request for provisional\u000ameasures was made by the Commission.\u000a54. On 24th October 2007, the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt to Dakar, Senegal, sent a Note\u000aVerbal to inquire about the submission if any, made by Complainants.\u000a55. At the 42nd Ordinary Session held in Brazzaville, Congo from 15 to 28 November 2007, the\u000aCommission deferred the communication to the 43rd Ordinary session so as to allow the parties to make\u000atheir submissions on the merits. During that same Session, the Secretariat received a submission on the\u000aMerit from the Respondent State.\u000a56. By Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and letter dated 19 March 2008, the parties to the\u000acommunication were informed that the 43rd Ordinary Session is scheduled to be held from 7 to 22 May\u000a2008 in Ezulwini, Swaziland.\u000a57. On 23 April 2008, the Secretariat received an electronic version of the submission on the merits from\u000athe Complainants.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000a58. On 24 October 2008 the Secretariat transmitted to the Respondent State the submission on the merits\u000aof the Complainants.\u000a59. By letter dated 24 October 2008, the Complainants were informed that the 44th Ordinary Session will be\u000aheld in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria from 10 to 24 November 2008.\u000a60. During the 44th Ordinary Session the African Commission considered the communication on the merits\u000aand deferred it to the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled to be held from 13 to 27 May 2009 in Banjul, The\u000aGambia.\u000a61. By Note Verbale and letter dated 19 December 2008, the Secretariat informed the parties of the\u000adecision to defer the consideration on the Merit of the communication to the 45th Ordinary Session.\u000a62. By Note Verbale and a letter both dated 24 April 2009, the parties were reminded that the\u000acommunication will be considered on the Merit at the 45th Ordinary Session to be held in Banjul, The\u000aGambia from 13-27 May 2009.\u000a63. By Note Verbale and letter dated 16 July 2009, the African Commission informed the parties of its\u000adecision to defer the communication to the 46th Ordinary Session, scheduled to take place from 11 to 25\u000aNovember 2009.\u000a64. By Note Verbale and letter dated 20 December 2009, the African Commission informed parties of its\u000adecision to defer consideration of this communication to the 47 Ordinary Session of the African\u000aCommission scheduled to take place from 12 to 26 May 2010.\u000a65. By Note Verbale and letter dated 11 June, the African Commission informed parties of its decision to\u000adefer the communication to the 48th Ordinary Session scheduled to take place from 10 to 24 November\u000a2010.\u000a\u000aThe Law on Admissibility\u000aSubmissions of the Complainants on Admissibility\u000a\u000a66. The Complainants submit that all the criteria of Article 56 of the African Charter are satisfied and that\u000atherefore, the communication should be declared admissible.\u000a67. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants state that under the Emergency Law\u000a(Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to commute the sentence, revoke the\u000ajudgement, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security Emergency Court. They submit that in\u000athe present case, the sentence imposed by the State Emergency Court on 30 November 2006 on the\u000avictims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Republic and that there is no judicial\u000aright to appeal the decision of the State Security Emergency Court.\u000a68. According to the Complainants, the President's decision under the Emergency Law is not judicial in\u000anature and therefore it cannot be defined as an available remedy for the Complainants to pursue. They\u000acompare the facts of the present communication to those of Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria in which\u000athe Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a special\u000atribunal in Nigeria as a "discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature" and where it was\u000afound that the Governor's decision was not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article\u000a56(5) of the African Charter. The Complainants also refer to Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria wherein\u000ait was found that in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate on the Applicant's complaint, there was no\u000aeffective remedy available.\u000a69. The Complainants further argue that the President's decision under the Emergency Law cannot be\u000amade subject to any appeal. Therefore, they submit that the victims are left without any judicial right to\u000aappeal the decision of the State of Emergency Court.\u000aThe Respondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\u000a\u000a70. The Respondent State submits that the communication is inadmissible for two reasons: firstly, it was\u000alodged before exhausting local means of redress as the sentence was not final; and secondly, the content\u000aof the communication is inaccurate.\u000a71. In terms of the second grounds the Respondent State submits that certain facts of the communication\u000aare false. It argues that the victims were given due process before and during the trial and that they had\u000aaccess to lawyers during interrogations.\u000a5\u000a\u000a72. The Respondent State submits that the victims had access to a forensic doctor and were examined.\u000aThey further State that copies of court proceedings were made available to the victims and their lawyers\u000aand they were properly remanded by a court prior to the commencement of interrogations commenced.\u000a73. The Respondent State asserts that trial of the victims was fair and was conducted in public.\u000a74. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State submits in its written statement that\u000athe judgment pronounced on 30 November 2006 by an Emergency Court is not final as it has not yet been\u000aendorsed.\u000a75. The Respondent State further explains that the Act No. 162 of 1958 stipulates that judgments by the\u000aState of Emergency Security Courts are only made final after being endorsed by the President of the\u000aRepublic (Article 42), and that the ratifying authorities may, in examining the judgment, mitigate the\u000asentence, replace it by a more lenient punishment, rescind it or rescind part thereof or stop its\u000aimplementation or a part thereof (Article 14).\u000a76. In addition, the Respondent State points out that for endorsement, the law stipulates that all cases on\u000awhich a ruling has been made must be examined by legal advisers assigned for this purpose to ascertain\u000athat the proper procedure was followed.\u000a77. The Respondent State also submits that the law allows the person convicted to submit a written appeal\u000ato the Office of the Public Prosecutor.\u000a78. The Respondent State confirmed that the request for Provisional Measures sent by the Chairperson in\u000aDecember 2006 to suspend the execution of the death penalty sentence while the communication was\u000abefore the Commission had been received, and further explained that the request was transmitted to the\u000aPresident of Egypt who considered it.\u000aThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\u000a79. The second ground submitted by the Respondent State pertains to the merits of the case and is not\u000arelevant at the stage of admissibility.\u000a80. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of\u000aArticle 56 of the African Charter which provides for seven requirements to be met before a communication\u000acan be declared Admissible. If any of the requirements set out in this article are not met, the African\u000aCommission declares the communication Inadmissible, unless the Complainant provides sufficient\u000ajustifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\u000a81. In the present communication, the Complainants claim that this communication fulfils all the\u000arequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that the\u000aComplainants have not fulfilled the requirements under Article 56(5) and as such, the African Commission\u000ashould declare the communication inadmissible. The Commission would thus analyze the arguments of\u000aboth parties based on the provisions of Article 56 of the Charter.\u000a82. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that "Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...\u000areceived by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request\u000aanonymity..." This communication is brought before the African Commission by the Egyptian Initiative for\u000aPersonal Rights and Interights, the Complainants, on behalf of the victims. In this communication, the\u000aauthors as well as the victims have been identified. The African Commission is therefore of the view that\u000asub-article (1) of Article 56 has been complied with.\u000a83. Article 56(2) of the African Charter states that "Communications...received by the Commission shall be\u000aconsidered if they are compatible with the Charter of the Organization of African Unity or with the present\u000aCharter." The present communication sets out that Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a), and 26 of the African Charter have\u000abeen violated. The communication is brought against the Arab Republic of Egypt a State Party to the\u000aAfrican Charter, and alleges violation of the rights of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdallah\u000aAbu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy who are in custody awaiting to be executed by the\u000aRespondent State. The African Commission therefore holds that the requirements under Article 56(2) have\u000abeen fulfilled.\u000a84. Article 56(3) of the African Charter states that "Communications ...received by the Commission shall be\u000aconsidered if they are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned\u000aand its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity (AU)". The present communication is not written in\u000aa disparaging or insulting language directed to the Respondent State, its institutions or the AU and for\u000athese reasons the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(3) have been complied\u000a6\u000a\u000awith.\u000a85. Article 56(4) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'\u000aRights... shall be considered if they are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass\u000amedia". There is no evidence in this communication indicating that the allegations contained therein are\u000abased exclusively on news or news disseminated through the mass media. The Complainants submit that\u000athe communication is based on eyewitness evidence, as well as documented reports, which they have\u000asubmitted along with the communication as attachments. The Respondent State have not challenged this\u000aassertion. For these reasons, the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(4) have\u000abeen fulfilled.\u000a86. Article 56(5) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'\u000aRights... shall be considered if they are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that\u000athis procedure is unduly prolonged".\u000a87. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to\u000aensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the Respondent State concerned\u000amust have had the opportunity to remedy the matters through its own local system. This prevents the\u000aCommission from acting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort. Three major criteria\u000acould be deduced from the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must\u000abe available, effective and sufficient.8\u000a88. The only issue at stake at this stage of admissibility in the present case is the one of the exhaustion of\u000alocal remedies.\u000a89. It appears from the oral submissions of the Respondent State that there is no local remedy left for the\u000acomplainants to exhaust. They argued that the decision of the State of Emergency Court has been\u000aexamined and confirmed by a legal adviser and the final procedure of endorsement (ratification by the\u000aPresident) of the decision of the State of Emergency Court what is a waiting. The outcome of these two\u000aprocedures did not change the decision of the State of Emergency Court.\u000a90. The fact that the endorsement of the Emergency Special Court in Egypt is of legal nature or not is not\u000arelevant for the examination of the communication by the Commission at this stage, because what is at\u000astake is whether there are other remedies available that the applicants did not resort to. The clarifications\u000abrought before the Commission by the representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st Ordinary\u000aSession led to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available for the Complainant to\u000aresort to. The endorsement process was completed and it was submitted by both parties that the\u000aComplainants had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance to the\u000a"judgment ratification office" and that this remedy was unsuccessful.\u000a91. Most of the submissions made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary\u000aSession of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and would be examined at the\u000amerits' stage. The respect of the rights of the Complainants is indeed a matter relevant at the merits stage\u000aand irrelevant at the admissibility stage.\u000a92. The African Commission in several communications held that the condition of exhaustion of local\u000aremedies "should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access international remedies. Therefore,\u000aArticle 56(5) should be applied concomitantly with Article 7, which establishes and protect the right to fair\u000atrial"9 . To this extent the African Commission, in determining whether local remedies have been exhausted\u000atakes into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which the formal\u000aremedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant."10\u000a93. In Communication No 250/2002 Zegveld v Eritrea11 , the African Commission confirmed that a\u000adomestic remedy is considered effective if it offers a prospect of success, and sufficient or adequate if it is\u000acapable of redressing the complaint.12 In Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara v The Gambia, the African\u000aCommission decided that the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also\u000ain practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. In the instant case and\u000aconsistent with the jurisprudence of the Commission, there are no remedies remaining for the\u000aComplainants to pursue as they have no judicial right to appeal the decision of the State Security\u000aEmergency Court. What remains was for the President of the Republic to ratify the judgment to give force\u000ato it.\u000a94. Therefore, if the victim cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of lack of an effective legal\u000aremedy to address his fear and concerns, local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.\u000a95. In the present case, the sentence imposed by the State Security Emergency Court on 30 November\u000a2006 on the Victims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Respondent State.\u000a7\u000a\u000aUnder Article 14 of the Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to\u000acommute the sentence, revoke the judgment, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security\u000aEmergency Court. The President's decision is discretionary and cannot be made subject to any appeal.\u000a96. The African Commission decided in Communication No. 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria13\u000athat purely discretionary remedies of non judicial nature where "the object of the remedy is to obtain a\u000afavour and not to vindicate a right" are not of the kind contemplated by Article 56(5). In this decision, the\u000aAfrican Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a Special\u000aTribunal in Nigeria as a "discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature."14 The African\u000aCommission stated that the remedy was neither adequate nor effective because the Governor was under\u000a"no obligation to decide according to legal principles"15 and concluded that the Governor's decision was\u000atherefore not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article 56(5) of the Charter.16 In\u000aCommunication No 87/93 Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria [sic] , the African Commission also found\u000athat in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate the applicant's complaints, there was no effective\u000aremedy to which the applicant could have recourse.17\u000a97. In the Instant matter, the clarifications by the Representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st\u000aOrdinary Session led the Commission to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available\u000afor the victims to resort to. The ratification process was completed and it has been submitted by both\u000aparties that the victims had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance\u000ato the "judgment ratification office" and that this remedy has proved unsuccessful.\u000a98. The African Commission therefore concludes that since the decision of the court is not appealable by\u000aany other judicial authority, the Complainants have exhausted the requirements of Article 56(5) of the\u000aCharter.\u000a99. Article 56(6) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'\u000aRights... shall be considered if they: are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies\u000aare exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized with the matter". The Complainant states that the\u000acase has been decided by the State Security Emergency Court whose decision was awaiting the ratification\u000aby the President of the Republic. The Secretariat of the African Commission received this communication\u000aduring the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul The Gambia\u000aand acknowledged receipt by a letter dated 12 February 2007. The Charter does not provide for what\u000aconstitutes a reasonable time, for a Complainant to bring his/her Complaint before the Commission. The\u000aCommission has however dealt with this issue, on a case by case basis. The communication got to the\u000aCommission ten months after the decision of the State Security Emergency Court. The African Commission\u000aconsiders this to be a reasonable time, taking into consideration the complexities of getting a representation\u000abefore an international body, and the challenges of communications system in Africa. The African\u000aCommission therefore holds that this provision has also been complied with.\u000a100. Article 56(7) of the African Charter states that "Communications relating to human and Peoples'\u000aRights... shall be considered if they: do not deal with cases which have been settled by these states\u000ainvolved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the\u000aOrganisation of African Unity or the provisions of the present Charter." The Complainants state that this\u000acommunication has not been settled by any international body and as such this requirement has been met.\u000aThe Respondent State did not object to Complainants assertion and there is no evidence before the\u000aCommission to show that the communication is being or has been settled by another international body.\u000aThe Commission therefore holds that the requirement set out in Article 56(7) has been fulfilled.\u000a101. Therefore, since all, under Article 56 have been met, the African Commission declares the\u000acommunication Admissible and maintains the request for Provisional Measures communicated to the\u000aRespondent State on 5th December 2006, in order to prevent irreparable damages.\u000a102. Other submissions which are made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary\u000aSession of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and will be examined at the\u000amerits stage.\u000aThe Merits\u000aThe Complainants' Submissions on the Merits\u000a\u000a103. The Complainants submit that the manner in which the Respondent State conducted the arrest,\u000adetention, interrogation, trial and sentencing of the victims violates Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the\u000a8\u000a\u000aAfrican Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment)\u000a\u000a104. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, after his arrest on\u000a22 October 2004 was held incommunicado by SSI (State Security Intelligence) agents until March 2005.\u000aSSI agents blindfolded and bound him, and occasionally hung him from the ceiling by his arms and legs.\u000aAccording to the Complainants he was held in this condition for 96 days, being untied only during his\u000ainterrogation by the State Security Prosecutor. They also allege that the SSI agents applied electric shocks\u000ato several parts of his body. They further allege that this beatings and torture took place before and after his\u000ainterrogation sessions by state security prosecutors which started on 3 November 2004.\u000a105. The Complainants also submit that the First Victim initially denied involvement in the bombings but\u000adue to the beatings and torture was compelled to change his plea and confessed on 4 November 2004.\u000aThey also submit that the First Victim was not allowed access to his family, lawyers, medical care until 24\u000aMarch 2005.\u000a106. The Complainants aver that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, who\u000awas arrested on 12 August 2005, was tortured by SSI officers during the initial period of his detention and\u000aquestioning, includes the use of electric shocks, beatings and suspension from the roof in painful positions.\u000aThey further submit that, during the interrogation session which spanned over seven months, the Second\u000aVictim was denied access to his legal counsel.\u000a107. They submit on behalf of the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, that between 28 September\u000a2005 and 20 November 2005, he was questioned by SSI officers in at least twenty-five sessions and that\u000ahe was subjected to electric shocks and suspended by the hands and legs in painful positions.\u000a108. In arguing this case, the Complainants further refer to the African Commission's jurisprudence18 where\u000ait held that the prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment includes 'actions which cause\u000aserious physical or psychological suffering (or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his\u000aor her will or conscience'.\u000a109. The African Commission was also referred to the absolute prohibition of torture and ill treatment as\u000acontained in the Robben Island Guidelines19 and Hurilaws v Nigeria20 . They further contend that the\u000aabsolute character of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is recognized in other regional and\u000ainternational instruments including the RIG and CAT.21 The Complainants submit that even those\u000ainstruments which, in contrast to the African Charter, allow for some derogation during times of national\u000aemergency explicitly exclude from the scope of permissible derogation, inter alia, the provisions prohibiting\u000atorture and ill-treatment.22 The Complainants argue that even the undoubted threat posed by terrorism, do\u000anot affect in any way the absolute prohibition on torture.23\u000a110. The Complainants further argue that, because of the importance of the values it protects, and as\u000ainternational courts and bodies have recognized, the prohibition of torture has now evolved into a\u000aperemptory norm or jus cogens, reflecting that the prohibition has become one of the most fundamental\u000astandards in the international community.24\u000a111. The Complainants submit that, not only is the Respondent State required to refrain from torture and\u000aill-treatment, but also that, it must take positive measures to effectively prevent and protect against it. They\u000aargue that, certain safeguards - such as access to counsel, courts and medical personnel, and the\u000ainadmissibility of evidence obtained through torture - are inherent aspects of the prohibition of torture and\u000aill-treatment. They further submit that where torture or ill-treatment does arise, the Respondent State is\u000aobliged to respond with effective investigation and remedial action. The importance of such measures they\u000aargue, lies firstly, in acting as a deterrent to the commission of torture and ill-treatment and, secondly, in\u000aensuring that where torture and other ill-treatment occurs, it is investigated and documented. The\u000aComplainants refer the African Commission to General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture,\u000awhich recognized judicial remedies and access to counsel and to medical assistance during detention as\u000a"baseline" guarantees which the state is obliged to respect in order to give effect to the obligation to prevent\u000aand protect against torture or ill-treatment.25\u000a112. The Complainants argue that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or\u000aill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 of the Charter "to adopt\u000alegislative or other measures to give effect" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such\u000asafeguards, the Complainants argue, has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben\u000aIsland Guidelines.26 The Complainants aver that, the Commission itself has noted that while "punishment of\u000a9\u000a\u000athe torturer is important, [...] preventive measures such as halting of incommunicado detention, effective\u000aremedies under a transparent, independent and efficient legal system, and ongoing investigations into\u000aallegations of torture"27 are the best ways to deal with such atrocities.\u000a113. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the victims were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by state\u000aagents - members of the security forces - while they were in state custody. They argue that, the victims\u000awere subjected to repeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding aimed at\u000atheir complete disorientation. They further state that, this treatment, which was inflicted by state officials on\u000athe victims, which intended to elicit confessions and information, clearly meets the torture threshold.\u000a114. The Complainants also argue that, although the context of the victims incommunicado detention and\u000ainterrogation is such that available evidence is necessarily limited, the allegations of torture and\u000aill-treatment are supported by the victims' independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. According to the\u000aComplainants, the fact that the victims were held incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the\u000a6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that access to medical professionals was persistently denied until\u000aduring trial itself is indicative of ill-treatment. They submit that, the irregular nature of the "interrogation"\u000asessions which is also consistent with the decision to interrogate late at night is a form of ill-treatment.\u000a115. The Complainants submit that the Forensic Medical Report, following the examination of the first\u000avictim on 5 July 2005, nearly nine months after his injuries were sustained, noted "healings" and "dark\u000adiscolorations" on his right and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The\u000asecond report of the FMA of 27 May 2006, following examination of the second and third victims also nearly\u000anine months after their torture, found that the Second victim had a "darker intersecting discolorations" all\u000aover his back, as well as an unhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the third victim had dark\u000adiscolorations in the chest, abdomen and upper arms. The Complainants concede that, in both cases the\u000agovernment examiners concluded that the long time lapse between being examined and the injuries made\u000ait impossible to determine with certainty the reason, manner or time of such injuries."\u000a116. The Complainants aver that their allegations are consistent with reports of the systemic nature of\u000atorture by security forces in Egypt in cases such as the present one. By referring the African Commission to\u000athe 1996 findings into the use of torture in Egypt, in which it concluded that "torture is systematically\u000apracticed by the security forces in Egypt, in particular by State Security Intelligence",28 the Complainants\u000aargue that human rights mechanisms consistently point to widespread and systematic torture in places of\u000adetention in Egypt. The Complainants also refer the African Commission to the decision of the Committee\u000aAgainst Torture which found that "Egypt resorted to consistent and widespread use of torture against\u000adetainees" and that "[r]isk of such treatment was particularly high in the case of detainees held for political\u000aand security reasons."29\u000a117. The Complainants aver that under international human rights law, when a person is injured in\u000adetention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was\u000asubjected to torture or ill-treatment. They argue that, it is incumbent on the state to provide a plausible\u000aexplanation of how the injuries were caused.30\u000a118. The Complainants also argue that, the Respondent State has failed to discharge this burden in that,\u000athey made no attempt to give satisfactory explanation of how the injuries were sustained, or to take any\u000asteps to investigate and address the surrounding circumstances. The Complainants contend further that,\u000athe trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the victims' testimonies.\u000aThey also argue that the SSI officers who were called to testify against the defendants in court were not\u000aasked to confront a single question with regard to the alleged torture and ill-treatment. They submit that the\u000ajudgment fails to mention, still less to address, the allegations of ill-treatment; and that the authorities have\u000acontinuously failed to take any steps to investigate the allegations of ill-treatment or the questions raised by\u000athe FMA reports.\u000a119. The Complainants also contend that the carrying out of a death sentence using a particular method of\u000aexecution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the suffering caused in\u000aexecution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that strictly necessary. They further argue that\u000awhere a death sentence has been imposed "it must be carried out in such a way as to cause the least\u000apossible physical and mental suffering."31 This approach they submit was tested and applied in the case of\u000aNg v. Canada where it was found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation fell foul [sic] of it.32\u000a120. The Complainants submit that in the present case, the victims have been sentenced to death by\u000ahanging. Hanging, they contend, is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without\u000aappropriate attention to the weight of the person condemned, hanging can result either in slow and painful\u000astrangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the\u000a10\u000a\u000aseparation of the head from the body. The risk of either possibility is not compatible with respect for the\u000ainherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary suffering.\u000aAlleged Violation of Articles 7(1) and 26 (Right to Fair Trial and Independent Judiciary)\u000a\u000a121. The Complainants argue that the victims right to a fair trial was violated in that; (a) they were tried by a\u000acourt that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions is not subject to appeal; (b) their right to\u000aa counsel was not fully respected; (c) confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the\u000acourt, and\u000a122. The Complainants also submit that by virtue of Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter, the victims have\u000a"the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal". They also state that, the\u000avictims were tried by an exceptional security court, which failed to meet the minimum guarantees of an\u000aindependent and impartial tribunal.\u000a123. The Complainants state that the requirement of impartiality in Article 7 of the Charter is complemented\u000aby Article 26 of the same which imposes on States Parties 'the duty to guarantee the independence of the\u000acourts' in their respective territories. These obligations, they submit, are captured in the Commission's\u000aPrinciples and Guidelines on Fair Trial wherein the Commission inter alia stated that: 'judicial bodies shall\u000abe established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their competence on the\u000abasis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed manner;33 there\u000ashould not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall decisions be\u000asubject to revision except through judicial review;34 all judicial bodies shall be independent from the\u000aExecutive branch35 and the government shall respect that independence;36 the process of appointments to\u000ajudicial bodies shall be transparent;37 the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any\u000arestrictions, improper influence, inducements, pressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any\u000aquarter or for any reason.38\u000a124. The Complainants aver that, not applying these fair trial principles stated above, to special tribunals,\u000aviolates Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive\u000abranch. They also contend that the removal of cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and placing\u000athem before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality39 and that\u000a"[the] very existence [of such special tribunals] constitutes a violation of the principles of impartiality and\u000aindependence of the judiciary."40\u000a125. The Complainants state that the above averments are founded on the jurisprudence of the African\u000aCommission and are equally reflected in broader international and comparative law approaches to the right\u000ato be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. To support this position the Complainants refer the\u000aAfrican Commission to the jurisprudence and case law of other regional and international and human rights\u000amechanisms. They argue that an interpretation of such a right under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR has been\u000adeemed to be "an absolute right that may suffer no exception,"41 and that where the executive is able to\u000a'control or direct' the judiciary, the notion of an independent and impartial tribunal is violated.42 This\u000ajurisprudence they submit has been followed by regional human rights treaty bodies such as the\u000aInter-American and European Courts of Human Rights, which have similarly held that special courts with\u000aclose ties to the executive branch violate provisions requiring an independent and impartial tribunal.43\u000a126. The Complainants state that the competence and procedures of the Supreme State Security\u000aEmergency Court, an Exceptional Court, which tried the victims fall far short of the above standards. They\u000aalso argue that the Supreme State Security Emergency Court was established by the Emergency Law as a\u000atemporary court,44 although, like the Emergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The\u000aEmergency Law gives the court the primary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of\u000adecrees issued by the President of the Republic in application of the Emergency Law,45 but the President\u000aof the Republic may also, at his/her discretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security\u000aEmergency Court.46 According to Presidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to\u000aEmergency State Security Courts, all felonies and misdemeanors against the government's security or\u000arelated to explosives shall be referred to State Security Emergency Courts, established under the\u000aEmergency Law.\u000a127. It is further contended by the Complainant that the composition of the Supreme State Security\u000aEmergency Court, and the procedure for appointments to it, illustrate the lack of independence. They state\u000athat while normally composed of three judges of the Court of Appeal,47 the President of the Republic may\u000aorder that the Security Court be formed of three judges of the Court of Appeal and two officers of the\u000a11\u000a\u000aarmy,48 or simply decide that it be formed of three military officers.49 Before appointing the judges and/or\u000amilitary officers, the law provides that the President of the Republic shall seek the opinion of the respective\u000aMinister of Justice and the Minister of War.50\u000a128. The Complainants also argue that, the degree of control which the President of the Republic exercises\u000aover the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court is antithetical to\u000athe notion of an independent and impartial judicial process because, the President, for example exercises\u000athe following powers:\u000a? the President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or\u000aorder the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State\u000aSecurity Emergency Court;51\u000a?? decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the\u000aPresident of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt;52\u000a? the President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also\u000aorder the release of defendants53 ; and or\u000a? order the retrial of the case before another court.54\u000a129. The Complainants further aver that, this lack of independence and impartiality of the Supreme State\u000aSecurity Emergency Court has been identified and criticized by the Human Rights Committee when it\u000aexpressed its 'alarm' at the fact that "that Military Courts and State Security Courts have jurisdiction to try\u000acivilians accused of terrorism although there are no guarantees of those Courts' independence and their\u000adecisions are not subject to appeal before a higher Court."55\u000a130. With regards to the right to a counsel, as enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter, 56 the\u000aComplainants contend that this right which underpins several others, such as freedom from ill-treatment\u000aand the right to prepare a defense,57 should be observed during all stages of criminal prosecution\u000a"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial\u000aand appeal proceedings."58 They submit that in proceedings relating to criminal charges, legal\u000arepresentation is the "best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights and fundamental\u000afreedoms".59 They also argue that in cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused\u000amust be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings".60\u000a131. They refer the African Commission to its decision in the matter of Malawi African Association and\u000aOthers v. Mauritania,61 the Complainants submit that the right to counsel in Article 7 refers to the right to\u000acounsel of the detainee or defendant's choice and argues that where the accused either had no access, or\u000aonly restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, there is a violation of Article 7(1) (c). They contend that this\u000aright guarantees the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.62\u000a132. The Complainants further argue that although the European system has recognized that in certain\u000aexceptional circumstances it may be necessary to limit the right to counsel, such restrictions can only be\u000aallowed if they are no more than strictly necessary and do not hinder the fairness of the proceedings.63 The\u000aComplainants refer the African Commission to the case of Ocalan v. Turkey, where the court held inter alia\u000athat the denial of access to a lawyer for ten days during interrogations, "a situation where the rights of the\u000adefence might well be irretrievably prejudiced", interfered with the fairness of the proceedings and violated\u000athe defendant's human rights.64\u000a133. In the instant matter, the Complainants state that none of the Victims had lawyers present at the\u000acritical early interrogation stage. They argue that on 23 November 2004 a group of human rights lawyers\u000asubmitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered under number 16332) to legally\u000arepresent a number of individuals, including the First Victim but received no response. They submit that the\u000aFirst Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months until 24 March 2005 and\u000athe Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when they first appeared in\u000acourt.\u000a134. The Complainants submit that, even at the beginning of the trial, all three victims were denied the\u000aopportunity to consult with counsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. They also submit that, the\u000alawyer client communication took place through bars of the court room, in the presence of, and within\u000aearshot security officials. It is submitted that the complete denial of access to counsel before their\u000aappearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter, violated the right to counsel and the right to a\u000a12\u000a\u000adefence under Article 7(1) (c).65\u000a135. With regards to the issue of the State Security Emergency Court's reliance on the "confessions" of the\u000athree Victims, the Complainants submit that "any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of\u000acoercion or force may not be admitted as evidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in\u000asentencing."66 They argue that "any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado detention\u000ashall be considered to have been obtained by coercion."67 They further argue that any evidence and/or\u000aconfessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment cannot be used in judicial\u000aproceedings except for the purpose of prosecuting the act of torture or ill-treatment itself.68\u000a136. Relying on decisions from European Court of Human Rights69 , the Complainants aver that the use of\u000aevidence obtained under torture or ill-treatment in criminal proceedings raises serious issues as to the\u000afairness of such proceedings. They contend that any incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a\u000aconfession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment\u000awhich can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt, irrespective of\u000aits probative value."70 They further submit that the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 also stipulates that "if a\u000aconfession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall be\u000aconsidered invalid and futile".71\u000a137. The Complainants submit that although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of\u000acases that, "it is for the author to demonstrate that the allegations are well founded", 72 the duty is generally\u000aon the state to prove that the confessions were freely obtained.73 In support of this view the Complainants\u000arefer the Commission to observations of the Human Rights Committee that "all allegations that statements\u000aof detainees have been obtained through coercion must lead to an investigation and such statements must\u000anever be used as evidence, except as evidence of torture, and the burden of proof, in such cases, should\u000anot be borne by the alleged victim."74 The African Commission was also referred to in the UN Report of the\u000aSpecial Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, who had\u000anoted that "[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well\u000afounded. This means that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence\u000ain any proceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the\u000aState, [sic]75\u000a138. The Complainants assert that the victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment\u000aand that these allegations are at least consistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the\u000aincommunicado nature of their detention and the reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of\u000aill-treatment. The Complainants also state that despite these concerns, and the apparent inconsistency and\u000aunreliability of the evidence, the "confessions" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at\u000aleast part of the basis of their convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such\u000aevidence, they argue, violates Article 7 of the Charter.\u000a139. With regards to the right to appeal, the Complainants aver that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency\u000aLaw stipulates that "It is not allowed in any form to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security\u000aCourts." They argue that these laws, and its application in practice, violate Article 7(1) (a) of the Charter,\u000awhich provides for 'the right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his\u000afundamental rights as recognized and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force.'\u000a140. The Complainants also submit that States Parties should guarantee the right to appeal as well as\u000aprovide for a genuine and timely review of the cases, including the facts and the law",76 and that in extreme\u000acases where life is at risk States Parties should take steps to make appeals mandatory especially in death\u000apenalty cases.77 The Complainants refer the Commission to its decisions in Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman\u000av Sudan78 to highlight the importance of appeal rights in the Commission's jurisprudence, and to Civil\u000aLiberties Organization and Others v. Nigeria79 concerning the right to appeal in death penalty cases.\u000a141. As a result of the above, the Complainants submit that the court before which the victims were tried\u000afailed to meet the criteria which the Commission has identified as essential for an independent and\u000aimpartial tribunal and urged the Commission to hold that the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Articles 7\u000aand 26 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\u000a\u000a142. In support of the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that\u000aalthough the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader\u000ainternational human rights law, certain circumstances, which are present in this case, will render it a breach\u000a13\u000a\u000aof the right to life. For the purposes of this instant case the Complainant argued that these special\u000acircumstances would include situations where the sentence was passed without meeting the requirements\u000aof a fair trial set out in Article 7 of the African Charter; and where the death penalty is mandatory or\u000aautomatic, imposed by law rather than being applied by a court of law in light of all relevant circumstances.\u000a143. They submit that in criminal proceedings which may lead to the imposition of the death penalty,\u000arespect for due process is required to ensure that the right to life guaranteed under Article 4 of the Charter\u000ais not violated. By referring the African Commission to its decisions in International Pen and Others (on\u000abehalf of Saro-Wiwa) v Nigeria80 and in Malawi African Association and Others v Mauritania, they argue\u000athat, where the death penalty is unlawfully imposed, Article 4 is violated because the victims' rights under\u000aArticle 7 of the Charter had been denied.\u000a144. The Complainants submit that 'a higher threshold of rights is intended for those who are charged with\u000acrimes the sentence of which might be the death penalty'81 , which explains the need for "scrupulous\u000arespect of the guarantees of fair trial" in capital offence cases.82 It is submitted that the Respondent State in\u000aa statement to the UN General Assembly in 2007 recognized the critical nature of respect for due process\u000arights in capital offence cases.83\u000a145. It is contended by the Complainants that the imposition of the death sentence by the Supreme State\u000aSecurity Emergency Court in the particular circumstances of this case would amount to an arbitrary\u000adeprivation of life.\u000aThe Respondent State's Submissions on the Merits\u000a\u000a146. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 5, the Respondent State submits that Article 42\u000a× Article 42 Any person arrested, detained or his freedom restricted shall be treated in the manner\u000aconcomitant with the preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him. He\u000amay not be detained or imprisoned except in places defined by laws organising prisons. If a confession is\u000aproved to have been made by a person under any of the aforementioned forms of duress or coercion, it\u000ashall be considered invalid and futile.\u000aof the Constitution of Egypt provides for and guarantees the right to security of the person and that if a\u000aconfession is proved to have been made by a person under duress or coercion, it shall be considered\u000ainvalid and futile. It is further submitted by the Respondent State that Article 57\u000a× of the same Constitution provides that "any assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of the\u000aprivate life of citizens and any other public rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and Article 57\u000aAny assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of private life of citizens and any other public rights\u000aand liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and the law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and\u000acivil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State shall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an\u000aassault.\u000athe law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State\u000ashall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an assault."\u000a147. Concerning the allegation that the victims were denied visits while in detention, the Respondent State\u000asubmit that the relatives of Ossama Mohamed al- Nakhlawy visited him 17 times, the relatives of Mohamed\u000aGayez Sabah visited him 30 times and the relatives of Yunis Mohamed Abu Gareer visited him 16 times\u000auntil April 2007. These, argues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants are\u000abaseless.\u000a148. The Respondent State avers that its penal code criminalizes acts of torture in Articles 126 and 282,\u000aand that the same code further criminalizes unjustified detention imposes penalties exceeding those\u000adecided by Articles 127 and 280.\u000a149. The Respondent State contends that, the assessment, value and reliance on any confession as a\u000apiece of evidence in any criminal proceedings is an issue entirely at the discretion of the Court. It is argued\u000athat it is the judge who in exercise of this discretion decides whether or not to accept and rely on the\u000aconfession as reliable evidence for conviction.\u000a150. It is contended by the Respondent State that the judge's competence to assess the value of a\u000aconfession entails as well his competence to interpret it, define its significance and explore its motives. This\u000aprinciple, argues the Respondent State, applies whether the confession was judicial or non judicial, whether\u000ait took place in the process of factual investigation, interrogation or even before a normal person. The\u000ajudge, argues the Respondent State, does not rely on a confession if he is not convinced with it even in the\u000a14\u000a\u000acase where the accused person insists on his confession. In such a case, the judge may issue an acquittal\u000aand clarify in the causation why he did not take the confession into consideration. If it is proved that the\u000aconfession was made under duress or coercion, it would be considered as invalid. But this does not prevent\u000athe court from taking other evidences to prove the accusation.\u000a151. It is argued by the Respondent State that the court judgment against the victims took into\u000aconsideration all the circumstances related to the facts according to the satisfaction of the court based upon\u000athe processes in the case, the investigations, the court sessions and the related hearings of witnesses and\u000athe written and verbal pleadings of the defence in order to clarify the facts, the elements of the crime and\u000athe provisions of the law applicable thereon. The Respondent State argues that the court considered,\u000ascrutinized and analyzed all the evidences of the subject matter of the complaint including the related\u000amedical and technical reports and the public prosecution investigations to reach the facts upon which its\u000ajudgment was established.\u000a152. It is further contended by the Respondent State that the court responded to all the pleas of the\u000adefence during the trial including the plea of the invalidity of the confessions, and that the court was\u000asatisfied that the confessions of the victims and the other accused persons during the investigation were\u000amade by persons who have the will and the discernment and are fully aware of the charges against them.\u000a153. The Respondent State submits that when the accused persons first appeared before the public\u000aprosecutor they were free from any injuries. They further submit that the court was certain that the victims\u000awere fully aware that the investigations were made by the Public Prosecution Office (PPO) and that the\u000aPPO had informed them of the charges against them. The Respondent State also stated that 'the Office of\u000athe Public Prosecutor in carrying out its investigations, interrogated the accused, Mohamed Gaiz Sabah in\u000afour sessions, Osama Abdel Ghani El-Nakhlawi in eight sessions and Mohamed Alyan Abu Garir in twenty\u000afive sessions. During these sessions, all the accused pleaded guilty of having committed the crimes\u000aattributed to them'.\u000a154. The Respondent State contends that as a result of the findings of the PPO, the victims were referred\u000ato Court in suit number No. 40/2005 of breaching security under the State of Emergency by committing\u000acapital offence. The Court, the Respondent State contends, had responded throughout its sittings to all the\u000arequests made by the victims. They also submit that the Court had during deliberations allowed the victims\u000aand their defence to produce evidence in support of their case and to bring their own to witnesses. They\u000afurther submit that the Complainants were heard and that their request to be examined by a forensic doctor\u000awas also granted. They submit that the court equally heard the Complainants submissions in defence of the\u000avictims in 12 sessions and that they were allowed access to visit victims whenever they requested. They\u000aalso submit that the Complainants were given copies of the minutes of investigations and all the records of\u000acourt sittings as well as the witnesses and that the court was convinced that their confessions were valid.\u000a155. Concerning the Complainants' allegation that the fair trial rights of the victims were violated, the\u000aRespondent State adopted its earlier position that the victims had a fair and just trial before a legal, national\u000aand competent court. They submit that the trial sessions were public and were attended by the lawyers who\u000arepresented the victims; and that, the trial was concluded within a reasonable period.\u000a156. The Respondent State argues that it is clear from the court processes that the victims were tried\u000abefore a legal, national and independent court constituted of judges who enjoy judicial immunity. This\u000aaccording to the Respondent State negates the allegation of a any violation of Article 26 of the African\u000aCharter.\u000a\u000aThe African Commission's Analysis on the Merits\u000a157. In this communication, the African Commission is called upon to determine whether the arrest, pre-trial\u000adetention, trial and sentencing of the Victims by the Respondent State following their alleged involvement in\u000aa bomb attack on 6 October 2004, in the Taba and Noueiba' resorts of the Sinai Peninsula which led to the\u000adeath of 34 and the injury of 105 Egyptian, Israeli and other foreigners, violates the victims' rights\u000aguaranteed under Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a)(c) and 26 of the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\u000aThe summary of the rights allegedly violated by the Respondent State are viz:\u000a\u000a? The torture of the victims while in State custody, including electrical shocks, beatings, hanging from their\u000ahands and legs and prolonged sensory deprivation violates the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or\u000a15\u000a\u000adegrading treatment enshrined in Article 5 of the Charter;\u000a\u000a? The denial of essential safeguards necessary to give effect to that prohibition, such as access to counsel,\u000acourts and medical personnel, and the use in court of evidence obtained through torture, themselves\u000aamount to a violation of Article 5 of the Charter;\u000a\u000a? The character, procedures and conduct of the Office of the State Security Prosecutor and of the Supreme\u000aState Security Emergency Court violate the victims' rights to due process under Article 7(1) of the Charter\u000aand the State's obligations to ensure the independence of the courts under Article 26;\u000a\u000a? The denial of fair trial rights and the imposition of the death penalty which would constitute a breach of\u000athe right to life, as protected by Article 4 and 5 of the Charter.\u000a158. The Commission will accordingly proceed to analyze each of the Articles of the Charter alleged to\u000ahave been violated by the Respondent State\u000aAlleged Violation of Article 5\u000a\u000a159. The Complainants submit that the Respondent State violated Article 5 in that, the Victims were held\u000aincommunicado and denied access to their families, lawyers and medical care by SSI agents. They State\u000athat they were beaten, tortured, blindfolded and occasionally hung from the ceiling by their arms and legs in\u000apainful positions by SSI agents who applied electrical shocks to several parts of their bodies.\u000a160. Article 5 of the African Charter, reads, "Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity\u000ainherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and\u000adegradation particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\u000atreatment shall be prohibited.\u000aArticle 42 of the 1971 Constitution of Egypt stipulates that:\u000a"any citizen arrested, detained or whose freedom is restricted shall be treated in a manner concomitant with\u000athe preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him..."84\u000a161. In order to analyse the allegation of torture by the Victims, the African Commission will look at what\u000aamounts to torture in accordance with the Charter and other international instruments. Article 60 of the\u000aCharter has drawn inspiration from broader international law to deal with specific issues. Substantive\u000ainternational jurisprudence and practice has therefore developed in recent years regarding the nature of the\u000aprohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the obligations of states to protect its\u000acitizens against such treatment.\u000a162. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel or Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CAT) has defined\u000atorture as: "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted\u000aon a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,\u000apunishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or\u000aintimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when\u000asuch pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\u000aofficial or other person acting in an official capacity."85\u000a163. The African Commission will now seek to address issues as outlined in the submissions of the\u000aComplainants viz:\u000a(a) the Arab Republic of Egypt, through its State Security Intelligence force tortured and/or ill-treated the\u000avictims; (b) the State, through its intelligence services, prosecutor's office and security court, denied the\u000aVictims the essential safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, including prompt access to counsel, to a\u000acourt and to medical personnel, and has permitted the admissibility of "confessions" obtained through\u000atorture in proceedings against them. (c) the State has failed to conduct an effective investigation into these\u000a16\u000a\u000aalleged acts of torture and ill-treatment and no diligent attempts have been made to hold anyone to\u000aaccount.\u000a164. The facts of torture as contained in the complaints is that the SSI agents subjected the victims to\u000arepeated electrical shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging by the leg, binding and blindfolding aimed at their\u000acomplete disorientation.\u000a165. The Respondent State on the other hand submit that the investigations carried out by the Public\u000aProsecutor established that it has conducted external check on the accused persons immediately when\u000athey were brought before it and that it was confirmed that they were free from any external injuries. The\u000aquestion therefore that would follow is, who then inflicted the injuries that were subsequently found on the\u000avictims?\u000a166. The victims' allegation is also consistent with the forensic reports which were eventually issued for\u000aeach of the victims. The FMA report, following the examination of the First Victim on 5 July 2005, nearly\u000anine months after his injuries were sustained, noted "healings" and "dark discolorations" on his right and left\u000aforearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The Second Report of the FMA of 27 May\u000a2006, following examination of the Second and Third Victim also nearly nine months after their torture,\u000afound that the Second Victim had a "darker intersecting discolorations" all over his back, as well as an\u000aunhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the Third Victim had dark discolorations in the chest, abdomen\u000aand upper arms.86 However, in both cases the government examiners concluded that the long time lapse\u000abetween being examined and the injuries made it impossible to determine with certainty the reason,\u000amanner or time of such injuries."87\u000a167. The question therefore that begs the mind is who then is responsible for the dark colorations found on\u000athe bodies of the Victims? Certainly this could not have been inflicted by the Victims themselves, especially\u000awhen it has been established that during all this time they were under the custody of the Respondent\u000aState's agents.\u000a168. It is a well established principle of international human rights law, that when a person is injured in\u000adetention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was\u000asubjected to torture or ill-treatment. As the European Court of Human Rights has recently noted: Where a\u000aperson is injured while in detention or otherwise under the control of the police, any such injury will give rise\u000ato a strong presumption that the person was subjected to ill-treatment [...]. It is incumbent on the State to\u000aprovide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under\u000aArticle 3 of the Convention [...].88\u000a169. The African Commission wishes to state that under such circumstance, the burden now shifts to the\u000aRespondent State to convince this Commission that the allegations of torture raised by the Complainants is\u000aunfounded. The context of the Victims incommunicado detention and interrogation is such that available\u000aevidence is necessarily limited. However, the allegations of torture and ill-treatment are supported by the\u000avictim's independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. Their allegations fit also with the fact that they were\u000aheld incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the 6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that\u000aaccess to medical professionals was persistently denied until during trial itself.\u000a170. In the present case, the Respondent State has made no attempt to give a satisfactory explanation of\u000ahow the injuries were sustained, or to take any steps to investigate and address the surrounding\u000acircumstances. The trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the Victims'\u000atestimonies.\u000a171. In the light of the above the African Commission concludes that the marks on the victims evidencing\u000athe use of torture could only have been inflicted by the Respondent State.\u000a172. On the right to medical services, during detention, the African Commission and other international\u000abodies have recognized and emphasizes that such rights be provided "promptly". The Human Rights\u000aCommittee, in its General Comment No. 20, has observed that protection of the detainee from torture and\u000aill-treatment requires "prompt and regular access" to doctors.89 The General Assembly has repeatedly\u000aunderlined the importance of the right to prompt medical examination promptly following detention to\u000aprevent abuse of detainees.\u000a173. In the presence of allegations or possible indications of abuse, the importance of prompt access to\u000amedical personnel becomes all the more critical. The Istanbul Protocol, a set of detailed guidelines on the\u000ainvestigation of torture and ill-treatment elaborated by an independent group of experts in 1999, recalls that\u000a"[t]he investigator should arrange for a medical examination of the alleged victim. The timeliness of such\u000amedical examination is particularly important. A medical examination should be undertaken regardless of\u000athe length of time since the torture, but if it is alleged to have happened within the past six weeks, such an\u000a17\u000a\u000aexamination should be arranged urgently before acute signs fade."90\u000a174. The Robben Island Guidelines in its section 20, urges State Parties to make sure that "all persons\u000awho are deprived of their liberty by public prder or authority should have that detention controlled by\u000aproperly and legally constituted regulations. Such regulations should provide a number of basic safeguard,\u000aall of which shall apply from the moment when they are first deprived of their liberty. These include:\u000aa) The right that a relative or relative or other appropriate third person is notified of the detention;\u000ab) The right to an independent medical examination;\u000ac) The right of access to a lawyer; and\u000ad) Notification of the above rights in a language which the person deprived of their liberty understand. [sic]\u000a175. In the present case, the victims were not examined by doctors at any point during their pre-trial\u000adetention. Even when they reported their torture and ill-treatment, they were still denied access to medical\u000apersonnel by the authorities.\u000a176. Only when the allegations of torture were made for the second time during the trial itself did the Judge\u000aorder the examination of the Victims by the FMA. The forensic examination conducted by the authorities\u000aplainly did not satisfy the obligations set out above, as it was carried out more than 6 months after the\u000aVictims complained that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment and was, therefore, ineffectual as a\u000amethod of prevention or investigation.\u000a177. The African Commission therefore holds that the failure by the Respondent State to provide prompt\u000amedical services to the victims whiles they were under detention violates the victims' rights to prompt\u000amedical services whiles under custody.\u000a178. The African Commission also notes that the victims were denied counsel during their detention,\u000aincluding the critical interrogation sessions. In the Jamaican Case of Osbourne Wright and Eric Harvey v.\u000aJamaica, adopted on 27 October 1995, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has held that the\u000arequirement that legal assistance must be made available to an accused faced with a capital crimes applies\u000anot only to the trail and relevant appeals, but also to any preliminary hearing relating to the case.\u000a179. The African commission, therefore, notes that there is no disputed that the victims were unrepresented\u000aat the preliminary investigation stage, and notwithstanding the Respondents State's assertion that it is not\u000athe responsibility of the State authorities to pay for such legal aid, it finds that it is axiomatic that legal\u000aassistance be available in capital cases, at all stages of the proceedings, especially when there were\u000arequest from human rights lawyers to represent the victims. It should be understood by the Respondent\u000aState that there a positive obligation on them to provide access to independent legal assistance under the\u000aCharter, inherent in the international prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission has\u000arecognized the right to access to a lawyer as one of the "basic procedural safeguards for those deprived of\u000atheir liberty"91 and as one of the necessary safeguards against abuse during the pre-trial process.92\u000a180. The link between the prevention of torture and the right to prompt access to a lawyer has likewise\u000abeen emphasised by other international human rights bodies. In its Resolution 61/153 of 2007, reaffirming\u000athe UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment,\u000athe General Assembly stressed that permitting prompt and regular access to legal counsel constitutes an\u000a"effective measure [...] for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and\u000apunishment."93 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has stated that the protection of detainees from\u000atorture and ill-treatment "requires that prompt and regular access be given to [...] lawyers"94 and that the\u000ause of prolonged detention without any access to a lawyer violates a number of provisions of the Covenant,\u000aincluding Article 7.95\u000a181. Human rights bodies have thus recognized that, for access to a lawyer to constitute an effective\u000aprotection against torture and ill-treatment, such access has to be "prompt" and regular.96 For example the\u000aHuman Rights Committee has recommended "that no one is held for more than 48 hours without access to\u000aa lawyer",97 whilst the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has clarified that "[l]egal provisions prescribing\u000athat a person shall be given access to a lawyer not later than 24 hours after he has been arrested usually\u000afunction as an effective remedy against torture, provided compliance with such provisions is strictly\u000amonitored."98\u000a182. Further, the right is to have access to a lawyer of one's choice, as recognized for instance in the UN\u000aBasic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.99 For the right to counsel to be meaningful it must also comprise\u000athe right to timely, effective and confidentially communicate with counsel.\u000a183. In the instant matter, the obligation to permit access to counsel or independent legal advice was\u000abreached, as detailed above. The African Commission is convinced that the Victims were not given access\u000a18\u000a\u000aduring the critical early stage of detention, including interrogation sessions, when there is the greatest risk\u000aof torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission's view is that right of a detainee to have prompt\u000arecourse to a court is established as a matter of international law. It constitutes a vital aspect of the\u000aprevention and deterrence of torture and other ill-treatment.\u000a184. In this regard it is worth mentioning that in the Robben Island Guidelines, the African Commission has\u000arecognized that the right to be brought promptly before a judicial authority constitutes an essential\u000asafeguard against torture and ill-treatment,100 In its General Comment No. 2, the Committee Against\u000aTorture expressed the view that the obligation to take measures to ensure the effective prevention of torture\u000aimplied a requirement that States should ensure "the availability to detainees and persons at risk of torture\u000aand ill-treatment of judicial and other remedies that will allow them to have their complaint promptly and\u000aimpartially examined, to defend their rights, and to challenge the legality of their detention or treatment."101\u000a185. This approach has been repeatedly endorsed by the General Assembly,102 and finds further support in\u000athe jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.103\u000a186. As one of the inherent aspects of the protection of detainees from torture and ill-treatment, judicial\u000aoversight of detention applies at all times, including times of national emergency, as noted by the\u000aInter-American Court:\u000a"[...] even in emergency situations, the writ of habeas corpus may not be suspended or rendered\u000aineffective. [...] the immediate aim of this remedy is to bring the detainee before a judge, thus enabling the\u000alatter to verify whether the detainee is still alive and whether or not he or she has been subjected to torture\u000aor physical or psychological abuse. The importance of this remedy cannot be overstated, considering that\u000athe right to humane treatment recognized in Article 5 of the American Convention on Human Rights is one\u000aof the rights that may not be suspended under any circumstances."104\u000a187. In this case the Respondent States' obligation to bring the victims promptly to an independent judicial\u000aauthority was breached. While they did appear before a prosecutor, the right guaranteed in law is to bring\u000athem before a judicial authority that is independent of the authorities detaining, interrogating and ultimately\u000aprosecuting them. They also had no meaningful opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention,\u000adue to lack of access to a court and to lawyers. Article 3 of the Emergency Law 50/1982 as amended,\u000astipulates that detainees or their representatives may appeal their arrest or detention orders within 30 days\u000aafter the orders are issued. However, in practice detainees often have little access to the appeal provided\u000afor in law. The victims had no access to lawyers neither were they arraigned before a competent court\u000aduring to properly remand them to custody\u000a188. The Respondent State, while arguing that the victims were allowed access to their families, failed to\u000achallenge in specific terms the allegations that they were refused access to medical care. The allegation of\u000atorture and more particularly the particulars of injuries sustained by the Victims as contained in the Forensic\u000aMedical Reports were never challenged by the Respondent State.\u000a189. The Respondent State has not refuted the allegations of torture or the harsh treatment to which the\u000avictims were subjected to. The African Commission has in many of its decisions held that facts uncontested\u000aby the Respondent State shall be considered as established.105 The fact that the victims were subjected to\u000arepeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding and denied access to\u000amedical care violates their physical and psychological integrity. There was also no evidence whatsoever\u000apointing to violent action from the victims themselves nor has there been any reported escape attempt by\u000athe victims to warrant holding them in such degrading and inhuman manner.\u000a190. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not\u000aonly actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or\u000aforce him or her against his or her will or conscience. The African Commission therefore holds that the\u000aaction of the Respondent State constitutes a multiple violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged Violations of Article 7 and 26\u000a\u000a191. The Complainants contend that the victims right to fair trial were violated in that;\u000a? they were tried by a Court that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions cannot be\u000aappealed;\u000a? their right to a counsel was not fully respected;\u000a19\u000a\u000a? confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the Court; and\u000a? they were denied the right of appeal.\u000a192. The essential question that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Victims complied with the\u000aprovisions of Articles 7(1) and 26 of the African Charter.\u000a193. Article 7 of the African Charter provides that: "Every individual shall have the right to have his cause\u000aheard. This comprises:\u000aa) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\u000arecognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\u000ab) The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\u000ac) The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\u000ad) The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\u000a194. Article 26 on its part provides that: 'States Parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to\u000aguarantee the independence of the courts and shall allow the establishment and improvement of\u000aappropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms\u000aguaranteed by the present Charter'.\u000a195. A combined reading of Articles 7 and 26 brings to the fore two core issues - having access to\u000aappropriate justice and the other relating to the independence of justice system. These two issues\u000aconstitute the bedrock of a sound justice delivery system. The African Commission believes that the right to\u000aa fair trial is analogous with the concept of access to appropriate justice and requires that one's cause be\u000aheard by efficient and impartial courts106 .\u000a196. Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter enshrines "the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an\u000aimpartial Court or tribunal." The requirement of impartiality in Article 7 is complemented by Article 26 of the\u000aAfrican Charter which imposes on States parties "the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts" in\u000atheir respective territories.\u000a197. These obligations are captured in the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial where the\u000aCommission has expounded on what should be required for an independent and impartial tribunal. Among\u000aother criteria, the Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial state that:\u000a- judicial bodies shall be established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their\u000acompetence on the basis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed\u000amanner;107\u000a- there should not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall\u000adecisions be subject to revision except through judicial review;108\u000a- all judicial bodies shall be independent from the Executive branch109 and the government shall respect\u000athat independence;110\u000a- the process of appointments to judicial bodies shall be transparent;111\u000a- the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any restrictions, improper influence, inducements,\u000apressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.112\u000a198. Applying these fair trial principles to special tribunals, the African Commission has held that they\u000a"violate Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive\u000abranch.\u000a199. The victims were tried before the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, whose competence and\u000aprocedures fall far short of the above standards. The Supreme State Security Emergency Court is an\u000aexceptional court. It was established by the Emergency Law as a temporary court,113 although, like the\u000aEmergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The Emergency Law gives the Court the\u000aprimary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of decrees issued by the President of the\u000aRepublic in application of the Emergency Law,114 but the President of the Republic may also, at his\u000adiscretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court.115 According to\u000aPresidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to Emergency State Security Courts, all\u000a20\u000a\u000afelonies and misdemeanours against the Government's security or related to explosives shall be referred to\u000athe State Security Emergency Courts, established under the Emergency Law.\u000a200. In view of the above, the African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the\u000aPresident of the Republic exercises over the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the\u000aState Security Court is antithetical to the notion of an independent and impartial judicial process. The law\u000aitself provides, for example, for the President to exercise the following powers:\u000a? The President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or\u000aorder the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State\u000aSecurity Emergency Court.116\u000a? Decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the\u000aPresident of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt.117\u000a? The President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also\u000aorder the release of defendants118 or order the retrial of the case before another court.119\u000a201. It most [sic] be pointed out that Supreme State Security Emergence Court is not part of the regular\u000acriminal court structure in Egypt. Sentences passed by this court can only be reviewed by the office\u000aresponsible for ratifying its judgments, office of the President of the Republic who is also the ratifying\u000aauthority. The ratifying authority which is not a court of law, may mitigate the sentence or repeal it and,\u000aonce the sentences are upheld the convicts may only petition the President for an amnesty or mitigation in\u000aaccordance with the provisions of Article 149\u000a× Article 149 The President of Republic shall have the right of granting amnesty or commute a sentence.\u000aAs for general amnesty, it can only be granted by virtue of a law.\u000aof the Constitution.\u000a202. The Respondent State, however, submitted that the State of Emergency Security Court which tried the\u000aaccused persons is a prosecuting court with limited functions according to the law and the objective criteria.\u000aThey further asserted that membership of this court comprises three experts (Judges who are members of\u000athe judiciary. They also state that the trials and procedures in this case and in stages and phases were\u000acarried out in public and in accordance with the law. It further argued that the criteria of fair trial adopted by\u000athe international agreements on human rights were observed, and therefore, it is obvious from the above\u000aand from the records of the proceedings of the court trials that two lawyers appeared during all the hearings\u000atogether with the first and the second accused persons and four lawyers representing the third complainant.\u000a203. From the submissions of the Respondent State, the African Commission of the view that the\u000aRespondent State does not appreciate the importance of an independent tribunal, especially one that is\u000aresponsible for trying victims charged with capital offences. The African Commission therefore reiterates\u000athat the essence of a higher tribunal is that, it affords the victims the opportunity to have their case\u000are-examined on both law and facts by a judicial body. In this way the decision of the court below can be\u000atested. The omission of the opportunity of such an appeal therefore greatly deprives the victims of due\u000aprocess.\u000a204. In this regard the African Commission also wishes to make reference to the UN Basic Principle on the\u000aIndependence of the Judiciary. Those principles provide that every one shall have the right to be tried by\u000athe ordinary courts or tribunals using established procedures. Tribunals that do not use the duly established\u000aprocedures of the legal process shall not be created to displace the jurisdiction belonging to the ordinary\u000acourts or judicial tribunals. Therefore, it is the view of the African Commission that a tribunal cannot be said\u000ato be independent when the implementation of its decision squarely vests on the executive branch of the\u000aGovernment, in this case the Head of State. This has completely defeated the criteria envisaged in a\u000ademocratic state.\u000a205. In Civil Liberties Organisation, and Others v Nigeria120 , the African Commission held that 'the\u000aforeclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent 63 national organs in a criminal case attracting\u000apunishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates Article 7(1) (a)'. The African Commission\u000aagrees with the Complainants that the fact that the decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency\u000aCourts are not subject to appeal constitutes a de jure procedural irregularity and manifestly violates Article\u000a7(1) (a) of the African Charter.\u000a206. Therefore, the African Commission notes that in all cases, the independence of a court must be\u000ajudged in relation to the degree of independence of the judiciary vis-?-vis the executive. This implies the\u000a21\u000a\u000aconsideration of the manner in which its members are appointed, the duration of their mandate, the\u000aexistence of protection against external pressures and the issue of real or perceived independence: as the\u000asaying goes 'justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done'.\u000a207. The African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the President exercises over\u000athe composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court does not guarantee\u000aan independent and impartial judicial process. In its view that amounts to executive interference in the\u000ajudicial process defeating the intent and purporse of Article 7(1) (d). The African Commission is therefore of\u000athe view that the verdict of the Supreme State Security Emergency court did not offer guarantees of\u000aindependence, impartiality and equity and therefore constitutes a violation of the Article 7 of the African\u000aCharter.121\u000a208. In any event, it was the responsibility of the Respondent State to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut\u000athe arguments that the court in its composition was independent and was capable of giving an impartial\u000aruling, and this the Respondent State has not done to the satisfaction of the African Commission. In the\u000aabsence of such rebuttal or facts that could convince the African Commission of the opposite view, it\u000acannot invalidate the submission by the complainants regarding the inexistence of a fair justice system.\u000a209. The African Commission will look into the issue of the right to counsel of ones [sic] choice. This right\u000aas enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter122 is an important right which underpins several\u000aothers, such as freedom from ill-treatment and the right to prepare a defence.123 In the Principles and\u000aGuidelines on Fair Trial, the African Commission considered that in proceedings relating to criminal\u000acharges, legal representation is the "best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights\u000aand fundamental freedoms".124 Such right to counsel applies during all stages of any criminal prosecution\u000a"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial\u000aand appeal proceedings. Article 7 is explicit that the right is to counsel of the detainee or defendant's\u000achoice. It comprises the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.125 Where the\u000aaccused either had no access, or only restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, the African Commission\u000ahas found a violation of Article 7.1(c)126 .\u000a210. In the instant case, none of the Victims had lawyers present at the critical early interrogation stage. It\u000ais submitted by the Complainants and not refuted by the Respondent State that on 23 November 2004 a\u000agroup of human rights lawyers submitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered\u000aunder number 16332) to legally represent a number of individuals, including the First Victim, whose names\u000ahad appeared in the local press as chief suspects in the Taba bombings' investigation. The lawyers\u000areceived no response. The First Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months\u000auntil 24 March 2005. The Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when\u000athey first appeared in court.\u000a211. Moreover, even at the beginning of the trial, all three were denied the opportunity to consult with\u000acounsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. The lawyer client communication, as alleged by the\u000aComplainants and not refuted by the Respondents, took place through bars of the court room, in the\u000apresence of and within earshot security officials. The African Commission therefore finds that the complete\u000adenial of access to counsel before their appearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter violated\u000athe right to counsel and the right to a defence (see below) under Article 7(1) (c).127\u000a212. Furthermore, in interpreting Article 7 of the African Charter, the African Commission has stated that\u000a"any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of coercion or force may not be admitted as\u000aevidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in sentencing."128 In Malawi African Association\u000aV. Mauritania, this Commission has held that "any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado\u000adetention shall be considered to have been obtained by coercion."129\u000a213. These principles correspond with other international human rights norms, addressed in relation to\u000atorture and ill-treatment, under which evidence and confessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman\u000aand degrading treatment, cannot be used in judicial proceedings apart from for the purpose of prosecuting\u000athe act of torture or ill-treatment itself.130\u000a214. The African Commission makes reference to Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT). It\u000aalso notes that it has been accepted as inherent in international fair trial provisions comparable to Article 7\u000aof the African Charter. The European Court of Human Rights for example has held that "the use of\u000aevidence obtained in violation of Article 3 [prohibition against torture or ill-treatment] in criminal proceedings\u000araises serious issues as to the fairness of such proceedings. Incriminating evidence - whether in the form of\u000aa confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of\u000atreatment which can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt,\u000a22\u000a\u000airrespective of its probative value."131\u000a215. It notes that the principle can also be found in the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 which stipulates that\u000a"if a confession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall\u000abe considered invalid and futile"132 .\u000a216. Thus, where an individual alleges that a confession has been obtained by torture or ill-treatment, the\u000aburden of proof then lies in this case on the state to demonstrate that the confession in question was freely\u000amade. Although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of cases that, "it is for the author\u000ato demonstrate that her allegations are well founded",133 it nevertheless stressed in P. E. v. France that, "In\u000athe light of the allegations that the statements at issue, which constituted, at least in part, the basis for the\u000aadditional extradition request, were obtained as a result of torture, the State party had the obligation to\u000aascertain the veracity of such allegations."134\u000a217. In a similar vein, the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\u000aTreatment or Punishment, reviewing two national decisions that adopted a somewhat different approach to\u000athe standard of proof question,135 noted as follows:\u000a"[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well founded. This\u000ameans that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence in any\u000aproceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the State.136\u000a218. Accordingly, once a victim raises doubt as to whether particular evidence has been procured by\u000atorture or ill-treatment, the evidence in question should not be admissible, unless the State is able to show\u000athat there is no risk of torture or ill-treatment. Moreover, where a confession is obtained in the absence of\u000acertain procedural guarantees against such abuse, for example during incommunicado detention, it should\u000anot be admitted as evidence.\u000a219. The victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment. These allegations are at least\u000aconsistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the incommunicado nature of their detention and\u000athe reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of ill-treatment. Despite these concerns, the\u000a"confessions" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at least part of the basis of their\u000aconvictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such evidence violates Article 7 of the\u000aCharter.\u000a220. The African Commission will now briefly address the matter of appeal. In this regard, the African\u000aCommission notes that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency Law stipulates that "It is not allowed in any\u000aform to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security Courts." This law, and its application in practice,\u000aviolate Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter, which provides for "the right to an appeal to competent national organs\u000aagainst acts violating the fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed by conventions, laws,\u000aregulations and customs in force."\u000a221. According to the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial, the right to appeal should be\u000aguaranteed in all States Parties and should provide "a genuine and timely review of the case, including the\u000afacts and the law".137 The Commission has noted that States Parties should take steps to make appeals\u000amandatory in death penalty cases, confirming the heightened importance of fair trial guarantees where life\u000ais at stake.138\u000a222. The importance of appeal rights is also reflected in the Commission's jurisprudence. In Law Office of\u000aGhazi Suleiman v. Sudan, the Commission held that "the fact that the decisions of the military Court [was]\u000anot subject to appeal [...] constitute[d] a de jure procedural irregularity."139 Concerning the right to appeal in\u000adeath penalty cases, the Commission found that "the foreclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent\u000anational organs in a criminal case attracting punishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates\u000a[Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter]."140\u000a223. By denying the victims the right to appeal the decision of the Supreme State Security Emergency\u000aCourt, the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Article 7(1) (a) of the African Charter. It should be noted\u000athat the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader international\u000ahuman rights law.\u000a224. The African Commission therefore concludes that the victims' rights under Article 7 (1) (a), (b) and (c)\u000aof the African Charter including their right to appeal, were violated.\u000a225. The African Commission will now analyse the submissions of the parties on Article 4 of the Charter.\u000a226. The Complainants aver that the imposition of the death penalty on the victims by a court, whose\u000acomposition is illegal and unconstitutional, such as the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, violates\u000athe victims' right to life and would amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\u000a23\u000a\u000a227. The Respondent State argues that trial as well as procedures adopted in this case satisfied the\u000arequirement of fair trial as guaranteed by international norms and standard. They stated that the trials were\u000acarried out in public and in accordance with the assurances provided by the law. They also state that the\u000avictims were represented by lawyers of their choice during trial.\u000a228. Article 4 of the African Charter provides that 'human beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be\u000aentitled to respect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one shall be arbitrary deprived of this right'.\u000a229. The victims were charged, inter alia, under Article 86 b (ii) and (iii) of the Egyptian Penal Code. This\u000alaw provides that the punishment for the crimes specified in those provisions is death penalty where "the\u000aaction of the offender leads to the death of the victim of the crime"141 or "the crime which occurred was the\u000aobject of the efforts or intelligence /contacts or involvement in committing it."142\u000a230. The above law imposes a penalty on a particular crime in specified circumstances but did not provide\u000aan avenue for a competent judiciary to evaluate the appropriate penalty, in light of all of the circumstances\u000aof the case. The penalty is effectively mandated by law for certain categories of offences, with the President\u000aempowered to decide not to apply that sentence if he so decides. This is at odds with the requirements of\u000aright to life, as reflected in international legal practice.\u000a231. The African Commission in the case of International Pen and Others (on behalf of Saro-Wiwa) v\u000aNigeria143 took the view that the execution and implementation of a death sentence emanating from a trial\u000awhich did not conform to Article 7 of the African Charter will amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\u000aHaving held that the trial of the applicants offended Article 7 of the African Charter, it follows that any\u000aimplementation of the death sentence imposed on the applicants by the Supreme State Security\u000aEmergency courts will therefore amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\u000a232. However after careful consideration of Articles 7 and 26 and the wordings of Article 4, the African\u000aCommission is of the view that Article 4 of the Charter has not been violated. The victims are still under the\u000acustody of the Respondent State, through a process that denied them due process and are not yet\u000aexecuted.\u000a\u000aHolding\u000a233. For these reasons, the African Commission holds as follows:\u000a(a) That the Respondent State - Republic of Egypt has violated the provisions of Articles 5, 7 (1) (a), (d)\u000aand 26 of the African Charter;\u000a(b) that there has been no violation of Article 4 of the African Charter;\u000a\u000aThe African Commission therefore calls on the Respondent State;\u000aI. Not to implement the death sentences;\u000aII. Calls on the Respondent State to adequately compensate the victims in line with international standard;\u000aIII. Reform the composition of the State Security Emergency Courts and ensure their independence;\u000aIV. Take measures to ensure that its law enforcement organs particularly the police respect the rights of\u000asuspects detained in line with Article 5 of the Charter;\u000aV. Calls on the Respondent State to harmonize the State Security Emergency Laws with a view to bringing\u000ait in conformity with the Charter and other international legislations and regional norms and standards\u000aVI. Calls on the Respondent State to release the victims;\u000aVII. Calls on the Respondent State to submit the African Commission within 180 days from the date of\u000areceipt of this decision (in line with Rule 112(2) of the African Commissions Rules of Procedure) on the\u000ameasures taken to give effect to these recommendations.\u000a\u000aDone in Banjul this 9th Extra-Ordinary Session held From 23 February to 3 March 2011.\u000a\u000a24\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a*Editor's note: 87/93 is the number of a Constitution Rights Project v.

aV373/06 INTERIGHTS, Institute for Human Rights and\u000aDevelopment in Africa, and Association Mauritanienne\u000ades Droits de l'Homme / Mauritania\u000a373/06 (formerly 242/01) - INTERIGHTS, Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa, and\u000aAssociation Mauritanienne des Droits de l'Homme v Mauritania 28 AAR\u000a\u000aDecision on Complainants' Request for Review\u000a1. On 1st September 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received from the Complainants, a\u000arequest to review the Commission's decision on the merits of Communication 242/2001 - Interights,\u000aInstitute for Human Rights and Development in Africa and Association Mauritanienne des Droits de\u000al'Homme / Islamic Republic of Mauritania, adopted at the African Commission's 35th Ordinary Session, held\u000ain Banjul, The Gambia in May 2006.\u000a2. The request was considered at the 36th Ordinary Session of the Commission held in Dakar, Senegal,\u000afrom 23rd November - 7th December 2006, and the Commission decided to bring the request to the\u000aattention of the Respondent State for the latter's comments. In spite of numerous reminders; the\u000aCommission has not received any response from the Respondent State. The Commission will therefore\u000aproceed to take a decision on the Complainants' request, in spite of the fact that the State has not\u000aresponded.\u000a3. In the request, the Complainants raised two issues: the first issue relates to the decision of the African\u000aCommission being infra petita, and the second issue relates to the fact that the decision of the Commission\u000a'did not represent the required guarantees of impartiality'.\u000a4. Regarding the first issue, the Complainants argue that having found the Respondent State in violation of\u000acertain provisions of the African Charter, the African Commission failed to address itself to the prayers of\u000athe Complainants, so as to restore the victim to his rights. According to the Complainants, this failure to\u000apronounce on the prayers renders the Commission's decision infra petita.\u000a5. On the question of impartiality, the Complainants submit that the principles of natural justice were not\u000arespected. They claim that one of the Members of the African Commission, a national of the Respondent\u000aState, took part in the deliberations that arrived at the final decision on the Communication. According to\u000athe Complainants, this is against Article 109 of the Rules of Procedures of the African Commission, which\u000aforbids Members of the Commission from participating in the deliberation of a Communication when they\u000ahave a "personal interest" or have "participated in whatever capacity in the adoption of whatever decision\u000arelating to the case referred to by the Communication".\u000a6. To consider this request, the African Commission has to address two preliminary issues:\u000a\u2022 Whether or not it is competent to review its own decision; and\u000a\u2022 Under what circumstances its decision should be reviewed?\u000a\u000aOn the Competence of the Commission\u000a\u000a7. Neither the African Charter nor the Commission's own Rules of Procedure provide for a review of the\u000aAfrican Commission's decision on the merits. Provision is made within the Commission's Rules of\u000aProcedure only for the review of a decision on admissibility, and even then, only in a situation where a\u000acommunication has been declared inadmissible.1\u000a8. This notwithstanding, the African Commission can draw inspiration from the practices of similar regional\u000aand international bodies to determine whether it can review its own decision. In Purohit & Moore v The\u000aGambia2 the Commission was confronted with a similar request and it invoked Articles 60 and 61 of the\u000aAfrican Charter, and adopted the principles and practices of other international tribunals with similar\u000amandate. In that communication, the Commission was persuaded by the practices of the International\u000aCourt of Justice (ICJ), whereby Article 61(1) of the ICJ Statute requires that, 'an application for revision of a\u000ajudgment may be made only when it is based upon the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a\u000a1\u000a\u000adecisive factor, which fact was, when the judgment was given, unknown to the Court and also to the party\u000aclaiming review, always provided that such ignorance was not due to negligence'.3\u000a9. The African Commission further adopts the ICJ's reasoning that an application for revision must be made\u000awithin a certain period of time.4\u000a10. Therefore, like all tribunals, domestic and international, judicial and quasi-judicial, the African\u000aCommission has the competence to review its decision on the merits, especially where it is evident that the\u000aapplication for review has introduced a new or compelling issue which, had the Commission had knowledge\u000aof, would have impacted on the decision; or where the Commission has inadvertently failed to take into\u000aaccount certain facts during the consideration of the case.\u000a11. In other words, the Commission can review its own decision when it is apparent that the application\u000aintroduces a new or compelling element, the failure to consider which would be an affront to fairness,\u000ajustice and good conscience.\u000a12. After determining that it is competent to review its own decision and the circumstances under which it\u000acan review its own decisions, the African Commission will now examine whether the application of the\u000aComplainants meet the African Commission's requirements for a review of its decision, that is, whether the\u000aapplication introduces a new or compelling element.\u000a13. In the present communication, the Complainants have seized the Commission on two main issues:\u000a1. (a) allegation that the decision of the Commission was infra petita; and (b) allegation of partiality.\u000a14. Can the Commission consider these two issues to be new or compelling to warrant a review of its\u000adecision?\u000a15. While the two issues raised by the Complainants do not raise any new element relating to the\u000asubstance of the communication that they submitted, they certainly are compelling enough to warrant a\u000areview.\u000aOn the question that the decision is infra petita\u000a\u000a16. The Complainants in their application for review are not raising new facts. They have also not\u000aintroduced evidence that was not brought to the attention of the African Commission during the\u000aconsideration of the communication on the merits. Rather they are asking the Commission to pronounce\u000aitself on each of the prayers they made when the communication was submitted to the Commission.\u000a17. The Complainants, in the communication, had requested the Commission that should the latter find the\u000aState in violation of any of the provisions of the African Charter, it should:\u000a\u2022 urge the State to restore all rights of the UFD/EN and instruct it to restore all confiscated properties;\u000a\u2022 request the Mauritanian authorities to harmonise national legislation in accordance with the relevant\u000aprovisions of the African Charter pertaining to fair trial and freedom of association and expression;\u000a\u2022 ask the Mauritanian government to take necessary measures to ensure that such violations against\u000apolitical parties not be repeated;\u000a\u2022 call on the State to put an end to such infractions; and\u000a\u2022 request the Mauritanian government to inform the Commission of any measures it takes to address\u000athe breaches elaborated in the communication.\u000a18. In its decision, the African Commission held with respect to the allegations made against the State that\u000a"the dissolution of UFD/Ere Nouvelle political party by the Respondent State was not proportionate to the\u000anature of the breaches and offences committed by the political party and is therefore in violation of the\u000aprovisions of Article 10(1) of the African Charter". The Commission did not pronounce itself on any of the\u000aprayers made by the Complainants.\u000a19. Does the fact that the Commission did not address the prayers of the Complainants make its decision\u000ainfra petita? Put differently, could the Commission's decision not to pronounce on the prayers made by the\u000aComplainants be considered infra petita?.\u000a\u000a2\u000a\u000aWhat is an infra petita decision?\u000a\u000a20. The term infra petita is a Latin expression sometimes used to describe a situation where the court has\u000afailed to pronounce itself on one of the main claims of a petition. In terms of Article 190 (2)(c) of the Swiss\u000aFederal Statute on Private International Law (PILA), an arbitral award or remedy can be set aside if the\u000atribunal has adjudicated beyond the relief sought (ultra petita) or granted relief different than what was\u000asought (extra petita) or failed to adjudicate certain claims raised by the Complainant (infra petita).\u000a21. To fully appreciate whether the Commission's decision was infra petita, there is need to differentiate\u000abetween an 'allegation' or 'claim' and a 'prayer' or 'remedy'.\u000a22. An allegation is a claim by a party in a pleading, which the party intends to prove in a court of law.\u000aAccording to the Black's Law Dictionary, an allegation is an assertion, claim, declaration or statement of a\u000aparty to an action, made in a pleading, setting out what he expects to prove. Allegations thus remain\u000aassertions without proof, until they can be proved. Generally, in a civil complaint, as is the present case, the\u000aplaintiff (in this case, the Complainants) must carry the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion in\u000aorder to prove their allegation.\u000a23. In the present communication, the Complainants allege or claim that the Respondent State has violated\u000acertain provisions of the Charter, which allegation/claim they want to prove before the Commission. Simply\u000aput, an allegation or a claim is a legal action to obtain a remedy, or the enforcement of a right against\u000aanother party. It is a legal statement made to alert the accused of the legal implications.\u000a24. A remedy on the other hand is an action taken by a court of law to enforce a right, impose a penalty, or\u000amake some other court order in order to resolve a dispute. According to the Black's Law Dictionary, a\u000aremedy is the means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed or\u000acompensated.\u000a25. In the communication under consideration, the Complainants allege/claim that the Respondent State\u000ahas violated Articles 1, 2, 7(1), 9(1), 10(1), 13(1) and 14 of the African Charter, dealing with the State's\u000aobligations under the Charter, freedom from discrimination, the right to have one's cause heard, freedom of\u000aexpression, freedom of association, the right to participate in government and the right to property. These,\u000ain the opinion of the Commission, are the Complainants' allegations/claims put before the Commission,\u000awhich the Complainants want to prove had been violated by the Respondent State and which they required\u000athe Commission to pronounce itself on, based on the interpretation of the African Charter.\u000a26. Apart from making these allegations, the Complainants also called upon the Commission that, should it\u000afind that they (the Complainants) have proven the allegations, it should adopt certain measures to reinstate\u000athe victim to his rights, including, urging the Respondent State to restore all rights of the UFD/EN and\u000ainstruct it to restore all confiscated properties; requesting the Mauritanian authorities to harmonise national\u000alegislation in accordance with the relevant provisions of the African Charter pertaining to fair trial and\u000afreedom of association and expression; requesting the Mauritanian government to take necessary\u000ameasures to ensure that such violation against political parties not repeat itself; call on the State to put an\u000aend to further violations; and requests the Mauritanian government to inform the Commission of measures\u000ait has taken to address the breaches elaborated in the Communication. In the opinion of the Commission,\u000athe above requests represent the remedies sought by the Complainants.\u000a27. There is thus a clear distinction between an allegation/claim and a remedy/prayer. In the present\u000acommunication, the Complainants are not disputing the fact that the Commission addressed the\u000aallegations. They are rather arguing that the Commission, having considered the allegations and found a\u000aviolation, did not provide them with the remedies they requested.\u000a28. Naturally, when a petitioner brings a complaint before a tribunal, he/she expects the tribunal to make a\u000adetermination as to his/her rights vis-?-vis the other party (in this case the State). There is a legitimate\u000aexpectation on the part of the petitioner that where the tribunal (in this case, the African Commission) finds\u000athat a State has violated the rights of the petitioner, he/she would be provided with remedies so as to\u000arestore his/her rights; that the State would be cautioned to take measures to ensure that the act that\u000aresulted in the violation does not repeat itself; and the tribunal could make any other decision it deems\u000anecessary in the particular circumstance. These are legitimate expectations from the Complainants.\u000a29. The right to a remedy for a violation has been firmly established under international law. This principle\u000ais provided in Article 63 (1) of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights which provides that "...if the\u000a[Inter-American Court] finds that there has been a violation of a right or freedom protected by the\u000aConvention, the Court shall rule that the injured party be ensured enjoyment of his right or freedom that\u000awas violated. It shall also rule, if appropriate, that the consequences of the measure or situation that\u000a3\u000a\u000aconstituted the breach of such right or freedom be remedied and that fair compensation be paid to the\u000ainjured party". In applying this provision, the Inter-American Court held in Yakye Axa v Paraguay5 that, "any\u000aviolation of an international obligation that has caused damage entails the duty to provide appropriate\u000areparations".\u000a30. In the present communication, the Commission found that "the dissolution of UFD/Ere nouvelle political\u000aparty by the Respondent State was not proportional to the nature of the breaches and offences committed\u000aby the political party and is therefore in violation of the provisions of Article 10(1) of the African Charter". It\u000amade no further determination, either by way of restoring the victim to his rights or proposing what the State\u000ashould do to prevent a recurrence of the violation.\u000a31. Does the fact that the Commission, after concluding that there was a violation of the Charter but failing\u000ato provide the remedies requested by the Complainants, renders its decision infra petita?\u000a32. To answer this question, the Commission will have to analyse the decision to examine the claims made\u000aby the Complainants and the extent to which the Commission addressed them.\u000a33. A tribunal will not be considered to have omitted to pronounce itself on a claim if it can be deduced from\u000athe judgment that the claim was implicitly rejected, or on the contrary, that the tribunal implicitly admitted it.\u000aIt is usually the case for example, where a petition contains main, as well as, subsidiary claims.\u000a34. In the present communication, the allegation/claim of the Complainants before the Commission is clear\u000a- that by its action, the Respondent State has violated Articles 1, 2, 7(1), 9(2), 10(1), 13(1) and 14 of the\u000aCharter. These are mere allegations/claims which the Complainants have to prove before the Commission.\u000aAt the same time, the remedies the Complainants requested were also clear. (See para 17 above).\u000a35. After analysing the submissions made by both the Complainants and the State, the Commission held\u000awith respect of the Complainants allegations/claims that Article 7(1) as alleged has not been violated (see\u000aCommissioner's arguments from paras 43-47 of the decision); that Articles 9(2), and 13(1) as alleged have\u000aequally not been violated; but that Article 10(1) has indeed been violated as alleged (see paras 76-85 of the\u000adecision).\u000a36. In its analysis of the Complainants allegations/claims, the Commission failed to address three\u000aallegations/claims, that is, the alleged violation of Articles 1, 2 and 14, dealing with the state obligations\u000aunder the Charter, non-discrimination and the right to property, respectively.\u000a37. While it is important for the Commission to provide remedies to a victim whenever it finds that the State\u000ahas infringed the victim's right, failing to do so does not render the Commission's decision infra petita, if it\u000acan be deduced from the decision that all the allegations mentioned in the communication have been\u000aaddressed by the Commission.\u000a38. From the analysis above, it is evident that that the Commission failed to pronounce itself on all the\u000aallegations made by the Complainants, in particular, it failed to pronounce itself on the alleged violation of\u000aArticles 1, 2 and 14, the latter being a principal allegation. To the extent that the Commission did not\u000aaddress all the allegations, the decision of the Commission is infra petita.\u000a39. Having established that the decision is infra petita, can the Commission supplement its decision? It is\u000aperfectly legal for a tribunal that has forgotten to decide on a claim (infra petita) to supplement its decision\u000awithout affecting the res judicata character of the other claims decided upon. This procedure excludes\u000arecourse to a higher court and can be undertaken suo moto or on the request of one of the parties. The\u000aCommission will therefore proceed to pronounce on the alleged violation of Articles 1, 2 and 14 of the\u000aCharter.\u000aAlleged violation of article 2\u000a\u000a40. The Complainants allege that there the Respondent State has violated Article2 of the African Charter.\u000aArticle 2 states that: "Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\u000arecognised and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic\u000agroup, colour, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth\u000aor any status".\u000a41. The Complainants do not demonstrate how the Respondent State discriminated against the victim, and\u000aas such the Commission cannot hold that the State violated Article 2 of the Charter.\u000a\u000a4\u000a\u000aAlleged violation of Article 14\u000a\u000a42. The Complainants alleged that the State confiscated the property of the political party in violation of\u000aArticle 14 of the Charter which provides that '[t]he right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be\u000aencroached upon in the interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in\u000aaccordance with the provisions of appropriate laws'.\u000a43. The right to property is a traditional fundamental right in democratic and liberal societies. It is\u000aguaranteed in international human rights instruments as well as national constitutions, and has been\u000aestablished by the jurisprudence of the African Commission. 6 The role of the State is to respect and protect\u000athis right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the exercise of this right in order for it to be\u000aaccessible to everyone, taking public interest into due consideration.\u000a44. The right to property encompasses two main principles. The first one is of a general nature. It provides\u000afor the principle of ownership and peaceful enjoyment of property. The second principle provides for the\u000apossibility, and conditions of deprivation of the right to property. Article 14 of the Charter recognises that\u000aStates are in certain circumstances entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in\u000aaccordance with the public or general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the\u000apurpose.\u000a45. However, in the situation described by the present Communication, the State has not demonstrated that\u000athe property of the Complainant was confiscated for public interest or in accordance with any established\u000alaw. The confiscation was done arbitrarily in a manner that violates Article 14 of the African Charter.\u000aAlleged violation of Article 1\u000a\u000a46. The African Commission concludes further that Article 1 of the African Charter imposes a general\u000aobligation on all State Parties to recognise the rights enshrined therein, and requires them to adopt\u000ameasures to give effect to those rights. As such any finding of violation of those rights constitutes a\u000aviolation of Article 1.\u000aOn the question of partiality\u000a\u000a47. On the question relating to the participation of a Member of the Commission who is a national of the\u000aRespondent State, the Commission would like to reiterate that its Rule 109(1) requires that no Member\u000ashall take part in the consideration of a communication:\u000a\u2022 If s/he has any personal interest in the case, or\u000a\u2022 If he/she has participated, in any capacity in the adoption of any decision relating to the case which\u000ais the subject of the communication.\u000a48. Rule 109(2) further empowers the Commission to rule on the applicability of Rule 109(1) where it is\u000acalled to do so.\u000a49. In the opinion of the African Commission 'take part' under Rule 109 (1) of its Rules of Procedure means\u000acontributing in the deliberations of a subject matter. While it is recommended that a Commissioner who\u000arecuses him/herself leaves the hall during deliberations, a Commissioner who recuses him/herself but\u000achooses to sit in the hall cannot be considered to have taken part in the deliberations. In terms of Article 31,\u000athe members are independent experts of the highest reputation, known for their high morality, integrity,\u000aimpartiality...and serve in their personal capacity. It is thus expected that Members of the Commission live\u000aup to the standards befitting their position.\u000a50. It is not necessarily the case that a Member of the Commission from a country against which a\u000acomplaint has been lodged would have an interest in that particular case. However, it is important to take\u000ainto consideration the public perception or adopt the principle of a reasonable person in the consideration of\u000aa communication. Would the public or a reasonable man believe that a member of the Commission would\u000a'take part' in the deliberation of a communication concerning his country and take a neutral decision?\u000a51. The African Commission adheres strictly to the natural justice principle of nemo judex in sua causa: "no\u000aman is permitted to be a judge in his own cause". This principle is very critical in the administration of\u000ajustice, for justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done.\u000a52. The use of the word 'shall' in Rule 109 implies that the Commission would not compromise in the\u000aimplementation of this principle. In the Complainants' submissions, they quoted paragraphs 2 and 17 of the\u000a5\u000a\u000aFinal Communiqué of the 35th Ordinary Session of the African Commission to buttress their argument that a\u000aCommissioner, a national from the Respondent State, took part during deliberations of the communication\u000ain question.\u000a53. In terms of Rule 106 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, communications are examined in private\u000asession and the Complainants could not have been privy to what transpired during the examination of the\u000aCommunication in question.\u000a54. The African Commission's records indicate that the Commissioner in question did not take part in the\u000adeliberations of the present Communication.\u000a55. The burden of proving that he did rests with the Complainants. Under such circumstances, and relying\u000aon the presumption of regularity, it is presumed that the Commission complied with its procedures under\u000aRule 109.\u000a56. In terms of the presumption of regularity, there is a favourable presumption that all what the\u000aCommission does in the normal course of its duty is regular and valid. This evidentiary principle which has\u000aits historical roots in the presumption against misconduct of public officials, presupposes that every\u000aindividual in his or her private and official capacity, does his or her duty, until the contrary is proved. In other\u000awords, it will be presumed that government officials (in this case, the Members of the Commission) have\u000adischarged their duty rightly and in good faith, unless the circumstances of the case provide adequate proof\u000ato the contrary\u000a57. To overturn this presumption, the party that seeks to challenge the presumption, and in this case,\u000aalleges that the Commission did not comply with its Rules, bears the burden of proof.\u000a58. The Commission noted in this instance that the fact that the name of the Commissioner, a national of\u000athe Respondent State, appeared in the Final Communiqué of the Commission does not signify that the\u000alatter took part in the proceedings regarding the communication in question, in violation of Rule 109. The\u000aComplainants therefore have the burden to prove that the spirit and object of Rule 109 have been\u000abreached. The only evidence that the Complainants adduced was the reference to the 2nd paragraph of the\u000aFinal Communiqué of the 35th Ordinary session of the Commission which indicated that the Commissioner\u000awas one of the members that attended that session.\u000a59. In terms of the Commission's practice, the Final Communiqué lists the names of the members who\u000aattend a particular session. The Communiqué however does not indicate which members took part in the\u000adeliberations of which any particular agenda item. In this case, the name of the Commissioner in question,\u000alike the names of all the other Members who attended the session, was indicated in the Final Communiqué\u000aof the session. This does not however mean that he took part in the deliberations with respect to the\u000acommunication in question.\u000a60. Admittedly, the Complainants could have been misled by the Final Communiqué to assume that all the\u000amembers who attended the session also took part in deliberations on all the agenda items, especially as\u000athe Final Communiqué did not indicate whether or not any member recused themselves on any particular\u000aitem.\u000a61. The African Commission is very strict in its application of its Rules of Procedure, and in particular, Rule\u000a109, and with respect to the said Rule, its application is not limited to the consideration of Communications,\u000abut extends to all items considered by the Commission.\u000a62. The Commission is therefore of the view that the Complainants have not fully discharged their burden\u000aof proof, and to state that the Commissioner, a national of the Respondent State did not take part in the\u000aconsideration of the communication in question, and his participation at the session is not proof that he\u000aparticipated in the deliberation related to this Communication.\u000a\u000aDecision of the African Commission\u000a63. In view of the above, the Commission finds that:\u000ai the decision on the merits of Communication 242/2001 -Interights, Institute for Human Rights and\u000aDevelopment in Africa, and Association Mauritanienne des Droits de l'Homme/Islamic Republic of\u000aMauritania is infra petita, to the extent that it did not address itself to the allegation of violations of Articles 1,\u000a2 and 14 of the African Charter;\u000aii the Respondent State did not violate Article 2 of the African Charter;\u000aiii the Respondent State violated Articles 1 and 14 of the African Charter;\u000aiv the Complainants have not discharged their burden of proof with respect to the allegation of partiality,\u000aand relying on the presumption of regularity, concludes that the Commission acted correctly and in good\u000a6\u000a\u000afaith.\u000a64. The African Commission recommends that:\u000a1. the Respondent State should pay adequate compensation to the victim for the loss suffered;\u000a2. the Respondent State should take steps to ensure that its law on freedom of association, in\u000aparticular the establishment and functioning of political parties, is in conformity with the provisions of\u000athe Charter;\u000a3. the Respondent State should inform the African Commission on measures adopted to implement\u000athese recommendations within 180 days of receipt of this decision.\u000a\u000aAdopted at the 8th Extraordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples'\u000aRights, Banjul, The Gambia.\u000a\u000aFootnotes\u000a1 See Rule 118(2)\u000a2 Communication 241/2001.\u000a3 Statute of the International Court of Justice.
