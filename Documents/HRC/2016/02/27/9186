<p><b>Letter from the Chairperson-Rapporteur to the members of the Open-ended  
Working Group on an optional protocol to the International Covenant on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council in its resolution 1/3 requested the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group to prepare a first draft optional protocol to be used as a basis for the 
negotiations on an optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. In response to this request, I prepared the draft optional protocol contained in 
document A/HRC/6/WG.4/2 which the Working Group considered and completed a first reading 
of at its fourth session, from 16 to 27 July 2007. 
</p>
<p>2.  To facilitate the negotiation process, I have prepared a revised version of the draft which is 
enclosed in annex I to the present letter. I have revised the text on the basis of proposals for 
amendments made during the fourth session of the Working Group, also reflected in the report of 
that session (A/HRC/6/8).  
</p>
<p>3.  The revised draft does not aim to reflect all discussions held during the fourth session of 
the Working Group, as a comprehensive account of those discussions is contained in the above-
mentioned report of the session. Rather, the draft aims to reflect those proposals for which 
concrete text was proposed and presented to the Working Group at its fourth session. 
Amendments made to the original draft are marked in bold font (new text) or strikethrough 
(deletions). Moreover, in those cases where no discussion was held or objections raised to 
specific proposals for amendments, the proposed new text has been placed in square brackets.  
</p>
<p>4.  In the explanatory memorandum, annex II, I have indicated the proposals for amendments 
which have been included in the revised draft and provided a few explanatory remarks on 
specific provisions, including on how, in some cases, I have combined different proposals in an 
effort to use the wording which seemed most consensual.  
</p>
<p>5. I hope the revised draft will assist us in moving forward during the fifth session, due to be 
held from 4 to 8 February 2008 (first part) and 31 March to 4 April 2008 (second part).

<p><b>REVISED DRAFT OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT 
ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><i> The States Parties to the present Protocol</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that <b>the peoples of the United Nations have, in </b>the Charter of the United Nations<b>, </b> 
reaffirm<b>ed</b> <b>their</b> faith in fundamental human rights<b>, </b>in the dignity and worth of the human 
person, <b>and in the equal rights of men and women, and have determined to promote social 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
</b></p>
<p><i> Also noting</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human 
beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights 
and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, <b>[such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property or other 
</b></p>
<p><b>status,] 
</b></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the <b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the </b>International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can 
only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Also recalling</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, in the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action adopted in 1993, reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible 
and interdependent and interrelated, <b>and that the international community must treat human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasis,</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that in order further to achieve the purposes of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (hereinafter referred to as the Covenant) and the 
implementation of its provisions it would be appropriate to enable the Committee on Economic, </p>

</p>
<p>(ii) If a solution within the terms of subparagraph (<i>d</i>) is not reached, the 
Committee shall, in its report, set forth the relevant facts concerning the issue 
between the States Parties concerned. The written submissions and record of 
the oral submissions made by the States Parties concerned shall be attached to 
the report. The Committee may also communicate only to the States Parties 
concerned any views that it may consider relevant to the issue between them.

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><b>EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
</b></p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>1. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to add wording from preambular 
paragraph 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and also to include a 
reference to the equal rights of men and women. 
</p>
<p>2. Paragraph 2: the amendment reflects a proposal to add the list of prohibited grounds of 
discrimination listed in article 2, paragraph 1, of the UDHR. While some States supported the 
initial draft, I believe the amendment would make the text clearer. Given the non-exhaustive 
nature of the list, I believe it would not jeopardize the notion that there might be other grounds 
of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>3. Paragraph 3: the amendment reflects suggestion to include a reference to the UDHR as a 
source of the expression &#8220;freedom from fear and want&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>4. Paragraph 4: the amendment reflects proposal to add wording from the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action (from section I, paragraph 5).   
</p>
<p>5. Paragraph 5: the amendments reflect suggestions to: (a) insert the word &#8220;alleged&#8221; before 
violations; (b) place between brackets &#8220;any of the rights&#8221;, as this wording would need to be 
revised in light of the agreement reached on articles 2 and 3 of the draft; and (c) include a 
reference to the origins of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. With regard 
to the latter, I have done so in a footnote, as I believe this proposal was the most consensual. 
</p>
<p>6. New paragraph 5 bis reflects a proposal to insert such new paragraph to highlight the 
obligation to take steps to the maximum of available resources set out in article 2, paragraph 1, 
of the Covenant.  
</p>
<p>7. One delegate proposed to delete all preambular paragraphs except the last one. This 
proposal did not seem to receive support from the floor. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p>8. Amendments reflect proposals to: (a) bracket &#8220;and to conduct inquiries&#8221; pending an 
agreement on whether the protocol would include such a procedure and (b) to add a paragraph 
with language from the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
rights (ICCPR-OP1),article 1.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p>9. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to: (a) delete the word &#8220;individual&#8221; in the 
title (there would be no need for such reference if, as proposed, article 3 on collective 
communications is deleted); (b) before &#8220;the jurisdiction&#8221;, replace &#8220;subject to&#8221; with &#8220;within&#8221;, 
which is agreed language from the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
Discrimination Against Women (OP&#8211;CEDAW); (c) add &#8220;direct&#8221; before the word &#8220;victims&#8221;; (d) 
add &#8220;significant&#8221; before the word &#8220;violation&#8221;; (e) amend the text in brackets to  read &#8220;Part III 
read in conjunction with provisions contained in Part II of&#8221;; (f) insert &#8220;express&#8221; before the word 
&#8220;consent&#8221;; (g) after &#8220;consent&#8221; add &#8220;&#8230;unless the author can justify acting on their behalf 
without such consent.&#8221;, which is agreed language from OP-CEDAW; (h) insert two new sub-
paragraphs providing for the possibility of granting amicus standing to non-governmental 
organizations (1 bis) and of receiving communications from such organizations (1 ter). 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to proposals (c) and (d) above, it should be noted that the wording proposed 
is not found in any existing communications procedures under the core international human 
rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>11. Paragraph 2: the amendment reflects a proposal to add specific wording requiring a State 
party that has made a declaration under paragraph 2 to reconsider its position after a 10 year 
period. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 3</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Deletion of article 3 was suggested by a number of States. On the basis of the Working 
Group&#8217;s discussions, I believe deletion of this article is justified by: (a) the lack of any clear 
support for this article; (b) the importance of ensuring consistency among United Nations 
human rights instruments to which the notion of collective communications - borrowed from </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the European context - is foreign; (c) the fact pointed out by many delegations that the 
possibility for groups of individuals to submit communications is already covered under article 
</p><p>2.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 4</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to (a) replace &#8220;domestic&#8221; before the word 
&#8220;remedies&#8221; with a specific reference to &#8220;judicial, administrative and other&#8221; and (b) specify that 
&#8220;The requirement of exhausting domestic remedies does not apply when no such remedies have 
been established in national legislation&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>14. Paragraph 2, subparagraph <i>(a)</i>: the amendment reflects proposals to use a more flexible 
deadline. In line with a proposal made by several delegations, I have proposed to use language 
similar to that of article 56, paragraph 6 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
which refers to the submission of communications &#8220;within a reasonable period from the time 
local remedies are exhausted or from the date the Commission is seized of the matter&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>15. Paragraph 2, subparagraph <i>(b)</i>: the amendment reflects the proposal to use agreed 
language of OP-CEDAW article 4, paragraph 2 (e) which would retain the idea that the alleged 
violation in question must have an element of continuity.  
</p>
<p>16. Paragraph 2, subparagraph <i>(c)</i>: the amendments reflect a proposal to (a) replace the word 
&#8220;matter&#8221; with &#8220;violation&#8221; and (b) proposals to specify that the &#8220;procedure of international 
investigation or settlement&#8221; referred to should be equivalent to or of the same nature as that 
under the optional protocol. The proposal which seemed most consensual in that regard was to 
use agreed language from the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), article 31, paragraph 2 (c).  
</p>
<p>17. Paragraph 2, subparagraph <i>(d)</i>: the amendment reflects a proposal to add &#8220;or inconsistent 
with applicable instruments in the field of human rights&#8221;. This is new language which is not 
contained in any other communications procedure, or in the rules of procedure of any of the 
treaty monitoring bodies. I would like to note that this additional criterion might place a 
considerable burden on the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, as it would be </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>required to assess the compatibility of a communication not only with the Covenant, but with 
every single applicable instrument in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>18. Paragraph 2, subparagraph <i>(e)</i>: the amendment reflects proposal to add new wording to 
exclude communications which are dependent mainly on second-hand information.  
</p>
<p>19. During the fourth session of the Working Group, one delegation sought further 
clarification as to the wording proposed for subparagraph <i>(e)</i>. In that regard, I would like to 
note that the language proposed in the first draft is identical to article 4, paragraph 2 (c) of OP-
CEDAW. As is clear from the <i>travaux preparatoires</i> of OP-CEDAW, the criteria relating to 
communications that are &#8220;manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated&#8221; were inspired 
by the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee. In this regard, a report of the Secretary-
General to the Commission on the Status of Women points out that &#8220;Insufficient substantiation 
is not addressed in the ICCPR-OP1 as a criterion of admissibility but is addressed in the rules of 
procedure of the Human Rights Committee. Rule 90 (b) requires, among other admissibility 
criteria, that a claim be submitted &#8216;in a manner sufficiently substantiated&#8217;. The Human Rights 
Committee has noted that &#8216;although an author does not need to prove the alleged violation at 
the admissibility stage, he must submit sufficient evidence substantiating his allegation for 
purposes of admissibility&#8217;. Where a claim is not substantiated for purposes of admissibility, the 
Human Rights Committee has held communications inadmissible under rule 90 (b)&#8221; 
(E/CN.6/1998/7, paragraph 20). 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p>20. The whole article is placed in square brackets, as some States proposed the inclusion of 
the present article in the rules of procedure. Except for OP-CEDAW and ICPPED, no other 
core human rights treaty foresees the possibility of interim measures. 
</p>
<p>21. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to: (a) specify that a request for interim 
measures should only be transmitted &#8220;before any decision on the merits&#8221;; (b) replace &#8220;request&#8221; 
with &#8220;transmit to the State party concerned for its urgent consideration a request&#8221; (I have used 
agreed language from ICPPED, article 31, paragraph 4, which seemed most consensual); (c) 
specify that a request should be made by a victim or victims; (d) add a reference to the 
availability of resources; (e) indicate that interim measures are only necessary in &#8220;exceptional </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>circumstances&#8221;; (f) replace &#8220;possible irreparable damage&#8221; with &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221;; (g) refer to 
&#8220;victims&#8221; in the plural (I have proposed to use the wording &#8220;victim(s)&#8221;, as in rule 108, 
paragraph 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the Committee against Torture); (h) add a reference to 
the need for a  request to be &#8220;based on reliable information&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>22. New paragraph 2 reflects a proposal to add such a paragraph, using agreed language from 
OP-CEDAW, article 5, paragraph 2, to specify that a request for interim measures would not 
imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p>23. One delegation found that inadmissible communications should be sent to the State Party 
concerned. However, except for the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD), existing procedures make it clear that only communications that fulfil specific 
admissibility criteria outlined in the relevant instrument are to be brought to the attention of the 
State party. Article 14, paragraph 6 (a) of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination (ICERD) stipulates that &#8220;The Committee shall confidentially bring any 
communication referred to it to the attention of the State Party alleged to be violating any 
provision of this Convention, but the identity of the individual or groups of individuals 
concerned shall not be revealed without his or their express consent. The Committee shall not 
receive anonymous communications.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>24. Paragraph 1: the amendment reflects a proposal to add language from ICERD,article 14, 
paragraph 6 (a), specifying that the revelation of the identity of the author(s) of a 
communication would require his, her or their express consent. In this regard, I would like to 
note that the knowledge of the identity of the author(s) by the State party would seem essential 
to providing an effective remedy.  Therefore the permanent withholding of the author's identity 
would need to be the exception, and this issue might be left out of the rules of procedure. One 
option could be to require an author expressly to object to the revelation of his/her identity, 
rather than requiring his/her express consent to such a revelation.  
</p>
<p>25. With regard to another suggestion made to establish time limits for the Committee to 
decide on the admissibility and merits of a communication, I would like to note that the rules of </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>procedure of some treaty bodies establish that, in the pre-admissibility stage, they may set time 
limits for the submission of additional information, clarifications and observations &#8220;with a view 
to avoiding undue delay&#8221; (see Committee Against Torture (CAT) rule 108, paragraph 5, Human 
Rights Committee (HRC) rule 91, paragraph 1 and CERD rule 92, paragraph 5). If deadlines 
are not kept either by the State party or by the author, the treaty body may decide the question 
of admissibility &#8220;in light of available information&#8221; (see CAT rule 108, paragraph 6 and CERD 
rule 92, paragraph 6).  
</p>
<p>26. Paragraph 2: the amendment reflects a suggestion to specify that States parties shall also 
submit to the Committee their views on admissibility. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p>27. The whole article is placed in square brackets as some delegations mentioned that the 
friendly settlement of disputes should only be allowed in inter-State disputes. In this regard, I 
would like to note that references to friendly settlement is found in the rules of procedure of 
some treaty bodies, as is for instance the case of the Human Rights Committee, according to 
which &#8220;[T]he Committee shall proceed to make its good offices available to the States parties 
concerned with a view to a friendly resolution of the matter on the basis of respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized in the Covenant.&#8221; (rule 79).   
</p>
<p>28. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to (a) specify that the procedure should 
aim at reaching a settlement &#8220;within a reasonable period of time&#8221;; (b) specify that procedures 
would only be initiated &#8220;where and if the parties concerned wish to settle the matter amicably&#8221; 
(as was noted in the Working Group, this would seem to be implicit in the initial text, since the 
Committee limits itself to making its good offices available); (c) specify that it is the parties 
concerned, and not the Committee, who would determine when the process of reaching a 
friendly settlement had been concluded, or (d) specify that the Committee should be given the 
competence to asses whether a friendly settlement is in conformity with the Covenant.  
</p>
<p>29. Paragraph 2: the amendments reflect a proposal to (a) add language to clarify that no 
communication should be closed before a friendly settlement has been fully implemented and 
(b) replace &#8220;shall be deemed to close&#8221; with &#8220;closes&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30. New paragraphs 3 and 4 reflect proposals to clarify that the Committee is at liberty to end 
the friendly settlement procedure (paragraph 3) and to specify that the Committee should write 
up a report with the terms of any settlement reached (paragraph 4).  
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>
<p>31. Title: the amendment reflects a proposal to use the title &#8220;examination of 
communications&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>32. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to (a) delete the reference to article 3; (b) 
delete the reference to &#8220;by the parties concerned&#8221;; (c) add language from OP-CEDAW, article 
7, paragraph 1, &#8220;provided that this information is transmitted to the parties concerned&#8221;; (d) 
specify that the Committee shall consider only consider a communication after it has been 
declared admissible.  
</p>
<p>33. With regard to (c) above, it should be noted that in the practice of the treaty bodies, all 
information submitted in the context of a specific communication or requested by the treaty 
body is to be made available to both parties (see e.g. CERD rule 94, paragraph 1 and CAT rule 
110,  paragraph 1).  
</p>
<p>34. Paragraph 3 is placed in square brackets since some delegations argued for its deletion. 
Amendments to the paragraph reflect proposals to: (a) replace the word &#8220;shall&#8221; with &#8220;may&#8221;; (b) 
replace &#8220;decisions and recommendations of&#8221; with &#8220;relevant work carried out by&#8221;; (c) replace 
&#8220;as well as bodies belonging to&#8221; with &#8220;and should consult, as appropriate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. Paragraph 4: in revising the text, I have aimed to reflect the various proposals made and 
use the language which seems the most consensual. In particular, the amendments reflect 
proposals to: (a) refer to the tripartite typology of obligations to &#8220;respect, protect and fulfil&#8221; or, 
alternatively, to refer to the obligation to &#8220;realize&#8221; or &#8220;guarantee&#8221;; (b) replace &#8220;will assess&#8221; with 
&#8220;shall address&#8221;; (c) add  &#8220;where and as required&#8221;; (d) refer to the &#8220;unreasonableness&#8221; and/or 
&#8220;effectiveness&#8221; and/or &#8220;adequacy&#8221; of the steps taken; (e) refer to a (broad) margin of 
appreciation of States to determine the optimum use of their resources.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 bis </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>36. In line with a proposal made by several delegations, I have split up article 8, separating 
paragraphs 5-6 into a new article 8 bis under the heading &#8220;Follow-up to the views of the 
Committee&#8221;. This would ensure consistency in the text, since article 11 also deals with the 
&#8220;Follow-up to the inquiry procedure&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>37. Paragraph 1 (previously article 8, paragraph 5): the amendments reflect proposals made 
that met the general agreement of delegations.  
</p>
<p>38. Paragraph 2 (previously article 8, paragraph 6): the amendment reflects a proposal to 
extend the deadline referred to in this paragraph.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p>39. The article is placed in square brackets as some delegations suggested its deletion. 
ICCPR, ICERD, CAT and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
</p>
<p>Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) all include inter-State procedures. 
However, as of 1 November 2007, these had never been used. The current draft requires States 
to opt in to this procedure, thus enabling those States that wish to subject themselves to the 
procedure to do so, while respecting the views of other States that might not wish to do so. 
</p>
<p><b>Articles 10 and 11  
</b></p>
<p>40. The articles are placed in square brackets as some delegations argued for their deletion.  
</p>
<p>41. Article 10, paragraph 1: Square brackets reflect a concern expressed by some delegates 
about the expression &#8220;grave or systematic&#8221; violations. It should be noted that this is language 
similar to that contained in OP-CEDAW, article 8, paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 10, paragraph 6: the amendment reflects a suggestion to add &#8220;provided for in 
article 15.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>Article 11 <i>bis</i>  
</b></p>
<p>43. In line with a suggestion made by a number of delegates, former article 20 (The 
Committee&#8217;s competence regarding the inquiry procedure) has been moved up and is now 
proposed as article 11 bis, in order to make it clearer that the inquiry procedure is optional. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Article 12 
</b></p>
<p>44. The amendments reflect a number of proposals which seemed to meet general agreement.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 13 
</b></p>
<p>45. At the fourth session of the Working Group, arguments were made for and against 
merging articles 13 and 14. I suggest keeping the two provisions separate as I believe that 
substantively they address different subjects. 
</p>
<p>46. Paragraph 1: the amendments reflect proposals to (a) clarify that States parties should 
consent to the transmittal of any information concerning a need for international assistance; (b) 
clarify that such information could also be sent to other State parties; and (c) add &#8220;financial&#8221; 
before the word &#8220;assistance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>47. Paragraph 2: the amendments reflect proposals to (a) add a reference to States and (b) 
delete &#8220;each within its field of competence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 14 
</b></p>
<p>48. Title and paragraph 1: following a proposal by several delegations, I have deleted 
reference to &#8220;special&#8221; before the word fund. Instead, I propose to refer to &#8220;trust fund&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>49. Paragraph 1: the other amendment reflects a proposal to use the wording &#8220;in accordance 
with the relevant procedures of the General Assembly&#8221;, as in article 26 of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT), rather than &#8220;by decision of the General 
Assembly&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>50. Paragraph 2: following several interventions on the financing of the fund, I suggest 
deleting this paragraph. There will thus be no references to &#8220;special&#8221; and &#8220;voluntary 
contributions&#8221;. Rather, the matter is left to the general financial rules and regulations of the 
United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 15 </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51. A proposal made by one delegation to put the language of this provision more in line with 
article 24 of CAT was included in the revised draft. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 16 
</b></p>
<p>52. The amendments reflect proposals to (a) replace &#8220;undertakes&#8221; with &#8220;is encouraged&#8221; and 
(b) to further specify the meaning of &#8220;accessible formats&#8221;. With regard to the latter proposal, I 
would like to note that this is an expressions entrenched in the human rights vocabulary. It 
relates, as was mentioned during the Working Group&#8217;s discussions, to formats that can be read 
by blind, deaf-blind, and vision-impaired people (e.g. braille, audio, electronic text, large print, 
and tactile diagrams). If the Working Group considers that further clarification would be 
helpful, I have proposed &#8220;for people with disabilities who do not read conventional print&#8221;. 
Another delegation suggested deleting the whole reference to accessible formats, and I have 
therefore placed it in brackets. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 17 
</b></p>
<p>53. Suggestions were made to retain or delete this article. Moreover, one delegate proposed 
new text indicating that the rules of procedure should be adopted by the States parties at the 
first conference of States parties.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 18 
</b></p>
<p>54. No comments were made on this draft article. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 19 
</b></p>
<p>55. Paragraph 1: the amendment reflects a proposal to increase the number of necessary 
ratifications or accessions for the entry into force of the optional protocol.  
</p>
<p>56. Paragraph 2: the amendment reflects a proposal to add &#8220;or acceding to&#8221; after &#8220;ratifying&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Article 20 
</b></p>
<p>57. This paragraph was moved up and has now become article 11bis.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/WG.4/2 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Article 21 
</b></p>
<p>58. This article is kept between brackets. Some delegations argued that a final decision on the 
question of reservations would depend on the decision on the scope of the proposed protocol 
under article 2.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 22 
</b></p>
<p>59. No comments were made on this draft article. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 23 
</b></p>
<p>60. Since no delegation supported the maintenance of this provision and several delegations 
asked for its deletion, I propose its deletion.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 24 
</b></p>
<p>61. Paragraph 2: the amendment reflects a proposal to add &#8220;10 and 11&#8221; after &#8220;9&#8221;. This 
proposal is therefore included in the text.  
</p>
<p><b>Articles 25 and 26
