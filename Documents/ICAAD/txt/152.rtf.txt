IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
(AT SUVA)

CIVIL APPEAL NO. HBA 8 OF 2000

Between:

MUKESH CHAND
Appellant

and

MOHINI LATA CHAND
Respondent

Appellant in person
Ms. S. Tabaiwalu for the Respondent

JUDGMENT

A divorce has now been granted. The maintenance order therefore lapses. However the arrears are still to be paid. No material has been placed before me to justify a variation of the original order made. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.
