<i>Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration

<p>and Programme of Action, and recalling the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the

</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 44/82 of 8 December 1989, 47/237 of 20 
September 1993, 50/142 of 21 December 1995, 52/81 of 12 December 1997, 54/124 of 17

</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the preparations for and observance of the twentieth anniversary of

<p> 
</p>

<p>programmes as part of an integrated comprehensive approach to human rights and

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that States have the primary responsibility to promote and protect the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings, including women, children 
and older persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing and 
protection of children and that children, for the full and harmonious development of their 
personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, 
love and understanding,  
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural 
environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, 
should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its 
responsibilities within the community,

is entitled to protection by society and the State,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-seventh session, a panel discussion on the 
protection of the family and its members to address the implementation of States&#8217; 
obligations under relevant provisions of international human rights law and to discuss 
challenges and best practices in this regard; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to liaise 
with States and all stakeholders, including the relevant United Nations bodies, agencies, 
and programmes, the treaty bodies, the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, 
national human rights institutions and civil society, with a view to ensuring their 
participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the panel 
discussion in the form of a summary, and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-eighth session; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
