<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with resolution 39/5 of 
31 March 1995 of the Commission on the Status of Women, resolution 1997/43 of 
11 April 1997 of the Commission on Human Rights, and resolution 6/30 of 
14 December 2007 of the Human Rights Council. A joint workplan has been 
prepared annually by the Division for the Advancement of Women of the Secretariat, 
now part of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
Women (UN Women), and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR). The workplan for 2010 is contained in document 
A/HRC/13/70-E/CN.6/2010/7. 
</p>
<p>2. Cooperation between OHCHR and the Division for the Advancement of 
Women continued in 2010, with the goal of achieving equality between women and 
men and the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s human rights. The major 
activities that were carried out jointly in 2010 are outlined below (see sect. II), as 
are plans for the future, taking into account the establishment of UN Women by the 
General Assembly (see sect. III). 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Review of the implementation of the joint workplan  
for 2010 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. During the implementation of the current joint workplan, the exchange of 
information continued between OHCHR, the Office of the Special Adviser on 
Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, now part of UN Women, and the 
Division for the Advancement of Women, now part of UN Women. The Division and 
OHCHR continued to cooperate within the framework of inter-agency mechanisms, 
especially the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, under the 
leadership of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women. 
The Division and OHCHR participated in the ninth session of the Inter-Agency 
Network on Women and Gender Equality from 23 to 25 February 2010 in New York. 
Both entities participated in several of the task forces of the Network, including its 
Task Force on Violence against Women, co-convened by the Division and the 
United Nations Population Fund, and the Task Force on Women and Peace and 
Security, chaired by the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of 
Women. OHCHR also contributed to the inventory of activities of the United 
Nations system on violence against women, compiled twice yearly by the Division 
as part of the activities of the Task Force on Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p>4. Both entities continued to participate in the Inter-Agency Cooperation Group 
against Trafficking in Persons, chaired by the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, as well as in decision-making concerning grants by the United Nations Trust 
Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women. The Division and 
OHCHR also continued collaboration within the context of the Executive 
Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, specifically in the cluster on the 
advancement of women, which is co-convened by the Division for the Advancement 
of Women and the Economic Commission for Africa.  
</p>
<p>5. An OHCHR staff member participated in an expert group meeting on good 
practices in national action plans on violence against women in Port of Spain, from 
13 to 15 September 2010, co-organized by the Division for the Advancement of </p>

</b></p>
<p>Women and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 
(ECLAC)/subregional headquarters for the Caribbean. The expert group meeting 
was part of the ongoing work of the Division to develop tools for stakeholders to 
address violence against women, and based on the outcome of the meeting, the 
Division will prepare a guide containing a model framework for national action 
plans on violence against women.  
</p>
<p>6. The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR continued to 
support the work of human rights treaty bodies and implementation of the major 
international human rights instruments, including through exchange of information 
and dissemination of information about the human rights treaty system. The Special 
Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women addressed the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 29 July 2010 at its forty-sixth 
session. The Division provided inputs in connection with the preparation by the 
Committee of a general recommendation on older women, which was finalized and 
adopted by the Committee on 19 October 2010. In celebration of the thirtieth 
anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, OHCHR organized an event focusing on how the 
Convention has been a force for change in women&#8217;s lives globally. The Division for 
the Advancement of Women participated in this event, during which the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights paid tribute to the Division for its 
excellent work in promoting and facilitating the implementation of the Convention 
during the past 30 years. 
</p>
<p>7. The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR continued to 
update their databases and websites. The Division continued to enhance its website 
in relation to violence against women, which includes the work of the Human Rights 
Council, including its resolutions on the elimination of discrimination against 
women, the elimination of violence against women, and trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children; work of the special procedures mandate holders; the 
universal periodic review; and reports of OHCHR to the Council. In its quarterly 
newsletters on violence against women, the Division included information on 
resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council, work of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and events organized by OHCHR on 
violence against women, including trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR and the Division for the Advancement of Women convened a number 
of meetings, including training seminars and other capacity-building activities, to 
support implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Violence against Women and other human rights treaties, including with respect to 
the preparation of reports and follow-up to concluding observations at the national 
level. The Division supported the convening of workshops in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Liberia 
and the United Republic of Tanzania. It continued its multiphased support to the 
Government of Liberia to strengthen capacity for the implementation of the 
Convention and held a round-table discussion on articles 1 and 2 of the Convention 
in June 2010. The Division continued to support the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in 
the preparation of its initial to fourth periodic report to the Committee, and it 
organized a drafter&#8217;s workshop in February 2010 and a workshop in May 2010. In 
October 2010, a workshop was held to support the Government of the United 
Republic of Tanzania on the implementation of the concluding observations of the 
Committee. The full involvement and support of OHCHR was sought in connection </p>

</b></p>
<p>with all of the Division workshops on reporting under and implementation of the 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>9. The Division for the Advancement of Women continued its interaction with 
special procedures mandate holders. In particular, the Division maintained contact 
with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, in the follow-up to the Secretary-General&#8217;s in-depth study on all 
forms of violence against women (A/61/122 and Add.1 and Corr.1) and General 
Assembly resolutions 61/143, 62/133, 63/155 and 64/137 on the intensification of 
efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women. In addition, OHCHR and 
the Division continued to exchange information in relation to the work of the 
Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>10. Collaboration in support of intergovernmental bodies continued. In March 
2010, the Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences addressed the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-
fourth session. In February 2010, OHCHR moderated an online discussion on the 
theme &#8220;Women and human rights&#8221; as part of a series of United Nations discussions 
to contribute to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission on the Status of Women 
and the 15-year review of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and 
Platform for Action.1 OHCHR staff participated in parallel events to the fifty-fourth 
session of the Commission on the Status of Women, such as an event on 
discriminatory laws, organized by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In October 2010, 
the new Executive Director of UN Women, the Vice-Chair of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences addressed the Third 
Committee of the General Assembly during the introduction of the agenda item on 
advancement of women. 
</p>
<p>11. Coordination of the preparation of reports to be submitted to 
intergovernmental bodies continued. OHCHR provided inputs to the reports of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of and assistance to Palestinian women 
(E/CN.6/2010/4), and on ending female genital mutilation (E/CN.6/2010/6), which 
were submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-fourth session. 
The Division provided inputs to the thematic study of OHCHR on discrimination 
against women, in law and practice, and how the issue is addressed throughout the 
United Nations human rights system (see A/HRC/15/40), which was submitted to 
the Human Rights Council at its fifteenth session; and the report on good practices 
in efforts aimed at preventing violence against women, which is under preparation 
by OHCHR pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 14/12. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> III. Future cooperation, in the light of the establishment  
of UN Women 
</b> 
 
</p>

<p>of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, 
the Division for the Advancement of Women, the United Nations Development Fund 
for Women and the International Research and Training Institute for the 
Advancement of Women, with the additional role of leading, coordinating and

equality and women&#8217;s empowerment. UN Women is to be operational 1 January 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>13. UN Women is in the process of developing its future strategy, including its 
coordination role within the United Nations system. The strategy will align with the 
founding resolution. It will focus on expanding support to Member States at the 
national level, in line with national priorities; strengthening coherence between the 
normative support provided to global intergovernmental processes and the technical 
and thematic advice provided to national partners at the country level; and 
strengthening leadership, coordination and accountability on gender equality and 
women&#8217;s empowerment and support to gender mainstreaming across the United

</p>
<p>14. The realization of women&#8217;s human rights will be an essential part of the vision 
and future strategy of UN Women. Cooperation between UN Women and OHCHR 
will continue and will be strengthened under a mutually agreed broad strategic 
framework of cooperation, including in connection with intergovernmental and 
expert bodies and special procedures, capacity-building activities, awareness-raising 
on women&#8217;s human rights, gender mainstreaming and inter-agency initiatives, such 
as the Global Migration Group currently chaired by OHCHR, UN Action against 
Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender 
Equality and the Inter-Agency Cooperation Group against Trafficking in Persons. 
Specific areas of focus will include support for implementation of the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and follow-up to 
the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations, particularly at the national level; the 
universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council; the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences; and the newly established 
Working Group of the Human Rights Council on discrimination against women in 
law and in practice. Common thematic priority areas include human rights of 
women; violence against women; trafficking in persons; discriminatory laws, 
including with respect to economic, social and cultural rights; women, peace and 
security; and global migration. 
</p>
<p>15. In the upcoming months, UN Women and OHCHR will elaborate further the 
framework and details in respect of their cooperation. The results will be reported to 
the Commission at its fifty-sixth session in the joint workplan for the period 2011-
</p><p>2012.
