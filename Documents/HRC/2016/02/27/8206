<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The present report contains an analysis of the progress made in implementing the 
recommendations made by the former Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, following his visit to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo from 5 to 15 October 2009 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3). During his visit, the previous 
mandate holder documented widespread extrajudicial killings by armed groups and the 
Congolese army in the Kivu provinces and Province Orientale, political killings and deaths 
in prisons. In addition, he investigated cases of sexual violence leading to death, killings of 
human rights defenders and journalists, and vigilante killings, including of suspected 
&#8213;witches&#8214;. He concluded that impunity was rampant for all forms of killings. 
</p>
<p> Within the period under review, the Government has taken some steps to fight 
impunity, as well as some initial measures to address the grave situation of prisons. The 
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and other international actors have implemented a number of the recommendations, 
aimed at strengthening the protection of civilians and fighting impunity at the international 
level. 
</p>
<p> However, the real impact of those measures on the right to life of the local 
population and its protection is still very limited. Extrajudicial killings remain widespread 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 17/5, the Human Rights Council urged States to, 
inter alia, cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions in the performance of his tasks, supply all necessary information 
requested by him, and ensure appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and 
conclusions formulated by him, including by providing information on the actions taken on 
those recommendations  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur shares the views of the previous mandate holder on the 
importance of follow-up reports as essential elements of his work after the conduct of 
country visits and the formulation of recommendations on ensuring respect for the right to 
life. Follow-up reports offer the opportunity to assess the progress made in respecting the 
right to life and the status of implementation of the respective recommendations within a 
certain time frame, thus ensuring continuity in the efforts to uphold human rights in the 
country visited. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with the established practice,1 the present report concerns the follow-
up to the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder regarding his visit to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2009.  
</p>
<p>4. The report was prepared on the basis of all available information. The Special 
Rapporteur requested information from the Government and other actors on the measures 
that had been taken to implement the recommendations formulated by his predecessor. 
Information on the non-implementation of recommendations was also sought. Further 
information was gathered on the current situation concerning extrajudicial executions in the 
country, including on the extent to which the situation has improved, deteriorated or 
remained static since the visit took place.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to all stakeholders who contributed 
to the preparation of the present report. He regrets that the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo was not able to follow up on his request and provide information on 
measures undertaken to implement the recommendations made by his predecessor.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>6. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur analyses the steps taken by the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo to implement the recommendations made by his 
predecessor, following his visit to the country from 5 to 15 October 2009. The conclusions 
of the visit and the recommendations thereof were contained in the mission report, 
submitted to the Human Rights Council at its fourteenth session (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>7. The mission report revealed a very worrying level of violations of the right to life, in 
particular in the following areas: the numerous extrajudicial executions of civilians in 
separate conflicts in the Kivu Provinces and Province Orientale, both by rebel groups and 
Government forces; political killings; deaths in prison; killings of human rights defenders 
and journalists; and sorcery-related and vigilante killings. The previous mandate holder 
concluded that impunity was rampant, and put forward a series of recommendations to 
redress violations and fight impunity in the areas mentioned.  
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1 In 2006, the previous mandate holder initiated the practice of preparing follow-up reports on country 
</p>
<p>visits to assess the extent to which States implement the recommendations contained in the mission 
reports. The practice has been followed by the Special Rapporteur on a regular basis. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur notes that the context of the period under review has been 
influenced by several developments. Among them is the Security Council&#8216;s decision, in its 
resolution 1925 (2010), that the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (MONUC) would, as of 1 July 2010, bear the title of the United 
Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUSCO). The mandate of the Mission focuses, in order of priority, on the protection 
of civilians and on stabilization and peace consolidation.2 
</p>
<p>9. Chapter VIII of the present report deals with the fight against impunity as crucial to 
bringing to justice all those responsible for unlawful killings in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. Consequently, other chapters will not address the issue.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Extrajudicial executions in the Kivu provinces 
</b></p>
<p>10. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder established that several hundred 
civilians had been killed in the context of the conflict in the Kivu provinces. Rebel groups, 
in particular the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda (FDLR), as well as the 
Government forces, committed unlawful killings. The previous mandate holder emphasized 
that the measures taken by the Government and MONUC to protect civilians were 
insufficient. He put forward recommendations to a number of actors, aimed at reducing 
killings and protecting civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Current situation of extrajudicial killings in the Kivu provinces 
</b></p>
<p>11. The current situation of human rights abuses, including of the right to life, remains 
of grave concern in North Kivu and South Kivu. During the period under review, civilians 
continued to be killed and subjected to other serious human rights violations, in particular 
mass rapes. Both sides of the conflict, that is, various rebel groups and the Forces arm&#233;es de 
la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC), continue to attack civilians, with cases 
resulting in a considerable number of deaths.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of civilians in the context of killings by FDLR 
</b></p>
<p>12. With respect to FDLR activities in the Kivu provinces, brutal attacks against 
civilians continue to be committed. The attacks against civilians registered in 2010 3 
followed a pattern of reprisals similar to the one described in the mission report 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, paras. 13-15). A reduction in the scale of deadly attacks was 
observed during 2011, where the main trend consisted in committing other types of grave 
human rights abuses. Despite reports of weakened FDLR capacities, the recent massacre in 
Shabunda territory, South Kivu, where suspected FDLR combatants killed an estimated 45 
people between 1 and 4 January 2012,4 raised concerns over the renewed activity of the 
FDLR and its strategy of mass killings of civilians as a means of intimidation.  
</p>
<p>13. In 2010, the previous mandate holder called upon FDLR commanders to 
immediately issue orders to their soldiers to comply with human rights and humanitarian 
law at all times. The Special Rapporteur concludes that no serious steps were taken to 
implement that recommendation. On the contrary, FDLR continues to kill, abduct, rape, 
loot and commit other grave human rights abuses against civilians in the Kivu provinces. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 2 In its resolution 1991 (2011), the Security Council extended the MONUSCO mandate until 30 June 
</p>
<p>2012. 
 3 See, for instance, Human Rights Watch,<i> World Report 2011</i> (New York, 2011), pp. 103-110, 
</p>
<p>available from www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/wr2011.pdf. 
 4 See the report of the Secretary-General on MONUSCO (S/2012/65), para. 24. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation of his predecessor that FDLR 
commanders take steps to ensure compliance with human rights and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>14. The previous mandate holder also pointed out that, while FDLR bore direct 
responsibility for the killings, that did not relieve the Government and MONUC of their 
international obligations to protect civilians and plan military operations to minimize the 
loss of civilian life&#8212;obligations they did not sufficiently fulfil within the Kimia II military 
operation (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, para. 20). 
</p>
<p>15. In this context, another military operation, Amani Leo, was launched against rebel 
forces in North and South Kivu on 1 January 2010. It was led by FARDC with 
MONUC/MONUSCO support, and follows the Kimia II operation. The main goals of the 
Amani Leo operation were to protect civilians and eliminate the threat of FDLR and other 
armed groups in North and South Kivu. Separate military operations were also conducted 
by FARDC and by MONUC/MONUSCO during the period under review.5 
</p>
<p>16. The current level of protection of civilians remains inadequate, as evidenced by the 
frequency and intensity of the attacks against them. The Special Rapporteur gives due 
consideration to the difficulties relating to terrain and inaccessibility of villages, as well as 
to resource constraints. He further notes the critical shortage of military utility helicopters 
and a lack of attack helicopters within MONUSCO in 2011.  
</p>
<p>17. However, such constraints do not remove the responsibility incumbent upon the 
Government to secure the right to life of individuals in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. The Special Rapporteur believes that efforts need to be critically stepped up in 
terms of military planning, in particular by FARDC. The most vivid example is illustrated 
by the transfer of FARDC soldiers to training centres during the FARDC reconfiguration 
process in 2011. During these transfers, entire areas in the Kivu provinces were temporarily 
left without effective military control, resulting in increased vulnerability of civilians to 
attacks and the regaining of positions by FDLR and other armed groups.6 The Special 
Rapporteur was also particularly concerned about information regarding poor 
communication to MONUSCO of these FARDC movements, which further diminished 
opportunities to protect several areas and deepened the level of exposure of civilians to 
FDLR attacks. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Killings of civilians by the Congolese Armed Forces 
</b></p>
<p>18. In the period under review, civilians in the Kivu provinces continued to be attacked 
and killed by FARDC, notably by its former Congr&#232;s national pour la d&#233;fense du peuple 
(CNDP) elements. At least 105 civilians were reported to have been killed in Masisi 
Territory in 2011, where integrated former CNDP troops conducted unilateral operations 
against FDLR and its allies.7 Patterns of accusing the local population of supporting the 
other side of the conflict, as well as opportunistic killings, have been reported.  
</p>
<p>19. The previous mandate holder identified the poorly planned and accelerated 
integration of CNDP troops, known for human rights atrocities, into the regular armed 
forces as one of the most important causes of the killings committed by FARDC 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, p. 2). This process of integration led to the creation of an unclear, 
parallel chain of command within FARDC, with former CNDP fighters largely continuing 
to respond to their former commanders, thus creating a context for indiscipline and further

</b></p>
<p>human rights abuses. According to the latest information received, the parallel chain of 
command was further reinforced during the period under review. 
</p>
<p>20. In an attempt to foster the integration process, the Congolese authorities launched 
the so-called process of regimentation of FARDC, as part of the Armed Forces reform 
announced in January 2010. The process of regimentation started in January 2011 and 
ended in the last quarter of that year. It was aimed at the reconfiguration of the Armed 
Forces and redistribution of the soldiers to other units after completion of a training course. 
A number of command positions created as part of the process were offered to former 
CNDP commanders. However, the positive results of the regimentation are regrettably very 
limited, and it may even lead to a further strengthening of the parallel command structure. 
A number of former CNDP elements reportedly continue to maintain the parallel chain of 
command, while others have resisted orders to redeploy outside their current areas of 
operation. Of major concern are reports that most integrated former CNDP elements remain 
in operation in areas in the Kivu provinces, where they previously committed grave human 
rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>21. These effects have a negative impact not only on the prevention of future human 
rights abuses by FARDC, but also on the fight against impunity. Various actors who 
contributed to the present report referred to the difficulty of carrying out investigations, in 
particular in the Masisi region, as a result of the parallel administration. Additionally, the 
local population reportedly encounters difficulties in identifying the new soldiers 
redeployed to their regions.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur also notes the calls from the Security Council and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish an adequate vetting 
mechanism to ensure that those responsible for grave human rights violations are removed 
from the army and are not permitted into the chain of command (A/HRC/19/48, para. 56). 
During the universal periodic review, the Government committed to proceed with the 
establishment of such a mechanism (A/HRC/13/8, para. 94.44); however, no measures have 
been reported to date. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the recommendation and 
emphasizes the urgency of establishing a vetting mechanism, and calls upon the Congolese 
authorities to take all necessary steps in this direction.  
</p>
<p>23. Regarding the identification of the soldiers committing abuses, the former mandate 
holder recommended that all FARDC soldiers should be provided with, and be required to 
wear, uniforms that identify their name and relevant unit. Furthermore, he recommended 
that the Security Council make this a precondition for United Nations assistance to the 
Congolese military operations.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the distribution to FARDC soldiers of a 
new uniform, with Velcro strips for attaching name tags, took place in 2010. However, the 
uniforms were not distributed to all soldiers, and the extent to which tags have been 
distributed to troops in the Kivu provinces is unclear. Moreover, the tags may be easily 
removed by the soldiers wearing them. Additional reports indicate that a number of soldiers 
refuse to wear tags, arguing that the tags do not reflect their new positions. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that this recommendation should be fully implemented. 
</p>
<p>25. Using tags with the soldier&#8216;s name and unit is currently not a precondition for 
MONUSCO support to FARDC battalions. The Security Council has not transformed this 
requirement into a precondition. Furthermore, the Standard Operating Procedures on 
MONUSCO Protection Mechanisms and Procedures for the Proposition of Support to the 
FARDC and the PNC [Congolese National Police], specifying these conditions, do not 
contain a reference to name and unit tags. Bearing in mind the current level of human rights 
violations committed by FARDC soldiers and the fact that the FARDC process to integrate 
various former rebel groups is ongoing, the Special Rapporteur considers that the obligation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>to wear uniforms with name and unit tags should be incorporated into the Standard 
Operating Procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The role of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>26. The previous mandate holder established that FARDC units had been receiving 
MONUC support, including in cases of reported human rights violations by its battalions 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, para. 36). He formulated several recommendations on the duty of 
MONUC to base its support activities on a strong conditionality policy towards FARDC, 
requiring full adherence to international human rights and humanitarian law. The policy 
would be coupled with monitoring, investigation and reporting actions on allegations of 
human rights violations committed by FARDC. The Special Rapporteur notes that these 
recommendations, while designed to address primarily the situation in the Kivu provinces, 
can be and have been applied to the entire country.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. MONUSCO conditionality policy 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur notes that MONUC drafted a conditionality policy paper 
late in 2009, and that steps have been taken to adhere to it. As stated by the Security 
Council in its resolutions 1906 (2009), 1925 (2010) and 1991 (2011), MONUSCO, like 
MONUC before it, is required to participate in or support only those operations that fully 
comply with international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, and only operations 
that are jointly planned. Screening of the FARDC battalions is conducted before logistical 
or other support is delivered. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, over the course of 
2011, MONUSCO support to three FARDC battalions was suspended. Still, challenges 
have been identified in monitoring the conduct of FARDC units on the ground and in 
securing the removal of problematic FARDC officers from the wider chain of command, in 
particular in North Kivu.8 
</p>
<p>28. The MONUSCO policy regarding support to FARDC and the fact that such support 
is governed by conditions have been laid out and referred to in United Nations public 
documents. However, the population remains uninformed as regards the object and content 
of the policy, as MONUC/MONUSCO has not organized a communication campaign 
explicitly aimed at informing it thereof. Meanwhile, other awareness campaigns have been 
conducted, focusing on key stakeholders such as FARDC.  
</p>
<p>29. The former mandate holder also suggested that steps taken under the conditionality 
policy be made public. The reports submitted by the Secretary-General to the Security 
Council regularly contain information on steps taken by the Mission in the application of 
the policy, but vary in their degree of detail. However, measures taken to exclude or 
suspend certain FARDC units from support are explicitly communicated to the media only 
in certain emblematic cases, for example, the suspension of MONUC support to the 
FARDC 213 brigade following what has often been referred to as the &#8213;Lukweti massacre&#8214; 
</p>
<p>of 2009. The publication of such information should be done in all cases. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Investigating, monitoring and reporting on human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>30. With regard to the recommendations relating to the investigation and monitoring of 
human rights, the Special Rapporteur notes that the United Nations Joint Human Rights 
</p>

<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, available from

</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Office (UNJHRO) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo contributes to the independent 
monitoring and investigation of human rights violations. The UNJHRO field offices 
continually monitor and verify allegations of human rights violations, including those 
implicating FARDC units supported by MONUSCO. The investigations are carried out in 
accordance with United Nations standards on human rights investigations, including 
independence and impartiality. If the circumstances so require, UNJHRO provides support 
to the Congolese judicial authorities to investigate allegations of grave human rights 
violations committed by FARDC or armed groups. UNJHRO regularly reports on 
violations committed by FARDC and it has also published reports on the outcome of 
special investigations.9 UNJHRO has also taken important measures to make its human 
rights reports public within a reasonable time period after investigations take place, and 
publishes regular human rights situation updates. Meanwhile, several representatives of the 
local civil society expressed to the Special Rapporteur their wish that MONUSCO 
cooperate to a greater extent with local organizations engaged in activities in the field. 
</p>
<p>31. Follow-up was ensured, in particular, in relation to the recommendation on the 
release of the results of the United Nations mapping project investigations in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. In October 2010, the United Nations published its 
&#8213;Report of the mapping exercise documenting the most serious violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>and international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003&#8214;.10 Documenting over 600 
cases, the report concluded with an observation of the severely limited capacity of the 
Congolese justice system to bring an end to impunity in respect of the crimes identified. It 
contained a series of recommendations for the Congolese authorities, including on the 
establishment of judicial and truth-seeking mechanisms, institutional reform and 
reparations for victims. The Special Rapporteur stresses that the implementation of these 
recommendations is crucial for delivering justice to the victims of the abuses, and calls 
upon the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to take all necessary 
measures in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Extrajudicial executions in Province Orientale 
</b></p>
<p>32. In the mission report, the previous mandate holder concluded that numerous 
extrajudicial executions in Province Orientale occurred as a consequence of the brutal 
attacks on civilians by the Lord&#8216;s Resistance Army (LRA) and, to a considerably smaller 
extent, abuses by FARDC. He formulated a series of recommendations aimed at protecting 
civilians in a context where he considered the LRA to present a continuing serious threat to 
Province Orientale, as well as to the region generally.  
</p>
<p>33. During the period under review, the LRA continued to pose a serious security threat 
to civilians in the Province Orientale, including in terms of the right to life. Moreover, the 
activities of several domestic militias further contribute to the current insecurity in the area, 
in parallel to the activity of the LRA. Several recent reports suggest that the LRA has 
fragmented into several highly mobile groups as a consequence of military operations,11

Walikale Territory, North Kivu. In July 2011, UNJHRO published a report on the aforementioned 
human rights violations in Walikale and another one on human rights violations, including mass 
rapes, committed in Bushani and Kalambahiro, Masisi Territory, North Kivu, on 31 December 2010 
and 1 January 2011.

</p>
<p>which weakened its capacity. By all accounts, however, the impact of these operations on 
the protection of civilians against the LRA has been limited. The LRA continues to stage 
well-planned, sudden and very brutal attacks. For the period between January and August 
2011, for instance, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs received 254 
reports of attacks on civilians, resulting in 125 deaths and 368 persons abducted; an 
estimated 440,000 persons were internally displaced or living as refugees.12 One of the 
worst massacres within the period under review took place in the Makombo area, Haut U&#233;l&#233; 
District, in December 2009, where the LRA killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 
others, including at least 80 children.13  
</p>
<p>34. One of the main recommendations of the previous mandate holder was that the 
military presence of the Government and MONUC, as well as their ability to respond to the 
LRA attacks, should be strengthened. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the current 
military presence of MONUSCO in Province Orientale is concentrated in the Haut U&#233;l&#233; 
District, where the LRA is reported to occupy a zone of 20,000 km&#178;. Since June 2010, there 
has been a stable presence of one battalion, including Guatemalan Special Forces. As of 
November 2011, this presence comprised about 1,200 troops (S/2011/693, para. 42). 
</p>
<p>35. The frequency of MONUSCO operations has increased during the period under 
review. The Special Rapporteur was informed that during the past year, about 20 joint 
operations with FARDC were conducted against the LRA, broadly in the framework of 
Operation Rudia II. Following the LRA massacres that took place in December 2008 and 
December 2009, and with the aim of preventing their repetition, MONUSCO launched a 
unilateral operation in December 2010 to ensure the protection of civilians during the end-
of-year period. This was replicated in December 2011 with a joint MONUSCO-FARDC 
operation code-named &#8213;Santa Claus&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur considers that the conduct of the end-of-year operations 
played a crucial role in ensuring the protection of civilians in a period of high risk of attack 
from the LRA. He commends this initiative and calls upon MONUSCO to replicate it. 
Meanwhile, he believes that the positive consequences of these operations reaffirm the 
conclusions of his predecessor on the need to increase military presence on the ground in 
order to deter LRA attacks and ensure a high capacity of response.  
</p>
<p>37. With respect to the series of recommendations on establishing community-based 
communications networks and improving community outreach with the aim of receiving 
and responding quickly to warnings of LRA attacks on the civilian population, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that MONUSCO has set up a Community Alert Network (CAN) 
project as a follow-up to Security Council resolution 1925 (2010). Within the project, focal 
points within remote communities in the Orientale and Kivu provinces are equipped with 
communication devices for contacting MONUSCO in case of a security threat. These 
threats are then responded to in coordination with the Congolese security forces. Measures 
have been taken to ensure the safety of the focal points. Currently, around 225 villages are 
covered by the project. During the second phase of implementation, scheduled for the first 
quarter of 2012, CANs are to be established in additional areas of Haut U&#233;l&#233; and Ituri 
Districts. MONUSCO is also collaborating with the United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) and Vodacom on a project to extend mobile network coverage in 
the Haut U&#233;l&#233; District. 
</p>
<p>38. The establishment of CANs is accompanied by joint visits by representatives of the 
MONUSCO Civil Affairs Section and the MONUSCO Force to the zones covered by the 
project. These visits are reportedly aimed at informing the population and the local 
</p>

<p>authorities about the project and the role of MONUSCO therein, and at inviting them to 
participate. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes meanwhile that no CAN has been established in the 
Bas U&#233;l&#233; District, The explanation provided is that it is not possible to establish a CAN in 
the absence of a military presence in Haut U&#233;l&#233;, as the Force must be able to react within 
one hour of the alert. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these communication-related steps, 
but invites MONUSCO to further intensify and expand them. 
</p>
<p>40. At the level of regional efforts to combat the LRA, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that, after holding two Ministerial Meetings, in October 2010 and June 2011, the 
African Union launched the Regional Cooperation Initiative for the Elimination of the 
LRA. Under the initiative, operational coordination and joint border patrols between 
affected countries are to be facilitated, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid to the 
affected population. Measures will be taken to establish a regional task force of brigade size 
(5,000 troops), composed of units provided by the affected countries. In addition, the 
United States of America has deployed about 100 soldiers as advisors in the region in order 
to tackle the LRA threat.  
</p>
<p>41. The recommendation of the previous mandate holder relating to necessary regional 
efforts focused also on the need to establish measures to facilitate desertions from the LRA. 
The Special Rapporteur notes that a constant effort is being made to repatriate foreign LRA 
combatants and to demobilize Congolese children associated with the LRA. However, no 
formal programme to demobilize and reintegrate adult LRA combatants has been 
implemented, due, inter alia, to a lack of funding.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Extrajudicial executions in the context of the socio-political 
situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>42. The 2009 mission revealed that politically motivated human rights abuses, including 
killings of opposition supporters, constituted a serious problem that received only minor 
attention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hundreds of civilians were killed in 
2007 and 2008 for election-related and political reasons, in particular by security forces. 
The former mandate holder warned of a very high risk of further violence during the next 
election period if urgent steps were not taken. He invited MONUC and the international 
community to give serious consideration to that risk, closely monitor the situation and put 
in place contingencies for civilian protection. In addition, steps were recommended for the 
reform of the security forces and closure of all detention facilities operating outside the law 
and not subjected to judicial scrutiny. Finally, the previous mandate holder drew attention 
to the killings of human rights defenders and journalists as a result of their work on human 
rights violations and impunity issues (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, paras. 92-93). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings in the context of the elections of November 2011 
</b></p>
<p>43. Presidential and parliamentary elections were held in the country on 28 November 
</p><p>2011. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the efforts of MONUSCO in monitoring the 
electoral situation, assessing the risks of violence and taking measures to prevent or contain 
violence. In a report published in November 2011, UNJHRO warned against the serious 
risk of an increase in human rights violations and violence during the electoral period, due </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>to, inter alia, the influence exercised by political actors on State security forces.14 Moreover, 
steps were taken to ensure civilian protection. In the west, MONUSCO deployed forces in 
areas identified as hot spots and kept reserve forces on standby. Additionally, 13 military 
observer team sites were deployed to monitor the security situation throughout the west. An 
ad hoc structure was also set up in Kinshasa to monitor the security situation and respond to 
any deteriorating situation.  
</p>
<p>44. Notwithstanding these measures, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the elections 
were characterized by a high level of tension, as well as by serious and numerous human 
rights violations. Human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and death threats, 
were registered in the pre-electoral, electoral and post-electoral periods. Excessive and 
indiscriminate use of force during demonstrations was of particular concern, including in 
cases of small-scale crowds. 15  The victims were mainly opposition activists, their 
supporters, demonstrators and bystanders. Congolese security and defence forces, 
especially the Republican Guard, are considered to be largely responsible for these 
violations. 
</p>
<p>45. The violence culminated on 26 November 2011, the final day of the electoral 
campaign, in clashes at Kinshasa&#8216;s N&#8216;djili Airport between the supporters of the opposition 
Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party and those of the incumbent 
president, as well as between UDPS and national security forces. According to the 
investigations carried out by UNJHRO, at least 33 people were killed, including 22 by 
gunshot, and at least 83 others were wounded, including 61 by gunshot, in Kinshasa 
between 26 November and 25 December 2011, by members of the defence and security 
forces. 16  However, the number could be higher, as UNJHRO reported difficulties in 
documenting violations of the right to life, such as victims&#8216; and witnesses&#8216; fears of reprisal; 
difficulties in accessing detention facilities and alleged mass graves; and obstacles in 
obtaining information from hospital staff, who were reportedly forbidden to provide 
information.17 Furthermore, the UNJHRO report addressed only the violations committed in 
Kinshasa, given the scope and gravity of the allegations committed in that city. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that violations committed in other parts of the country will be 
addressed in a forthcoming report.  
</p>
<p>46. A report on elections, human rights and related issues was published by the 
Government in March 2012. The Special Rapporteur notes inconsistencies with the number 
of killings reported by UNJHRO, as the Government concludes that 20 people died, in 
circumstances different to those described by UNJHRO.18 He welcomes the fact that a 
judicial investigation was opened to investigate the alleged violations, including a 
commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses committed by the PNC. However, the 
Special Rapporteur stresses the need to conduct thorough, independent and impartial 
investigations into the killings and other numerous abuses relating to the November 2011

<p>elections, ensure accountability for the perpetrated crimes, and provide compensation for 
the victims or their families. He also regrets that little information was provided on the 
progress made in prosecuting and sanctioning the perpetrators of the killings. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur further considers that the recommendation of his 
predecessor on the full integration of the Republican Guard into the regular Congolese 
army, with the aim of rendering its actions accountable, was not properly implemented. 
Although new legislation was adopted that addressed this issue, it did not provide for a 
viable solution. Thus, according to article 56 of Law No. 11/012 of 11 August 2011 on the 
organization and functioning of the Armed Forces, the Republican Guard constitutes an 
integral part of FARDC. However, under the same Law, it remains an independent entity 
within the army, over which the Presidency retains control (art. 154). The President 
appoints the commander and two deputy commanders and decides by presidential decree its 
organization and functioning (arts. 156 and 157).  
</p>
<p>48. Nor was follow-up ensured on the important recommendation to immediately close 
all detention facilities operated outside the law by security forces, including by the 
Republican Guard. Some reportedly still remain operational, in particular in remote areas. 
As noted above, monitors, including from the United Nations, are denied access to the 
majority of them. Despite several Security Council resolutions and a Presidential directive 
of 5 July 2005, UNJHRO is still denied access to most of the detention facilities of the 
National Intelligence Agency (ANR) and to all but one of the detention facilities of the 
Republican Guard. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the need to close all unlawful 
detention centres, which, due to the lack of judicial supervision, are places where serious 
human rights abuses continue to be reported.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings of human rights defenders and journalists 
</b></p>
<p>49. During the period under review, an increase was registered in attacks against human 
rights defenders and journalists, who continued to receive death threats and be killed as a 
consequence of their activities. In the electoral context of 2011, human rights defenders and 
journalists remained in a particularly precarious situation, especially those touching upon 
the sensitive issues of corruption, extortion or elections. According to Protection 
International, the most exposed are those who investigate and publicly denounce human 
rights violations, assist victims and call for justice. Other categories at risk are journalists 
and defenders cooperating with the International Criminal Court, women and defenders 
working in rural areas.19  
</p>
<p>50. The most emblematic case is the murder during the night of 1 to 2 June 2010, in 
Kinshasa, of Floribert Chebeya, executive-secretary of the R&#233;seau national des ONG des 
droits de l&#8216;homme de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo and president of the Congolese 
NGO Voix des Sans-Voix pour les droits de l&#8216;homme, and his driver, Fid&#232;le Bazana, whose 
body has not yet been found. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the investigations and trial 
launched in this case and will address this aspect in chapter VIII below. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at the current level of attacks against 
human rights defenders and journalists, and urges the Congolese authorities to ensure 
protection of the right to life of these professionals. He takes note of the recent initiatives of 
the Government to create a legislative and institutional framework to achieve this goal, 
such as the introduction of a draft law in the Parliament on the protection of human rights 
activists in May 2011, and the adoption of the Ministerial Decision from June 2011 to 
establish a protection cell for human rights defenders within the Ministry of Justice and

<p>Human Rights. These mechanisms should be implemented swiftly and become effectively 
functional as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Deaths in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>52. The previous mandate holder concluded that a high number of prisoners died in 
Congolese prisons due to a severe lack of the most basic standards of organization, 
monitoring and health. The current prison situation continues to raise grave concerns, with 
endemic overcrowding, very poor conditions and a high level of insecurity leading to a 
considerable number of deaths, including from preventable illness. According to the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, 119 deaths in custody were registered between January 
and June 2010 (A/HRC/16/27, para. 16); 41 were reported between January and September 
2011 (A/HRC/19/48, para. 9). Chronic malnutrition, severe ill-treatment and a lack of 
access to basic health care constitute the main reasons for deaths in custody. Prison unrest, 
including mass escapes20, prisoners&#8216; riots and strikes by the staff, is also of serious concern. 
For instance, a prison break attempt on 1 January 2012 at the Bukavu Central Prison, in 
South Kivu, resulted in the death of 8 prisoners and the injury of 47 prisoners (S/2012/65, 
para. 67). 
</p>
<p>53. To tackle the situation of deaths in custody, the mission report focused on three 
recommendations necessary for taking first steps to improve the very poor prison system in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo: the conduct of a comprehensive census of the 
prison population and release of all arbitrarily detained prisoners; the establishment of a 
reasonable budget for every prison; and the recording and regular reporting of deaths in 
prisons by prison officials.  
</p>
<p>54. With respect to the recommendation on the conducting of a comprehensive census 
of the prison population, the Special Rapporteur was informed that within the period under 
review the Congolese authorities, with support from the MONUSCO Corrections Unit, 
conducted a census in those correction facilities that are located near a MONUSCO 
presence. A two-year project is currently being developed with funding from the 
Government of France to conduct a comprehensive census of the entire prison population. 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding the recording and reporting of deaths in custody, the Special Rapporteur 
received information that prison authorities currently send incident reports on deaths in 
detention to the Director of Prisons at the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights on a case-
by-case basis. During the period under review, the drafting of those reports has become 
significantly more frequent. 
</p>
<p>56. The allocation by the Government of reasonable budgets for every prison remains a 
challenge. The Special Rapporteur received information that some steps have been taken to 
restructure the management and human resources allocated to the penitentiary system since 
June 2010. However, those steps were not accompanied by sufficient budgetary allocations. 
As a result, penitentiary employees are significantly underpaid, lack dedication, and are 
susceptible to corruption. Only the central prisons, including the Ndolo military prison in 
Kinshasa, receive a small, but still insufficient, budget for feeding detainees. By 
consequence, detainees remain dependent upon their families, friends and charitable 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 20 One of the most serious cases is the reported escape of more than 960 prisoners from Kasapa prison, 
</p>
<p>Lubumbashi, Katanga Province, on 7 September 2011, following an attack by several armed men 
outside the prison. The escapees included the former Mai-Mai chief G&#233;d&#233;on Kyungu Mutanga, who was 
convicted of war crimes, crimes against humanity and terrorism in March 2009 (see submission from 
Amnesty International). For further information, see media reports, for example, Radio Okapi, 
&#8213;Lubumbashi: 963 prisonniers s&#8216;evadent de la prison de Kasapa&#8214;, 7 September 2011, http://radiookapi.

<p>organizations for their nutrition and survival. Living conditions remain dire due to, inter 
alia, the lack of basic health care. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite the persisting difficult conditions and the severe overcrowding in prisons, 
the recommendation relating to the release of all arbitrarily detained prisoners was not 
followed up. As documented by the civil society in 2011, a considerable percentage of the 
prison population is in prolonged detention without trial or charge. Numerous detainees 
have never appeared before a court, or been allowed to challenge the legality of their 
detention.21 Furthermore, it is reported that convicted prisoners are often not freed at the 
end of their sentence, a situation that is exacerbated by the lack of prison records. 
Meanwhile, arbitrary arrests continue to be frequent, thus further increasing the pressure on 
the prisons.22 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Killings related to sexual violence, witchcraft and vigilantism 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Extrajudicial executions and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>58. The previous mandate holder raised the issue of the prevalence and atrocious nature 
of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which had reached such a 
grave level that it was resulting in deaths. The Special Rapporteur confirms that during the 
period under review, sexual violence, including mass rape, continued to be committed at an 
unabated rate. Investigation reports indicate that FARDC soldiers and various armed groups 
remain, by a large margin, the main perpetrators, although media reports from 2011 also 
point to an increase in sexual violence committed by civilians, as well as its proliferation 
throughout the entire country. The Special Rapporteur has encountered the same difficulties 
as his predecessor regarding the lack of statistics on deaths resulting from sexual violence. 
However, having analysed various reports on sexual violence in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, he observes with concern that death threats and killings related to sexual 
violence continue to occur, in particular in cases of resistance or rescue attempts, as well as 
in situations where the victims decide to report the case and seek justice. 
</p>
<p>59. The previous mandate holder noted that MONUC had launched a comprehensive 
strategy against sexual violence in April 2009, but that implementation had been delayed 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, para. 68); he recommended full implementation of the strategy. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that the implementation of the comprehensive strategy 
began in 2010, with the first projects launched within its framework. It is now the national 
strategy against gender-based violence, and is supported by the United Nations system. The 
strategy is aimed at ensuring the coherence and harmonization of international support to 
tackle sexual violence. Five working groups were created to ensure coordination among 
various agencies. The MONUSCO Sexual Violence Unit ensures the overall coordination 
of the five working groups. Congolese ministries are reported to participate in each of the 
working groups. The comprehensive strategy has been replicated at the national 
Government level as the National Strategy on Sexual and Gender-based Violence, and at 
the provincial level. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the start of the implementation of 
this strategy and insists on the importance of its effective and full realization, given the 
scale of the problem of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Vigilante justice killings, including for witchcraft 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur concurs with his predecessor on the spread of vigilante 
killings and mob justice, which is mainly due to a lack of trust in the justice system and the 
high costs of turning to the mechanisms of the justice system. The victims, as before, 
include suspected witches, in particular women and children, as well as persons suspected 
of crimes such as theft or rape. While data are not sufficiently available to establish precise 
statistics on the number of killings, local media and NGO reports indicate that they are still 
widely carried out.23 For instance, 15 persons are reported to have been killed in June 2011 
in the territories of Lubero, Beni and Rutshuru in North Kivu as a consequence of &#8213;popular 
justice&#8214;.24 
</p>
<p>61. The previous mandate holder put forward recommendations on the need to 
investigate and punish the killings of &#8213;witches&#8214; and those resulting from vigilante justice, 
as well as to sanction police or other officials who fail to take reasonable steps in this 
direction. Another recommendation suggested strengthening public awareness campaigns 
on this problem. The Special Rapporteur has regrettably not received sufficient information 
to assess the follow-up to those recommendations. He takes note however of the 
information received that the current efforts made by the Congolese authorities to bring 
those responsible for these killings to justice are insufficient. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Fight against impunity in cases of extrajudicial executions 
</b></p>
<p>62. The previous mandate holder concluded that impunity for all forms of killings in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo was prevalent, which was partly due to systemic 
problems of the justice system. Impunity for senior military commanders constituted a 
particularly serious concern (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, para. 96). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Systemic problems in the Congolese justice system 
</b></p>
<p>63. During the period under review, the Congolese authorities, with international 
support, have taken some steps to address the systemic problems in the justice system. For 
instance, in an attempt to strengthen the capacity of the system, 2,000 additional 
magistrates were to be trained and deployed between January 2010 and January 2012. The 
establishment of prosecution support cells and efforts to equip judiciary institutions with 
modern technologies were reported. While these steps are welcomed, the Congolese justice 
system still has poor capacity to ensure a proper administration of justice. It continues to be 
severely affected by inadequate resources, endemic corruption, political interference, poor 
enforcement of judgments 25  and very limited access to justice for the majority of the 
Congolese population. Interference is of particular concern in both the military and civilian 
justice systems. In the military justice system, officers have been reported to protect the 
soldiers under their command from accountability and to avoid cooperation with the 
judiciary, thus undermining efforts to fight impunity within the military.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>

<p>64. Witness protection raises serious concerns. The former mandate holder drew 
attention to the lack of a national witness protection programme as a major obstacle to 
fighting impunity (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, para. 100). Despite the fact that the Government, 
in its Plan of Action for the Reform of Justice from 2007, had envisaged the creation of a 
protection programme for victims and witnesses, such a programme has not yet been 
established. This perpetuates a situation in which victims fear to seek justice, and reinforces 
the climate of impunity in the country.  
</p>
<p>65. There are currently only two such protection programmes in place in the country: 
one under the International Criminal Court and one implemented by UNJHRO. The former 
programme is limited to supporting only victims and witnesses &#8213;who appear before the 
</p>
<p>Court, and others who are at risk on account of testimony given by such witnesses&#8214;.26 
Furthermore, &#8213;intermediaries&#8214;, such as local NGOs, grass-roots associations or individuals 
who have supported the work of the International Criminal Court, currently do not benefit 
from this protection programme. 
</p>
<p>66. The UNJHRO protection programme is aimed at protecting victims, witnesses of 
human rights violations, human rights defenders and journalists. While the former mandate 
holder commended the programme, he also acknowledged its limited reach and resources, 
and recommended that it be expanded. The Special Rapporteur was regrettably informed 
that throughout 2010 and 2011 there was no increase in either financial support or 
personnel for the programme. Efforts were made with NGOs from the cities to expand the 
protection networks into territories further afield. As a result, 174 people enjoyed protective 
measures under the programme in 2010; another 147 received protection from January to 
November 2011.  
</p>
<p>67. Bearing in mind that witness and victim protection constitutes a crucial element of 
the fight against impunity, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Congolese authorities to 
establish as soon as possible a national programme for the protection of witnesses and 
victims. In parallel, he strongly believes that the UNJHRO protection programme should 
urgently be expanded, in terms of both resources and reach. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Efforts at the national level to combat impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. </b>Implementation of the &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy of the Government<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. An essential recommendation from the mission report requested the Government of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fully implement its &#8213;zero tolerance&#8214; policy, 
announced on 5 July 2009, with the aim of addressing a lack of discipline among and 
criminal activity by FARDC members. The former mandate holder recommended that 
FARDC members responsible for abuses be investigated, arrested and prosecuted. He listed 
five senior commanders suspected of involvement in war crimes, to whom the &#8213;zero 
</p>
<p>tolerance&#8214; policy should apply primarily. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the implementation of the zero-tolerance 
policy had gained momentum since 2010. A considerable number of mobile hearings were 
held by various military courts and tribunals. In South Kivu, for instance, court hearings 
held between January and August 2011 led to rape convictions of at least 50 FARDC 
soldiers, including several officers. In one trial, nine soldiers from the Congolese Armed 
Forces, including Lieutenant Colonel Kibibi Mutware, were convicted of crimes against 
humanity, notably rape, committed on 1 January 2011 in Fizi, South Kivu. They were given 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 26 Article 43, paragraph 6, of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>prison sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years in February 2011.27 Such positive measures 
should also be taken to bring to justice perpetrators of extrajudicial executions. 
</p>
<p>70. However, many officers still evade justice and are rarely, if ever, prosecuted for 
their command responsibility. The situation is complicated by the political discourse of the 
Congolese authorities of prioritizing stability over justice, which is aimed at not 
undermining the integration process of former rebel groups into the FARDC and implies a 
certain level of tolerance towards their record of serious human rights abuses. 
Consequently, well-known perpetrators of crimes under international law are not held 
accountable and even remain in positions of command.28  
</p>
<p>71. The current situation of the five senior commanders listed in the recommendation 
from the mission report confirms this trend. According to information received, General 
Bosco Ntaganda, the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, is still at 
large in Goma. Moreover, in October 2011, the President of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo reiterated the authorities&#8216; refusal to surrender Bosco Ntaganda to the Court. 29 
Colonel Sultani Makenga is the Deputy Commander of the FARDC Amani Leo Operation 
for South Kivu. Colonel Innocent Zimurinda is the Commander of the 811th FARDC 
Regiment deployed in Masisi Territory, North Kivu. Colonel Bernard Byamungu is the 
Commander of the 9th FARDC Sector based in Uvira, Uvira Territory, South Kivu. Finally, 
Lieutenant Colonel Salumu Mulenda was the Deputy Commander (Operations and 
Intelligence) of the 113th FARDC Regiment based in South Kivu. He reportedly died on 12 
December 2011 in Kigali as a result of injuries sustained during an ambush, and his body 
arrived in Goma on 14 December 2011.   
</p>
<p>72. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the conviction by the International 
Criminal Court of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo on 14 March 2012 as a major step in the fight 
against impunity. Mr. Lubanga Dyilo was found guilty of the war crimes of conscripting 
and enlisting children under the age of 15 into the Patriotic Force for the Liberation of 
Congo, and using them to actively participate in hostilities in the country&#8216;s north-eastern 
Ituri District from September 2002 to August 2003.30 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other measures to combat impunity 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Congolese authorities have made additional efforts in fighting impunity, in an 
attempt to follow up on one of the main recommendations of the United Nations report on 
the mapping exercise (see para. 31 above). The Minister of Justice and Human Rights 
devised in 2011 a draft law concerning the creation and organization of a specialized court, 
composed of national and international judges, to deal with the crimes committed during 
the period from 1993 to 2003. On 22 August 2011, the Senate decided to return the draft 
law to the Government for review. The Senate considered, inter alia, that the draft would be 
unconstitutional as it would contradict the constitutional provisions regarding immunities 
and privileges of jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p>74. Beyond the issue of accountability of the Armed Forces, another example of an 
attempt to fight impunity in Congolese society was the trial on the killings of Floribert 
Chebeya and Fid&#232;le Bazana (see para. 50 above). On 23 June 2011, the Military Court of

<p>Kinshasa/Gombe rendered its judgment, convicting and sentencing four policemen to the 
death penalty, and a fifth to life imprisonment. Three persons were acquitted for lack of 
evidence. Various NGOs reported concerns relating to the proper clarification of the 
circumstances of the deaths of Mr. Chebeya and Mr. Bazana, the conviction of all alleged 
perpetrators, as well as to the competences of a military court to rule on cases of ordinary 
law.31 At the moment of drafting the present report, the United Nations was still verifying 
aspects relating to the respect of fair trial guarantees within this trial. An appeal has also 
been filed, but no hearing has yet taken place. The head of the police at the time of the 
killings, John Numbi, who is believed to have been involved in the death of Floribert 
Chebeya, was suspended, but regrettably no legal examination into his role in the death has 
taken place.  
</p>
<p><b> C. International measures to fight impunity in the Democratic Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>75. The previous mandate holder formulated additional recommendations for 
international actors to contribute to the fight against impunity in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo. One concerned the need to investigate, arrest and prosecute senior leaders of 
FDLR based abroad. Another was addressed to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
Court, suggesting he emphasize crimes of sexual violence in his investigations in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>76. With respect to the FDLR leaders based abroad, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that on 11 October 2010, the French authorities arrested Callixte Mbarushimana 
and transferred him to the International Criminal Court on 25 January 2011. On 16 
December 2011, the Court&#8216;s Pre-Trial Chamber I declined to confirm the charges against 
Mr. Mbarushimana and ordered his release on the grounds that there was insufficient 
evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that he could be held criminally 
responsible for the eight counts of war crimes and five counts of crimes against humanity 
brought against him by the Prosecutor. Mr. Mbarushimana was released on 23 December 
2011, although he is currently being investigated in France for his alleged role in the 
genocide in Rwanda in 1994. 
</p>
<p>77. In parallel, on 4 May 2011, the trial of Ignace Murwanashyaka and Straton Muson 
started before the Oberlandesgericht in Stuttgart, Germany, for their alleged role in war 
crimes and crimes against humanity reportedly committed by the FDLR. The trial is 
ongoing at the moment of drafting this report. 
</p>
<p>78. With regard to the recommendation made to the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court, in two out of four cases before the Court concerning the situation in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Prosecutor has charged the accused with rape and 
sexual slavery both as war crimes and as crimes against humanity. The trial for the first 
case, against Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, began on 24 November 2009. 
The second case concerned Mr. Mbarushimana.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The situation of extrajudicial executions in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo remains complex. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the series of steps taken 
</b></p>

<p><b>Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), in particular those to ensure better 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of civilians. He concludes, however, that their impact on the population 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains limited. The population continues to be subjected to grave and massive 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuses of human rights, including killings, by rebel groups and various Congolese 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces, including the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC). The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>further regrets the fact that election-related violence, including killings, was not 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevented, and invites all concerned actors to examine the related reasons and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen contingency plans during future electoral cycles. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the measures taken at both the national and 
international levels to fight impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Additional resolute and robust steps need to be taken in this area by the Congolese 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities. In particular, senior FARDC commanders suspected of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations, including the five persons listed in the mission report, need to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated, arrested and prosecuted. Practical follow-up to the report on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mapping exercise released by the United Nations in 2010 needs to be ensured, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through the creation of a specialized court to address the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations committed between 1993 and 2003. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The fight against impunity should also be considerably strengthened in the 
civilian justice system. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of witness and 
</b></p>
<p><b>victim protection mechanisms in the fight against impunity, and regrets their very 
</b></p>
<p><b>limited functioning in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He invites the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to establish a national programme for the protection of witnesses and 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims, and invites MONUSCO to expand its own programme in this field. </b></p>

<p><b> A. Extrajudicial executions in the Kivus 
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>Large numbers of civilians have been killed in the Kivus, either in revenge 
attacks by rebel groups, or in opportunistic attacks or massacres committed by the

<p><b>Congolese army. Much more should urgently be done to reduce killings and protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilians. 
</b></p>
<p>2. <b>All FARDC soldiers should be provided, and be required to wear, uniforms 
that identify their name and relevant unit. The Security Council should make this a 
</b></p>
<p><b>precondition for United Nations assistance to Congolese military operations. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</p>
<p>3. The Government should fully implement its &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy, and 
<b>investigate, arrest and prosecute FARDC members responsible for abuses. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially includes the following senior commanders suspected of involvement in war 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes: General Bosco Ntaganda, Colonel Sultani Makenga, Colonel Innocent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Zimurinda, Colonel Bernard Byamungu and Lieutenant Colonel Salumu Mulenda. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</p>
<p>4. <b>Senior leaders of the FDLR based outside the country, including in Germany 
and France, should be investigated for their role in war crimes and crimes against 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and arrested and prosecuted 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been implemented.  
</p>
<p>5. <b>FDLR commanders should immediately issue orders to their soldiers to comply 
with human rights and humanitarian law at all times. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>The conditionality policy of MONUC, setting out the terms on which it provides 
support to the Congolese Armed Forces, should be made public. It should be strictly 
</b></p>
<p><b>adhered to, and the steps taken under it made public at an appropriate time. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</p>
<p>7. <b>The United Nations should consider creating an independent mechanism to 
monitor and investigate human rights violations in accordance with the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartiality, effectiveness and credibility. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been implemented. </p>
