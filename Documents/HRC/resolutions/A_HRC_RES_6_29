</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/29.   Right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental 
health 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Aware</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health still remains 
</p>
<p>a distant goal and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal 
</p>
<p>remains remote, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
</p>
<p>attainable standard of physical and mental health is a human right as reflected, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, in article 25, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 
</p>
<p>12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 
</p>
<p>24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as, with respect to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, in article 5 (e) (iv) of the International Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and in article 12, paragraph 1, of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and 
</p>
<p>that such a right derives from the inherent dignity of the human person, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with interest</i> of general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of health (article 12 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), adopted by the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights at its twenty-second session in May 2000; of general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 3 (2003) on HIV/AIDS and the rights of the child, adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child at its thirty-second session; and of general 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 24 (1999) on women and health (article 12 of the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women), adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women at its twentieth 
</p>
<p>session, </p>

<p> <i>Recalling</i> all resolutions on the realization of the right of everyone to the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health adopted by 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the declarations and programmes of action adopted by the 
</p>
<p>major United Nations conferences and summits and their follow-up meetings, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the need for States, in cooperation with international 
</p>
<p>organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the 
</p>
<p>private sector, to create favourable conditions at the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of the right of everyone 
</p>
<p>to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> about the interrelations between poverty and the realization of the 
</p>
<p>right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
</p>
<p>mental health, in particular that ill-health can be both a cause and a consequence of 
</p>
<p>poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the commitments made by the international community to fully 
</p>
<p>implement the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are 
</p>
<p>fundamental elements in the reduction of their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and that the 
</p>
<p>advancement of women and girls is a key factor in reversing the pandemic, and noting 
</p>
<p>the importance of increasing investments in and accelerating research on the 
</p>
<p>development of effective HIV-prevention methods, including female-controlled 
</p>
<p>methods and microbicides, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the creation, under the aegis of the International Action against 
</p>
<p>Hunger and Poverty of the international drug purchase facility UNITAID, which 
</p>
<p>facilitates access to drugs for the world&#8217;s poorest people as part of the fight against the 
</p>
<p>major pandemic diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the complementary and mutually reinforcing relationship between 
</p>
<p>health and human rights, as well as the indispensable contribution of health </p>

<p>professionals to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
</p>
<p>attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations
