Canada concerns reparations to victims of the Residential School system.  Under this system 
several generations of Aboriginal children were compelled to attend schools far from their 
communities, leading to widespread psychological suffering, physical abuse and loss of identity.  
The system has been the object of an increasing number of court cases in recent years 
(see E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.3, paras. 60-61).  The Special Rapporteur recommended that &#8220;special 
attention be paid to the nexus between the Residential Schools restitution process, the 
transgenerational loss of culture and its attendant social problems&#8221; (ibid., para. 102).  This 
recommendation reportedly helped advance the negotiations towards the Indian Residential 
Schools Settlement Agreement, signed by the Government, the claimants, AFN  and various 
Churches in May 2006.  The agreement includes payments to former students who lived at one 
of these schools, a system to deal with serious claims of abuse, and an expedited system of 
compensation for the elderly.  The agreement further funds programmes for healing, truth and 
reconciliation for former students and their families.

<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report presents the study of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people regarding best practices carried out to 
implement the recommendations contained in his general and country reports, pursuant to the 
request of the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/51. 
</p>
<p> The study presents a number of general considerations concerning the objectives and 
impact of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, and provides specific examples of initiatives 
undertaken in specific countries to follow up on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations that 
have involved international organizations and agencies, civil society and indigenous peoples, in 
cooperation with the Governments concerned.  The final part of the study incorporates a number 
of examples concerning specific countries in which these recommendations have promoted 
specific changes in State policies and legislation. 
</p>
<p> The study concludes that, while the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports have had an important 
impact in some countries, the recommendations incorporated in his reports do not generate 
automatic and speedy changes in the situation of the rights of indigenous peoples.  The several 
initiatives that have been undertaken over the last years by Governments, the United Nations 
system, civil society and indigenous organizations to monitor and promote the implementation 
of these recommendations demonstrate that, if left for institutional action alone, the 
recommendations are rarely implemented.  Implementation needs to be pushed forward in close 
cooperation with the Government and other stakeholders, including indigenous peoples 
themselves.  In countries where follow-up mechanisms exist, institutional efforts for 
implementation have been more sustained, leading to concrete changes in law and practice. 
</p>
<p> These experiences suggest that, despite the advances that can be identified, the general 
record of implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations is gloomy.  Much 
remains to be done by Governments, international agencies and other relevant stakeholders to 
bridge the &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; that divides international and domestic norms and the serious 
human rights violations that indigenous peoples continue to experience in all parts of the world. 
</p>
<p> The study contains a number of conclusions and recommendations to enhance 
implementation. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 2005/51, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, 
Rodolfo Stavenhagen, to begin preparing a study regarding &#8220;best practices carried out to 
implement the recommendations contained in his general and country reports&#8221; (para. 9) and to 
submit a progress report to the Commission at its sixty-second session and the final study at its 
sixty-third session. 
</p>
<p>2. Following this request, the Special Rapporteur presented a progress report 
(E/CN.4/2006/78/Add.4) to the first session of the Human Rights Council in September 2006 
containing an overview of the main conclusions and recommendations from his thematic and 
country reports; a summary of the information received from Governments, international 
agencies and civil society organizations on the actions being taken; and a plan of work for the 
preparation of the final study. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to note that an in-depth study would have required 
full-time research and additional information.  In this context, the present report should be seen 
by the Council as a general overview of the actions being taken and the challenges ahead that 
could serve as a first step for a more comprehensive study on the subject matter in the future. 
4. Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001/57 establishing the mandate on the 
situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people attributes to the 
Special Rapporteur the responsibility of formulating &#8220;recommendations and proposals on 
appropriate measures and activities to prevent and remedy violations of the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people&#8221; (para. 1 (b)).  Such recommendations are included 
in a number of thematic and country reports.  Since his appointment in 2001, the Special 
Rapporteur has presented six annual reports.  In the first, the Special Rapporteur proposed a list 
of issues on which he wanted to focus his subsequent reports (E/CN.4/2002/97, para. 113), 
which was endorsed by the Commission (resolution 2002/65, para. 5).  Subsequently, the Special 
Rapporteur prepared thematic reports on the impact of large-scale development projects 
(E/CN.4/2003/90); access to the administration of justice and indigenous customary law 
(E/CN.4/2004/80); education (E/CN.4/2005/88); and the implementation of legislation and 
jurisprudence concerning the rights of indigenous peoples (E/CN.4/2006/78).  The Special 
Rapporteur presents his sixth annual report at the present session of the Council (A/HRC/4/32), 
which focuses on the state and evolution of the rights of indigenous peoples in recent years. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has also submitted reports on his missions to Guatemala 
(E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.<footnote name="2">4. Similar meetings have taken place in Guatemala, where, at the invitation of the 
Government, the Special Rapporteur conducted a follow-up mission in May 2006.  During his 
visit, he met with the President&#8217;s full Cabinet, as well as with several governmental agencies and 
committees; members of parliament and the judiciary; indigenous and civil society organizations 
and representatives of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT).  He further participated in a 
national workshop with more than 100 representatives of indigenous and civil society 
organizations, which presented him with a full assessment of the state of implementation of the 
recommendations of his country report. </footnote>); Philippines (E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.3); Mexico 
(E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.<footnote name="2">3. OHCHR Mexico and its counterparts in the Government have organized a number of 
meetings to evaluate the state of implementation of his recommendations, including one with 
high-level government officials in 2006, and a national consultation with indigenous and human 
rights organizations in January 2007.  The project also supported the follow-up visit undertaken 
by the Special Rapporteur to the &#8220;La Parota&#8221; hydroelectric project and other indigenous 
communities in the State of Guerrero in August 2006. 
</footnote>); Chile (E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.3); Colombia (E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.<footnote name="2">2. In the framework of this project, OHCHR has promoted training courses for members of 
the Government, the judiciary and indigenous organizations on the rights of indigenous peoples.  
The project also promoted the dissemination of the reports by way of printed and audio materials 
in Spanish and indigenous languages.  In 2006 two research projects on the recognition of 
traditional indigenous law in the official legal system were initiated in Mexico, following up the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations on indigenous law and access to justice, and on the 
situation of the rights of indigenous women. 
</footnote>); 
Canada (E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.3 and Corr.<footnote name="1">9. Finally, while the &#8220;best practices&#8221; study commissioned by the Commission on 
Human Rights constitutes a useful tool to assess the impact and effectiveness of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations, he cannot conclude these general considerations without noting 
that, as described in the thematic report presented to the current session of the Human Rights 
Council, despite the many efforts deployed, indigenous peoples around the world continue to</footnote>); South Africa (E/CN.4/2006/78/Add.2); 
New Zealand (E/CN.4/2006/78/Add.3).  At the current session of the Council, the Special 
Rapporteur presents reports on his missions to Ecuador (A/HRC/4/32/Add.2) and Kenya 
(A/HRC/4/32/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>6. In preparing his final study, the Special Rapporteur used the information included in the 
replies to a questionnaire distributed in October 2005 which he received from the Governments 
of Argentina, Belarus, Canada, Chile, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, Germany, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>Lebanon, Mexico, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Switzerland and Tunisia.  The 
Special Rapporteur received replies from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), the World Bank, as well as the country offices of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Colombia, Guatemala and 
Mexico, and the OHCHR Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, in response to 
another specific questionnaire addressed to the United Nations agencies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>7. This study is also based on the information compiled during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
participation in a number of visits, seminars and meetings, including the International expert 
seminar on the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations, organized by 
Rights and Democracy in Montreal, Canada, in October 2006.  The Special Rapporteur received 
written contributions from a number of indigenous organizations, NGOs and individual experts.  
He acknowledges the cooperation received and wishes to thank all the people and organizations 
that supported this research. 
</p>
<p>8. The study first presents a number of general considerations concerning the objectives and 
impact of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, and makes a number of preliminary conceptual 
clarifications concerning the scope of the study.  The second part of the study provides a number 
of examples of initiatives led by international organizations and agencies, civil society and 
indigenous peoples to follow up on the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports, in 
cooperation with the Governments concerned.  The third part analyses a number of instances in 
which these recommendations have promoted specific changes in State policies and legislation.  
The study concludes with a number of conclusions and recommendations to enhance 
implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE 
OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR&#8217;S RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>9. In its resolution 2005/51 the Commission on Human Rights specifically limited the scope 
of the study to the recommendations contained in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s &#8220;general and country 
reports&#8221;.  The emphasis on &#8220;best practices&#8221; is particularly relevant in order to ascertain the 
effectiveness of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate and the cooperation of the relevant 
stakeholders, particularly States, with this special procedure. 
</p>
<p>10. The &#8220;best practices&#8221; approach presents methodological limitations related to the 
difficulty of establishing clear relations of causality between the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations and policy and practical changes that have actually taken place.  The Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s work is informed by and builds upon existing international standards regarding 
indigenous rights, including treaties, customary law and &#8220;soft law&#8221;; the decisions and 
recommendations of international human rights bodies responsible for monitoring those norms,</p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>which have developed a specific jurisprudence concerning indigenous peoples; and other 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council (see E/CN.4/2002/97, paras. 6-33, and 
E/CN.4/2006/78, paras. 7-13, 51-79).  Therefore, the recommendations made by the Special 
Rapporteur cannot be seen in isolation, but are rather part of the wider system of international 
norms, actors and procedures that interact to promote the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>11. Examples of this interaction are manifold.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic reports 
have been used as a source in the reports of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
and also in the activities of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.  His reports have also been used in the 
work of other special procedures of the Human Rights Council.  For instance, the thematic report 
on the impact of major development projects is a tool for ongoing discussions within OHCHR 
concerning the impact of business on human rights, and for the work of the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational 
Corporations and other Business Enterprises.  In addition, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country 
reports have been used by the United Nations treaty bodies in the preparation of their concluding 
observations concerning State compliance with the human rights conventions they have ratified. 
</p>
<p>12. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations are related to social, political and 
legal processes at the domestic level.  The different issues highlighted by the Special Rapporteur, 
particularly in his country reports, are derived from his independent assessment of already 
existing discussions and demands concerning the rights of indigenous peoples in the countries he 
visits.  As a consequence, the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations 
cannot generally be seen in isolation from ongoing efforts by government actors, civil society 
organizations and indigenous peoples themselves to promote solutions to the substantive human 
rights issues that the recommendations seek to address. 
</p>
<p>13. The human rights situation of indigenous peoples is derived from complex historical 
processes and structural phenomena, and therefore the actions and strategies required to improve 
this situation are necessarily multifaceted.  In a number of cases, the effective protection of 
indigenous rights requires specific legal, institutional and even constitutional reforms to 
guarantee them or to solve conflicts with other existing norms at the domestic level, and the 
implementation of these recommendations may be relatively easy to assess.  In other instances, 
particularly when addressing broader or systemic conditions affecting the enjoyment of basic 
human rights by indigenous peoples, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations are phrased 
differently.  The implementation of the recommendations must be measurable, and a system of 
benchmarks should be set to evaluate progress, with the participation of indigenous peoples 
themselves. 
</p>
<p>14. The impact of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work on the protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples is not measured necessarily only along the implementation/non-implementation 
continuum.  His missions in several countries and the specific recommendations in his country 
reports have in some cases had a direct impact.  Some of the participants in the Montreal expert 
seminar pointed out that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country visits and reports possibly constitute 
one of the more effective, practically oriented lines of action of the various activities undertaken 
within his mandate. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>15. Specifically, indigenous peoples themselves become involved in the visits of the Special 
Rapporteur.  Typically, he holds consultations with indigenous organizations and individuals at 
the national, regional and community levels.  These meetings have provided him not only with 
valuable information, but have also promoted a space for dialogue between indigenous peoples, 
Governments and other actors at the national level.  In New Zealand, the visit was reportedly 
seen as a basic point of reference by indigenous organizations, irrespective of the level of 
implementation of the specific recommendations by the Government.  The visit by the Special 
Rapporteur to Colombia was also seen by indigenous organizations as a crucial event for their 
empowerment.  An expert at the Montreal seminar pointed out that the visit encouraged the 
consolidation of a distinct human rights agenda for indigenous peoples, and helped reinforce the 
relationships with human rights NGOs. 
</p>
<p>16. Though not on official mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Norway twice during his 
mandate at the invitation of the Saami Parliament and the University of Troms&#248;.  In 2006, after 
lengthy negotiations, the Parliament adopted the Finnmark Act, a new law regarding the 
management of the Saami traditional reindeer-herding areas in the north of the country.  The 
Special Rapporteur has been informed both by government officials and Saami spokespersons 
that his presence in the country during crucial stages in the process was considered a positive 
contribution to the adoption of the law. 
</p>
<p>17. The relatively high impact of country reports in public debates and policymaking 
concerning the rights of indigenous peoples at the national level, as well as the concrete 
character of some of the recommendations allow for a detailed analysis of their follow-up by the 
Governments and other actors concerned.  Indeed, as this study shows, the most relevant &#8220;best 
practices&#8221; in the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations relate to those in 
the various country reports. 
</p>
<p>18. One of main conclusions of the Montreal expert seminar was that the implementation of 
recommendations included in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic reports has been limited in 
comparison to those in the country reports.  This is partly due to their different objectives.  
Thematic reports aim at providing an overview of evolving domestic and international legal 
norms and policies, as well as the major challenges regarding the rights of indigenous peoples, 
with a view to calling international attention to areas of special concern.  Their recommendations 
are not addressed to specific States, and government institutions do not often feel directly 
concerned about their implementation.  It has been pointed out, however, that the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic reports are increasingly seen as authoritative sources for different 
purposes at the national and international levels.  For instance, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations have served as a tool in the formulation of national policies, such as in the case 
of the Spanish Strategy of Cooperation with Indigenous Peoples (Estrategia de la Cooperaci&#243;n 
Espa&#241;ola con los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas, ECEPI), to which the Special Rapporteur was requested to 
give an input.

</p>
<p>suffer serious and systematic violations of their rights, a situation that will persist as long as the 
root causes of these violations remain unaddressed.  In many cases, instead of &#8220;best practices&#8221;, 
the Special Rapporteur finds only &#8220;good intentions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>20. In a number of countries, specific initiatives have taken place to follow up on the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations.  These initiatives have involved international organizations and 
agencies, civil society and indigenous peoples, in cooperation with the Governments concerned.  
These initiatives have been key in promoting &#8220;best practices&#8221; in the implementation of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations in the countries concerned, and provide positive 
examples that could be applied to other countries. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  OHCHR project in Mexico and Guatemala 
</b>21. In 2005, the OHCHR country offices in Mexico and Guatemala, in cooperation with the 
respective Governments, initiated the project Promotion and protection of human rights of 
indigenous peoples in Central America with special focus on Guatemala and Mexico.  One of 
the main objectives of this project is to provide support to both Governments in implementing 
the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country reports, particularly by setting up 
human rights protection and monitoring standards to measure the implementation of the 
recommendations, the developments in the legal system, and the changes in the human rights 
situation of indigenous peoples and of women in particular. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>25. In 2006 OHCHR Mexico conducted a survey on actions taken by government 
institutions, the legislative and judicial branches, as well as national human rights institutions at 
the federal and state levels to implement the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations concerning 
that country.  This information has been submitted to the Special Rapporteur and will also be 
presented in meetings with government officials.  In Guatemala, the Office has assisted the 
Presidential Commission on Human Rights (Comisi&#243;n Presidencial de los Derechos Humanos, 
COPREDH) in the elaboration of indicators to improve monitoring of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. The OHCHR binational project has also helped further the action of OHCHR country 
offices in the field of indigenous rights in those two countries.  In Mexico, the Office identified 
the administration of justice in the State of Oaxaca as one of the priority areas for 2005.  In 
planning the different activities in this area, consideration was given to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations in his report on administration of justice and indigenous law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Other OHCHR projects 
</b>27. Following the example of the project in Mexico and Guatemala, OHCHR launched the 
&#8220;Andean Project&#8221;, in 2006, aiming at working with the Governments of Bolivia, Ecuador and 
Peru in reinforcing the existing protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and mainstreaming 
indigenous issues in the work of the UNCTs.  One of the lines of work of the project is the 
implementation of recommendations by United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures as 
regards the rights of indigenous peoples, including the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>28. In 2006, the OHCHR Andean Project, the UNICEF Regional Office and the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women Andean Regional Office started a study on the 
best practices and obstacles regarding the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic 
recommendations in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.<b>1</b>  The study will pay special attention to the 
recommendations concerning indigenous children and women, in connection with the 
recommendations to these countries of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.  The study, which is expected 
to be concluded in 2007, intends to promote the mainstreaming of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
thematic recommendations in policymaking and United Nations programming, including 
concerning the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>29. In Ecuador, the Andean Project has led the first efforts to establish a follow-up 
mechanism to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on the visit to that country in April/May 2006.  
These efforts involve indigenous organizations through the Permanent Advisory and

<p>Consultative Council of the United Nations and Organizations, Nationalities and Indigenous 
Peoples of Ecuador.  The Council was established in the context of the Human Rights 
Strengthening (HURIST) programme, a joint initiative implemented at country level by OHCHR 
and UNDP that endeavours to mainstream human rights in the work of the UNCT. 
</p>
<p>30. In his report on Colombia, the Special Rapporteur signalled the existence of serious 
conflicts as a result of faulty consultation processes in development projects in indigenous 
<i>resguardos</i> (reserves), and called upon the Government to work out &#8220;[a]n agreed approach to the 
consultation process&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.2, para. 108).  OHCHR Colombia is currently 
considering the establishment of a specific programme on promoting the right to consultation 
which would engage indigenous and Afro-descendant communities, government ministries and 
agencies, and the Office of the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>31. In the report on his visit to Chile, the Special Rapporteur recommended that OHCHR 
should organize a follow-up meeting &#8220;to identify ways in which the United Nations system can 
assist the State authorities in implementing the recommendations set out in this report&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.3, para. 82).  Since the report was made public in 2004, indigenous 
organizations have approached the Office on several occasions to seek its support in advancing 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations,<b>2</b> and the OHCHR Regional Office for Latin America 
and the Caribbean participated in various activities aimed at the dissemination and follow-up of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations.  In 2006, the OHCHR Regional Office included 
these objectives as part of the Action 2 Project on strengthening the capacities of UNCT Chile to 
promote and protect human rights.  For 2007, the project has planned various regional 
consultations with government actors and indigenous organizations concerning the state of 
implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. As in the case of Chile, the Special Rapporteur recommended to OHCHR that it provide 
technical cooperation to the Philippines for the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights (see E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.3, para. 67 (j)).  This recommendation, which has been 
endorsed and followed up by indigenous organizations, has not yet been implemented due to the 
lack of a technical cooperation project between OHCHR and the Government of the Philippines. </p>
<p><b>C.  Follow-up initiatives by international agencies 
</b></p>
<p>33. A number of international agencies have used the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic and 
country recommendations in their programmatic work.  UNESCO, which took an active part in

</p>
<p>the preparation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic report on indigenous education,<b>3</b> has 
reportedly used the recommendations in that report in defining its general programmes, 
particularly with regard to the promotion of bilingual education and the development of 
culturally appropriate curricula.  The UNDP Regional Initiative on Strengthening Policy 
Dialogue on Indigenous, Highland and Tribal Peoples&#8217; Rights and Development (RIPP) has 
worked on access to justice, a question highlighted in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second annual 
report, in Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.  UNHCR took note of the concern 
expressed by the Special Rapporteur regarding political violence against indigenous leaders in 
Colombia in the elaboration of its country assessment.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>34. In Guatemala, in keeping with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation, the Thematic 
Group on Indigenous and Multicultural Issues has continued operating as an inter-agency group 
of UNCT, involving indigenous peoples in its activities (see E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.2, para. 86).  
International agencies have further continued their cooperation in training indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations, a best practice that was also encouraged in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report 
(ibid., para. 87).  Similarly, various agencies of UNCT in Colombia are working together with 
the Kogui, Wiwa, Arhuaco and Kankuamo in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta region to 
elaborate a &#8220;humanitarian diagnosis&#8221; of these peoples.  This initiative aims at shedding light on 
their human rights situation taking into account their own perspectives and priorities. 
</p>
<p>35. Finally, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports have also informed the activities of the 
Inter-Agency Support Group providing technical assistance to the United Nations Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues concerning the different issues covered at its annual sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Follow-up initiatives by civil society 
</b></p>
<p>36. At the Montreal expert seminar indigenous leaders and experts concluded that they 
cannot wait for Governments to implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur.  
Rather, indigenous peoples and their support organizations, in cooperation with governmental 
and other non-governmental actors, should take a leading role in putting these recommendations 
into practice.  A growing number of experiences in countries that the Special Rapporteur has 
visited provide examples of how indigenous peoples have appropriated these reports and used 
them as practical tools in the defence of their rights. 
</p>
<p>37. A concern expressed by indigenous organizations in many of the countries visited by the 
Special Rapporteur is the lack of information among indigenous communities about his reports 
and recommendations.  In order to address this shortfall, a number of indigenous organizations 
have promoted publication of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports.  In the Philippines, Tebtebba 
published a book in 2002 which reproduced the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on the country, as

</p>
<p>well as general information on the mandate.  The book was widely disseminated nationally and 
abroad, and has helped indigenous peoples in other countries to make the best use of a mission 
by the Special Rapporteur.<b>5</b>  International NGOs working in the area of indigenous rights have 
focused on the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur.<b>6</b>  Amnesty International 
(Canada) disseminated sections of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on major development 
projects as part of a national campaign to publicize the impacts of these projects on indigenous 
communities in the country.  In Chile, the Lafkenche Mapuche published an abridged version of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report and of the Chilean official response in 2005. 
</p>
<p>38. In Mexico, the Citizen Observatory of Indigenous Peoples (Observatorio Ciudadano de 
los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas, OCPI), established by the Mexican Academy of Human Rights, one of 
the main human rights NGOs in the country, in cooperation with the UNESCO Chair on 
Human Rights of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, monitors the implementation 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations after his visit to Mexico in 2003 to the States of 
Chiapas, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz and Yucat&#225;n, the States with the highest density of 
indigenous populations in the country.  The Observatory launched a nationwide campaign to 
promote knowledge of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate and the recommendations of his report 
and evaluate the state of implementation of these recommendations through an information 
request system (SISI) about the different governmental programmes and projects aimed at the 
implementation of the recommendations, which is available to the general public via the 
Internet.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Indigenous and civil society in a number of countries have also regularly promoted 
follow-up of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations though national consultations.  In 
the Philippines, a national meeting, &#8220;Indigenous Peoples, the UN Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples and the Second Decade Programme of Action&#8221;, was held in Manila in 
August 2005 and evaluated the state of implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations following his visit to the country.  A second meeting was held in 
February 2007, with the participation of the Special Rapporteur.  A similar experience was the 
Open Forum, &#8220;Closing the Implementation Gap&#8221;, held in Ottawa in October 2006, organized by 
the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), the Native Women&#8217;s Association of Canada (NWAC), the 
Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), Amnesty International (Canada) and the Canadian 
Friends Service Committee, which the Special Rapporteur attended.

</p>
<p>40. Other relevant initiatives regarding the follow-up to the recommendations of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country reports have been the organization of independent human rights 
observation missions to assess the state of implementation of these recommendations.  An 
important initiative in this regard was the organization of the International Mission of 
Verification on the Humanitarian and Human Rights Situation of Indigenous Peoples of 
Colombia (IMV) in Colombia in October 2006.  IMV was an initiative of the National 
Indigenous Organization of Colombia (Organizaci&#243;n Nacional Ind&#237;gena de Colombia, ONIC), in 
cooperation with several indigenous and civil society organizations at the national and 
international levels.  IMV visited the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Departments of 
Arauca, Cauca, C&#243;rdoba and Guaviare, and produced specific reports on the findings in those 
areas. 
</p>
<p>41. In other cases independent observation missions have focused on specific aspects of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations.  In the case of Chile, Human Rights Watch and the 
International Federation of Human Rights conducted separate missions in 2004 and 2006, in 
cooperation with indigenous and civil society organizations, as a follow-up to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations concerning the criminal policy regarding Mapuche social protest 
in the south of the country, which in a number of cases has led to members of Mapuche 
communities receiving long prison sentences under the anti-terrorist legislation.

OF RECOMMENDATIONS

<p>and girls, particularly in the urban environment&#8221; (ibid., para. 113).  In March 2005, the 
Government signed a five-year contribution agreement NWAC to run the &#8220;Sisters in Spirit&#8221; 
programme.  This educational and policy programme aims at addressing violence, particularly 
racialized and/or sexualized violence, against Aboriginal  women through awareness-raising and 
practical-oriented research, aimed at gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>44. Another serious issue affecting indigenous women that was pointed out in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report is the violation of property rights on Aboriginal reserves as a result 
of gaps in the existing legal regulation (ibid., para. 31).  The Special Rapporteur called on the 
Government to address &#8220;with high priority the lack of legislative protection regarding on-reserve 
Matrimonial Real Property which places First Nation women living on reserves at a 
disadvantage&#8221; (ibid., para. 112).  In June 2006, after a parliamentary committee published a 
report on the issue, the Government announced its intention to take legal steps to ensure legal 
protection of Aboriginal women&#8217;s matrimonial real property.  Since then, the Ministry of 
Indian Affairs, AFN and NWAC have led a process of consultation with representatives of over 
630 First Nations to provide input for that proposal. 
</p>
<p>45. An important recent development is the reform of the Canadian Human Rights Act, 
whose section 67 exempts any actions taken by band councils and the Federal Government under 
the Indian Act from the application of the Act and from the system of petitions included in the 
Act.  The Special Rapporteur specifically recommended that &#8220;the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission be enabled to receive complaints about human rights violations of First Nations, 
including grievances related to the Indian Act; and that section 67 of the Human Rights Act be 
repealed&#8221; (ibid., para. 108).  In December 2006 the Government introduced legislation to repeal 
section 67, and when this reform enters into effect, indigenous peoples and individuals will have 
the ability to seek recourse with the Human Rights Commission.  This measure is expected to 
increase the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, particularly those of Aboriginal women. 
</p>
<p>46. Despite these &#8220;best practices&#8221; in the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations, participants in the Open Forum held in Ottawa in October 2006 expressed 
concern about the lack of institutional action in areas covered by these recommendations.  A 
particularly controversial issue, also referred to by Members of Parliament in interviews with the 
Special Rapporteur, was Canada&#8217;s negative vote on the United Nations Declaration of the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples at the first session of the Human Rights Council, in March 2006.  Efforts 
to reduce the gap in socio-economic indicators between indigenous peoples and the rest of 
Canadian society have been thwarted by the Government&#8217;s failure to honour the Kelowna 
Accord, agreed to in November 2005 by the Federal Government, all the provinces and 
territories, and all the national Aboriginal organizations.  Despite ongoing efforts to negotiate 
comprehensive land agreements, numerous conflicts still exist as a result of the failure to 
recognize indigenous property rights over indigenous lands, including the recent case of 
Caledonia, in Ontario.<b>

</p>
<p>&#8220;prompt ratification&#8221; of ILO Convention No. 169, as Chile is one of the few Latin American 
States that still have not ratified this fundamental instrument.  The Government has taken 
substantive steps in this direction, and in June 2006, on the occasion of the National Day of 
Indigenous Peoples, formally expressed the commitment to &#8220;achieve, as soon as possible&#8221; the 
ratification of Convention No. 169.  A recent international human rights observation mission 
assessed the state of the ratification process, which now depends on the support of only 
two senators.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>48. Positive signs have been reported concerning the change of the criminal policy towards 
the so-called &#8220;Mapuche conflict&#8221; in the south of the country.  The judicialization of the many 
existing conflicts over lands claimed by Mapuche communities in the south, and specifically, the 
application of the anti-terrorist legislation in a number of cases related to indigenous land claims, 
received particular attention in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on his 2003 visit.  In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report recommended not penalizing &#8220;legitimate protest 
activities or social demands by indigenous organizations and communities&#8221; and that the 
anti-terrorist legislation should not be applied in these cases (ibid., paras. 69-70)<i>. 
</i></p>
<p>49. Despite the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations, judicial processes against Mapuche 
activities continued in recent years, leading to further long prison sentences.  A new judicial 
process initiated in 2005 against members of Mapuche organizations, including some of those 
already serving prison sentences, for allegedly engaging in criminal &#8220;illegal terrorist 
association&#8221;, an accusation that became the object of a national and international outcry, 
prompted the Special Rapporteur to address an open letter to the President of Chile.  The Court 
of Temuco eventually acquitted the defendants, and this acquittal marked a turning point in the 
judiciary&#8217;s position concerning the unreasonable application of existing anti-terrorist legislation. 
50. A hunger strike initiated in 2006 by the four convicts in the Poluco Pidenco case again 
brought domestic and international attention to this serious issue, and several mandate holders of 
the Human Rights Council addressed the Government in that regard.  This led to a 
reconsideration of the criminal policy with regard to the land conflicts in southern Chile, and the 
recently elected President declared publicly that the anti-terrorist legislation would not be 
applied again in this context.  The Government also introduced an initiative to reform the 
anti-terrorist law, aimed at excluding from the scope of the crime of terrorism acts against 
property with no effect on the life and physical integrity of persons or the national security.  The 
law is still pending consideration by the Senate. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to set up a programme to reduce poverty 
among the country&#8217;s indigenous communities (ibid., para. 62) has been the object of special 
consideration by the Government, notably the inclusion of the total indigenous population 
estimated to live in extreme poverty (73,<footnote name="5">8. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recent follow-up visit to Guatemala allowed him to observe a 
number of changes and advances regarding the situation of indigenous peoples in the country in 
line with some of the recommendations included in the report on his 2002 visit.  The Special 
Rapporteur noted in particular an increasing level of awareness among State authorities of the 
need to give priority attention to indigenous issues. </footnote>00 people) under the system of social protection &#8220;Chile

implementing the programme &#8220;Origins&#8221; (<i>Or&#237;genes</i>), an ambitious development project within the 
scope of the Indigenous Law (Law No. 19.253), with the support of the Inter-American

implemented by the National Corporation on Indigenous Development (Corporaci&#243;n Nacional de 
Desarrollo Ind&#237;gena, CONADI), and Phase II will be implemented in the period 2007-2011. 
</p>
<p>52. The above examples show that Chile has multiplied its efforts to improve the situation of 
indigenous peoples in recent years.  However, these efforts are still thwarted by the limited 
recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in the existing legal and institutional framework.  The 
constitutional reform adopted in November 2006 failed to include a recognition of indigenous 
peoples and their rights, and subsequent proposals of constitutional reform fall very short of 
existing international standards and have not involved indigenous peoples.  The Indigenous Land 
and Water Fund has proved an insufficient mechanism, partly due to the failure of the existing 
mechanism to affirm ancestral rights and to review irregular adjudication of indigenous lands in 
the past.  Development projects continue to threaten the livelihood of indigenous communities in 
areas claimed as part of their traditional territories, as in the case of the Pascua Lama project in 
Atacama, opposed by the Diaguita community of Huasco Alto.  Cases of police violence and 
abuse in indigenous communities have recently been documented, as in the case of the 
Temucuicui community.  Meanwhile, the Mapuche convicted of terrorism continue to serve long 
prison sentences. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur in the report on his visit to Colombia in 2004 expresses 
his concern about the threat of extinction hanging over 12 small groups of indigenous 
peoples living in the Amazon region who are experiencing a &#8220;humanitarian emergency&#8221; as a 
result of armed conflict, illicit crops, environmental destruction and economic megaprojects 
(see E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.2, box, p. 16).  Particularly worrisome is the situation of the 
Nukak Maku, an isolated hunter-gatherer community in the Department of Gavire.  Their 
existence has become endangered in recent years as they have become embroiled in armed 
confrontations between guerrillas, paramilitaries and the Colombian Army, and as their lands 
have been encroached upon by coca growers.  The number of community members that have 
been displaced from their traditional lands is now estimated at more than 200, approximately 
50 per cent of the total population.  The Special Rapporteur has addressed urgent appeals to the 
Government of Colombia on various occasions concerning the forced eviction of the Nukak and 
the killing of their leaders.  The Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Adviser to the 
Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, is currently involved in a dialogue with the 
Government concerning this pressing issue. 
</p>
<p>54. In June 2006, the Government presented a Plan for Integrated Assistance to Vulnerable 
Communities.  The Plan includes special measures to attend to the urgent needs of the 
Nukak Maku, particularly in the fields of health and food security, as well as the temporary 
relocation of the displaced population in Puerto Ospina.  This movement to areas that do not 
belong to the Nukak traditional territory has been the subject of controversy, and the recent 
suicide of a Nukak traditional leader has increased the international focus on the critical situation 
of this community.  In a parallel initiative, OHCHR Colombia, in cooperation with the Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNDP and UNHCR, has undertaken a comprehensive 
study on the situation of the Nukak Maku and have advised the Government on further possible 
actions to address it. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>55. Another serious situation analysed in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on Colombia is the 
selective killing and forced disappearance of indigenous leaders and traditional authorities, at the 
hands of both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries.  By way of illustration, it offers the specific 
situation of the Embera-Katio people of Alto Sin&#250;, who have suffered violence and intimidation 
because of their opposition to the construction of the Urr&#225; hydroelectric dam on their territory, 
and who have been granted precautionary measures by the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights (ibid., box, p. 10).  In connection with this and similar cases, the Special 
Rapporteur recommended that State authorities should immediately implement the precautionary 
measures granted by the Inter-American Commission to various indigenous communities.  A 
positive development in this regard is the establishment of a mixed committee, comprised of 
government authorities, civil society, representatives of ONIC and authorities of the 
communities concerned, with OHCHR participating as an observer.  The committee undertakes 
periodic visits to the region to verify the situation of the Embera-Kat&#237;o and the state of 
implementation of the Commission&#8217;s precautionary measures.  The committee further requests 
specific government bodies to take action concerning the implementation of these measures. 
</p>
<p>56. In addition, in May 2005, the Government reached an agreement with the traditional 
authorities of the Embera-Kat&#237;o to ameliorate the situation of the communities affected by the 
Urr&#225; dam.  The agreement consists of different measures in areas like the environment, 
education, health and food supply, including the elaboration of a plan to replace traditional 
hunting and gathering activities affected by the construction of the dam.  The agreement further 
incorporates the Government&#8217;s agreement to hold periodic meetings with indigenous 
representatives concerning the recommendations in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports.  But much 
remains to be done to restore the livelihood of this endangered people. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite these specific cases in which the Government has taken action in favour of 
particularly vulnerable communities, the overall situation of indigenous peoples in Colombia has 
not improved since the Special Rapporteur visited the country.  The International Verification 
Mission that visited several indigenous areas in 2006 concluded that indigenous people, and 
particularly women, are victims of serious human rights abuses and breaches of humanitarian 
law in the context of the ongoing armed conflict in the country, including selective killings, 
enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and breaches of due process.  Ongoing 
human rights violations against members of the Wiwa people and other communities of the 
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta constitute a particularly serious example of this pattern.  
Indigenous organizations continue to denounce the impact of megaprojects on their traditional 
territories, as exemplified by the resumption of oil exploitation in the U&#8217;wa territory, in the 
Departments of Santander and Arauca, and the plans to construct a gas pipeline across the 
Wayuu traditional lands on the border with Venezuela. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on Guatemala paid special attention to the 1996 Peace 
Agreements, which include the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  The 
agreement defines a comprehensive programme of action to advance the recognition and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples (see E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.2, para. 4).  Given the 
comprehensive character of these agreements, and the setback detected in their implementation, 
the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government &#8220;carefully review the progress 
achieved in implementing the Peace Agreements insofar as they affect the indigenous peoples,&#8221; 
and take &#8220;all appropriate measures to ensure full implementation&#8221; (ibid., para. 71).  An 
encouraging development in this regard is the adoption in August 2005 of the Framework-Law 
on the Peace Agreement (Decree No. 52-2005), with the objective of regulating the 
implementation and monitoring of State action in this realm, and which makes the 
implementation of the Peace Agreements a legal commitment of the State. 
</p>
<p>60. In connection with the Peace Agreements, the Special Rapporteur also welcomed a 
number of initiatives to seek redress for the atrocities committed during the civil war.  In 2004, 
in implementation of the decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the 
<i>Masacre de Plan de S&#225;nchez </i>case, concerning a massacre in a Mayan village in 1982 committed 
by the military, the Government organized a public event at which it acknowledged its 
responsibility for the atrocity and apologized to the victims and their relatives.  The Presidential 
Commission on Human Rights (Comisi&#243;n Presidencial de Derechos Humanos, COPREDEH) 
initiated in February 2006 a process of compensation of the victims of the massacre. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report emphasizes the need to strengthen and prioritize 
measures to combat the high level of racism and discrimination in the country.  There have been 
a number of court decisions in recent years regarding cases of racial discrimination, which is a 
crime under the Guatemalan Penal Code.  Institutional action in this regard has been reinforced 
with the establishment of the Presidential Commission to Combat Discrimination and Racism 
against Indigenous Peoples (Comisi&#243;n Presidencial contra la Discriminaci&#243;n y el Racismo contra 
los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas en Guatemala, CODIRSA).  As a follow-up to a specific recommendation 
in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report (ibid., para. 67), CODIRSA, with the technical assistance of 
OHCHR Guatemala, has announced the launching in 2007 of a national campaign for 
coexistence and elimination of racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>62. Another issue of special concern that was pointed out in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report 
on Guatemala is the situation of serious and systematic discrimination faced by indigenous 
women.  In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommended the adoption of &#8220;special 
measures&#8221;, including &#8220;greater political, legal and economic support to the Office for the Defence 
of Indigenous Women [Defensoria de la Mujer Ind&#237;gena, DEMI]&#8221; (ibid., para. 79).  A positive 
development in recent years has been the strengthening of the work of DEMI, with the support of 
international organizations and agencies, including OHCHR, UNDP, UNICEF and others.  
DEMI is now a key actor in the national human rights machinery, and requires continuous 
support to perform its important task. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report further recommends that Guatemala strengthen the 
educational system as a &#8220;national priority&#8221;, including the extension of bilingual education to all 
areas of the country (ibid., para. 77).  An important measure of the implementation of this 
recommendation is the establishment of a Vice-Ministry of Bilingual Inter-cultural Education in 
2003 and the adoption of Government Agreement No. 22-2004 on the extension of multicultural </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>bilingual education in the education system, including the development of appropriate curricula.  
In addition, in 2003 Congress passed the Law on National Languages (Decree No. 19-2003), 
which officially recognizes the Mayan, Garifuna and Xinka languages and promotes their 
preservation and use in the Administration.  This new legal and institutional framework has been 
welcomed by indigenous organizations and experts, who now demand its full implementation. 
</p>
<p>64. Despite these positive examples, and all the efforts deployed, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
second visit to Guatemala gave him the opportunity to ascertain that the levels of racism and 
discrimination against indigenous peoples are still worryingly high, and that the situation of 
indigenous women and children deserves urgent attention.  The implementation of the Peace 
Agreements, and particularly of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is 
thwarted by insufficient institutional backing and budgetary allocations.  The justice system 
needs support to ensure that victims of human rights violations, and particularly indigenous 
women, find redress, and indigenous customary law needs to be recognized and incorporated in 
the work of the judiciary.  Despite the acknowledgment of the atrocities committed in the past, 
the Special Rapporteur perceived that there will be no justice in Guatemala unless all those 
responsible for these acts are brought to justice. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>65. After a controversial constitutional reform was adopted in 2001, granting more powers to 
the states, many of the positive developments in the country concerning indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights have taken place at the state level.  Nevertheless, the federal constitutional review on 
indigenous issues remains at stalemate.  State legislatures have followed the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to adopt legislation recognizing and protecting the rights of 
indigenous peoples (see E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.2, para. 66), including the Law on Indigenous 
Rights, Culture and Organization of Nayarit, Campeche and Quintana Roo.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Important efforts have taken place to promote the implementation of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations concerning the review of the administration of justice in order to 
address indigenous peoples&#8217; specific needs (ibid., para. 82).  Various initiatives have taken place 
to promote the consolidation and extension of the system of bilingual translators in courts, as 
recommended by the Special Rapporteur (ibid., para. 85).  The Federal Government has 
undertaken a programme of training of bilingual legal aid services, and in Oaxaca students at the 
Benito Ju&#225;rez University work as bilingual legal aid lawyers.  In Chiapas, the Office of the 
Prosecutor on Indigenous Justice (<i>Fiscal&#237;a de Justicia Ind&#237;gena</i>) was created in 2005, and is 
staffed by indigenous lawyers who receive special training to ensure that the rights of indigenous 
peoples are respected in cases involving indigenous communities and individuals.  In Quer&#233;taro, 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office established a mobile office specializing in indigenous issues.  
Several states, including the States of M&#233;xico, Michoac&#225;n and Puebla, have started programmes 
to train legal translators and interpreters in indigenous languages.

</p>
<p>67. In line with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to incorporate indigenous law in 
the judicial system (ibid., para. 93), new &#8220;indigenous courts&#8221; or &#8220;peace and reconciliation courts&#8221; 
have been established in Campeche, Chiapas, Hidalgo, Puebla, Quintana Roo and San Luis 
Potos&#237;, comprised of members of local indigenous communities, with power to hear civil and 
family cases, as well as minor criminal cases, on the basis of indigenous law and custom.  The 
National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisi&#243;n Nacional para 
el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas, CDI) has conducted studies on indigenous law and its 
&#8220;compatibility&#8221; with human rights norms and national legislation. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to review the case files of indigenous persons 
prosecuted by the different courts in order to &#8220;remedy any irregularities&#8221; (ibid., para. 86)<b>10</b> has 
been addressed by CDI, which has reviewed thousands of case files and is preparing a census of 
the indigenous population in national prisons.  Similar programmes have been implemented in 
Hidalgo, Michoac&#225;n and Oaxaca. 
</p>
<p>69. A best practice is the implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to 
provide institutional strengthening of and adequate resources to bilingual intercultural education 
in the country (ibid., para. 102).  The Ministry of Public Education has recently expanded 
bilingual secondary education, already provided in preschool and primary school, through a 
special course on indigenous peoples taught in several indigenous languages, and a number of 
&#8220;intercultural high schools&#8221; and &#8220;communitarian high schools&#8221;, with adapted curricula and 
teaching in indigenous languages, have been created in areas of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Tabasco.  
Eight &#8220;intercultural universities&#8221; have been set up in indigenous regions in the States of Chiapas, 
Guerrero, M&#233;xico, Michoac&#225;n, Puebla, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Veracruz.  The use of 
indigenous languages in education and in other spheres of public life has also been reinforced by 
the recently created National Institute on Indigenous Languages, responsible for the 
implementation of the General Law on the Linguistic Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2003). 
</p>
<p>70. Many of these best practices are the result of specific governmental and 
non-governmental initiatives to follow up on the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
(see paragraphs 21-23 and 38 above).  Despite these positive steps, many important human rights 
concerns pointed out in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations have still not been addressed.  
The existing constitutional framework remains contested by many indigenous peoples and 
organizations and, notwithstanding the efforts of CDI, the reform has actually led to a lessening 
of the Federal Government&#8217;s attention to indigenous issues.  The agrarian legal and judicial 
system is obsolete in relation to the contemporary recognition of indigenous rights over their 
land and natural resources, and environmental policies have failed to sufficiently involve 
indigenous peoples, as in the case of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve.  Development 
projects continue to threaten indigenous livelihoods, and the lack of clear consultation 
mechanisms has led to protracted conflicts, such as the case of the La Parota dam.  The situation 
in Chiapas continues in a state of paralysis and human rights abuses by security forces and 
paramilitary groups have raised serious national and international concern, as exemplified by 
recent events in the State of Oaxaca. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  The Special Rapporteur recommended particularly (para. 87) that CDI should be assigned a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;greater role&#8221; in this regard. </p>

</p>
<p><b>F.  The Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>71. Information from different sources indicates that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to the 
Philippines in 2003 has helped strengthen the country&#8217;s institutional machinery with regard to 
the rights of indigenous peoples.  The Special Rapporteur recommended, for instance, that the 
work of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) should be supported &#8220;to 
become firmly established as the lead agency in protecting and promoting indigenous rights&#8221; 
with the widest possible participation of indigenous peoples (E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.3, 
para. 67 (a)).  Since then, NCIP, with the support of international governmental and 
non-governmental donors, has strengthened its different lines of activity, particularly in relation 
to the delineation and recognition of Certificates of Ancestral Domain Title (CADTs) and the 
Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development and Protection Plan. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report further recommended that NCIP call for a &#8220;National 
Consultative Assembly&#8221; (ibid., para. 67 (a)), with the objective of including indigenous peoples 
and organizations in the planning and implementation of the Commission&#8217;s activities.  NCIP 
convened a National Forum in November 2006, leading to the establishment of the Indigenous 
Peoples Consultative Body (IPCB) operating at the national, regional and provincial levels.  The 
composition of IPCB is tripartite, including representatives of NCIP, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations and NGOs.  Despite criticism concerning their membership, the establishment of 
these bodies has been seen as a positive development towards enhanced participation by 
indigenous peoples in the making and implementation of NCIP policies. 
</p>
<p>73. NCIP has strengthened its cooperation with the National Commission on Human Rights 
(NCHR) on indigenous issues.  As recommended by the Special Rapporteur, NCHR has 
expanded its activities in the area of indigenous rights, including the development of training 
courses on the content of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act for the police, the military, and 
other governmental bodies.  Also in line with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to 
promote special training programmes regarding the content of the Act (ibid., para. 67 (c)), the 
Government and civil society have concentrated efforts on training public officials, with special 
emphasis on members of the judiciary, with the cooperation of the Judicial Academy and the 
Ateneo Law School. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations to extend education in indigenous areas 
(ibid., para. 67 (h)) and standardize the rights of indigenous peoples as at all levels of formal 
schooling (ibid., para. 67 (m)) were well received by the Department of Education, which in 
2004 issued a permit to operate primary schools for indigenous peoples (Dep. Order No. 42).  
These schools can adapt their curriculum and calendar to the particularities of indigenous 
communities, and also incorporate &#8220;para-teachers&#8221; from these communities in school teaching 
activities.  Following the holding of the Third National Assembly on Indigenous Education in 
2005, the Department of Education is currently embarked on a process of mainstreaming 
indigenous issues in the general curricula, in cooperation with professors of the University of 
the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>75. Significant advances have been reported in the implementation of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to promote policy-oriented research by universities and civil 
society organizations regarding the rights of indigenous peoples (ibid., para. 67 (l)).  National 
consultations were promoted in 2004 and 2005 by Tebtebba, the main indigenous research centre </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>in the country, on strengthening the Philippine Chapter of the Indigenous Peoples Global 
Research and Education Network, an international network of individuals and institutions 
promoting indigenous research, education and development. 
</p>
<p>76. Nevertheless, the main areas of concern pointed out in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on 
the Philippines remain unaddressed.  Despite the many efforts deployed by NCIP and its partners 
to promote the delineation and recognition of CADTs, NICP continues to be underfunded, and 
the rate at which titles are granted every year is still very limited in relation to the number of 
requests.  Increased tension has been detected between the demarcation of indigenous lands and 
the agrarian reform promoted by the Department of Agrarian Reform, and certain indigenous 
territories have been identified as agrarian reform areas where individual titles are being granted 
to individual peasants.  Serious human rights violations continue to be reported in relation to 
indigenous leaders and human rights defenders, a situation which was the subject of particular 
concern in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report.  Non-governmental sources have reported more 
than 75 cases of recent extrajudicial killings of indigenous individuals, many of which have not 
been thoroughly investigated. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>77. The various cases reviewed in this study suggest that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic 
and country reports have had a different level of impact.  Inasmuch as they have the status of 
official United Nations documents elaborated from an independent viewpoint, thematic reports 
are part of ongoing discussions and policymaking concerning issues of special relevance for 
indigenous peoples, and their impact cannot be easily evaluated in terms of the implementation 
of the specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country visits have generally had a more direct impact on legal, 
social and political dynamics at the national level in relation to the recognition and protection of 
the rights of indigenous peoples.  These reports, and the visits themselves, have helped promote 
spaces of dialogue between States and indigenous peoples; have contributed to educating 
government actors, civil society and the general public on the situation of indigenous peoples in 
their own countries; and have been appropriated by indigenous peoples and human rights 
organizations as an advocacy tool. 
</p>
<p>79. The recommendations included in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports do not provide a 
&#8220;magic fix&#8221;, and do not generate automatic and speedy changes in the situation of the rights of 
indigenous peoples.  The level of implementation of these recommendations varies according to 
different country situations and the issues tackled by those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Several initiatives have been undertaken over the last years by Governments, the 
United Nations system, civil society and indigenous organizations to monitor and promote the 
implementation of the recommendations included in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports.  These 
experiences demonstrate that, if left for institutional action alone, the recommendations are 
rarely implemented, but implementation needs to be pushed forward in close cooperation with 
the Government and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>81. In countries where follow-up mechanisms exist, institutional efforts towards 
implementation have been more sustained, leading to concrete changes in law and practice.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/32/Add.4* 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>These mechanisms have taken different forms, such as monitoring bodies, national forums and 
follow-up missions, and have involved a myriad of governmental and non-governmental actors, 
as well as international agencies. 
</p>
<p>82. The process of implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations has opened 
spaces for dialogue between Governments, civil society and indigenous peoples and 
organizations.  In all cases where substantive advances can be reported, indigenous peoples have 
been actively involved in the process. 
</p>
<p>83. The comparative analysis of best practices in several countries shows that the effective 
changes in implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations are more easily 
detected in relation to recommendations related to the areas of social policy and development, as 
well as to the strengthening of specific government institutions and policies related to indigenous 
affairs.  However, many of the main recommendations of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports 
remain unaddressed, particularly in the fields of legal and constitutional reform and indigenous 
land and resource rights, including the right of consultation in relation to development projects in 
indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>84. These experiences suggest that, despite the advances that can be identified, the general 
record of implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations is gloomy.  Much 
remains to be done by the Governments, international agencies and other relevant stakeholders to 
bridge the &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; that divides international and domestic norms and the serious 
human rights violations that indigenous peoples continue to experience in all parts of the world.
