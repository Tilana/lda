<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on Human

special mechanisms of the Council that have reported on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of migrants, particularly those held in detention centres,

(A/HRC/11/7), which focuses on the protection of children in the context of migration,  
</p>
<p> <i>Aware also </i>of the report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (A/HRC/7/4), 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the importance of addressing the situation of migrants in detention centres 
and in administrative detention, which creates conditions for the potential violation of their 
human rights, through a comprehensive, integrated, concerted and balanced approach,

geographic and gender participation of Governments, relevant experts and representatives of

address the issue of the detention of migrants and to explore ways to promote and protect their 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To elaborate on how to reduce the recourse to and duration of detention of persons 
who enter or remain in a country in an irregular manner, as well as on how to provide them with 
appropriate access to due legal process; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
provide the necessary assistance and support for holding the panel.
