<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to resolution 19/36, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion, on 
11 June 2013, at its twenty-third session, on common challenges facing States in their 
efforts to secure democracy and the rule of law from a human rights perspective, as well as 
on lessons learned and best practices in the engagement of the State with the international 
community to support such processes. 
</p>
<p>2. The debate focused on two main themes, namely (a) the common, salient challenges 
to democracy and the rule of law in both settled democracies and States transitioning 
towards democracy, and (b) best practices and strategies to address these challenges at the 
national, regional and global levels. The discussion was based on a study on common 
challenges facing States in their efforts to secure democracy and the rule of law from a 
human rights perspective (A/HRC/22/29) and was submitted to the Human Rights Council 
at its twenty-second session. The study was prepared by the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), at the request of the Council pursuant to 
resolution 19/35, in consultation with States, national human rights institutions, civil 
society, relevant intergovernmental bodies and international organizations.   
</p>
<p>3. The panel discussion was co-moderated by the President of the Human Rights 
Council, Remigiusz Achilles Henczel, and the BBC correspondent to Geneva, Imogen 
Folkes, and opened by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay. The 
panellists were the Romanian State Secretary for Political Affairs and Liaison with 
Parliament, Radu Podgorean; the Permanent Delegate of Peru to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris, Manuel Rodr&#237;guez 
Cuadros; the Secretary-General of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral 
Assistance, Vidar Helgesen; the President of the Moroccan National Human Rights 
Council, Driss el-Yazami; the Vice-President of the Arab Parliament of the League of Arab 
States, Aisha al-Mannai; and a member of the Executive Board of Femmes Africa 
Soldarit&#233;, Brigitte Balipou.  
</p>
<p>4. In an effort to render the Human Rights Council more accessible to persons with 
disabilities and to allow them to participate in the work of the Council on an equal basis 
with others, sign language interpretation and captioning were provided and webcasted. 
Physical accessibility was promoted by making room facilities wheelchair friendly. 
</p>
<p>5. The present summary was prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/36. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>6. In her opening statement, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, 
recalled that democracy, the rule of law and human rights are fully interdependent and 
mutually reinforcing, and that the weakening of one immediately endangers the existence of 
the others. She stated that beyond elections, which occur once every four or five years, 
democracy involves continuous participation of the people in political processes. It also 
implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues and to inform public 
opinion without censorship or restraint. She also stressed that effectively functioning 
oversight processes and mechanisms, which can provide accountability and safeguard 
against abuse of power, are equally indispensable, and that democracy also entails the 
existence of transparent and accountable governing institutions. The legitimacy of these 
institutions depends upon compliance with the fundamental principles of the rule of law and </p>


<p>respect for human rights. Moreover, the High Commissioner confirmed that, while 
democracy can and should be contextualized, its core values are universal. In reference to 
the hurdles faced by democracy, the High Commissioner underlined that there are many 
experiences and good practices on ways to overcome these various challenges. Experience 
has shown that new democracies, as soon as they come to life, must address past human 
rights violations, and prioritize the fight against impunity. In this regard, transitional justice 
processes are crucial. Whether they are new or mature democracies, States must ensure that 
their governing institutions are sufficiently strong to maintain order and preserve political 
stability. Furthermore, the High Commissioner referred to socioeconomic inequalities and 
corruption as serious challenges to democratic values. The High Commissioner concluded 
by emphasizing the responsibility of the international community to support States not only 
in the early stages of a transition to democracy, but also in the consolidation phase. 
</p>
<p>7. The Romanian State Secretary for Political Affairs and Liaison with Parliament, 
Radu Podgorean, stated that, over the last two decades, Romania has been in a process of 
transition from dictatorship to democracy. He noted that the main challenges are of a 
political nature and includes the inherited communist legal system and mentalities, the  
political culture shaped by authoritarianism, and mistrust in public institutions and 
authorities. The essential elements that have contributed to the success of democratization 
are: the guarantee of all human rights for all citizens, in legislation and in practice; the 
establishment of strong, respected and accountable institutions; and the creation of a legal 
and judicial system defined by the rule of law, including a favourable framework for 
building a strong civil society and an uncensored media. In addition, the State Secretary 
underlined that the new Constitution, with its checks and balances mechanisms, free and 
fair elections and a strong and independent justice system, are further cornerstones in 
building the road to a democratic society. He emphasized that the national democratization 
process has not been the result of exclusively internal endeavours. Since the beginning of 
the transition, Romania has relied on cooperation with international partners, both at the 
European and global level, including the Council of Europe and the European Union. He 
concluded by saying that the United Nations can and should pursue a comprehensive 
approach to human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and should provide space for 
coordination of various global or regional initiatives in this field.  
</p>
<p>8. The Vice-President of the Arab Parliament of the League of Arab States, Aisha al-
Mannai, underscored that democracy, human rights and the rule of law are all very closely 
related. She also recalled that everyone is entitled to equal rights regardless of race, religion 
or gender, as well as recalling the importance of fair laws. The Vice-President of the Arab 
Parliament highlighted that various Human Rights Council resolutions have thoroughly 
tackled the issue of democracy and its relationship with human rights and rule of law. In 
that context, she emphasized that there is no single definition of democracy. Furthermore, 
democracy not only relates to the political arena but also encompasses an economic and 
social perspective. The Vice-President of the Arab Parliament also noted with interest the 
study prepared by OHCHR and presented to the twenty-second session of the Council, and 
noted that it gave an accurate picture of the interdependency between democracy, human 
rights and the rule of law. In addition, she pointed out various challenges to democracy and 
highlighted that one major impediment comes from the leadership itself, as exemplified by 
the Arab Spring. In her statement, the Vice-President of the Arab Parliament called for the 
recognition of the rights of Palestinians to a free and independent State. She also stressed 
the need to fight religious extremism and terrorism, including when not linked to religion. 
Finally, she recommended the organization of trainings and workshops on democracy and 
the rule of law, in order to promote mutual respect and build trust among people. 
</p>
<p>9. The Secretary-General of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral 
Assistance, Vidar Helgesen, welcomed the particular emphasis in Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/36 on the notion that there was no single model of democracy and that </p>


<p>democracy did not belong to any country. He further highlighted that the universal nature of 
democracy, as something which people all over the world aspire to, is clear from citizens&#8217; 
own actions and demands for democracy, as demonstrated most recently in North Africa. 
The Secretary-General of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral 
Assistance identified four key areas in which democracy can be strengthened through better 
national and international actions. First, he emphasized that there is a need to better connect 
international human rights commitments made by States with democracy at the national 
level. Secondly, he stressed that it is critical to respect and promote the &#8220;genuine&#8221; nature of 
elections. When elections are carried out with integrity, they bolster democracy, respect for 
human rights and result in elected officials &#8211; women and men &#8211; who are more likely to 
represent their citizens&#8217; interests. Strengthening national capacity to conduct elections with 
integrity is clearly critical, as is the need for more concerted international attention on this 
issue. Thirdly, the Secretary-General of the International Institute for Democracy and 
Electoral Assistance pointed out what the United Nations itself can do better. While 
stressing that there is a powerful normative and conceptual foundation for the work of the 
United Nation on democracy-building, he suggested that the United Nations could better 
integrate its democracy-building work with its human rights operations on the ground; that 
the work of the United Nations in the area of rule of law could be enhanced; and that there 
is a need for increased focus on constitutions and constitution-building. Fourthly, he 
underscored the importance of enhancing the role of democracy, human rights and the rule 
of law in the post-2015 development framework. He concluded that experience has shown 
that democracy and human rights are at the core of inclusive, legitimate and responsive 
political institutions and processes, which are among the key transformative shifts required 
in addressing the challenges of the new era of development goals. 
</p>
<p>10. The member of the Executive Board of Femmes Africa Soldarit&#233;, Brigitte Balipou, 
referred to the situation in the Central African Republic. She explained that in 1990, the 
country embarked on the path to democracy, but that this process was soon undermined by 
recurring conflict in the region. She pointed out that numerous dysfunctions have affected 
various democratic initiatives in the country. These include mismanaged elections; the 
politicization of all State functions; bad governance characterized by corruption, impunity, 
exclusion, tribalism and family management of resources; lack of dialogue; lack of 
independence of the judiciary; restrictions on freedom of the press; and extrajudicial and 
summary executions. She further stated that at the social level, the country is afflicted by 
widespread poverty, illiteracy, the exclusion of minority groups and women, and lack of 
respect for ethnic, religious and cultural factors. Moreover, the collapse of the State has left 
a security void in the country. The State is no longer capable of controlling its territory, 
exposing citizens, particularly women and children, to abuses by armed groups. The 
member of the Executive Board of Femmes Africa Soldarit&#233; also stated that from a 
humanitarian perspective, the crisis has resulted in the displacement of 200,000 people. In 
addition, more than 80,000 people, of whom 57,000 are children aged under 5, are exposed 
to the risk of severe malnutrition during the dry season.  She recommended several 
measures to reinforce and strengthen democracy in the Central African Republic: the 
establishment of a democratic regime and return to constitutional order; the creation of the 
necessary conditions to facilitate participation of citizens in public affairs, as well as 
transparency, access to information, freedom of the press and accountability; the promotion 
of democracy and the rule of law in order to create conditions conducive to holding 
transparent, fair and free presidential elections; the independence of the judicial system; and 
the participation of the judiciary in reforming the security sector, with a view to restoring 
the authority of the State. Finally, the member of the Executive Board of Femmes Africa 
Soldarit&#233; called for the involvement of women in mediation and negotiation processes, and 
consolidation of peace.  </p>


<p>11. The Permanent Delegate of Peru to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization in Paris, Manuel Rodr&#237;guez Cuadros, stated that, while social 
inclusion, the fight against poverty and inequality, and the fight for decent work for all are 
core tasks of democracy, they are not necessarily constitutive elements of a democratic 
regime. The key to tackle challenges with regard to democracy in Latin America is to take a 
human rights-based approach. In that context, the Permanent Delegate of Peru to UNESCO 
made reference to the emergence of the human right to democracy through national and 
international norms, as well as the jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals. He 
gave the example of the Inter-American Democratic Charter which affirms that the peoples 
of the Americas have a right to democracy, and their governments have an obligation to 
promote and defend it. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in the cases of 
<i>Vel&#225;squez&#8211;Rodr&#237;guez </i>v.<i> Honduras</i> (1988) and <i>God&#237;nez&#8211;Cruz</i> v. <i>Honduras</i> (1989), has also 
acknowledged that the realization of human rights takes place in a democratic society. The 
Court found that States parties are obliged to organize the governmental apparatus and, in 
general, all structures through which public power is exercised, so that they are judicially 
capable of ensuring the free and full enjoyment of human rights. In this context, the 
Permanent Delegate of Peru to UNESCO also stressed that the consolidation and quality of 
democracy in Latin America is directly linked to the rule of law. The main elements include 
the degree of respect for the separation of powers; the autonomous, efficient and non-
discriminatory functioning of the branches of power; respect for freedom of expression and 
association; and the effective guarantee and exercise of individual freedoms and civil and 
political rights, as well as the progressive realization of economic, social, cultural and 
environmental rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The President of the Moroccan National Human Rights Council, Driss el-Yazami, 
stated that the panel was held at a time when the Middle East and North African region is 
experiencing major sociopolitical changes. These upheavals pose new challenges to human 
rights and human rights defenders, which cannot be overcome without understanding the 
root causes of these historical transformations. He added that these upheavals have 
underlined the role of youth as key actors in the periods of transition. The President of the 
Moroccan National Human Rights Council pointed out that the Arab Spring is the product 
of demographic, urban and educational transitions. The demographic transition is 
characterized both by an increasing number of young people and a sharp fall in birth rates. 
This in turn had led to deep sociocultural change characterized by a shift in the patriarchal 
foundations of society, transformation of relationships between the generations and 
between men and women, the emergence of the individual and the questioning of 
traditional power-based relationships, in both the private and public spheres. Furthermore, 
the generalization of education and rapid urbanization has contributed to the emergence of 
educated, urbanized and technically competent youth. He pointed out that, following the 
popular uprisings, the new actors are faced with the challenges of drafting new 
constitutions and new laws, establishing transitional justice mechanisms and reorganizing 
relations between the State and citizens. The President of the Moroccan National Human 
Rights Council highlighted that the main challenge is to enlarge the democratic space and 
create an inclusive State model that guarantees all rights and fundamental freedoms. He 
recalled that the means of creating such a model are: elections and popular sovereignty; 
peaceful change of power; rejection of a sanctified leader, one-party system or spiritual 
guide; negotiation as a means of resolving differences; an autonomous and dynamic civil 
society; public space for discussion and debate (parliament, free and independent press, 
etc.); the exercise of power by legitimate and democratically elected political parties; and 
accountability of those mandated to govern and manage public affairs. The President of the 
Moroccan National Human Rights Council concluded by emphasizing the fundamental role 
of human rights as a common ground upon which to build new democratic institutions. </p>

Foundation for Peace and Development; Association of World Citizens. 
</p>
<p><b> A. General remarks 
</b></p>
<p>14. A number of delegations emphasized that democracy relies on respect for human 
rights and the rule of law and that these three concepts are interlinked and mutually 
reinforcing. Without their respect, sustainable development and peace are also not possible. 
In that regard, a question was raised as to how human rights and democracy can be framed 
as development goals and which indicators should be used to measure progress. Several 
delegations underlined that although democracy and its underlying principles are universal, 
democracy does not belong to any single region, and that there is no single model of 
democracy. The history, culture and specificities of each country must be taken into 
account. Furthermore, democracy is not just an outcome, it is a means by which to achieve 
human rights. It should generate an environment in which human rights can flourish. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutive elements of democracy 
</b></p>
<p>15. Several delegations highlighted the main constitutive elements of democracy. It was 
stressed that elections are an essential element of democracy. However, although a key 
element, elections alone are not sufficient to create a free and democratic society. 
Furthermore, it was pointed out that consolidating democracy also requires continuous 
efforts by State and political authorities, as well as other stakeholders, including national 
human rights institutions, the media and human rights defenders. Moreover, democracy 
requires institutions, such as effective parliaments, responsible political parties, 
independent electoral commissions, and a strong and free civil society. The importance of 
strengthening national institutions in order to promote and protect human rights was also 
highlighted.  
</p>
<p>16. Several delegations also stressed that democracy requires inclusive and participatory 
governance and decision-making. Everyone should be able to freely express their will and 
determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems. Democracy should 
empower those voices that are sometimes excluded or marginalized. In that regard, the need 
to ensure participation in political life of persons with disabilities and the role of women in 
democratic societies were underlined. Some States also highlighted the importance of 
tolerance and dialogue.  
</p>
<p>17. In addition, according to a number of delegations, democracy requires accountability 
and transparency. Effective checks and balances should be ensured within governments. 
Moreover, it was pointed out that a free and independent media, access to information and 
freedom of expression play a crucial role. It was underscored that freedom of the press was 
a catalyst for human rights, in particular freedom of expression. While some limitations 
may be necessary, it was stressed that these should only be very narrow and aim at </p>


<p>protecting human rights of others. The importance of civic education, which fosters 
democratic culture and practices and tolerance, was also stressed. At the same time, 
delegations pointed out the need for capacity-building for national institutions.  
</p>
<p>18. In addition, delegates emphasized the importance of the rule of law and democracy 
in transition from armed conflict to democracy. In that context, transitional justice 
processes were highlighted as one of the key elements of democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges to the securing of democracy 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the discussion, several delegations underlined the challenges facing 
democracy. It was stressed that challenges can arise in all democracies, whether new or 
well-established. Challenges are manifold, including security, political, social and 
economic challenges. Poverty, corruption and restriction of civil society were also pointed 
out as hindering democratic processes. It was noted that various challenges for persons with 
disabilities exist: participation in political life, including lack of legislation protecting the 
rights of persons with disabilities; a lack of understanding and awareness of actors involved 
in the political system; and physical barriers for persons with disabilities in exercising their 
right to vote. In addition, it was stressed that although political will exists, efforts to 
consolidate democracy are hampered by resource constraints and a lack of technical 
expertise to enact changes and strengthen institutional capacity. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International and regional cooperation for the promotion and 
strengthening of democracy and the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>20. Various delegations highlighted the importance of international and regional 
initiatives and cooperation to promote and strengthen democracy. It was emphasized that, 
although progress has been made, more work needs to be done in the future. In that context, 
States underlined that democratization efforts by the international community must never 
be imposed; rather, democracy must be the sovereign choice of people. Cooperation should 
be fostered through dialogue, and sharing of experiences and best practices that adhere to 
the principles of equality, mutual respect and understanding. 
</p>
<p>21. The role of the United Nations in fostering democracy, the rule of law and human 
rights was also addressed. It was pointed out that, while States have the primary 
responsibility for safeguarding and strengthening democracy and the rule of law, the United 
Nations has a critical role in providing assistance and coordinating international efforts to 
support new democracies and democratization processes. Delegations pointed out that the 
United Nations Democracy Fund is as a step in the right direction. However, it was also 
suggested that the United Nations should play a more substantive and visible role.  
</p>
<p>22. States underscored the need for effective international instruments and mechanisms 
to ensure the enjoyment of human rights. In that context, delegations emphasized the 
unique role of the United Nations in developing new norms and standard-setting. The core 
role of the Human Rights Council in promoting and protecting human rights, monitoring 
the implementation of human rights norms and standards and fostering international 
cooperation in this area was also underlined. In that regard, a number of questions were 
raised concerning ways of improving assistance for States to consolidate democratization 
processes, including through international and regional initiatives, as well as efforts by the 
Human Rights Council and other United Nations bodies. </p>


<p><b> IV. Concluding remarks 
</b>23. <b>The Romanian State Secretary for Political Affairs and Liaison with 
Parliament, Radu Podgorean, pointed out that the United Nations and regional 
organizations can offer an important framework for the exchange of experience and 
the sharing of best practices. He also stressed that the international community has a 
responsibility to offer a general framework for the development of human rights 
through the promotion of peace. He suggested that an international forum could be 
established in order to elaborate a framework for education, democracy and human 
rights. He also encouraged the promotion of resolution 19/6.</b> 
</p>
<p>24. <b>The member of the Executive Board of Femmes Africa Soldarit&#233;, Brigitte 
Balipou, emphasized the need for strong and robust institutions and support for 
international and regional mechanisms. She also stressed the importance of 
combatting impunity. She called for the full implementation of Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. 
</b>25. <b>The Secretary-General of the International Institute for Democracy and 
Electoral Assistance, Vidar Helgesen, reiterated that democracy can only be sustained 
if it was owned by citizens. Moreover, political process and institutions must be 
inclusive. However, he cautioned that inclusion takes time and cannot be rushed. He 
stressed the need to move from the normative to the realities on the ground and 
suggested that the post-2015 development agenda could be an opportunity in that 
regard, including by setting democracy as a development goal on the post-2015 
development agenda</b>. 
</p>
<p>26. <b>The Vice-President of the Arab Parliament of the League of Arab States, Aisha 
al-Mannai, underlined that good governance is the basis for democracy, the rule of 
law and human rights. She recommended the implementation of the recommendations 
set out in the above-mentioned study of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
She also recalled the importance of dialogue in democracies.  
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>The Permanent Delegate of Peru to the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization in Paris, Manuel Rodr&#237;guez Cuadros, underlined that 
building democracies is a multidimensional task, which includes establishing the rule 
of law and access to the exercise of power through democratic structures. He also 
emphasized that the protection of human rights is not a solely domestic matter 
anymore. Legal systems have also been established for the protection of democracy, 
including &#8220;democracy clauses&#8221;. He called for the elaboration of a United Nations 
declaration on democracy. He also suggested integrating respect for democracy and 
the rule of law as medium and long-term assessment benchmarks in the Universal 
Periodic Review process. 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>The President of the Moroccan National Human Rights Council, Driss el-
Yazami, referred to the importance of coherent efforts to strengthen democracy by 
the multiple actors in this field and called for strengthening consistency between the 
various efforts and actors. He also reiterated the fundamental importance of elections 
and political participation in general. In that context, he called for further reflection 
on how to ensure a participative democracy. He stressed the particular importance of 
ensuring participation of persons with disabilities.
