</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Council resolution 10/15. In its 
resolution 7/7, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to continue her efforts to implement the mandate given to 
her by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/80 and the General 
Assembly in its resolution 60/158, and report to the Council. These two resolutions request 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights, making use of existing mechanisms, to 
continue: 
</p>
<p> (a) To examine the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, taking into account reliable information from all 
sources; 
</p>
<p> (b) To make general recommendations concerning the obligation of States to 
promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while taking actions to 
counter terrorism; 
</p>
<p> (c) To provide assistance and advice to States, upon their request, on the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, as well as 
to relevant United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 10/15, the Human Rights Council called upon States to ensure 
access to an effective remedy where human rights are violated as a result of counter-
terrorism measures, and provide adequate, prompt and effective reparations for victims. 
The present report addresses developments in respect of the protection of human rights 
while countering terrorism over the past year. In the same resolution, the Human Rights 
Council requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights &#8220;to present [her report], 
bearing in mind the content of the present resolution, to the Council at its thirteenth session 
under its agenda item 3, in conformity with its annual programme of work&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy and the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force </b></p>
<p>3. Through the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and Plan of Action, 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 60/288, Member States reaffirmed that 
acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are activities 
aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy. They 
committed to adopting measures to ensure respect for human rights for all and to use the 
rule of law as the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. Member States also 
resolved to ensure that measures taken to counter terrorism comply with their obligations 
under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>4. In the Plan of Action, it was reaffirmed that the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) should play a lead role in examining the 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism. OHCHR continued to lead the 
Working Group on Protecting Human Rights While Countering Terrorism of the Counter-
Terrorism Implementation Task Force established by the Secretary-General in 2005, in an 
effort to ensure a coordinated and coherent approach across the United Nations system to 
counter-terrorism. In 2008, the Monitoring Team of the Security Council Committee 
established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) (Counter-Terrorism Committee) joined the </p>


<p>GE.10-10442 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Working Group and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as observers. The aim of the 
Working Group is to support efforts by Member States to ensure the promotion and 
protection of human rights in the context of counter-terrorism through, among other things, 
the development and implementation of legislation and policies that are compliant with 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>5. To assist Member States in strengthening the protection of human rights in 10 
specific areas, my Office, in consultation with Member States, started to develop a series of 
basic technical reference guides on countering terrorism with the endeavour of providing 
full respect for human rights. Following consultations with Member States, the first four 
guides being developed are on (a) proscription of organizations, (b) stopping and searching 
of persons, (c) designing security infrastructure, and (d) the principle of legality in national 
counter-terrorism legislation. 
</p>
<p>6. On 14 and 15 October 2009, my Office participated in the Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force retreat in Vienna. This yearly meeting was focused on taking 
stock of the work that the Task Force and its working groups accomplished in the past year. 
It also set forth the plans for the future. Key issues discussed included, among others, the 
institutionalization of the Task Force in accordance with General Assembly resolution 
62/272 and the communications strategy of the Task Force. 
</p>
<p>7. On 12 and 13 October 2009, my Office participated in the first International 
Workshop for National Counter-Terrorism Focal Points. The workshop was organized by 
the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime and was co-sponsored by the Governments of Austria, Norway, Switzerland and 
Turkey, as well as by Costa Rica, Japan and Slovakia. It gathered practitioners and 
policymakers from national Governments to share experiences and to develop strategies for 
better cooperation in the collective fight against terrorism. Participants represented more 
than 110 Member States. During the workshop, it was affirmed that the United Nations 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is the policy framework within which concrete 
implementation actions need to be strengthened at the national, regional and international 
levels, and that the Strategy needs to be implemented in a comprehensive manner. 
Participants noted the importance of the prevention of terrorism. Action in the area of 
prevention includes promoting economic development, enhancing dialogue among 
civilizations, supporting victims, and protecting human rights. Participants also discussed 
steps towards enhancing coordination among governments, United Nations entities and 
other partners, including the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The work of the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>8. On 29 October 2009, I addressed the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Guided by 
Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), the Committee has been 
working to enhance the ability of States Members of the United Nations to prevent terrorist 
acts both within their borders and across regions. The Committee is assisted in its efforts by 
the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, which carries out the policy 
decisions of the Committee, conducts expert assessments of each Member State and 
facilitates counter-terrorism technical assistance to countries. This was the third time that a 
High Commissioner for Human Rights addressed this important body. 
</p>
<p>9. During this briefing, I reiterated that upholding human rights while countering 
terrorism is an inescapable imperative, because human rights law offers a framework that 
can both meet public security concerns and protect human dignity and the rule of law. 
Some measures taken to counter terrorism, such as resorting to the use of excessive force 
and indiscriminate repression by the police, security and army personnel, can strengthen </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10442 
</p>
<p>terrorists&#8217; support bases, undermining the goals that States set out to achieve. Upholding 
human rights creates trust between the State and those under its jurisdiction, and such trust 
can serve as the foundation of an effective response to terrorism. I highlighted that 
meaningful protection also includes tackling the underlying causes of terrorism, such as the 
obstacles to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p><p>10. I sought to underscore that the time had come for the Security Council&#8217;s counter-
terrorism bodies to consider a broader approach in their vital work in this area, such as that 
of the General Assembly in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and 
Plan of Action, which stressed not only the need for counter-terrorism measures, but also 
the impact of such measures on human rights. I noted that because the Counter-Terrorism 
Committee and the United Nations human rights machinery review counter-terrorism laws 
and measures in parallel, better cooperation between them could provide additional 
legitimacy and coherence to the United Nations system as a whole. 
</p>
<p>11. I shared with the Counter-Terrorism Committee my views that it could play a key 
role in placing the rule of law and human rights at the core of the fight against terrorism. I 
mentioned six areas in particular: 
</p>
<p> (a) The question of legality, including vague definitions of acts of terrorism that 
have led to the prosecution of individuals for the legitimate, non-violent exercise of their 
rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, and which represent a violation 
of the principle of legality; 
</p>
<p> (b) The need to respect and protect non-derogable rights. I noted in this respect 
that national, ethnic, racial or religious profiling raises concerns with regard to the non-
derogable principles of equality and non-discrimination. I also raised the question of torture 
and ill-treatment. These discriminatory and stigmatizing measures affect the rights of 
communities and may lead to further marginalization and possibly radicalization within 
those communities; 
</p>
<p> (c) The expansion of surveillance powers and capacities of law enforcement 
agencies and the need to adequately protect the right to privacy, which may severely 
undermine international cooperation; as well as the use of torture and ill-treatment for 
intelligence gathering, which taints evidence and makes it inadmissible at trial; 
</p>
<p> (d) Accountability for human rights violations, which is especially crucial to 
effective counter-terrorism strategies. True security can only be achieved where all 
members of society cooperate with State authorities and are confident that the measures 
adopted by these authorities to counter-terrorism are effective, proportionate, and respectful 
of their human rights and dignity; 
</p>
<p> (e) The issue of targeted sanctions. I noted that while I welcomed the recent 
improvements in procedures related to the United Nations targeted sanctions regime, 
further improvements were necessary to ensure a transparent listing process based on clear 
criteria, and with a uniformly applied standard of evidence. Accessible and independent 
mechanisms for review are also necessary; 
</p>
<p> (f) Issues regarding the proper integration of a human rights approach to the 
technical work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. I suggested that consideration should 
be given to include a human rights expert on all Committee visits to Member States and to 
devote additional resources to this area of the Committee&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>I also reaffirmed the OHCHR commitment to supporting the Committee and its Executive 
Directorate on all issues related to States&#8217; compliance with human rights. 
</p>
<p>12. From 8 to 10 November 2009, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive 
Directorate and the Government of Bangladesh held a regional workshop in Dhaka on </p>


<p>GE.10-10442 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>effective counter-terrorism practices for senior police officers and prosecutors from 
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka; a 
representative of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) also 
attended. OHCHR participated in this workshop offering views on how human rights can 
be upheld at the operational level in the context of international legal cooperation. 
</p>
<p>13. On 17 December 2009 the Security Council adopted resolution 1904 (2009) to meet 
the challenges faced by Member States in implementing the sanctions regime against Al-
Qaida and the Taliban. The resolution was aimed at improving the procedures to ensure that 
they are fair and the procedures are clear. In it, the Security Council decided, among other 
things, to create an office of the ombudsperson, which would assist in analysing available 
information concerning the delisting requests of those seeking removal from the Council&#8217;s 
sanctions list. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The work of the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>14. In December 2009, the General Assembly adopted resolution 64/168 on the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. In the 
resolution, the General Assembly, among other things: 
</p>
<p> (a) Expresses serious concern at the occurrence of violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (b) Urges States countering terrorism to comply with their obligations in a 
number of areas, such as the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, the guarantee for liberty and security, the treatment of prisoners, 
non-refoulement, the legality in the criminalization of acts of terrorism, non-discrimination, 
the right to an effective remedy, due process and the right to a fair trial; 
</p>
<p> (c) Highlights the need to protect economic, social and cultural rights; 
 (d) Notes the need to continue ensuring that fair and clear procedures under the 
United Nations terrorism-related sanctions regime are strengthened to enhance their 
efficiency and transparency; 
</p>
<p> (e) Urges States to ensure the rule of law and to include adequate human rights 
guarantees in their national listing procedures; 
</p>
<p> (f) Requests OHCHR to continue to contribute to the work of the Counter-
Terrorism Implementation Task Force, including by raising awareness on the need to 
protect human rights and the rule of law while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p> (g) Encourages the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee to 
strengthen dialogue with relevant human rights bodies, in particular with OHCHR, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, other relevant special procedures and mechanisms of 
the Human Rights Council and relevant treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Other relevant activities 
</b></p>
<p>15. The annual report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict (A/HRC/12/49) presented to the Human Rights Council at its 
twelfth session addresses terrorism and counter-terrorism and their impact on children. The 
Special Rapporteur noted that anti-terrorism measures often target children; in some cases, 
children are arrested or detained for reasons of alleged association with terrorist groups, and 
legal and practical safeguards are disregarded. The Special Representative also focused on </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10442 
</p>
<p>&#8220;collateral damage&#8221;, in which children are often the victims, resulting from precision aerial 
bombardment and other types of military operation. 
</p>
<p>16. The United Nations human rights treaty bodies have continued to take up issues 
related to terrorism in their examination of State party reports and individual complaints. In 
their concluding observations, different committees have urged States parties to recognize 
and ensure that the human rights treaties apply at all times, in any territory under their 
jurisdiction. The Secretary-General has recently reported on key developments in this field 
to the General Assembly (see A/64/186); I would like to focus on the most recent 
developments. 
</p>
<p>17. On 18 and 19 November 2009, my Office participated in a workshop in Jakarta 
hosted by the Center on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation and Nahdatul Ulama with 
support from the Governments of Germany and Sweden. The aim of the workshop was to 
raise awareness of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy among civil 
society in South-East Asia and to explore the possibilities for greater civil society 
participation in efforts to implement the global framework in a manner that reflects the 
needs and priorities across the region. 
</p>
<p>18. On 30 November 2009, OHCHR participated in an Arria Formula meeting on 
strengthening a United Nations integrated approach to human rights and counter-terrorism 
through the role of the Security Council. The meeting was convened by the Government of 
Mexico, which invited speakers who were members of the Eminent Jurist Panel of the 
International Commission of Jurists. Participants included members of the Security 
Council, representatives of the 1267 Committee, the Counter-Terrorism Committee 
Executive Directorate and the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Issues of concern: accountability and reparations 
</b></p>
<p>19. A major challenge facing States today is accountability for serious violations of 
human rights that have taken place in the context of counter-terrorism measures and the 
rights of victims to remedy and reparations. In recent years, serious violations have taken 
place affecting fundamental rights, including wilful killings, summary executions, 
disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention. These practices have rarely been 
investigated thoroughly, perpetrators have often not been punished, and reparations to 
victims have not been forthcoming. 
</p>
<p>20. In article 2, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
it is spelled out that in addition to effective protection of Covenant rights, States parties 
must ensure that individuals have accessible and effective2 remedies to vindicate those 
rights,3 which was restated by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 31 
(2004). The Committee stated that it attaches importance to States parties establishing 
appropriate judicial and administrative mechanisms for addressing claims of rights 
violations under domestic law. The Committee noted that the enjoyment of the rights 
recognized under the Covenant can be effectively assured by the judiciary in many different 
ways, including direct applicability of the Covenant, application of comparable

<p>constitutional or other provisions of law, or the interpretive effect of the Covenant in the 
application of national law. Administrative mechanisms are particularly required to give 
effect to the general obligation to investigate allegations of violations promptly, thoroughly 
and effectively through independent and impartial bodies. National human rights 
institutions, endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end.  
</p>
<p>21. The Human Rights Committee also stated in general comment No. 31 that article 2, 
paragraph 3, requires that States parties make reparation to individuals whose Covenant 
rights have been violated. Without reparation to individuals whose Covenant rights have 
been violated, the obligation to provide an effective remedy, which is central to the efficacy 
of article 2, paragraph 3, is not discharged. In addition to the explicit reparation required by 
articles 9, paragraph 5, and 14, paragraph 6, the Committee considered that the Covenant 
generally entails appropriate compensation. The Committee noted that, where appropriate, 
reparation can involve restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction, such as public 
apologies, public memorials, guarantees of non-repetition and changes in relevant laws and 
practices, as well as bringing to justice the perpetrators of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>22. Where serious violations of human rights occur, States have the duty to ensure that 
such violations are properly investigated and, wherever possible, investigation should lead 
to a judicial or other appropriate response.4 The failure to conduct an independent 
investigation of serious human rights violations not only reinforces the violations that have 
already been committed but can lead to the serious deterioration of larger countrywide 
human rights situations. On the other hand, a timely and efficient inquiry can have a 
preventive effect and improve the overall national human rights situation. Failure to 
investigate also violates the human rights of the victims.5 Also, a failure by a State party to 
investigate allegations of violations could give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. 
Cessation of an ongoing violation is an essential element of the right to an effective 
remedy.6 
</p>
<p>23. States are under the obligation to investigate all human rights violations. Under 
extreme circumstances, where a state of emergency is declared, derogations from some 
rights and freedoms are permissible under article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, but they should not exceed the exigencies of the situation.7 Article 4

 Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights cannot be invoked to derogate 
</p>
<p>from the rules of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Derogation measures must be consistent with 
State obligations under international humanitarian law. The minimum provided for in article 3 of the 
four Geneva Conventions of 1949 must be respected. In particular, the minimum provided in article 3 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10442 
</p>
<p>(2) of the Covenant lists various rights which are non-derogable at all times, such as: the 
right to life; the prohibition of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment; the 
prohibition of retroactive criminal laws; freedom of thought, conscience and religion;8 and 
the prohibition of the death penalty (article 6 of the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). 
</p><p>24. Under article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, State 
parties are obliged to respect and ensure the Covenant rights to all persons who may be 
within their territory and to all persons subject to their jurisdiction. General comment No. 
15 of the Human Rights Committee indicates that this obligation is not limited to a State&#8217;s 
citizens, but must be guaranteed to all individuals, regardless of nationality or statelessness, 
such as asylum-seekers, refugees, migrant workers and others who may find themselves 
subject to the jurisdictional regulations of the territory in which they are found. 
25. Procedurally, States commit themselves to establishing suitable institutions (i.e. 
primarily judicial institutions, such as criminal, civil, constitutional and special human 
rights courts, or also national human rights institutions and torture rehabilitation bodies) to 
enable victims of torture to obtain redress.9 National mechanisms are required to give 
prompt, thorough, and effective attention to the obligations to investigate allegations of 
violations10 through independent11 and impartial bodies. National human rights institutions, 
endowed with appropriate powers, can contribute to this end by referring all those 
responsible for committing gross human rights violations to the criminal justice system for 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment indicated that in the light of the consistent international jurisprudence 
suggesting that the prohibition of amnesties leading to impunity for serious human rights 
has become a rule of customary international law, he expresses his opposition to the 
passing, application and non-revocation of amnesty laws which prevent torturers from 
being brought to justice and hence contribute to a culture of impunity. He called on States 
to refrain from granting or acquiescing in impunity at the national level, inter alia, by the

</p>
<p>for persons taking no active part in hostilities entails, among other things: the prohibition, at any time 
and in any place, of violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel 
treatment and torture, the taking of hostages, and outrage upon personal dignity. See also general

Article 4 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment states that each State party must ensure that all acts of torture are 
offences under its criminal law; this also applies to an attempt to commit torture and to an 
act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture. It also states that 
each State party must make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take 
into account their grave nature. The Convention against Torture contains obligations aimed 
at punishing perpetrators, preventing torture and assisting victims of torture.13 
</p>
<p>27. With regards to the right to life, in general comment No. 6 (1982) the Human Rights 
Committee specifies that not only do States have a negative obligation not to arbitrarily 
interfere with the individual right to life, but also, States have a positive obligation to adopt 
all measures that are appropriate to protect and preserve the right to life and to prevent and 
punish deprivations of life by criminal acts as well as arbitrary killings by their own 
security forces.14 The police have the duty to prepare and plan counter-terrorism operations 
so as to avoid any loss of life. Public investigations of any death in which State agents may 
be implicated are necessary.15 
</p>
<p>28. Covert actions raise particular challenges for accountability. Since they are secretive 
types of action, where information is classified, it is difficult for the legislator and the 
judiciary to be aware of them. It should be recalled that all measures taken by law 
enforcement agencies must be lawful under national and international law, and compatible 
with States&#8217; human rights obligations. This means that all activities undertaken by

Committee against Torture, without explicit reference to the Guidelines, followed the terminology 
developed therein in its decision. In that case the perpetrators were subsequently pardoned after they 
had paid compensation. Despite the payment of compensation, the Committee found a violation of 
article 14 of the Basic Principles. It held that reparation should cover all the damages suffered by the 
victim, which included, among other things, restitution, compensation and rehabilitation of the victim, 
as well as measures to guarantee the non-repetition of the violations, always bearing in mind the 
circumstances of each case. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10442 
</p>
<p>intelligence agencies, including intelligence-gathering, covert surveillance activities, 
searches and data collection must be regulated by law, monitored by independent agencies, 
and subject to judicial review. The lack of transparency that prevails in a number of the 
investigations and trials related to terrorism is a cause for concern. Through the adoption or 
revival of State secrecy or immunity doctrines or the adoption of other measures to shield 
intelligence, military or diplomatic sources and information, in the name of national 
security interests, States have limited the access to the necessary information for an 
effective investigation and prosecution of cases relating to acts of terrorism. States are 
required to ensure that confined powers, review of accountability and oversight 
mechanisms are established against the misuse of exceptional powers granted to 
intelligence, military agencies or special police to counter terrorism. Such controls might 
encompass the process or authorizing special powers and the remedies for people claiming 
abuse of these powers. Controls can occur either before or after the use of powers. 
</p>
<p>29. The Convention against Torture requires States parties to prevent, within their 
territory, any acts of torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.16 By virtue of the 
extraterritorial application of the prohibition of such acts, and the obligations under 
customary international law and Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, 
States must also ensure that their officials do not undertake such practices overseas and that 
they are not complicit in such conduct by other persons. It is thus essential that those 
responsible for conducting or colluding in interrogation techniques amounting to torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment are held accountable.17 
</p>
<p>30. The practice of holding terrorist suspects in secret detention has led to the denial of 
several rights of detainees, not only with respect to their rights associated with liberty, but 
also for example their right to a fair trial. In such circumstances, where confessions are 
extracted by torture and evidence gathered illegally through secret agents, the possibility of 
bringing to justice people who are responsible for committing the above-mentioned 
violations is unlikely. In its general comment No. 21 on article 10 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights Committee imposes on States an 
obligation to individuals who are vulnerable, such as juveniles, due to their status of 
persons deprived of liberty to be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent 
dignity of the human person. 
</p>
<p>31. Accountability and the right to effective remedies are connected to the right to a fair 
trial as guaranteed by article 14 of the Covenant, clarified by general comment No. 32 of 
the Human Rights Committee. Protecting the right of terrorist suspects to a fair trial is 
critical not only for ensuring that anti-terrorism measures respect the rule of law, but also 
for ensuring that perpetrators of human rights violations are held accountable. Indeed, 
violations carried out in the execution of &#8220;extraordinary renditions&#8221; and collecting evidence 
by illegal means are very unlikely to be adequately brought to light, and perpetrators 
brought to justice, if suspects of terrorism are tried in special courts with special procedures 
or sealed evidence which do not fully guarantee the right to a fair trial. Therefore, the 
guarantees of a fair trial are essential to ensure accountability and to combat impunity, as 
well as to provide effective remedies.18 
</p>
<p>32. Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has a clear 
relationship with the protection from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and 
punishment. Human Rights Committee general comment No. 21 clarifies that article 10

<p>imposes on States parties a positive obligation towards persons who are particularly 
vulnerable because of their status as persons deprived of liberty, and complements for them 
the ban on torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment contained 
in article 7 of the Covenant. The Committee also recalls that the principle set forth in article 
10, paragraph 1, constitutes the basis for the more specific obligations of States parties in 
respect of criminal justice, which are set forth in article 10, paragraphs 2 and 3. 
</p><p>33. In the endeavour to protect intelligence sources, some States have amended the 
regulations governing legal or administrative procedures to allow the non-disclosure of 
materials to suspects.19 Secrecy and immunity doctrines should not be applied where 
serious human rights violations are being investigated, such as the absolute prohibition of 
torture and cases of killings or disappearances. Independent, impartial, transparent and 
credible investigations are required by law to ensure accountability. Individual 
responsibility cannot be avoided through amnesties or immunities, and other limitations to 
the recognition of legal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>34. States must refrain from granting or acquiescing in impunity at the national level 
through amnesties.20 Amnesties for gross and serious violations of human rights and 
humanitarian law may also violate customary international law,21 and the continued 
passing, application and non-revocation of amnesty laws22 contributes to a culture of 
impunity. 
</p>
<p>35. Since September 2001, there has been a trend towards outsourcing the collection of 
intelligence to private contractors. While the involvement of private actors can be necessary 
as a technical matter in order to have access to information (for instance for electronic 
surveillance), there are reasons to be wary of using contractors to interrogate persons who 
are deprived of their liberty. The responsibility to protect the right to life, physical integrity 
or liberty of individuals should remain within the exclusive domain of the State. The 
combination of a lack of proper training, the introduction of a profit motive into situations 
which are prone to human rights violations, and the often questionable prospect that such 
contractors will be subject to judicial and parliamentary accountability mechanisms are all

</p>
<p>elements that should be considered by Member States to ensure that those actors are 
accountable. 
</p>
<p>36. A particular concern is that of rendition and extraordinary rendition that arises from 
increased intelligence cooperation. Extraordinary rendition is almost certain to constitute or 
facilitate a violation of a variety of human rights, especially the rights that protect 
individuals against arbitrary arrest, forcible transfer, enforced disappearance or the 
subjection of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.23 States must fulfil 
their obligations under the different treaties and standards, and ensure that their territory is 
not used to transfer persons to places where they are likely to be subjected to torture.24 
</p><p>37. In the absence of procedural safeguards that protect legal rights such as due process, 
persons who are subject to such transfers have no means of challenging their transfer. 
Hence, States should take all practical steps to determine whether foreign movements 
through their territories involve practices that can lead to irreparable harm. States have an 
obligation to investigate the role of their agents (both military and intelligence) who may 
have been involved in facilitating these renditions,25 to sanction those responsible, and to 
provide reparation for victims.26 States also have a responsibility to put in place procedures 
to address these issues, whether in reference to their own agents or to foreign agents, and to 
regulate the use of their airspace. States are further required to ensure accountability for 
past practices.27 
</p>
<p>38. There should be controls against the misuse of exceptional powers by institutions 
that are not subject to sufficient democratic and civilian control, in particular intelligence or 
military agencies or special police. States need to ensure confined powers, the review of 
accountability and oversight mechanisms. Such controls might encompass the process of 
authorizing special powers and the remedies for people claiming abuse of these powers. 
Controls can occur either before or after the use of powers. 
</p>
<p>39. Intelligence-gathering activities must be regulated by law, monitored as much as 
possible by independent agencies, and subject to judicial review. Under international 
human rights law, any act that impacts human rights must be lawful; it must be prescribed 
and regulated by law. This means that any search, seizure, surveillance activity, 
apprehension or data collection about a person must be clearly authorized by law. States

<p>disclosure of materials to suspects must ensure they do so in conformity with their human 
rights obligations, in particular, with due process.28 
</p>
<p>40. Counter-terrorism measures that have an impact on the enjoyment of economic and 
social rights should also respect the principles of proportionality, effectiveness and 
legitimacy.29 Access to justice and the existence of remedies, including adequate reparation 
for the victims, are key to upholding the accountability of States and to reducing impunity 
for violations of economic, social and cultural rights. In the context of countering terrorism, 
evictions and house demolitions are sometimes used as forms of targeted punishment for 
residents who are suspected of supporting terrorist groups. Where this constitutes a form of 
collective punishment it is considered a gross violation of human rights. It is often suffered 
by vulnerable communities, such as women, ethnic, religious and other minorities and 
indigenous peoples, who are suspected of supporting terrorist groups. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Remedies and reparation 
</b></p>
<p>41. In addition to States&#8217; duties to bring perpetrators of gross human rights violations 
before the criminal justice system, States&#8217; obligations have been described as requiring 
them to respect the right to truth, to justice and to reparation.30 The right to truth puts an 
obligation on the State to investigate human rights violations and to present the facts to the 
public. The right to reparation comprises not only the right to compensation31 and 
restitution, but also the right to rehabilitation,32 satisfaction and guarantees of non-
repetition,33 as described by the United Nations set of principles for the protection and 
promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity. These are complementary 
rights. The right to reparation as established by international law include: restitution <i>in 
integrum</i>, payment of compensation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetitions, among 
others.34 When restitution, <i>in integrum, </i>is not possible, other forms of reparation must 
afford relief. The different obligations of the State regarding remedies and reparation are 
unconditional. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 2, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
ensures an accessory right to effective remedy against violations of human rights. This 
obligation was established in order to ensure victims had a means of vindicating their 
rights. The right to an effective remedy requires that a domestic process to deal with the

<p>complaint is available and that it provide the appropriate relief.35 The procedural aspect of 
upholding accountability and reducing impunity for States&#8217; human rights violations36 is 
access to justice, including proper judicial review, and the existence of remedies, including 
adequate reparation for the victims. An independent judicial review by States of counter-
terrorism measures undertaken, including those affecting human rights, serves to ascertain 
their proportionality, effectiveness and legitimacy.37  
</p>
<p>43. The Human Rights Committee has stressed that the acquisition, development and 
use of information on terrorist groups and their activities must be in conformity with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.38 While implementing the United 
Nations targeted sanctions, such as asset freezing and travel bans against individuals 
suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, it is necessary to ensure that those victims 
of wrong listing or listing which violated their rights should be also compensated within the 
same established set of rules.39 
</p>
<p>44. According to the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and 
Abuse of Power,40 victims include &#8220;persons who, individually or collectively, have suffered 
harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial 
impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts or omissions that are in violation of 
criminal laws operative within Member States, including those laws proscribing criminal 
abuse of power&#8221;. In the Declaration, it is noted that an individual may be considered a 
victim &#8220;regardless of whether the perpetrator is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or 
convicted and regardless of the familial relationship between the perpetrator and the 
victim&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>45. In light of frequent shortcomings with respect to victims in domestic jurisdictions, 
guidelines should be adopted by States to provide victims of counter-terrorism measures 
that may violate human rights with urgent assistance for their material and psychiatric 
needs, as well as long-term assistance, including medical and psychological follow-up. 
Such guidelines should also grant effective access to justice and ensure that evidentiary 
privileges are not an obstacle to transparency in the conduct of investigations and access to 
legal remedies. 
</p>
<p>46. Human rights principles and guidelines that would comprehensively address victims 
of counter-terrorism deserve serious consideration, by drawing on national and international 
best practice and based on the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy 
and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and 
Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (Basic Principles and Guidelines),41

 Communication No. 1472/2006, <i>Sayadi and Vinck v. Belgium</i>, 22 October 2008. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>40
 Adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 40/34 of 29 November 1985.

 General Assembly resolution 60/147, annex. </p>


<p>GE.10-10442 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>and the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to 
combat impunity.42 
</p>
<p>47. The Basic Principles and Guidelines provide for different categories of reparation. 
Since torture constitutes a particularly serious violation of human rights, criminal 
prosecution and appropriate punishment is perceived by the victim as the most effective 
means of satisfaction and justice. Criminal investigations serve the purpose of establishing 
truth and pave the way for other forms of reparation. Guarantees of non-repetition, such as 
amending relevant laws, fighting impunity and taking effective preventive or deterrent 
measures, constitute a form of reparation if torture is practised in a widespread or 
systematic manner. Monetary compensation for the immaterial damage (pain and suffering) 
or material damage (rehabilitation costs, etc.) may provide satisfaction as an additional 
form of reparation. 
</p>
<p>48. In its general comment No. 15, the Human Rights Committee indicates that under 
article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the obligation is not 
limited to a State&#8217;s citizens, but must be guaranteed to all individuals, regardless of 
nationality or statelessness, such as asylum-seekers, refugees, migrant workers and others 
who may find themselves subject to the jurisdictional regulations of the territory in which 
they are found. Such remedies should be appropriately adapted to take account of the 
special vulnerability of certain categories of person, including in particular children. As was 
confirmed by general comment No. 31, this principle also applies to those within the power 
or effective control of the forces of a State acting outside its territory, regardless of the 
circumstances in which such power or effective control was obtained. States must ensure 
that individuals have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate the aforementioned 
rights, which should be appropriately adapted to the special vulnerability of certain 
categories of persons, particularly children. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>49. <b>States are urged to ensure that measures taken to combat crimes of terrorism 
comply with their obligations under international human rights law, in particular the 
right to an effective remedy for victims of human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>States are urged to respect all rights, in particular non-derogable rights. It is 
extremely important that the Member States reconfirm their commitment to the 
absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, which 
are not to be permitted under any circumstances. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>States are urged to cooperate with the special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council in enforcing accountability mechanisms and measures and means of 
providing remedies to victims. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>States are urged to issue a standing invitation to all special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council, and in particular to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and the Working Groups on Arbitrary Detention and on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.

<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10442 
</p>
<p>53. <b>States are urged to strengthen legislation to protect the rights of arrested and 
detained individuals from torture and physical mistreatment and ensure they are 
afforded the full complement of due process rights in accordance with their 
obligations under international human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>States should ensure that national human rights institutions have the necessary 
capacity to contribute meaningfully to the protection of human rights and in 
particular to the provision of effective remedies in cases of substantive violations. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>States should provide their law enforcement authorities, including intelligence 
agencies and prison staff, with training on international human rights laws and 
standards, including on the obligation to ensure effective remedies and accountability 
in the case of violations of human rights when committed by State agents or public 
officials. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>To ensure accountability, torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
committed by public officials and State agents should give rise to criminal liability 
and/or disciplinary measures. All allegations of torture or ill-treatment by any of the 
above-mentioned officers should be investigated and those found responsible 
punished. National laws and relevant regulating documents for public officials and 
State agents, including the police, intelligence officials and the military must comply 
with international human rights obligations to ensure that appropriate investigation 
and, where necessary, prosecution of alleged violations occur.
