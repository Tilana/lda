<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
</p>
<p>Rashida Manjoo, visited Afghanistan at the invitation of the Government from 4 to 12 
</p>
<p>November 2014 to examine in a comprehensive manner the situation of violence against 
</p>
<p>women in the country, including violence perpetrated within the family, in the community, 
</p>
<p>in institutional settings and in the transnational sphere. She would like to thank the 
</p>
<p>Government for the cooperation extended prior to and during her visit.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the support provided by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>country team, and especially grateful for the logistical and substantive support provided by 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Unit within the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>(UNAMA).   
</p>
<p>3. During her nine-day visit, the Special Rapporteur held consultations in Kabul with 
</p>
<p>high-ranking officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Women&#8217;s Affairs, Interior and 
</p>
<p>Justice. She also met with members of parliament; representatives from the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office and the Supreme Court of Justice and other judges and prosecutors; 
</p>
<p>members of the police force, prison administration and medical staff in hospitals; and 
</p>
<p>members of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. She also met with 
</p>
<p>the Governors and members of the local councils in Herat and Jalalabad. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of civil 
</p>
<p>society, United Nations agencies and members of the diplomatic corps. She also visited the 
</p>
<p>Badam Bagh women&#8217;s prison in Kabul, a juvenile rehabilitation centre and the burn clinic 
</p>
<p>of the regional hospital in Herat and two shelters.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to her interlocutors, including the women who 
</p>
<p>shared their experiences of survival with her. She looks forward to a fruitful and continued 
</p>
<p>dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of her 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>6. The four decades of prolonged armed conflict across the country has contributed to 
</p>
<p>significant levels of instability, insecurity, violence, rule-of-law challenges, poverty and 
</p>
<p>underdevelopment, which have obstructed the effective realization and enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights for people of Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>7. The first visit by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
</p>
<p>its causes and consequences took place in 1999, during the Taliban era. In her report, the 
</p>
<p>mandate holder noted that discrimination against women was officially sanctioned, thus 
</p>
<p>affecting every aspect of the lives of women. In addition to the various manifestations of 
</p>
<p>violence, as commonly understood, the issuance of strict edicts banning women from 
</p>
<p>education and work, restricting their freedom of movement and imposing particular dress 
</p>
<p>codes, among others, has had a lasting and devastating impact on the lives of women and 
</p>
<p>girls. The mandate holder called for the end to the armed conflict and the establishment, 
</p>
<p>through peaceful political negotiations, of a broad-based multi-ethnic fully representative 
</p>
<p>Government that would respect internationally recognized human rights and abandon all 
</p>
<p>policies that are inconsistent with the international human rights instruments to which 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan is party. Another crucial recommendation in the report was the need for 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s involvement in the political and peace process. The mandate holder recommended 
</p>
<p>that all parties to the conflict end the violations of the human rights of women and girls; 
</p>
<p>ensure respect for women&#8217;s right to security of the person; ensure justice and accountability </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>for crimes against women; and take urgent measures to ensure the elimination of all 
</p>
<p>discriminatory legislation, policies and practices. 
</p>
<p>8. The second visit to Afghanistan by the mandate took place in 2005, four years after 
</p>
<p>the fall of the Taliban regime. The mandate holder acknowledged that efforts to improve 
</p>
<p>the status of women had been closely linked to the challenge of multiple political and 
</p>
<p>economic transitions confronting Afghan society and, importantly, attempts to move from 
</p>
<p>the rule of power to the rule of law. She highlighted the fact that the extraordinary level of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls had been embedded in a traditional system of male 
</p>
<p>domination in which girls and women had no status as independent persons. She noted that 
</p>
<p>the persistence of patriarchal cultural norms and customs and the misinterpretation of 
</p>
<p>religion had been used to subjugate women and further perpetuate the cycles of violence 
</p>
<p>against them. She called for urgent measures to protect women and girls from violence and 
</p>
<p>reiterated the need to build a strong democratic inclusive State that is able to ensure an 
</p>
<p>environment of economic and social development from which women and girls would fully 
</p>
<p>benefit. 
</p>
<p>9. Afghanistan is currently recovering from the decades of conflict and, while the 
</p>
<p>economy has significantly improved since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, the 
</p>
<p>country remains heavily dependent on foreign aid. Women constitute roughly 49 per cent of 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan&#8217;s population of 27.5 million, and it is estimated that around 36 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>total population lives in total poverty. In households that experience acute poverty, a young 
</p>
<p>girl may be perceived to be an economic burden and marriage into another family may 
</p>
<p>become a survival strategy to reduce economic pressures on the household. Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>economic participation is hindered by restrictions on their mobility and inability to gain 
</p>
<p>access to resources, markets and employment. The Government has taken positive steps 
</p>
<p>towards the empowerment of women, including through the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan National Development Strategy (2009-2012) and the National Action Plan for 
</p>
<p>Women Advancement. However, there remain deeply engrained structural and societal 
</p>
<p>challenges that hamper the realization of this goal, including gender discrimination and 
</p>
<p>male preference.  
</p>
<p>10. Over the past 15 years, several legislative and institutional advances have been made 
</p>
<p>towards the promotion of human rights broadly and women&#8217;s rights in particular. These 
</p>
<p>include the creation of a national human rights institution, a ministry for women&#8217;s affairs at 
</p>
<p>the national level and departments of women&#8217;s affairs at the provincial level, human rights 
</p>
<p>units in various ministries, gender units in some ministries and the enactment in 2009 of the 
</p>
<p>landmark Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women. During the visit, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was also informed of several law reform initiatives to be carried out over the 
</p>
<p>following year or so, including a comprehensive review of the Penal Code and the drafting 
</p>
<p>of a law to regulate the jurisdiction and functioning of <i>jirgas</i> and <i>shuras</i> (informal 
</p>
<p>communal councils). 
</p>
<p>11. The literacy rate for adults (15 years and older) is as low as 31.4 per cent in some 
</p>
<p>areas, with an average of 17 per cent for women and 45.4 per cent for men at the national 
</p>
<p>level. Despite significant progress in the country&#8217;s education system since 2001, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Education estimates that about 3.5 million school-aged children are out of 
</p>
<p>school. The majority of these children are girls, children in remote areas, disabled children, 
</p>
<p>nomad children and members of other vulnerable groups.1 Despite the Government&#8217;s efforts 
</p>
<p>to ensure education for girls and boys, social and cultural obstacles keep many girls out of

<p>school. Even for those girls who go to school, separate toilets and the necessary facilities 
</p>
<p>for them during menstruation are lacking in most schools, resulting in girls missing at least 
</p>
<p>a quarter of their educational life. In more remote areas, there is a shortage of female 
</p>
<p>teachers, resulting in girls in those areas foregoing their education. Teachers are sometimes 
</p>
<p>brought in from other provinces to address the shortage; however, insecurity and fear of 
</p>
<p>violence for teachers and female students while travelling to neighbouring schools serves as 
</p>
<p>a deterrent to mobility. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Manifestations of violence against women and girls, including 
its causes and consequences 
</b></p>
<p>12. The sections below illustrate the current status of the most prevalent forms of 
</p>
<p>violence against women, many of which were also identified in the mission reports of the 
</p>
<p>previous mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women in the family 
</b></p>
<p>13. Violence in the family sphere, including spousal violence and intrafamily violence, 
</p>
<p>continues to affect women disproportionately. Most manifestations of violence are 
</p>
<p>underreported in the context of a patriarchal and conservative society where domestic 
</p>
<p>violence is not always perceived as a crime and is condoned by authorities that attribute the 
</p>
<p>abuse to a woman&#8217;s alleged disobedience of her husband. It is estimated that up to 87.2 per 
</p>
<p>cent of women have experienced at least one form of physical, sexual or psychological 
</p>
<p>violence, or forced marriage. More than 60 per cent of women experience multiple forms of 
</p>
<p>violence.2 A total of 4,505 cases of violence against women were registered by the joint 
</p>
<p>database of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, Ministry of Interior and the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office from March 2012 to March 2013 in 32 provinces.3 During the first half of 
</p>
<p>2013, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission registered 4,154 cases of 
</p>
<p>violence against women, including 1,249 cases of physical violence, 976 cases of 
</p>
<p>psychological violence, 862 cases of economic violence, 262 cases of sexual violence, and 
</p>
<p>805 cases of other types of violence. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in the 
</p>
<p>context of marriage, rape is seldom acknowledged or reported, since women do not have 
</p>
<p>the freedom to decide whether or not to have sexual intercourse with their husband. In spite 
</p>
<p>of its prevalence, domestic violence is not explicitly classified as a crime in the Penal Code, 
</p>
<p>though it may constitute beating and laceration under articles 407 and 408. It has been 
</p>
<p>reported that, during criminal investigations of domestic violence cases, including in the 
</p>
<p>criminal and family courts, a factor often taken into account is whether the violence was a 
</p>
<p>response to a woman&#8217;s disobedience. This then results in decisions not to prosecute cases, 
</p>
<p>or in the reduction of sentences.4  
</p>
<p>14. The legal age for marriage is 18 for boys and 16 for girls, although, under certain 
</p>
<p>circumstances, a girl may marry at the age of 15 in accordance with articles 70 and 71 of 
</p>
<p>the Penal Code. Nonetheless, early marriage practices remain prevalent. It is reported that 
</p>
<p>17.3 per cent of girls aged 15 to 19 are married. The 2010&#8211;2011 Afghanistan Multi 
</p>
<p>Indicator Cluster Survey found that 15.2 per cent of surveyed women were married before 
</p>

<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>the age of 15 and 46.4 per cent before 18.5 As noted by the previous mandate holder, the 
</p>
<p>practices of child and forced marriages are at the root of most violence that takes place in 
</p>
<p>the household, but are also amplified in other spheres (see E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.5, 
</p>
<p>para. 23). A girl child is seen as an asset exchangeable for money or goods owing to the 
</p>
<p>practice of the bride price (ibid. para. 24). Moreover, the importance of preserving family 
</p>
<p>honour and girls&#8217; virginity is such that parents push their daughters into marriage well 
</p>
<p>before they are ready. Poverty, as well as tradition, culture and religion, are used to justify 
</p>
<p>early and/or forced marriages without regard for the adverse effects that such practices have 
</p>
<p>on the health and well-being of the child. Girls who marry early have their first children at a 
</p>
<p>younger age. Early childbearing contributes to pregnancy-related deaths and birth 
</p>
<p>complications, which are the leading cause of mortality among girls.  
</p>
<p>15. Some of the victims of early and/or forced marriage often resort to committing self-
</p>
<p>immolation. Although not all women and girls who take this action intend to kill 
</p>
<p>themselves, they inflict severe injuries upon themselves, which in some cases results in 
</p>
<p>their death. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission recorded a total of 
</p>
<p>133 cases of self-immolation from March to November 2011. However, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was unable to confirm the prevalence of this practice during her visit. At the 
</p>
<p>Burn Clinic in Herat, she was informed that there was a declining trend in the phenomenon 
</p>
<p>and that a burn injury could only be categorized as a self-immolation subject to a 
</p>
<p>confession from the victim, even if the medical evidence was conclusive.  
</p>
<p>16. Women and girls also run away from home as a response to harmful practices, 
</p>
<p>including physical, psychological or sexual abuse, or being forced into marriage, to avoid 
</p>
<p>death at the hands of their relatives. Running away is neither a crime under Afghan law, as 
</p>
<p>there is no provision in the Penal Code that addresses the issue,; nor is it a crime under 
</p>
<p>sharia law. However, the authorities sometimes charge women and girls who run away, 
</p>
<p>with the &#8220;intention&#8221; to commit sexual intercourse outside of marriage (<i>zina</i>) or attempted 
</p>
<p><i>zina</i>, which is considered to be a crime against God&#8217;s commands under sharia law. They 
</p>
<p>can also be charged for the crime of <i>zina</i> under article 427(1) of the Afghan Penal Code.6  
</p>
<p>17. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission registered more than 280 
</p>
<p>women who had been killed by family members during 2011 and 2012. Most of these 
</p>
<p>killings had been carried out on women and girls who had refused to enter into an arranged 
</p>
<p>marriage or had been accused of having a relationship that the family considered to be 
</p>
<p>inappropriate. Given the sensitivities surrounding this phenomenon, many of the cases are 
</p>
<p>concealed, and other explanations are provided for the deaths.  
</p>
<p>18. Some interlocutors raised concerns about the issue of incest, including when 
</p>
<p>committed against minors. The taboo nature of the crime results in victims not speaking 
</p>
<p>about or reporting the abuse. The Special Rapporteur heard the testimony of a young 
</p>
<p>woman who had been raped by her father for nearly a decade. In addition to the rapes, 
</p>
<p>threats and abuse she suffered, she had been forced to abort a number of pregnancies, but 
</p>
<p>was able to continue with one pregnancy. The victim alleged that some family members 
</p>
<p>had wanted to kill the baby to destroy evidence of sexual violence. Members of the family 
</p>
<p>were aware of the abuse, but no one intervened, out of fear.

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women in the community 
</b></p>
<p>19. Women are perceived as the custodians of a family&#8217;s &#8220;honour&#8221; and are seen as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;dishonouring&#8221; their families and communities when they are subjected to sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>As such, it is the rape victim who carries the shame of the crime in many cases.7 Women 
</p>
<p>and girls who live in rural areas, unaccompanied women, widows, divorced women and 
</p>
<p>women whose husbands are away are at a greater risk of becoming victims of rape.8  
</p>
<p>20. A significant number of rape incidents occur during armed robberies, kidnapping 
</p>
<p>and gang activity in general. A typical example includes an incident in 2014 in which seven 
</p>
<p>men dressed in police uniforms and armed with Kalashnikov rifles stopped two cars 
</p>
<p>heading into Kabul. The armed men forced the occupants out of their cars, took money and 
</p>
<p>jewellery and then proceeded to rape four women, including a pregnant woman. During a 
</p>
<p>two-hour trial in September 2014, the seven men were charged with armed robbery and 
</p>
<p><i>zina</i> and sentenced to death under the provision of the 1987 Law on Crimes against Internal 
</p>
<p>and External Security, which makes banditry punishable by death. The fact that the accused 
</p>
<p>men were not charged with rape but with the crime of <i>zina</i> implies that the consent of the 
</p>
<p>women had been obtained.9  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur was concerned at the escalating level of targeted attacks 
</p>
<p>against high-profile women, particularly those working in the public sector. For instance, in 
</p>
<p>February 2015, a former journalist and member of the provincial council of Nangarhar 
</p>
<p>Province was wounded in an explosion in Jalalabad city and died a week later. In 
</p>
<p>November 2014, a parliamentarian was targeted in a suicide attack, which resulted in the 
</p>
<p>death of three individuals.  
</p>
<p>22. Earlier in 2014, another parliamentarian was wounded in an attack when leaving her 
</p>
<p>office. Her sister, who is also a member of parliament and a prominent women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>activist, was attacked in 2010. In 2013, a senator lost her daughter in an attack on her car 
</p>
<p>and a parliamentarian was kidnapped and held for several weeks before being released. In 
</p>
<p>July 2013, the highest-ranking female police officer in Helmand was shot and killed on her 
</p>

<p>attacks against women working in the public domain. These attacks occur with impunity

</b></p>
<p>23. During her visits to the Badam Bagh women&#8217;s prison in Kabul and the juvenile 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation centre in Herat, the Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern at the high 
</p>
<p>number of women and girls arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for so-called &#8220;moral 
</p>
<p>crimes&#8221;, including adultery and premarital sex. Interlocutors stated that such convictions 
</p>
<p>were often made on the basis of minimal evidence of wrongful behaviour and that 
</p>
<p>investigations were often not properly carried out. Of the 744 female prisoners across the 
</p>
<p>country, 428 &#8212; or 58 per cent &#8212; were charged with so-called &#8220;moral crimes&#8221;.10 In the

</p>
<p>Rapporteur was informed that 90 women were in pretrial detention and 69 had been 
</p>
<p>convicted. A total of 11 girls were being held at the juvenile rehabilitation facility in Herat, 
</p>
<p>most of who had been arrested on charges of attempted <i>zina</i>.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur noted that the women&#8217;s versions of the incidents prior to 
</p>
<p>their detention was seldom taken into account, and that women victims were often treated 
</p>
<p>as criminals by the criminal justice system, thus violating due process rights. One 
</p>
<p>interviewee alleged that, following her rape by a relative, she was sentenced to six years of 
</p>
<p>imprisonment, along with her rapist, for the crime of <i>zina</i>. 
</p>
<p>25. The forced submission to virginity testing of women and girls accused of moral 
</p>
<p>crimes, including those have been raped, to gather evidence for the purposes of a 
</p>
<p>conviction, was an issue of concern raised by women prisoners.  
</p>
<p>26. The widespread practice of harassment of female police officers by their peers and 
</p>
<p>superiors is of concern as it serves to deter many women from joining or remaining in the 
</p>
<p>police force. There are also allegations that sexual favours are often demanded in exchange 
</p>
<p>for promotions. In addition, the lack of female-only facilities, including toilets and 
</p>
<p>changing areas, further contributes to women&#8217;s vulnerability.11 During a meeting with the 
</p>
<p>Provincial Policewomen&#8217;s Council in Herat, the Special Rapporteur was informed that most 
</p>
<p>of the cases the Council receives concern harassment, promotions and issues related to 
</p>
<p>gender-based discrimination. In an effort to prevent harassment and the undermining of 
</p>
<p>female police officers&#8217; authority by commanders and male police colleagues, and to 
</p>
<p>integrate women as full, equal and respected professionals within the police force, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior adopted the &#8220;Strategy for the Integration of Afghan National Police 
</p>
<p>Female Personnel&#8221; in 2013. It outlines measures for recruiting more women and preventive 
</p>
<p>measures to create an enabling environment for the protection of policewomen from sexual 
</p>
<p>harassment and violence. Pursuant to Order No. 163, issued in March 2014, steps are under 
</p>
<p>way to establish a commission tasked with drafting an action plan to operationalize the 
</p>
<p>strategy. However, the strategy fails to incorporate a clear, detailed, confidential and 
</p>
<p>enforceable complaints mechanism that could lead to either disciplinary action or, if 
</p>
<p>warranted, criminal sanctions against perpetrators of harassment or abuse of authority.12  
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women linked to the transnational sphere 
</b></p>
<p>27. There has been a significant increase in internal displacement over the past few 
</p>
<p>years as a consequence of the conflict. Other causes of displacement include generalized 
</p>
<p>violence, serious violations of human rights, natural disasters, development projects and 
</p>
<p>man-made disasters. It has been reported that, at the end of September 2014, 755,011<b> 
</b></p>
<p>individuals had been internally displaced in Afghanistan.13 Afghan internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons do not live in camps, but in informal settlements on the outskirts of major cities. 
</p>
<p>The overcrowded living situation increases the risks of violence for women. Many of them 
</p>
<p>are subjected to domestic violence and forced marriages. Furthermore, the switch in 
</p>
<p>traditional housing conditions, including the move from rural to urban environments, have

<p>28. More than 60 per cent of trafficking in women and children takes place inside 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan, while cross-border trafficking occurs in 40 per cent of the cases, for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of sexual exploitation, domestic servitude and sale of narcotics.15 Female victims 
</p>
<p>of trafficking not only experience sexual assaults and slavery from the perpetrator, but also 
</p>
<p>are victims of honour killings and subjected to violence by their own families after being 
</p>
<p>rescued.16 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Responses in addressing violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>29. With the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) and six subsequent resolutions on 
</p>
<p>women, peace and security (1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013) and 
</p>
<p>2122 (2013)) the Security Council outlined concrete actions to be taken by the international 
</p>
<p>community and respective Member States to address the issues of women, peace and 
</p>
<p>security. In November 2014, the Government of Afghanistan adopted its 2015-2018 
</p>
<p>National Action Plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  
</p>
<p>30. Since the fall of the Taliban era, the international community, including the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and international donors, has invested significant human, technical and material 
</p>
<p>resources to assist the Government in its post-conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction 
</p>
<p>efforts. Despite significant advances in the status of women, they continue to face severe 
</p>
<p>challenges in the realization of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>Prevailing insecurity and the generalized violence across the country, the existence of deep-
</p>
<p>rooted conservative social norms and cultural practices and the limitations on freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement for women all contribute to women&#8217;s role in public life being limited, including 
</p>
<p>in political and peace processes.  
</p>
<p><b> A. National responses 
</b></p>
<p>31. The institutional framework for addressing women&#8217;s rights includes a number of 
</p>
<p>governmental bodies and institutions, both at the capital and the provincial levels, which 
</p>
<p>have similar mandates and functions. Established in 2001 by a presidential decree, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs is responsible for monitoring, supporting and coordinating the 
</p>
<p>implementation of policies and legislation and developing and contributing to the 
</p>
<p>development of policies for advancement of women, including the adoption of the 10-year 
</p>
<p>National Action Plan for Women of Afghanistan in 2008. Under the supervision of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry, State institutions are expected to mainstream gender in their policies, plans and 
</p>
<p>activities, and ministries are encouraged to dedicate at least 30 per cent of their budget to it.

</p>
<p>The Plan commits the State to ensure the civil service comprises 30 per cent women by 
</p>
<p>2018.17  
</p>
<p>32. While the establishment of Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs has been considered a 
</p>
<p>positive sign, it has not been fully able to exercise its mandate effectively, owing to such 
</p>
<p>challenges as inadequate budgetary allocation by the State; international donor funding 
</p>
<p>dependency; a lack of independence; a lack of capacity of staff; cultural norms that affect 
</p>
<p>functioning; the politicization of appointment processes; poor spatial infrastructure; and a 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate security in the workplace. The lack of substantive support by the 
</p>
<p>Government for the Ministry, in comparison with other ministries, was observed during the 
</p>
<p>mission.  
</p>
<p>33. There are a total of 27 gender units within the different ministries. Some units are 
</p>
<p>staffed only with a gender focal point, who have no access to the Ministry&#8217;s budget and are 
</p>
<p>without a clear job description. Most of the units lack staff, office space and technical 
</p>
<p>equipment. In March 2010, the Government established the Special Violence against 
</p>
<p>Women Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to investigate and prosecute cases of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and support and assist victims throughout the process. The unit 
</p>
<p>registered 285 cases from Kabul province between March 2010 and March 2011, but filed 
</p>
<p>indictments with the courts in only 21 of those cases. More than 70 per cent of cases were 
</p>
<p>closed, archived, withdrawn or mediated owing to prevalent cultural and traditional norms. 
Since then, specialized units for the elimination of violence against women have been set 
</p>
<p>up in eight provinces.
12
</p>
<p> The Ministry of Interior established family response units staffed 
</p>
<p>by policewomen throughout the country, mainly in the provincial capitals. There are 17 
</p>
<p>such units in Kabul and, as at May 2013, there were 184 units in 33 provinces.18 The units 
</p>
<p>mainly handle domestic disputes and domestic violence and are rarely involved in 
</p>
<p>investigating cases of rape, self-immolation or forced marriage.  
</p>
<p>34. The High Commission for the Elimination of Violence against Women is mandated 
</p>
<p>to coordinate activities among government, non-governmental institutions and related 
</p>
<p>organizations to &#8220;effectively combat violence&#8221;. It is chaired by the Ministry of Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Affairs and its members include the Deputy Attorney General and the Deputy Ministers of 
</p>
<p>Interior; Justice; Public Health; Information and Culture; Education; Higher Education; 
</p>
<p>Labour, Social Affairs, Martyrs and the Disabled; and Hajj and Religious Affairs. 
</p>
<p>Membership is also open to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, the 
</p>
<p>Head of the Special Family Court and the Head of the Afghanistan Independent Bar 
</p>
<p>Association. Commissions on the elimination of violence against women have also been 
</p>
<p>established in 32 of 34 provinces to coordinate, plan and track the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Law.  
</p>
<p>35. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission was established in 2002 
</p>
<p>through a presidential decree in line with the provisions of the Bonn Agreement. The 
</p>
<p>Commission consists of nine Commissioners appointed by the President for a five-year 
</p>
<p>term. It is mandated to monitor the human rights situation, promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights, conduct investigations into human rights violations and take measures for the 
</p>
<p>improvement and promotion of human rights nationwide. The Commission employs 
</p>
<p>approximately 600 staff working in regional and provincial offices across the country and 
</p>
<p>plays a central role in monitoring, reporting and advocating for women&#8217;s rights broadly, 
</p>
<p>including gender-based violence. The Commission works with a wide range of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including United Nations agencies and religious leaders.

<p>36. Despite considerable achievements and the progress made in the area of human 
</p>
<p>rights in the country, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission continues to 
</p>
<p>face numerous challenges in achieving its objectives and implementing its activities. Owing 
</p>
<p>to the high level of insecurity, the Commission services cover just 44 per cent of the area 
</p>
<p>linked to its provincial and regional offices, and many districts are deprived of services 
</p>
<p>provided by the Commission.19 Other obstacles include a weak presence of the rule of law, 
</p>
<p>a persistent culture of impunity, high levels of corruption, abuse of power by government 
</p>
<p>officials and a weak judicial system. The human rights of women and children continue to 
</p>
<p>be undermined by reports of egregious crimes and impunity for such crimes.20 Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>the Commission is almost entirely dependent on foreign Governments and international 
</p>
<p>organizations for funding. The lack of appropriate State-allocated budgets has affected the 
</p>
<p>planning and programmatic activities of the Commission.  
</p>
<p>37. Following the appointment of five new commissioners and the reappointment of 
</p>
<p>four serving commissioners in June 2013, concerns were raised about the transparency of 
</p>
<p>the selection process and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission was at 
</p>
<p>risk of being downgraded from an A status institution to a B status. In addition to the 
</p>
<p>limited consultation and transparency in the appointment of commissioners, other issues 
</p>
<p>highlighted during the November 2013 review of the Commission by the International 
</p>
<p>Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights was the gender imbalance of the its staff and its insufficient State funding. 
</p>
<p>However, in October 2014, the Committee recommended that the Commission be re-
</p>
<p>accredited with an A status, which has since been done.21 The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>commends the Commission for its commitment and leading role in addressing the issue of 
</p>
<p>violence against women in the country, despite the constraints and challenges it faces.  
</p>
<p>38. In August 2010, the High Council of the Supreme Court, in approval number 572, 
</p>
<p>instructed prosecutors on how to handle &#8220;runaway&#8221; cases, by invoking article 130 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. According to the instruction, courts should assess whether runaway women 
</p>
<p>are single or married, the cause and motive for running away and the place to which the 
</p>
<p>woman has run. If a woman runs to escape harassment and disturbance by family members 
</p>
<p>and goes to a relative&#8217;s house, the house of a legitimate <i>mahram</i> (unmarriageable kin) or to 
</p>
<p>a justice institution, then this shall not be regarded as a crime from the sharia perspective. 
</p>
<p>However, if a woman goes to a stranger&#8217;s house, even if it is to escape ill-treatment, the 
</p>
<p>instruction states that she exposes herself to crimes such as &#8220;adultery and other associated 
</p>
<p>offences&#8221;, which are considered illegal under sharia law, and thus prohibited and 
</p>
<p>punishable.
6
 Other instructions have been issued on how to handle &#8220;runaway&#8221; cases, 
</p>
<p>including from the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. Urgent Communication No. 91/02 of 11 
</p>
<p>April 2012 requests that units for the elimination of violence against women issue 
</p>
<p>instructions to all prosecution offices not to press charges against women for &#8220;running 
</p>
<p>away&#8221; or &#8220;attempted <i>zina</i>&#8221; &#8211; as these are not actual codified crimes under Afghan law. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, in December 2012, the Supreme Court sent a letter (No. 820/347) to the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General&#8217;s Office stating that running away from home to escape domestic 
</p>
<p>violence and seeking assistance from justice institutions, legal aid organizations or relatives 
</p>
<p>was not a crime and should not be prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>39. Penalties for women convicted of moral crimes range from medium- to long-term 
</p>
<p>imprisonment. Sentences will be clarified in the forthcoming Criminal Procedure Code and 
</p>

<p>are expected to define short-term imprisonment as ranging from three months to one year; 
</p>
<p>medium-term imprisonment as one year to five years, and long-term imprisonment as 5 to 
</p>
<p>15 years or 15 to 20 years, depending on the crime.22  
</p>
<p>40. Article 17 of the Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women makes 
</p>
<p>reference to article 426 of the Afghan Penal Code, in respect of sexual assaults. If the 
</p>
<p>person against whom the crime is committed is under 18 or meets any of the other 
</p>
<p>conditions laid down in article 427, paragraph 2, of the Code, then the offender is sentenced 
</p>
<p>to a long prison term, not exceeding 10 years. In a recent case, the Kabul City Primary 
</p>
<p>Court sentenced a perpetrator to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of 1,500,000 Afs 
</p>
<p>(approximately $26,000) for rape under article 17 (2), (3) and (5) of the Law and 
</p>
<p>articles 426, 427 and 148 of the Code.  
</p>
<p>41. The Anti-Human Trafficking and Abduction Law was passed in 2008 with the aim 
</p>
<p>of supporting the victims of human trafficking, especially women and children. Anyone 
</p>
<p>who sexually provokes or involves individuals under the age of 18 in sexual activities or 
</p>
<p>prostitution as his or her profession, or provides them with facilities for such activities, is 
</p>
<p>considered criminally liable and will be sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison. If 
</p>
<p>the exploited person is raped or forced to pederasty, the punishment can increase up to 15 
</p>
<p>years in prison. Under article 8 of Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the 
</p>
<p>penalty for anyone who exploits or forces an adult woman into prostitution increases to 7 to 
</p>
<p>16 years of imprisonment. If the exploited person is a child, the perpetrator is sentenced to a 
</p>
<p>minimum of 10 and a maximum of 16 years in prison.23  
</p>
<p>42. The Law on Prison and Detention Centres provides that, if the case of an accused 
</p>
<p>person is not finalized within 9 months, the prison administration must notify the relevant 
</p>
<p>court or public prosecutor in writing 15 days before the expiry of the term. If there is no 
</p>
<p>reply, the accused person shall be released from prison.24 In practice, time limits and other 
</p>
<p>safeguards are seldom applied and women often remain in pretrial detention for much 
</p>
<p>longer than the prescribed period. Although article 86 of the Interim Criminal Procedure 
</p>
<p>Code makes provisions for alternatives to imprisonment while awaiting trial, it is seldom 
</p>
<p>utilized.  
</p>
<p>43. In 2011, the United Nations Population Fund commissioned an assessment of 
</p>
<p>services provided to victims of gender-based violence by State and non-State agencies in 
</p>
<p>three pilot areas: Bamiyan and Nanghahar provinces and Kabul city. The assessment 
</p>
<p>revealed that most service providers did not have units responsible for addressing the 
</p>
<p>special needs of victims of gender-based violence. Other issues highlighted include the 
</p>
<p>capacity, quality and reach of services provided to victims; the shortage of trained female 
</p>
<p>professionals; and the lack of specialized knowledge and skills among key staff members. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, most health-care facilities did not have separate facilities for examining and 
</p>
<p>interviewing victims of gender-based violence. In terms of access to services, the majority 
</p>
<p>of service providers did not promote the services among target population groups. Service 
</p>
<p>providers often place the responsibility for starting the interaction solely on the victims or 
</p>
<p>their families. As regards the processing of cases, there is a of lack of relevant policies, 
</p>
<p>standard operating procedures, protocols and ethical and safety guidelines regulating the 
</p>
<p>treatment of victims of gender-based violence.25

<p>44. Civil society is composed of both Afghan and international non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. While organizations working exclusively on women&#8217;s rights are numerically 
</p>
<p>few, they are dynamic and organized. The organizations working directly with victims of 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence have to operate in secrecy, as they are viewed with hostility and 
</p>
<p>victims are often perceived as criminals. For example, shelters are viewed by many as 
</p>
<p>institutions that encourage women to leave home; to behave immorally and outside of what 
</p>
<p>is traditionally considered &#8220;acceptable&#8221; in a conservative and religious society; or as 
</p>
<p>prostitution houses; or establishments that are causing the break-up of families. Thus both 
</p>
<p>the service providers and those seeking protection are stigmatized and shunned by society.  
</p>
<p>45. Many of the challenges that civil society organizations face are linked to the 
</p>
<p>generalized context of insecurity, which limits their presence to the least volatile areas, and 
</p>
<p>to the difficulties in accessing funding that enables sustainability. Furthermore, various 
</p>
<p>interlocutors highlighted the lack of consultation during the drafting of legislation and the 
</p>
<p>absence of participatory democracy. The Special Rapporteur was informed that legislation 
</p>
<p>is usually drafted between the Ministry of Justice and international experts and that non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations are only consulted in the final stages of the process, after 
</p>
<p>decisions have been made. This was a criticism that was also voiced by some State 
</p>
<p>authorities, and concerns were raised about the consequences of perceptions of the 
</p>
<p>international community and consultants owning the law-making processes.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International responses 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>46. The United Nations country team in Afghanistan comprises 21 United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds, programmes and offices, as well as UNAMA, which was established by 
</p>
<p>the Security Council in 2002 at the request of the Government to assist it in laying the 
</p>
<p>foundations for sustainable peace and development in the country. Through its Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Unit, UNAMA supports strategies and mechanisms for combating violence against 
</p>
<p>women, including prevention and remedial mechanisms for female victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>UNAMA is also providing support to the Ministry of Interior to implement and monitor a 
</p>
<p>policy and action plan for the protection of female staff from harassment and abuse. The 
</p>
<p>UNAMA Rule of Law Unit and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime are also 
</p>
<p>supporting the Government with the reform of the penal system.  
</p>
<p>47. The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women 
</p>
<p>(UN-Women) has been working in Afghanistan since 2002. The agency has provided 
</p>
<p>technical and financial support to the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs and civil society in the 
</p>
<p>management and operation of 13 women&#8217;s protection centres and two family guidance 
</p>
<p>centres, as well as in advocacy and awareness-raising to promote prevention of violence 
</p>
<p>against women, operation of the provincial commissions for the elimination of violence 
</p>
<p>against women and resource centres, and training of and coordination between stakeholders 
</p>
<p>concerning legal reform.  
</p>
<p>48. In 2013, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) undertook a review 
</p>
<p>of the functioning of units for the elimination of violence against women in Kabul, Mazar-
</p>
<p>E-Sharif, Herat and Jalalabad. It recommended the establishment of a court on the 
</p>
<p>elimination of violence against women to enable the units to function effectively, in light of 
</p>
<p>the difficulties of limited management, training and resources, and a high level of 
</p>
<p>corruption or perceived corruption faced in all of the Government ministries, including the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>court system.26 Technical assistance is being provided by UNDP to relevant government 
</p>
<p>institutions to support efforts to develop and implement rights-based guidelines and 
</p>
<p>protocols regulating mediation of registered incidents of violence against women. In 2013, 
</p>
<p>the World Health Organization developed a &#8220;Gender-based violence treatment protocol for 
</p>
<p>primary health care in Afghanistan&#8221; to improve the delivery of a multi-sectorial response to 
</p>
<p>survivors of gender-based violence. Moreover, the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) supports the implementation of the national 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons  policy and has established women&#8217;s <i>shuras</i> (consultations) to 
</p>
<p>enable them to voice their concerns and participate in decisions that affect their lives.  
</p>
<p>49. While acknowledging the notable contributions of the United Nations system, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur observed some duplication of work and the need for better coordination 
</p>
<p>among the agencies in the interest of resource management, efficiency and the achievement 
</p>
<p>of a more substantive improvement of women&#8217;s rights for all Afghan women.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Donor community 
</b></p>
<p>50. Since the end of the Taliban era, the international community has made significant 
</p>
<p>investments towards Afghanistan&#8217;s reconstruction. The Bonn Agreement adopted in 
</p>
<p>December of 2001 led to the adoption of a national Constitution in 2004. It also led to the 
</p>
<p>increase of women&#8217;s participation in civil and political life and a commitment to respect 
</p>
<p>international human rights law through ratification of or accession to numerous 
</p>
<p>instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women. The concluding resolution at the second Bonn conference in 2011 
</p>
<p>reaffirmed the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>including the rights of women, as well as a thriving and free civil society.  
</p>
<p>51. The international community pledged over $67 billion at nine donors&#8217; conferences 
</p>
<p>from 2003 to 2010. However, it is reported that international aid actually disbursed was 
</p>
<p>significantly less. In July 2012, the international community committed to directing 
</p>
<p>financial support towards Afghanistan&#8217;s economic development by providing over 16 
</p>
<p>billion dollars through 2015 and sustaining support through 2017 at or near levels of the 
</p>
<p>past decade. On 4 December 2014, the National Unity Government of Afghanistan and the 
</p>
<p>international community, along with other partners, met in London to reaffirm and 
</p>
<p>consolidate their partnership as they begin the Transformation Decade (2015&#8211;2024).  
</p>
<p>52. Between 2002 and 2009, the United States of America was Afghanistan&#8217;s largest 
</p>
<p>donor, followed by European Union institutions, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland, Germany, Canada and Japan. The United Nations, non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International 
</p>
<p>Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are important channels of delivery for 
</p>
<p>donor funds. Funding from the United States aims at providing humanitarian assistance for 
</p>
<p>families and communities affected by conflict or natural disasters; and assistance to women 
</p>
<p>that focuses on health, education, economic development, shelters, women&#8217;s rights and 
</p>
<p>political empowerment.27  
</p>
<p>53. The funding of shelters by international donors is crucial as a long-term solution to 
</p>
<p>the housing needs of women and girls. In most developed countries, shelters are places of 
</p>
<p>temporary refuge and support for women escaping violence. The situation of women in 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan is somewhat different and women who are forced to find shelter in a safe

<p>house risk finding themselves with no way out of their situations. They do not have the 
</p>
<p>option of returning home or to their communities and thus shelters become a long-term 
</p>
<p>residential solution for women and their children. As noted by the previous mandate holder, 
</p>
<p>and confirmed during this visit, the difficulty of finding durable solutions for women who 
</p>
<p>end up in a shelter is compounded by the societal attitude towards shelters, which to a large 
</p>
<p>extent are regarded as places of doubtful reputation. There are also concerns regarding the 
</p>
<p>ability of shelters to provide protection, the management abilities of staff and the long-term 
</p>
<p>reintegration and support that is provided to women. Unfortunately, some shelters have also 
</p>
<p>been used in the past for pretrial detention, owing to the lack of female pretrial facilities.  
</p>
<p>54. The findings of a 2008 report on aid effectiveness, which were reiterated by 
</p>
<p>interlocutors during the mission, pointed to the fact that one quarter of all aid to 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan had been allocated to technical assistance, which was intended to build 
</p>
<p>Government capacity. It was argued that much of such assistance had been wasteful, donor-
</p>
<p>driven and of limited impact. Also, in the design or execution of projects, too often the 
</p>
<p>promotion of the capabilities, status and rights of women was a low priority. The report also 
</p>
<p>revealed that most of the aid had been directed to Kabul and other urban centres rather than 
</p>
<p>to rural areas, where it is most needed.28 Some interlocutors argued that, when bilateral 
</p>
<p>agreements are signed with civil society or United Nations agencies, the benefits of such 
</p>
<p>aid does not reach volatile areas, often owing to the recipients not having nationwide 
</p>
<p>coverage, as opposed to government agencies, which more often do.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Remaining challenges 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Government of Afghanistan has taken measures to promote the rights of 
</p>
<p>women. However, given the current transitional process, characterized by a new 
</p>
<p>Government, a growing budget deficit and the withdrawal of international troops, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur expresses her concern about the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights, including accountability for all acts of gender-based violence. In addition to 
</p>
<p>the generalized context of insecurity, the equal participation of women in decision-making 
</p>
<p>positions and peacebuilding processes and the lack of implementation of legislation and its 
</p>
<p>impact on women&#8217;s access to justice are some of the key challenges faced by women.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Continuum of violence and insecurity  
</b></p>
<p>56. Afghanistan is slowly recovering from a long period of conflict, albeit with high 
</p>
<p>levels of insecurity. The consequences of conflict, poverty, underdevelopment, social 
</p>
<p>norms and practices, and the use of religion and culture as justification for control of 
</p>
<p>women in every sphere, all continue to contribute to human rights violations, with women 
</p>
<p>being disproportionately affected. It has been reported that there was a 22 per cent rise in 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties in 2014, with the highest number of women&#8217;s deaths and injuries from 
</p>
<p>conflict-related violence since 2009. In total, 556 incidents were recorded, involving 909 
</p>
<p>women (298 deaths and 611 injured). Furthermore, women who were left as sole income-
</p>
<p>providers after the death or injury of their husbands often experience long-term negative 
</p>
<p>social and economic consequences. Poverty forces many women to give their daughters in 
</p>
<p>marriage to repay debts or take their children out of school, often to work. Widowed

</p>
<p>women are particularly vulnerable to other forms of violence and abuse from family and 
</p>
<p>community members.29  
</p>
<p>57. Certain areas of the country are outside of the Government&#8217;s control, and targeted 
</p>
<p>attacks against communities and high-profile women and men by anti-Government 
</p>
<p>elements, both in Government-controlled areas and other areas, are a frequent occurrence. 
</p>
<p>Politicians and policewomen also face threats and violence outside their working 
</p>
<p>environment, often from the anti-Government elements and radicals. In different provinces, 
</p>
<p>numerous women have been forced to quit their jobs or have been killed.30  
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>Women&#8217;s participation<b> in decision making and peace building processes 
</b></p>
<p>58. As regards women&#8217;s participation in decision-making positions, under the previous 
</p>
<p>Government, women headed the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, the Ministry of Public 
</p>
<p>Health and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Martyrs and the Disabled.31 In January 
</p>
<p>2015, the president announced his 25 ministerial nominees, which included three women 
</p>
<p>nominated to lead the Ministries of Information and Culture, Higher Education and 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Affairs. The number of women nominated for public office increased to four and, 
</p>
<p>in April 2015, the Afghanistan parliament approved the appointment of four women 
</p>
<p>ministers who would lead the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, the Ministry of Higher 
</p>
<p>Education, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Martyrs and the Disabled and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Counter-narcotics. 
</p>
<p>59. The Constitution has introduced a quota system to ensure a minimum level of 
</p>
<p>female representation in the two houses of parliament. A minimum of two of the elected 
</p>
<p>members of the lower house from each of Afghanistan&#8217;s 34 provinces must be female. In 
</p>
<p>addition, a third of the upper house seats must be female.32 Currently, there are 69 out of 
</p>
<p>249 women in the <i>Wolesi Jirga</i> (lower house) and 28 female senators out of 102.33
 
As 
</p>
<p>regards the representation of women in the judiciary, while there are no women in the High 
</p>
<p>Council of the Supreme Court, there are 250 female judges in both primary courts and 
</p>
<p>appeal courts throughout the country.34 As at April 2013, there were 300 female defence 
</p>
<p>lawyers and 250 female prosecutors, including a chief prosecutor in Herat, the only woman 
</p>
<p>ever to hold such a position.35
 
The current Chairperson of the Afghanistan Independent 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission is a woman. 
</p>
<p>60. In 2005, a former Minister for Women&#8217;s Affairs, was appointed governor of 
</p>
<p>Bamiyan. She was the first female provincial governor in Afghanistan&#8217;s history. In 2009, 
</p>
<p>the first ever female mayor was appointed in Daikundi province.36 In January 2013, the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s first female district governor in Faizabad district was appointed, making her the 
</p>
<p>only woman appointed among 60 district governors. Unfortunately, amendments made to 
</p>
<p>the Electoral Law in July 2013 reduced the quota for women representatives in the

<p>61. In terms of the number of women operating in the security sector, it has been 
</p>
<p>reported that, as at 1 March 2014, women constituted 0.4 per cent of the Afghan National 
</p>
<p>Army, 0.75 per cent of the Afghan Air Force, 1.3 per cent of the Afghan National Police 
</p>
<p>and 4.6 per cent of the staff of the Directorate of Prisons.  
</p>
<p>62. Women are minimally represented in peace negotiations, and women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>continue to be a low priority in the peace talks agenda. For example, out of 1,600 
</p>
<p>individuals who attended the Peace Jirga hosted by the Government of Afghanistan in June 
</p>
<p>2010, only 300 were women. In September 2010, the High Peace Council to seek peace 
</p>
<p>talks with the Taliban was formed, but only 9 out the 70 appointed members were women.37 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, interlocutors stated that female members of the High Peace Council played a 
</p>
<p>symbolic role rather than being active participants.  
</p>
<p> <b>C.</b> <b>Lack of effective implementation of legislation and its impact 
on </b>women&#8217;s access to justice and effective remedies<b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. As regards to access to justice and accountability for gender-based crimes, while the 
</p>
<p>legal framework provides for sufficient protection for violence against women, there are 
</p>
<p>institutional, procedural and social obstacles limiting women&#8217;s access to justice. In most 
</p>
<p>instances, women do not use the formal justice system, for reasons including a lack of easy 
</p>
<p>access to the justice system, the ineffective implementation of existing legislation and the 
</p>
<p>overreliance on the informal justice system. During a meeting with representatives of civil 
</p>
<p>society and local councils in Herat, the Special Rapporteur was informed that shuras often 
</p>
<p>deal with cases of violence against women despite legislative measures such as the Law on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Violence against Women and the existence of institutions with a 
</p>
<p>legislative mandate to mediate such cases.  
</p>
<p>64. The Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women is a major legal 
</p>
<p>development in the prevention and elimination of violence against women. The 
</p>
<p>Government has undertaken steps to implement and enforce the Law, including through the 
</p>
<p>establishment of specialized prosecution units for the elimination of violence against 
</p>
<p>women in some provinces and the establishment of family response units within some 
</p>
<p>police stations. However, the Law is not implemented to the same degree in the different 
</p>
<p>provinces, with particularly low levels of implementation in rural areas. In numerous cases, 
</p>
<p>mediation is conducted by <i>jirgas</i> and <i>shuras</i>, whose membership is limited to men, and 
</p>
<p>solutions are made on the basis of cultural norms rather than using the legal framework, to 
</p>
<p>ensure accountability and effective redress for the victim. Law enforcement agencies such 
</p>
<p>as the Afghan National Police and family response units have a mandate to mediate cases; 
</p>
<p>however, there are no criteria or regulations governing the conduct of mediation.  
</p>
<p>65. Very few cases of violence against women, particularly cases of rape or sexual 
</p>
<p>abuse, are reported compared with the actual prevalence rates. Women and girls are 
</p>
<p>prevented from reporting acts of violence for various reasons, including deeply engrained 
</p>
<p>attitudes that regard domestic violence as a private matter and the treatment of victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse as perpetrators of <i>zina</i>. Other reasons include stigma, shame, discrimination, 
</p>
<p>fear of reprisals from the perpetrators, feelings of guilt and lack of support from friends and 
</p>
<p>family. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, even when women wish to file 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 37 See Oxfam, &#8220;Behind closed doors&#8221; (24 November 2014), p. 17. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>complaints, they are often discouraged, and when they file complaints, they are encouraged 
</p>
<p>to withdraw the case. Prosecutors often use one of the objectives of the Law on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Violence against Women, defined under its article 2 as the preservation of 
</p>
<p>the family unit, to mediate cases out of the formal court system. As regards protection 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, the main challenges include the insufficient number of shelters and safe 
</p>
<p>houses for women who are victims of violence and the lack of opportunities for women to 
</p>
<p>be reintegrated back into their families and society.  
</p>
<p>66. Other challenges to women&#8217;s access to justice include insufficient resources and 
</p>
<p>poor infrastructure and a lack of female police officers and specialized units to specifically 
</p>
<p>address crimes against women and girls. The lack of proper investigation, evidence 
</p>
<p>collection and forensic capacities further hinder women&#8217;s access to justice. The issue of 
</p>
<p>forced virginity testing to gather evidence for criminal prosecutions represents a serious 
</p>
<p>violation of women&#8217;s rights to privacy, bodily integrity and dignity.  
</p>
<p>67. Furthermore, corruption in the criminal justice system is prevalent and represents an 
</p>
<p>obstacle to the rights of due process and fair trial, thus affecting women&#8217;s access to justice. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was informed that bribes were often required for cases to move 
</p>
<p>through the different stages of the criminal justice system. Also, perpetrators can go 
</p>
<p>unpunished if bribes are paid to relevant officials. This creates a culture of impunity and 
</p>
<p>fosters further distrust of the formal justice system.  
</p>
<p>68. Illegal detention and imprisonment, human rights violations in prisons and the lack 
</p>
<p>of fair and effective implementation of non-custodial sanctions continue to remain a 
</p>
<p>challenge.38
 
The Special Rapporteur heard numerous accounts from women in prison and 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society who corroborated such violations. 
</p>
<p>69. Victims of violence and representatives of civil society with whom the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur met highlighted the lengthy criminal procedure, the non-respect of protection 
</p>
<p>measures and the inadequate pecuniary and detention sanctions against perpetrators.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Government has undertaken a number of legal and institutional initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>to meet its human rights obligations and to address the situation of women and girls in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country, despite the continued political, economic, social and developmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges. Political commitments to protect and promote human rights continue to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlighted through the Bonn process, the Kabul Conference, the Tokyo Conference 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, most recently, the 2014 London Conference. However, these commitments have 
</b></p>
<p><b>not translated into concrete improvements in the lives of the majority of women, who 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain marginalized, discriminated against and at high risk of being subjected to 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence. In light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expand on key recommendations made by her predecessors in 1999 and 2005, many of 
</b></p>
<p><b>which remain relevant today.

<p><b>more effective consultation processes in the law-making sphere; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Prioritize the clear codification of family law and the criminal law 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning gender-specific offences to ensure compliance with article 22 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution, which expressly provides that men and women have equal rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>duties before the law;  
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>Ensure that legislation clearly specifies the obligation to register all 
</b></p>
<p><b>marriages and divorces; 
</b></p>
<p>(d) <b>Ensure that the criminal law establishes criminal liability for all parties 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved in the organization of child and forced marriages. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In relation to the reform of the 1960 Penal Code, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government:  
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>Incorporate gender-specific offences, including rape, into the new penal 
</b></p>
<p><b>code. These offences should be clearly defined and the sanctions applicable to each 
</b></p>
<p><b>offence should be specified to ensure that gender-specific offences are treated with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>same degree of gravity as gender-neutral crimes. A review of all existing laws that 
</b></p>
<p><b>include criminal offenses, including the Law on the Elimination of Violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women, should be undertaken to ensure consistency; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Repeal article 398 of the Penal Code to ensure that perpetrators of 
</b></p>
<p><b>honour killings are not granted legal concessions; 
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>Revise the Criminal Procedure Code and prohibit degrading practices, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including virginity testing, as a source of evidence in criminal investigations; 
</b></p>
<p>(d) <b>Ensure that there is accountability in cases of self-immolation, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through effective forensic and other investigations; 
</b></p>
<p>(e) <b>Reform the law pertaining to moral crimes to ensure that it incorporates 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies and directives that have been issued. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In relation to the draft law regulating the jurisdiction of <i>jirgas</i> and <i>shuras</i>, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur recommends that: </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Clear guidelines and policies on the use of mediation to settle disputes be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed, including provisions on non-discrimination and sanctions for non-
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>The processing of a case by <i>jirgas</i> or <i>shuras</i> not preclude such cases from 
</b></p>
<p><b>being brought before the formal justice system;  
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>All gender-based violence cases that have a criminal component be 
</b></p>
<p><b>referred to the formal justice system to ensure accountability.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government repeal the 
</b></p>
<p><b>amendment to the Electoral Law so as to ensure that the quota for women 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives in the Provincial Councils is increased. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Women in detention 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Ministry of Justice, in 
</b></p>
<p>cooperation with the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, 
</p>
<p><b>initiate a review, including recommendations in respect of provisions in the penal and 
</b></p>
<p><b>family laws relevant to moral offences, of the files of all women and girls currently in 
</b></p>
<p>detention for crimes generally, and more specifically for &#8220;moral crimes&#8221;, to verify 
</p>
<p><b>whether: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>There has been a valid court decision to sentence the detainees to 
</b></p>
<p><b>imprisonment, or in the case of pretrial detention, an order by the authority 
</b></p>
<p><b>competent under the Criminal Procedure Law; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>That the women or girls have been found guilty or stand accused of 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes expressly punishable under codified law currently in force; 
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>That the women have been given their rights to fair trial and due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Government should consider alternatives to detention and address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>question of transit houses for women who are released from detention. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Government should increase the number of shelters for victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women; strengthen support services for victims, including counselling, 
</b></p>
<p><b>medical and rehabilitation services; provide training and skills development 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes; assist with financial and technical support to ensure good practices and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainability; and develop a strategy to ensure financial support.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Women working in the public sector 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government address more fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>the safety and security concerns of women working in the public sphere, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>women politicians and police personnel, and in particular that it: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>Undertake an inquiry into the allegations of harassment and abuse of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women working in the security sector across the country; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Establish and/or strengthen monitoring mechanisms both within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ministry of Interior and externally, to ensure that women working in the security 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector are protected from all forms of abuse, exploitation and harassment.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p> <b>E. International community 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the international community, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the United Nations and the donor community, continue to support the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Afghanistan in fulfilling its duty to promote and protect the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in Afghanistan. In particular, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international community:</b> 
</p>
<p>(a) Advocate for the inclusion of women and women&#8217;s rights issues on the 
</p>
<p>agenda of peace negotiations and set the promotion of women&#8217;s right as a targe<b>t for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the provision of further funding; 
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Review the actual amount of funding that is currently being given 
</b></p>
<p><b>directly to the Government of Afghanistan and to local non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, to enable a more precise picture of who is benefiting from aid. There is 
</b></p>
<p><b>a need to address perceptions of large amounts of funding to foreign consultants and 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations agencies, which are sometimes seen as wasteful and leading to a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building and sustainability of local authorities and service providers; 
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>Assist in the review of protection mechanisms, including shelters, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to find sustainable long-term housing alternatives for women in need of 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection. Emphasis should be placed on the empowerment of women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b>through education, skills development and job creation.
