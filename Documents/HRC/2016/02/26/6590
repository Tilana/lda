<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that 2008 marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> of the initiative of member and associate States of the 
Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), to present a proposal to elaborate a set of human 
rights goals to be pursued, inspired by the Millennium Development Goals, to promote the 
implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also taking note with great 
appreciation of the process towards broadening cross-regional support for that initiative, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> that the above-mentioned initiative could bring more visibility and 
public awareness to the United Nations human rights system with a view to the promotion and 
protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides</i> to initiate an open-ended intergovernmental process in order to elaborate, on 
a consensual basis, a set of human rights voluntary goals, to promote the realization and 
implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in accordance with States&#8217; 
international human rights obligations and commitments to be launched on 10 December 2008 
during the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also decides</i> to the end described in paragraph 1 above to take the following steps: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To invite States to refer to the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and to human rights voluntary goals at the High-level Segment of 
the Human Rights Council at its session in March 2008, and to hold a panel with the aim of 
exchanging views on the issue of human rights voluntary goals at that session; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To invite the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
present to the Human Rights Council by its session in June 2008 information on the programmes 
and activities to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To hold thereafter open-ended intergovernmental informal consultations to elaborate 
a set of human rights voluntary goals to be presented to the Human Rights Council, on a 
consensual basis, through a draft resolution to be adopted by the Council at the end of its session 
in September 2008; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further decides</i> that the open-ended intergovernmental process will lead to the elaboration 
of human rights voluntary goals under the following issues: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Universal ratification of the core international human rights instruments; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Elaboration, in each country, where they do not exist, of national human rights 
programmes, and the creation of national institutions responsible for human rights issues, in 
accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993 and the Paris 
Principles; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Adoption of a legal, institutional and policy framework at the national level in order 
to ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Definition, within the framework of national human rights programmes, of targets 
and actions in the field of capacity-building as well as of a programme of human rights education 
and identification of needs and shortcomings related to international cooperation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Definition within the framework of national human rights programmes of targets and 
actions in compliance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, inter alia, to eliminate 
</p>
<p>discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes</i> that such human rights voluntary goals are to be regarded as reinforcing 
and by no means as replacing, either totally or partially, existing human rights obligations and 
commitments, including the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5.<i> Welcomes</i> participation in the process of representatives of the United Nations and of 
regional human rights systems, as well as of all relevant stakeholders, according to the rules of 
procedure of the Human Rights Council; </p>

 <p></p>
<p>6. <i>Decides</i> to consider the results of the open-ended intergovernmental process in elaborating 
a set of human rights voluntary goals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council, on a 
consensual basis, through a draft resolution, by its session in September 2008; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> States and all relevant stakeholders to present to the Human Rights Council, 
during the commemoration process, the projects and activities undertaken at the national, 
regional and international levels on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.
