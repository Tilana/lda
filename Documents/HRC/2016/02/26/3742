<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on this issue, in particular Assembly 
resolution 65/223 of 21 December 2010 and Council resolution 8/5 of 18 June 2008,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote 
universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for all, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments 
relating to human rights and international law,

<p><i> Affirming</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation for the promotion and 
protection of all human rights should continue to be carried out in full conformity with the 
purposes and principles of the Charter and international law as set forth in Articles 1 and 2 
of the Charter and, inter alia, with full respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, political 
independence, the non-use of force or the threat of force in international relations and non-
intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Preamble to the Charter, in particular the determination to reaffirm 
faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the 
equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the 
rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully 
realized, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to save 
succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under which justice 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its eighteenth session (A/HRC/18/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p>and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law 
can be maintained, to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
to practise tolerance and good-neighbourliness, and to employ international machinery for 
the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social 
issues, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the 
nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally, and that, in this regard, the 
central role must be played by the United Nations as the most universal and representative 
organization in the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 
aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the 
Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of 
peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better 
standards of living and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human 
rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, including 
the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that democracy is 
based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, 
social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the promotion and protection of human rights should be based on 
the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity 
of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all 
human beings, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that democracy is not only a political concept, but that it also has 
economic and social dimensions, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to 
development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of 
society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary 
foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development, 
</p>

intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, 
marginalization and social exclusion, 
</p>

contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels,

broad and sustained efforts, based on our common humanity in all its diversity, can 
globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable, 
</p>

crises, resulting from a combination of several major factors, including macroeconomic and 
other factors, such as environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, </p>


<p>natural disasters and the lack of financial resources and the technology necessary to 
confront their negative impact in developing countries, particularly in the least developed 
countries and small island developing States, represent a global scenario that is threatening 
the adequate enjoyment of all human rights and widening the gap between developed and 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must 
include policies and measures, at the global level, that correspond to the needs of 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated and 
implemented with their effective participation, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing also</i> the need for adequate financing of and technology transfer to 
developing countries, in particular landlocked developing countries and small island 
developing States, including to support their efforts to adapt to climate change,

justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights, including
