“Tesoro’s integrated business model continues to perform well, even with the Tesoro Index 6%
lower this quarter compared to the average of 2014 and 2015,” said Greg Goff, Chairman and
CEO. “We continue to focus on driving sustainable improvements to the business and growing
Logistics and Marketing to further enhance shareholder value.”
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 1
For the second quarter, the Company recorded segment operating income of $806 million
compared to segment operating income of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Second
quarter 2016 results reflect lower operating income in Refining and Marketing, offset by
continued growth in Logistics.
Tesoro previously provided adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings and certain other metrics
including special adjustments for unusual items impacting quarterly results. The Company
decided to limit its disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures to EBITDA (which has been
revised to include discontinued operations), segment EBITDA and debt to capitalization,
excluding Tesoro Logistics LP (NTSE:TLLP). The Company also adjusted the presentation of
certain items to conform to recent guidance regarding non-GAAP measures. Tesoro will continue
to highlight significant items impacting quarterly results in its earnings releases and quarterly
SEC filings to facilitate analysis of its results.
SEGMENT RESULTS
REFINING. Refining operating income was $520 million for the second quarter 2016 compared
to $757 million in 2015 and segment EBITDA was $692 million compared to $880 million in
2015. The Tesoro Index(b) was $13.93 per barrel for the second quarter with a gross refining
margin of $15.70 per barrel or 113% capture of the Tesoro Index, compared to a gross refining
margin of $19.13 per barrel or 89% capture of the Tesoro Index of $21.61 per barrel last year.
Second quarter 2016 gross refining margin and segment EBITDA include a pre-tax benefit of
$363 million related to a LCM inventory adjustment. Total refinery throughput for the quarter was
802 thousand barrels per day, or 92% utilization. Manufacturing costs in the second quarter of
2016 decreased $0.57 per barrel over last year to $5.01 per barrel, due to a combination of
higher throughput in 2016 and a decline in natural gas prices. Throughput and capture rates in
the second quarter were impacted by an extension of planned maintenance in the Kenai, Alaska
refinery and unplanned unit downtime within our California region.
LOGISTICS. Logistics operating income increased to $125 million in the second quarter 2016
from $104 million in 2015 and segment EBITDA increased to $172 million from $149 million last
year. This performance was driven by volume growth in TLLP’s crude oil gathering and natural
gas gathering and processing businesses as well as contributions from the LA Storage and
Handling Assets acquisition. Year-to-date, TLLP has seen volume growth of approximately 23%
in crude oil pipeline gathering volumes, 5% in NGL processing throughput, 4% in terminalling
throughput and 4% in pipeline transportation volumes over the same period last year.
MARKETING. Marketing operating income was $161 million compared to $212 million a year
ago and segment EBITDA was $173 million compared to $223 million a year ago. In the quarter,
the Company experienced lower overall margins but continued to see high consumer demand
and growth in the branded network of retail stations. Total stations in second quarter grew 8%
over the same period last year. The year-over-year decline in operating income was impacted by
fuel margins which declined to 10.5 cents per gallon from 13.7 cents per gallon a year ago.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
Corporate and unallocated costs for the second quarter 2016 were $88 million. The effective tax
rate was 34.5% for the quarter.
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW
Tesoro ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to
$942 million at the end of 2015. Tesoro has $2.1 billion of availability under the Company’s
revolving credit facility. Total debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $4.5 billion or 36% of
total capitalization at the end of the second quarter. Excluding TLLP debt and equity, total debt
was $1.3 billion or 19% of total capitalization.
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 2
Capital spending for the second quarter was $167 million for Tesoro and $42 million for TLLP.
Turnaround expenditures for the second quarter were $191 million.
The Company repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $100 million in the second
quarter and has $1.3 billion remaining under its previously approved share repurchase programs.
Tesoro is well positioned to continue to execute its financial priorities of investing in high-return
capital projects, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Tesoro today announced that the board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend by
10% to $0.55 per share payable on September 15, 2016, to all holders of record as of August 31,
2016.
STRATEGIC UPDATE
In June, Tesoro closed the acquisition of Flint Hills Resources wholesale marketing and logistics
assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska. This acquisition enhances the Company’s
capabilities to efficiently and reliably serve customers in the state of Alaska. In addition, the
Company acquired Dakota Prairie Refining, LLC, which owns a refinery near Dickinson, North
Dakota, with strategic access to Bakken crude oil and is located just 100 miles west of the
Tesoro Mandan Refinery. Tesoro plans to continue to market the ultra-low sulfur diesel to local
customers and utilize the naphtha and resid in its integrated value chain system.
On July 1, 2016, Tesoro executed an agreement for the sale of storage and terminalling assets in
Alaska to TLLP for a total consideration of $444 million. The Alaska Storage and Terminalling
Assets include crude oil, feedstock and refined product storage tanks in Kenai, Alaska and
refined product terminals in Anchorage and Fairbanks. The first phase, the storage portion of the
acquisition, closed on July 1, 2016. The second phase, the acquisition of the Anchorage and
Fairbanks terminals, is expected to close in the third quarter once the Consent Decree with the
State of Alaska becomes effective. The Consent Decree is related to Tesoro's acquisition of
certain Flint Hills Resources Alaska assets, which closed on June 20, 2016. The total acquisition
price of $444 million includes cash proceeds to Tesoro of $400 million and the issuance of
common and general partner units to Tesoro, valued at approximately $44 million.
At Tesoro's 2015 Investor and Analyst Day, the Company provided its expectations for 2016.
These included a Tesoro index of $12 to $14 per barrel, Marketing segment fuel margins of $0.11
to $0.14 per gallon, crude oil differentials reflecting transportation costs and year-over-year
improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $500 to $600 million.
Through the first half of 2016, the Tesoro Index and Marketing fuel margins are in line with
expectations. Crude oil differentials continue to be significantly narrower than expectations and
have resulted in lower capture rates and lower refining profitability than the Company’s
expectations. Refining utilization is at the low end of the Company’s expectations, primarily due
to unplanned maintenance and, as a result, Tesoro now expects year-over-year improvements
from higher utilization and operational efficiencies of $400 to $500 million.
In addition, the Company committed to delivering $400 to $500 million of annual improvements to
operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 to $250 million in Refining, $175 to $200 million in
Logistics and $25 to $50 million in Marketing. Tesoro remains confident in delivering these
annual improvements to operating income. Through the first half of the year, estimated Refining
improvements are trending towards the high end of the range, Marketing improvements are on
track with full year expectations and estimated Logistics improvements are tracking slightly below
the range, primarily attributable to slower than expected organic growth due to the weak
commodity price environment.

(a)After-tax amount utilizes the marginal tax rate.
(b)
As a performance benchmark, we utilize crack spreads and the Tesoro Index to measure the
difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products. Crack spreads are a
commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in gross refining
margins, while the Tesoro Index is more specifically designed around Tesoro’s assets. Crack
spreads and the Tesoro Index can fluctuate significantly over time as a result of market
conditions and supply and demand balances. For example, The West Coast 321 crack spread
is calculated using three barrels of Alaska North Slope crude oil (ANS) producing two barrels
of Los Angeles CARB gasoline and one barrel of Los Angeles CARB diesel. In comparison
the Tesoro Index uses several crude oils and approximately 8 to 10 products to provide a
potentially closer representation of the trends in the available margin. Our actual gross refining
margins differ from these crack spreads and the Tesoro Index based on the actual slate of
crude oil we run at our refineries and the products we produce or yield.

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets
acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers
between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of TLLP contained
herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired in
the acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods
presented. The TLLP financial data is derived from the combined financial results of the TLLP
predecessor (the “TLLP Predecessor”). We refer to the TLLP Predecessor and, prior to each
acquisition date, the acquisitions from Tesoro collectively, as “TLLP’s Predecessors.”
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Our management uses certain performance “non-GAAP” measures to analyze operating segment
performance. Our management also uses additional measures that are known as “non-GAAP”
financial measures in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future to
supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These financial non-GAAP
measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include
the following:
U.S. GAAP-based net earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization
expense (“EBITDA”);
Segment EBITDA is defined as a segment’s U.S. GAAP operating income before depreciation
and amortization expense plus equity in earnings (loss) of equity method investments and other
•
•
income (expense), net; and
Debt to capitalization ratio excluding TLLP, reflects the ratio achieved by dividing the net result
of our consolidated debt less all debt owed by TLLP (both net of unamortized issuance costs) by
the sum of our consolidated debt less TLLP’s total debt (both net of unamortized issuance costs)
and our total equity less noncontrolling interest associated with the public ownership of TLLP.
•
We present the measures defined above because investors, analysts, lenders and ratings
agencies may use these measures to help analyze our results of operations and liquidity in
conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to the following:
•
our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the refining,
logistics and marketing industries, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment
of various investment opportunities.
•
In addition, these measures are used by management to assess internal performance. We
believe these measures, when supplemental to information presented under U.S. GAAP, may
provide meaningful information to the users of our financial statements. Each of the performance
measures should not be used in isolation from their comparable U.S. GAAP measure and thus
should not be considered as alternatives to any U.S. GAAP measure. Non-GAAP measures have
important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect
net earnings and operating income.

reflect replacement cost as of those reporting dates. We reverse any lower of cost or market
reserve in the subsequent period because the inventories are sold or used and then perform a
complete lower of cost or market assessment of ending inventories at the end of each reporting
period to determine if a reserve is required.

million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant impact
to stock-based compensation expense is primarily a result of changes in Tesoro’s stock price.
Other income (expense), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 included
insurance proceeds related to a shipment of contaminated crude oil that was received in 2014
as well as a refund of certain tariff charges that were disputed. Additionally, a gain recognized
by TLLP on a settlement of amounts disputed by one of its customers on the annual
calculation of the natural gas gathering rate is included for the six months ended June 30,
2016.

We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 24
degrees or less.
Sources of total refined product sales include refined products manufactured at our refineries
and refined products purchased from third parties.
Refined product sales include intersegment sales to our marketing segment of $3.8 billion and
$4.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6.8 billion
and $8.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput multiplied by the gross refining
margin per barrel. Consolidated gross refining margin combines gross refining margin for each
of our regions adjusted for other amounts not directly attributable to a specific region. Gross
refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the marketing segment and services
provided by TLLP. Gross refining margin reflects the incremental expense or benefit associated
with the LCM adjustments for all periods presented.
Management uses various measures to evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare
profitability to other companies in the industry, including gross refining margin per barrel,
manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense (“Manufacturing Costs”)
per barrel. We calculate gross refining margin per barrel by dividing gross refining margin
(revenues for manufactured refined products sold less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined
products, transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput. We calculate
Manufacturing Costs per barrel by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput.
Gross refining margin per throughput barrel on a consolidated and regional basis includes the
incremental expense or benefit associated with the LCM adjustments for all periods presented.

Prior to TLLP’s deconsolidation of Rendezvous Gas Services L.L.C. (“RGS”) as of January 1,
2016, fees paid by TLLP to RGS were eliminated upon consolidation and third-party
transactions, including revenue and throughput volumes, were included in its results of
operations. Third party volumes associated with RGS, included in gas gathering volume for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were both 146 thousand MMBtu/d and
(o)
reduced our average gas gathering revenue per MMBtu by $0.05 for each period. These
volumes are no longer included in TLLP operational data.
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 16
(p)
(q)
TLLP segment revenues from services provided to our refining segment were $168 million and
$154 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $337
million and $302 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
These amounts are eliminated upon consolidation.
TLLP segment operating expenses include amounts billed by Tesoro for services provided to
TLLP under various operational contracts. Amounts billed by Tesoro totaled $34 million and
$29 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $71 million
and $58 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating
expenses also include imbalance gains and reimbursements pursuant to the Amended
Omnibus Agreement of $5 million and $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and $12 million and $19 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are eliminated upon consolidation. TLLP
segment third-party operating expenses related to the transportation of crude oil and refined
products related to Tesoro’s sale of those refined products during the ordinary course of
business are reclassified to cost of sales in our condensed statements of consolidated
operations upon consolidation.
TLLP segment general and administrative expenses include amounts charged by Tesoro for
general and administrative services provided to TLLP under various operational and
administrative contracts. These amounts totaled $16 million and $18 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $33 million and $35 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are eliminated upon
consolidation. General and administrative expenses are reclassified to cost of sales as it
relates to Tesoro’s sale of refined products in our condensed statements of consolidated
operations upon consolidation.
