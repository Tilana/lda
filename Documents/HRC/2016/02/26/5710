<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief submits the present report to the 
Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolution 6/37. The report is divided into two main 
sections. In the first part, the Special Rapporteur outlines the activities carried out according to 
the four pillars of the mandate&#8217;s terms of reference since their review, rationalization and 
improvement in December 2007. She highlights the importance of initiatives in the fields of 
education, public awareness and interreligious dialogue, as well as State action against advocacy 
of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. Applying a 
gender perspective, the Special Rapporteur also addresses discriminatory and harmful practices 
against women and refers to several communications sent to Governments and to country 
reports.  
</p>
<p> In the second part, the Special Rapporteur provides a preliminary analysis of 
discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights. With regard to the legal framework at the international level, she emphasizes 
that non-discrimination is an overarching principle that applies to all human rights, including 
freedom of religion or belief. She recalls that it is crucial to prevent discrimination with regard to 
the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, since minorities and vulnerable groups are 
particularly affected when States do not abide by their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil 
these rights. The Special Rapporteur then highlights some of the recurrent issues encountered in 
the mandate practice in order to illustrate the adverse impact of discrimination based on religion 
or belief on the enjoyment of the rights to work, to adequate food and housing, to health, to 
education and to take part in cultural life. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that discrimination based on religion or belief often 
emanates from deliberate State policies to ostracize certain religious or belief communities and 
to restrict or deny their access, for example, to health services, public education or public posts. 
States have the duty to refrain from discriminating against individuals or groups of individuals 
based on their religion and belief (obligation to respect); they are required to prevent such 
discrimination, including from non-State actors (obligation to protect); and States must take steps 
to ensure that, in practice, every person on their territory enjoys all human rights without 
discrimination of any kind (obligation to fulfil).  
</p>
<p> Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recalls that all human rights are universal, indivisible, 
interdependent and interrelated. Consequently, there should not be a different approach between 
discrimination affecting the enjoyment of civil and political rights on the one hand, and 
discrimination affecting the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on the other. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/37, in 
which the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief and revised its terms of reference.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur first outlines the activities carried out under 
the mandate on freedom of religion or belief since the submission of her previous reports to the 
Council (A/HRC/4/21 and A/HRC/6/5). The Special Rapporteur then analyses the international 
legal framework and provides some examples of discrimination based on religion or belief and 
its impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. Lastly, she presents her 
conclusions and recommendations on this issue.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance was initially appointed pursuant to 
resolution 1986/20 of the Commission on Human Rights. While the Commission defined the 
scope of the mandate on religious intolerance according to the provisions of the Declaration on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief of 
25 November 1981, the scope was subsequently broadened by the Commission and the 
General Assembly in subsequent resolutions. The Commission changed the title of the mandate 
to &#8220;Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief&#8221; by its resolution 2000/33, which was 
approved by the Economic and Social Council in its decision 2000/261.  
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 6/37, the Human Rights Council concluded that there was a need for the 
continued contribution of the Special Rapporteur to the protection, promotion and universal 
implementation of the right to freedom of religion or belief. The Council therefore decided to 
extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further period of three years and, in this 
context, invited the mandate-holder:  
</p>
<p> (a) To promote the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels 
to ensure the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> (b) To identify existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom 
of religion or belief and present recommendations on ways and means to overcome such 
obstacles;  
</p>
<p> (c) To continue her/his efforts to examine incidents and governmental actions that are 
incompatible with the provisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief and to recommend remedial 
measures as appropriate;  
</p>
<p> (d) To continue to apply a gender perspective, inter alia, through the identification of 
gender-specific abuses, in the reporting process, including in information collection and in 
recommendations.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>5. Since the review, rationalization and improvement process regarding the mandate in 
December 2007, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken her activities according to these four 
pillars. In conformity with the first pillar, she has for instance participated in several regional and 
international initiatives related to freedom of religion or belief. With regard to initiatives at the 
national level, the Special Rapporteur promoted the adoption of measures to ensure the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief, for example, during 
country visits. Communications with Governments and country visits helped her implement the 
second and third pillars. Furthermore, she has strived to apply a gender perspective throughout 
all her activities, mainly during country visits and through thematic reports submitted to the 
General Assembly and the Council. While these four pillars may, in some instances, overlap, the 
Special Rapporteur has, for the sake of clarity, clustered the overview of her recent activities 
under the above four headings.  
</p>
<p><b>A. Promotion of the adoption of measures at the national, regional and  
international levels to ensure the promotion and protection of the  
right to freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the national level, the Special Rapporteur has held numerous formal and informal 
brainstorming meetings with representatives of States and civil society organizations in order to 
reflect on the situation of freedom of religion or belief in a given country.<b>1</b> These meetings were 
mainly held during country visits, at sessions of the Assembly and the Council, as well as during 
various conferences. Research on the status of freedom of religion or belief in specific country 
situations is conducted on an ongoing basis by the mandate-holder.  
</p>
<p>7. At the regional level, the Special Rapporteur was involved in an initiative of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for the development of the Toledo Guiding 
Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools.<b>2 </b>Since 1994, the 
Commission on Human Rights had encouraged the Special Rapporteur to examine the 
contribution of education in promoting tolerance of religion and belief.<b> </b>This framework enabled 
the previous mandate-holder, Abdelfattah Amor, to be actively involved in the organization of 
the International Consultative Conference on School Education in relation to Freedom of 
Religion or Belief, Tolerance and Non-discrimination in 2001. In 2007, the current 
mandate-holder participated in the elaboration of the Toledo Guiding Principles, which she 
believes may contribute to enhancing religious tolerance. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the Toledo Guiding Principles, teaching about religions and beliefs must be 
provided in ways that are fair, accurate and based on sound scholarship. The environment in 
which students learn about religions and beliefs must be respectful of human rights, fundamental 
freedoms and civic values. While the Toledo Guiding Principles recognize that teaching about 
religions and beliefs is a major responsibility of schools, they also acknowledge the role of 
families and religious or belief organizations in transmitting values to successive generations. 
With regard to compulsory programmes involving teaching about religions and beliefs, 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  See E/CN.<footnote name="4">7. Cases of direct and indirect discrimination based on religion or belief adversely affecting 
the right to health have also been reported by the mandate. In the very first annual report, 
Mr. d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro criticized the fact that the members of a religious community in one 
country were denied access to medical care (E/CN.<footnote name="4">1. The Special Rapporteur deplores that members of certain religious or belief groups are 
often denied access to employment or have faced obstacles, both in Government institutions and 
in private companies. For instance, during a recent country visit, she received information that 
members of certain religious minorities had been summoned by the authorities and pressured to 
leave their jobs in State institutions (A/HRC/10/8/Add.4, para. 21). During another country visit, </footnote>/1987/35, para. 64). In a recent country visit, 
the current mandate-holder also addressed the situation of members of the Muslim minority with </footnote>/2005/61, paras. 15-20 and E/CN.4/2006/5, annex, as well as the online digest of

</p>
<p>non-discriminatory opt-out rights should be granted for parents and pupils in case these 
programmes are not sufficiently objective. On the central issue of school curricula, the Toledo 
Guiding Principles provide that curricula should be developed in accordance with recognized 
professional standards in order to ensure a balanced approach to study about religions and 
beliefs. The preparation and implementation of these curricula should be inclusive so as to give 
different stakeholders the opportunity to offer comments and advice. Moreover, attention should 
be given to key historic and contemporary developments pertaining to religion or belief, and 
curricula should reflect global and local issues. In addition, care should be taken to avoid 
inaccurate or prejudicial educational material, particularly when this reinforces negative 
stereotypes. Teachers have a prominent role to play implementing these curricula. They should 
first have a commitment to religious freedom that contributes to a school environment and 
practices which foster protection of the rights of others in a spirit of mutual respect and 
understanding among members of the school community. Furthermore, in accordance with the 
Toledo Guiding Principles, those who teach about religions or beliefs should be adequately 
educated to do so, in terms of both subject-matter competence and pedagogical skills, and they 
should also receive ongoing training for using the curricula.  
</p>
<p>9. On the basis of the assumption that there is a positive value in teaching that emphasizes 
respect for everyone&#8217;s right to freedom of religion and belief and that teaching about religions 
and beliefs can reduce harmful misunderstandings and stereotypes, the Toledo Guiding 
Principles were drafted in order to deepen commitment to human rights standards. The aim of 
these guiding principles is neither to propose a curriculum for teaching about religions and 
beliefs, nor to promote any particular approach to the teaching about religions and beliefs. 
Rather, they seek to assist all relevant actors in the field of education - teachers, educators, 
legislators and officials in education ministries as well as administrators and teachers in private 
and religious schools - to ensure that teaching about different religions and beliefs is carried out 
in a non-biased and balanced manner. 
</p>
<p>10. At the regional level, the Special Rapporteur was also invited to address the European 
Parliament in the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008). In her 
speech of 18 June 2008, she emphasized the importance of interreligious and intra-religious 
dialogue in order to promote the right to freedom of religion or belief through preventive efforts. 
The Special Rapporteur emphasized that the rule of law and the functioning of democratic 
institutions were essential prerequisites for the establishment of a favourable climate conducive 
to real dialogue and understanding. People need to have trust in State institutions and 
representatives, and diversity within these institutions may contribute to creating such an 
environment. State policies should provide enough space for a variety of religions and beliefs 
and therefore create natural opportunities for interaction and understanding. 
</p>
<p>11. At the international level, the Special Rapporteur participated in a joint contribution 
with 13 other special procedures mandate-holders (A/CONF.<footnote name="2">7. The responsibility to protect women from discriminatory practices based on, or attributed 
to, religion has also been addressed by the current mandate-holder since 2004. At the very outset,

substantive input to the review process of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. She 
also addressed the Preparatory Committee of the Durban Review Conference at its second 
substantive session on 6 October 2008. In the joint written contribution, the Special Rapporteur 
provided responses to six questions relating to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
adopted in 2001 by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Related Intolerance. In doing so, she focused on issues and themes relevant to her mandate.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>12. In paragraph 79 of the Durban Programme of Action, States are called on to, inter alia, 
promote and protect the exercise of the rights set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief in order to obviate 
religious discrimination which, when combined with certain other forms of discrimination, 
constitutes a form of multiple discrimination. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur regrets that 
she still receives reports of religious intolerance and acts of violence against members of certain 
religious or belief communities. Concerning concrete measures and initiatives for combating and 
eliminating all manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, she referred the Preparatory Committee to the above-mentioned initiatives in the 
field of education. Likewise, she encouraged initiatives of interreligious and intra-religious 
dialogue aiming at the promotion of respect for religious diversity within pluralist societies. In 
cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief addressed the issue of dissemination of expressions that offend certain 
believers. While not a new phenomenon, the three special rapporteurs acknowledged that, 
following the events of 11 September 2001, tensions in inter-community relations have been 
exacerbated. In that context, joint press releases have been issued by the three mandate-holders. 
They noted that, while peaceful expression of opinions and ideas should always be tolerated, the 
use of stereotypes and labelling that insult deep-rooted religious feelings do not contribute to the 
creation of an environment conducive to constructive and peaceful dialogue among different 
communities.  
</p>
<p>13. At the international level, the Special Rapporteur took part in an expert seminar organized 
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the theme 
&#8220;freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility and violence&#8221;, held on 2 and 3 October 2008 in Geneva. Invited to 
address the issue of limits and restrictions to freedom of expression, she contended that there was 
an obligation for States to act upon advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence. She also emphasized that Governments had several tools at 
their disposal to counter religious intolerance, for example via interreligious and intra-religious 
dialogue, and education.  
</p>
<p>14. States have a delicate role to play in legislating or devising policies in matters of religion 
or belief. Violent acts perpetrated in the name of religion must not be extended to any form of 
impunity. Any legislation or policy designed to combat religious discrimination must be 
all-inclusive, carefully crafted and implemented in a balanced manner to achieve its objectives. 
There may yet be cases of intolerant religious behaviour that do not constitute violations of 
human rights but which may still give rise to religious polarization and disturb social cohesion. 
The Special Rapporteur specifically cautioned against excessive or vague legislation on such 
religious issues, which may create tensions and problems rather than solving them. From her 
mandate experience, she pointed out that the implementation of such national legislation had 
often fostered more polarization rather than protect religious minorities. Furthermore, she 
stressed that each particular case could only be adjudicated according to its own circumstances, 
and also referred to the role of the judiciary as vital in providing a means of legal redress to 
victims of human rights violations. In conclusion, she affirmed that more consultation was 
needed, especially concerning the implementation of existing standards at the domestic level. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>She suggested that the Human Rights Committee could revisit its general comment No. 11 
(1983) on article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. She also 
recommended that regional workshops be organized to explore this topic at the grass-roots 
levels, emphasizing the fact that international human rights instruments were designed to protect 
individuals and groups of individuals.  
</p>
<p>15. Lastly, at the international level, the Special Rapporteur also contributed to the general 
discussion of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the issue of 
non-discrimination. The aim of the half-day of general discussion held on 17 November 2008 
was to foster a deeper understanding of the content and implications of article 2 (2) of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to offer an opportunity to 
review draft general comment No. 20 on non-discrimination. More closely related issues are 
examined in the section on discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Identification of existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment  
of the right to freedom of religion or belief and presentation of  
recommendations on ways and means to overcome such obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>16. In 2007 and 2008, the Special Rapporteur undertook six country missions, to Tajikistan, 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Angola, Israel and the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, India and Turkmenistan. The country reports on her visits in 2007 to 
Tajikistan (A/HRC/7/10/Add.<footnote name="2">6. In 2002, the previous mandate-holder submitted a comprehensive study on freedom of 
religion or belief and the status of women from the viewpoint of religion and traditions 
(E/CN.4/2002/73/Add.<footnote name="2">5. Since 1996, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council have 
persistently stressed in their resolutions the need to continue to apply a gender perspective, 
inter alia, through the identification of gender-specific abuses, in the reporting process, including 
in information collection and in recommendations. In doing so, they have constantly reaffirmed 
the need for the Special Rapporteur to highlight situations and address cases pertaining to 
discrimination against women based on religion or belief. 
</footnote>), in which he noted that many forms of discrimination against women 
were based on or attributed to religion, tolerated by the State and in some cases enshrined in 
legislation. At the heart of this problem lies the fact that discriminatory and harmful practices 
against women, such as female genital mutilation, polygamy, discrimination related to 
inheritance, sacred prostitution, general preference to have boys, are often perpetrated by 
individuals or communities who perceive them as a religious obligation or as being part of their 
freedom to manifest their religion or belief. However, the previous mandate-holder argued that 
religions have not invented discriminatory and harmful practices against women; rather, these 
practices are mainly attributable to a cultural interpretation of religious precepts. The concepts of 
culture and religion are, however, inextricably linked; it is therefore difficult to dissociate 
religion from culture or customs and traditions, since religion is itself a tradition. Nonetheless, he 
concluded that an important number of these discriminatory practices have decreased over time. 
This is mainly due to a wilful strategy of the State to tackle the root causes by modifying certain 
cultural schemes through reforms pertaining to, inter alia, all aspects of social and family life. 
The previous mandate-holder emphasized that, while certain traditional practices have ancestral 
origins, the Government nevertheless remains responsible to protect women from discriminatory 
practices perpetrated by individuals or communities on its territory. 
</footnote>), the United Kingdom (A/HRC/7/10/Add.3) and Angola 
(A/HRC/7/10/Add.4) were submitted to the Council at its seventh session, in accordance with 
Council resolution 6/37. The reports on her visits in 2008 to Israel and the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory (A/HRC/10/8/Add.<footnote name="2">3. The most salient issues addressed in her recent communications related to legislation on 
religious issues and questions of conversion. The groups affected by these issues were mainly 
religious minorities and vulnerable groups. The Special Rapporteur has identified women, 
individuals deprived of liberty, asylum-seekers, refugees, children, minorities and migrant 
workers as being particularly vulnerable to violations of their right to freedom of religion or 
belief. The Special Rapporteur regularly receives reports of violations of the rights of members 
of religious minorities and vulnerable groups to carry out their religious activities. Indeed, they 
continue to be subject to frequent acts of harassment from the authorities or from majority 
religious groups, including in the context of intra-religious tensions. On legislation, the Special 
Rapporteur has conveyed her concerns about legislation unduly limiting the right to manifest 
one&#8217;s religion or belief, in particular through registration requirements or restrictions on places 
of worship, religious education, religious literature and proselytizing activities. As regards </footnote>), India (A/HRC/10/8/Add.3) and Turkmenistan 
(A/HRC/10/8/Add.4) are issued as addenda to the present report. 
</p>
<p>17. In general, the Special Rapporteur would like to thank all the Governments for the 
cooperation they extended during her respective missions. She hopes that the recommendations 
issued following the country visits will contribute to overcoming existing and emerging 
obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief in the concerned 
countries. The Special Rapporteur will also re-establish the mandate&#8217;s initial approach<b>3</b> to send 
follow-up letters after country visits in order to receive updated information about the 
implementation of her recommendations at the national level.  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to preventive efforts, the Special Rapporteur reiterates her recommendation 
that States should devise proactive strategies to overcome existing and emerging obstacles to the 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief. In addition to initiatives in the field of 
education (see paragraphs 7-9 above), interreligious dialogue constitutes one of the principal 
means of countering sectarian attitudes and enhancing religious tolerance worldwide. It is a 
precious tool for preventing misunderstanding and violations in the area of freedom of religion 
or belief. Interreligious dialogue can also help activate the silent majority to look for common

</p>
<p>strategies on how to find harmony and peace. While it is evident that dialogue alone cannot solve 
all the underlying problems, the Special Rapporteur nonetheless stresses that it can contribute to 
defusing tensions in post-conflict situations and can also help prevent them before a situation 
deteriorates. During her country missions, she was encouraged by several examples of fruitful 
dialogue bringing together people from different religious and political backgrounds. The 
Special Rapporteur also welcomes the recent initiative of a Catholic-Muslim forum<b>4</b> at which it 
was emphasized, inter alia, that religious minorities are entitled to be respected in their own 
religious convictions and practices. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to participation in initiatives related to interreligious dialogue, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that it should not be limited to leaders of religious or belief communities, 
but be as inclusive as possible. Indeed, interreligious dialogue at the grass-roots level should be 
strongly encouraged and an exchange of views should, if possible, also include atheists and 
non-theists as well as believers who are dispassionate about their faith and members of religious 
minorities. Any dialogue would also greatly benefit from the perspectives of women, who tend 
to be marginalized in major events of interreligious dialogue. Indeed, although women are often 
subject to discrimination based on religion or belief, women&#8217;s groups have been very effective 
human rights advocates across religious lines in situations of communal tensions. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur believes that artists, including those in the visual media, may play an 
important role in public education regarding religious tolerance and in building bridges between 
different communities. Journalists and lawyers can also make a difference, especially when their 
statements and actions transcend religious lines. Politicians should also help to implement 
concrete actions aiming at promoting religious tolerance and mainstreaming religious diversity. 
In this regard, emphasis should be put on public awareness and education. They are particularly 
crucial in a world where technology plays a powerful role in building public opinion. In addition, 
prompt responses to acts of violence based on religion or belief are critical; they can either fan 
religious intolerance or can be constructive and calm rising tensions. The electronic media 
therefore have a key role which, if played in a responsible manner, can contribute to peace.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the content of interreligious dialogue might 
potentially also give rise to controversy, in particular if it entails discussion on the respective 
religions and their theological approaches. As a result, there may be the temptation to look for 
dialogue only on non-contentious topics that are not directly related to theology, such as 
common environmental concerns. While debate on these topics is without doubt useful, the 
potential of interreligious dialogue to promote religious tolerance by improving understanding 
between and among members of religious or belief communities should not be neglected. 
Participants in interreligious dialogue might well be able to discuss the similarities and 
differences of their respective theological approaches. In doing so, they may find common 
ground on several issues, but they might also ultimately agree to disagree.

<p>21. It is desirable to institutionalize interreligious dialogue at various levels, in the right format 
and with a wide selection of participants, which still allows for a real exchange of views. 
Nonetheless, interreligious dialogue may also take place in rather informal settings. Natural 
spaces in pluralistic societies that encompass multicultural neighbourhoods, schools, clubs and 
other public services and which allow for constant interaction are conducive to true dialogue. In 
a society where there are no invisible boundaries on the basis of religion or belief, constant 
interaction is inevitable, which leads to dialogue and mutual understanding. In addition, the role 
of educational institutions in this regard seems to be vital; they can either inculcate a spirit of 
tolerance or promote tensions, even at an early age. The emphasis must therefore lie on 
enlightened education that teaches children to recognize and appreciate existing diversity. To 
that effect, the final document of the International Consultative Conference on School Education 
in relation to Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tolerance and Non-discrimination included the 
strengthening of a non-discriminatory perspective in education and of knowledge in relation to 
freedom of religion or belief at the appropriate levels as one of its objectives.

<p><b>C. Examination of incidents and governmental actions incompatible with  
the provisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of  
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief and  
recommendation of remedial measures as appropriate 
</b></p>
<p>22. Since the establishment of the mandate in 1986, the Special Rapporteur has sent more 
than 1,150 allegation letters and urgent appeals<b> </b>to a total of 130 States. The communications sent 
by the Special Rapporteur between 1 December 2006 and 30 November 2008 and the replies 
received from Governments are summarized in her two latest communications reports 
(A/HRC/7/10/Add.1 and A/HRC/10/8/Add.1). These communications have been a valuable tool 
to examine incidents and governmental actions that are incompatible with the provisions of the 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
Religion or Belief. As mentioned above, they have also proven useful in the implementation of 
the second pillar pertaining to the identification of existing and emerging obstacles to the 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief. Indeed, through information received and 
related communications sent to the Governments, the Special Rapporteur has been able to 
identify recurrent issues relating to her mandate and to initiate a constructive dialogue with the 
States concerned.

</p>
<p>conversion, she has sent numerous communications pertaining to sanctions imposed following 
acts of conversion away from the religion of the majority in a given country. She has also 
addressed the issue of forced conversion, which often targeted women and children abducted and 
then compelled to convert to another religion.  
</p>
<p>24. Although recurrent issues are identified through information received and related 
communications, the Special Rapporteur recalls that the communications sent to the 
Governments only give a general picture and that the mandate receives many more allegations 
than are eventually transmitted. In addition, there may be further allegations that have not been 
brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. Consequently, she stresses that the mandate&#8217;s 
communications report is only an indication of the forms of violation of freedom of religion or 
belief which cannot be regarded as exhaustive.

<p>right of a non-derogable character which can be limited only under restricted conditions 
determined pursuant to article 18 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Nevertheless, this right, like other human rights, cannot be used to justify the violation of other 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur has sent joint communications with other special procedures 
mandate-holders - such as the Special Rapporteur on the violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children - on cases where women suffer from discrimination on the grounds of gender and 
religion or belief. In addition, several of her recent country reports include subchapters on the 
specific situation of women (A/HRC/7/10/Add.2 and Add.3; A/HRC/10/8/Add.2 and Add.3). In 
these reports, she refers to discriminatory and harmful practices against women, including 
honour killings, polygamy, marriage of underage girls and prohibition or coercion to wear 
religious symbols. She has also devoted particular attention to religion-based personal laws, in 
particular in the areas of divorce, inheritance, custody of children and transmission of 
citizenship.  
</p>
<p><b>III. DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RELIGION OR BELIEF AND ITS 
IMPACT ON THE ENJOYMENT OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND 
CULTURAL RIGHTS </b></p>
<p>29. In the implementation of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has always strived to adopt a 
holistic approach and to examine all issues related to freedom of religion or belief in a 
non-selective manner. In doing so, she and her predecessors came across a great variety of issues 
of concern, including cases of discrimination based on religion or belief<b>5</b> pertaining to civil and 
political rights, as well as to economic, social and cultural rights. In this section, the Special 
Rapporteur provides a preliminary analysis on discrimination based on religion or belief and its 
impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. While focusing on economic, 
social and cultural rights in the present report, the Special Rapporteur recalls that the 
1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action proclaimed that all human rights are 
universal, indivisible, and interdependent and interrelated. Therefore, the distinction made in this 
section between civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural 
rights on the other, should merely be seen as reflecting the terminology used by the two 
international covenants.

</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  The Special Rapporteur prefers to use the term &#8220;discrimination based on religion or belief&#8221; 
</p>
<p>rather than &#8220;religious discrimination&#8221;, in order to emphasize that the prohibition of 
discrimination is not limited to theistic beliefs but also encompasses non-theistic or atheistic 
beliefs. This is in line with the approach taken by the Human Rights Committee in its general 
comment 22, para. 2 (&#8220;Article 18 protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as 
the right not to profess any religion or belief. The terms &#8216;belief&#8217; and &#8216;religion&#8217; are to be broadly 
construed&#8221;), as well as with the approach in the final document of the International Consultative 
Conference on School Education in Relation to Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tolerance and 
Non-discrimination (E/CN.4/2002/73, appendix). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal framework at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>30. The principle of non-discrimination is generally perceived as one of the most important in 
the field of human rights; it is overarching and therefore applies to all human rights, including 
the right to freedom of religion or belief. It is crucial to prevent discrimination with regard to the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, since minorities and vulnerable groups are 
particularly affected when States do not abide by their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil 
these rights. 
</p>
<p>31. The enjoyment of rights and freedoms on an equal footing, however, does not mean 
identical treatment in every instance.<b>6</b> Indeed, discrimination not only occurs when individuals or 
groups in the same situation are treated differently, but may also occur when individuals or 
groups are treated in the same way although their situation is different. The principle of 
non-discrimination thus prohibits both unjustified distinctions when similar situations are treated 
differently and unjustified comparisons when different situations are treated in the same manner. 
32. The Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination 
Based on Religion or Belief extensively addresses the principle of non-discrimination in its 
articles 2, 3 and 4. In particular, article 2 (1) of the Declaration states that &#8220;[n]o one shall be 
subject to discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons, or person on the grounds of 
religion or other belief&#8221;. Furthermore, article 2 (2) provides the following definition for the 
purposes of the Declaration: &#8220;&#8216;intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief&#8217; means 
any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on religion or belief and having as its 
purpose or as its effect nullification or impairment of the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis&#8221;.<b>7</b> Article 4 provides that &#8220;[a]ll States 
shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion 
or belief in the recognition, exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
in all fields of civil, economic, political, social and cultural life&#8221; and that they &#8220;shall make all 
efforts to enact or rescind legislation where necessary to prohibit any such discrimination, and to 
take all appropriate measures to combat intolerance on the grounds of religion or other beliefs in 
this matter&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights addresses the 
principle of non-discrimination in its article 2 (2), which includes a reference to religion, as 
follows: &#8220;[t]he States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to guarantee that the rights 
enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to 
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. In its general comment No. 22 (1993), the Human Rights Committee specifically referred 
to economic, social and cultural rights in relation to the prohibition of coercion. In paragraph 5, it

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 18 (1989), para. 8. 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  The Human Rights Committee uses a similar definition of the term &#8220;discrimination&#8221; in its 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 18 (1989), para. 7. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>stated that policies or practices having the same intention or effect, such as those restricting 
access to education, medical care or employment, are similarly inconsistent with article 18 (2) of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This approach was recently reinforced 
by the General Assembly in its resolution 63/181 on the elimination of all forms of intolerance 
and of discrimination based on religion or belief, in which it urged States to step up their efforts 
to ensure that no one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief when 
accessing, inter alia, education, medical care, employment, humanitarian assistance or social 
benefits. 
</p>
<p>35. On the basis of articles 2 and 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, three issues need to be 
emphasized. First, the principle of non-discrimination, as enshrined in the Declaration, applies to 
States as much as to non-State actors as potential perpetrators. States have therefore the duty to 
refrain from discriminating individuals or groups of individuals because of their religion and 
belief and must also take necessary measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination between 
non-State actors. Incidents among non-State actors tend to be less clear-cut than discrimination 
perpetrated by States. For instance, it may be difficult to determine whether faith-based 
associations are allowed to disregard employment applications from believers belonging to a 
different community or if they are compelled to consider all applicants, regardless of their 
religious affiliation. Another example is when a religious or belief community wishes to exclude 
a certain community from using its premises if these are usually available for rent. In order to 
determine whether these actions amount to discrimination or not, a case-by-case analysis is 
necessary. 
</p>
<p>36. Second, it follows from the definition provided by article 2 (2) that &#8220;any distinction, 
exclusion, restriction or preference based on religion or belief having as its purpose or as its 
effect nullification or impairment of the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms on an equal basis&#8221; constitutes discrimination. Hence, not all forms of 
distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference amount to discrimination; some may in fact be 
used in the context of special temporary measures or affirmative action, aiming at the elimination 
of conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination, including on grounds of religion 
or belief. According to the Human Rights Committee, &#8220;in a State where the general conditions of 
a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State 
should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a 
time, to the part of the population concerned, certain preferential treatment in specific matters as 
compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct 
discrimination in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant&#8221;.<b>8</b> The Special 
Rapporteur stresses that affirmative actions may be essential to empower communities that 
suffered on account of historic discriminatory practices. At the same time, she underlines that the 
effectiveness of affirmative action should be measured through various identifiable means and 
should be monitored for its progress. 
</p>
<p>37. Third, by referring to the &#8220;purpose&#8221; or &#8220;effect&#8221; of any distinction, exclusion, restriction or 
preference based on religion or belief, article 2 (2) of the Declaration provides protection against 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  General comment No. 18 (1989), para. 10. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>formal (de jure) and actual (de facto) discrimination. Both concepts are obviously closely linked. 
While de jure discrimination refers to discrimination enshrined in laws, de facto discrimination 
pertains to the effects of laws, policies or practices. It entails that de jure discrimination should 
be eradicated immediately, as this can be done by amending or repealing the discriminatory 
legislation. When faced with de facto discrimination, States should immediately adopt measures 
that are likely to lead to its elimination as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition to the above, reference should also be made to the concepts of direct and 
indirect discrimination based on religion or belief. A law, policy or practice creates direct 
discrimination when a difference in treatment, which cannot be justified objectively, is expressly 
based on a person&#8217;s religion or belief. Indirect discrimination stems from a law, policy or 
practice that does not appear at first sight to involve inequalities but which inevitably leads to 
inequalities when implemented. Since indirect discrimination may also exist without intention 
from the perpetrator, it may be more difficult to detect and prove than direct discrimination. 
However, once indirect discrimination has been identified, States should adopt appropriate 
measures in order to remedy the situation as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>39. Even in cases where there is no intention on the part of the State to discriminate against 
members of a certain religious or belief community, or where there is no de jure discrimination 
in national legislation, there may yet exist religious differentials in the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights. Access to basic services like education and health care or access to 
employment may therefore differ when comparing various religious communities or, more 
generally, socio-economic groups of individuals that may be closely linked to certain religious or 
belief communities. Where there is discrimination, be it de jure or de facto and direct or indirect, 
States should address existing or emerging imbalances in line with article 4 of the Declaration on 
the Elimination of Intolerance and Discrimination. Consequently, in-depth studies and analyses 
on the socio-economic situation of particular religious communities are vital for States to take 
adequate measures. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Examples from mandate practice 
</b></p>
<p>40. In order to illustrate the adverse impact of discrimination based on religion or belief on the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, the Special Rapporteur highlights some of the 
recurrent issues encountered in the mandate practice, both in communications with Governments 
and during country visits. She has therefore selected a number of examples in order to show how 
various economic, social and cultural rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have been 
denied to certain individuals or groups of individuals based on their religion or belief. She also 
refers to other United Nations human rights mechanisms, such as treaty bodies and special 
procedures, which have addressed these issues within their mandates. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/10/8 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>the previous mandate-holder was informed about a number of obstacles faced by religious 
minorities in their access to public-sector jobs, especially with regard to positions of 
responsibility (A/55/280/Add.2, paras. 50 and 64). The first mandate-holder, Angelo d&#8217;Almeida 
Ribeiro, also noted that, in one country, the Government had required private employers to 
dismiss employees belonging to a certain sect and had instructed administrative departments to 
prepare lists of members of the sect employed in the departments (E/CN.4/1987/35, para. 63). 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur was also provided with evidence of persistent inequalities and 
religious differentials in relation to employment. For instance, during a recent country visit, she 
noted a serious level of underrepresentation of Catholics in the police, prison services, other 
criminal justice agencies and at the senior level of the civil service, while Protestants were 
underrepresented in sectors such as education and health (A/HRC/7/10/Add.3, para. 38). During 
another country mission, the previous mandate-holder observed that Catholics seemed, in 
practice, not to be accepted for careers in the army, the police and other sensitive areas of the 
administration, including diplomacy (A/51/542/Add.1, paras. 65-67). Whereas such cases may 
be regarded as de facto or indirect discrimination, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind 
States of their obligation to take immediate measures that are likely to lead to the elimination of 
these persistent inequalities and religious differentials as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>43. Discrimination based on religion or belief in the context of access to employment has also 
been addressed by the Special Rapporteur with regard to the issue of the wearing of religious 
symbols. The Special Rapporteur highlighted in a thematic report (E/CN.4/2006/5, para. 55) that 
legislative and administrative actions would be typically incompatible with international human 
rights law if they apply restrictions which are intended to, or lead to, overt discrimination or 
camouflaged differentiation depending on religion or belief. In the event that restrictions would 
be compatible with human rights, State agencies must nonetheless not apply them in a 
discriminatory manner or with a discriminatory purpose, for example by arbitrarily targeting 
certain communities or groups. The Special Rapporteur, however, emphasized that contentious 
situations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by weighing the different rights, 
according to the circumstances of a given situation. She referred to pertinent international case 
law, including to the views of the Human Rights Committee on a communication related to the 
termination of the labour contract of a Sikh employee wearing a turban in his daily life and who 
refused to wear safety headgear during his work in a national railway company. In response to 
the employee&#8217;s complaint that the company had discriminated against him on the basis of his 
religion, the Committee argued that &#8220;legislation requiring that workers in federal employment be 
protected from injury and electric shock by the wearing of hard hats is to be regarded as 
reasonable and directed towards objective purposes that are compatible with the Covenant&#8221;.<b>9</b> The 
Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, on a similar matter, another State enacted specific 
legislation exempting Sikhs from the requirement to wear safety helmets on construction sites 
and offering protection to Sikhs from discrimination in this connection.<b>10</b>

</p>
<p><b>2. Right to an adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur has raised the issue of the right to adequate food of persons 
deprived of their liberty. For example, in a recent communication, she took up the case of a Hare 
Krishna follower who complained of being denied access to food meeting the specific dietary 
needs in accordance with his belief (A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, paras. 57-68). While the prison 
authorities provided one hot meal per day, the detainee complained that, as a vegetarian, he most 
often could not eat it since the vegetables were covered with meat sauce. According to prison 
rules, specific food was provided to detainees only for medical reasons, and detainees had in any 
case the possibility to either buy cold snacks at the cafeteria or to receive specific food from their 
religious communities. However, the complainant argued that there was no local Hindu 
community available to accommodate his dietary needs. This example illustrates that 
discrimination can also occur when individuals are treated in the same way although their 
situation is different. The Special Rapporteur recalls that persons deprived of their liberty find 
themselves in a situation of enhanced vulnerability since prison authorities are given total control 
over the most basic activities of the inmates, including over what they eat. 
</p>
<p>45. With regard to discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the right to 
adequate housing, the mandate addressed the situation of members of a Muslim minority 
community in several communications to a Government (E/CN.4/1993/62, para. 45, 
E/CN.4/2005/61/Add.1, para. 173 and A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 180-181). Reportedly, 
Muslims were systematically relocated through eviction from villages, where afterwards 
members of the Buddhist majority settled in so-called &#8220;model villages&#8221;. In the course of these 
evictions, mosques were reportedly destroyed and replaced by Buddhist pagodas. In addition, the 
land of existing mosques in certain places was confiscated by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>46. During a country visit, the previous mandate-holder noted that personal property, including 
residential premises, of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community had allegedly been confiscated 
(E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.2, para. 62). In a more recent country report, the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living also addressed 
this issue (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.2, paras. 81-85). He highlighted how the housing situation of 
religious minorities was adversely affected by discriminatory laws, such as legal provisions 
concerning inheritance rights, as well as by the abusive use of property confiscation. In 
particular, he reported on several cases of land confiscation against members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith, 
which were often accompanied by threats and physical violence before and during related forced 
evictions. The properties confiscated since 1980 included houses and agricultural land, but also 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; sacred places, such as cemeteries and shrines. The Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing expressed his concern at the clear evidence of discriminatory conduct with respect to 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; property, including housing. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and  
 mental health 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/10/8 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>regard to the right to health (A/HRC/10/8/Add.3). She referred to the analysis in a national 
report<b>11</b> on the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim community which noted a 
bias in public services provisioning in areas with a high proportion of Muslims. The report 
indicated that more than 10,000 villages with a high proportion of Muslims were without any 
medical facilities, and stressed that policy initiatives to ameliorate these conditions were urgently 
required. 
</p>
<p>48. In the framework of another country mission (E/CN.4/1999/58/Add.2, paras. 35 and 113), 
the previous mandate-holder noted that a residence permit containing essential information on an 
individual, including religious and political data, was indispensable in order to get access to 
health care, employment and education. Reportedly, sector policemen had the power to issue and 
revoke this document. The previous mandate-holder criticized such an elaborate system of 
control and its excessive power over individuals. The current Special Rapporteur would like to 
reiterate that any indication of a person&#8217;s religious affiliation on official documents carries a 
serious risk of abuse or subsequent discrimination based on religion or belief, which has to be 
weighed against the possible reasons for disclosing the holder&#8217;s religion (A/63/161, para. 77). 
</p>
<p><b>4. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>49. The mandate has dealt with cases of discrimination based on religion or belief in education 
since its very establishment. Mr. d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro had for instance stated in his first annual 
report that discrimination in education may take a variety of forms, such as in the form of 
vexations suffered at school by the children of believers on the part of teachers of other pupils; in 
certain countries, young believers are excluded from access to higher education. Sometimes, the 
discovery of a student&#8217;s adherence to a particular religious denomination may lead to his 
expulsion from university (E/CN.4/1987/35, para. 65). Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education observed that discrimination on religious grounds has been extensively 
documented, and there are many examples of hostility encountered by those who are out of step 
with the dominant culture (E/CN.4/2005/50, para. 100). 
</p>
<p>50. Concerning school education, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief was 
informed by atheistic and non-theistic believers that pupils were, in some instances, compelled to 
take part in collective religious worship and had no adequate rights of withdrawal. Furthermore, 
atheistic and non-theistic groups objected to the manner in which syllabuses of religious 
education were drawn up, especially that atheists and non-theists were rarely represented on the 
relevant committees or advisory bodies. Some countries afforded a special status to faith-based 
schools and allowed them to discriminate in their admission and employment policies. 
Consequently, teachers with no religious beliefs or with beliefs incompatible with those of the 
faith-based school were put at a disadvantage in comparison with theistic colleagues. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that pupils and teachers should not be discriminated against on 
grounds of their adherence - or not - to a specific religion or belief (A/62/280, paras. 72 and 78).

</p>
<p>51. Indirect or de facto discrimination based on religion or belief has been encountered in the 
context of legislation regulating the wearing of religious symbols in education institutions. 
During a country visit (E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.4, paras. 47-68 and 98-104), the Special Rapporteur 
examined a law that prohibits symbols or clothing by which students conspicuously show a 
religious identity in public elementary schools, middle schools and secondary schools. Although 
the scope of the law applied equally to all religious symbols, it turned out to disproportionately 
affect young Muslim women wearing the headscarf, thereby constituting a form of indirect 
discrimination. It also seriously affected members of the Sikh community, who reported that 
displaying religious symbols was an essential part of their faith. The implementation of this law 
led to the exclusion of children from the school public system and consequently hindered the 
right of some children to have access to educational institutions.<b>12</b> On a similar issue, the Special 
Rapporteur recently dealt with university rules, which reportedly prohibit students from taking 
examinations if their heads are covered (A/HRC/10/8/Add.1). For instance, when a Muslim 
student presented herself with a wig at a university examination, she was prevented from taking 
the examination. Allegedly, the examination personnel refused to hand her the examination 
papers, arguing that her hair did not look natural. She was therefore dismissed from the 
classroom before she could take her examination. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Right to take part in cultural life 
</b></p>
<p>52. Since the right to freedom of religion or belief is intrinsically linked to the right to take part 
in cultural life, the Special Rapporteur has also addressed cases of discrimination based on 
religion or belief with regard to participation in cultural life. Such a case was seen in the 
destruction of irreplaceable relics and religious monuments, which ultimately prevented certain 
believers from enjoying their cultural and religious rights. In this regard the previous 
mandate-holder demanded a halt to the destruction of the Buddhist statues of Bamayan, which 
reflected the religious diversity in the country concerned (A/56/253, para. 27). Unfortunately, the 
statues were subsequently destroyed. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly emphasized that places of worship, religious sites 
and cemeteries have more than a material significance for the religious community attached to 
them. In this context, she is of the view that the concept of collective heritage of humankind 
could be used more prominently with regard to the preservation and protection of religious sites. 
During a recent country visit, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government should 
issue non-selective regulations and designate holy sites on a non-discriminatory basis 
(A/HRC/10/8/Add.2, para. 77).<b>13</b> In addition, restrictions on access to such places of worship and 
religious sites, which ultimately also affect the right to take part in cultural life, must comply 
with international human rights law, including the principle of non-discrimination, as well as 
freedom of religion or belief and liberty of movement. In the context of article 12 (3) of the 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  On the same topic, the Committee on the Rights of the Child in one of its concluding 
</p>
<p>observations expressed its concern that &#8220;the new legislation on wearing religious signs in public 
schools may be counterproductive, by neglecting the principle of the best interests of the child 
and the rights of the child to access to education&#8221; (CRC/C/15/Add.240, paras. 25-26).

</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Special Rapporteur stressed that the 
prohibition of discrimination and freedom of religion or belief may be decisive in the evaluation 
of whether a restriction on the liberty of movement is permissible. 
</p>
<p>54. The right of indigenous peoples to maintain, protect and have access in privacy to their 
religious and cultural sites was affirmed in article 12 of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. These issues were also raised by the previous mandate-holder in 
several country reports (E/CN.4/2002/73/Add.1; E/CN.4/1999/58/Add.1; E/CN.4/1998/6/Add.1). 
He insisted that access to and preservation of holy sites were fundamental rights in the sphere of 
religion or belief that must be guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of international 
human rights law. He welcomed any effort to ensure that indigenous peoples cease to be an 
excluded community and enjoy all their rights, especially economic, social and cultural rights. 
Indigenous peoples who suffer from an accumulation of unfavourable conditions - economic, 
social, cultural and religious - should benefit in practice from a policy of support to compensate 
for these inequalities. Such an approach needs to be in line with the general requirements for 
temporary special measures as reflected in several general comments issued by treaty bodies.<b>14</b>

<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Sixty years ago, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, which stipulates, inter alia, that &#8220;the advent of a world in which human beings shall 
enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed 
as the highest aspiration of the common people&#8221;. It furthermore emphasized that everyone 
is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of 
any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status. Unfortunately, there remains a long way to go 
in order to achieve the goals laid down in the Declaration. Indeed, discrimination based on 
religion or belief preventing individuals from fully enjoying all their human rights still 
occurs worldwide on a daily basis. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The issue of discrimination based on religion or belief has been at the heart of the 
mandate since its inception in 1986, when the mandate was still entitled &#8220;Special 
Rapporteur on religious intolerance&#8221;. Over the years, the Special Rapporteur has reported 
on numerous cases of discrimination adversely affecting civil, cultural, economic, political 
and social rights. By discussing the impact of discrimination based on religion or belief on 
the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in the present report, the Special 
Rapporteur has highlighted some of the problematic trends in this area. She hopes that this 
preliminary analysis might lead to a deeper reflection on this important issue.

<p>57. <b>In many countries, religion is exploited for political ends. As illustrated in the report, 
discrimination based on religion or belief often emanates from deliberate State policies to 
ostracize certain religious or belief communities and to restrict or deny their access to, for 
example, health services, public education or public posts. State authorities usually tend to 
be more sensitive to the interests of a religious majority community and, as a result, 
minority religions or beliefs may find themselves marginalized or discriminated against. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that States have the duty to refrain from 
discriminating against individuals or groups of individuals based on their religion and 
belief (obligation to respect); they are required to prevent such discrimination, including 
from non-State actors (obligation to protect); and must take steps to ensure that, in 
practice, every person in their territory enjoys all human rights without discrimination of 
any kind (obligation to fulfil). 
</b>59. <b>In order to implement these obligations, States have several tools at their disposal. 
These include the removal of de jure and de facto obstacles to the exercise on an equal 
footing of all human rights. In this regard, the training of State officials may constitute an 
important measure to ensure that the principle of non-discrimination, including on the 
basis of religion or belief, is respected by the State. Monitoring compliance with 
anti-discrimination legislation by the private sector and offering quality public education 
also seem vital to promote the principle of non-discrimination in society. Furthermore, 
legal remedies must be provided to individuals in order to allow them to seek redress 
against discrimination based on religion or belief. In addition, States should envisage 
protective measures in favour of certain population groups, including religious minorities, 
to provide those who do not have sufficient means with equal access to basic services, such 
as health care or education. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>In order to take appropriate measures to remedy persistent inequalities and religious 
differentials in relation to all human rights, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
States collect disaggregated data and that they encourage in-depth analyses pertaining to 
the socio-economic situation of religious and belief communities. However, she cautions 
against improper utilization of these data, which may further cluster the population into 
artificial categories and ultimately lead to a more polarized and intolerant society. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>All human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. 
Consequently, there should not be a different approach between discrimination affecting 
the enjoyment of civil and political rights on the one hand, and discrimination affecting the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on the other. As reiterated in several 
general comments by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
principle of non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is not subject to the rule of the progressive 
realization of rights or to the availability of resources. It is immediately and fully 
applicable to all the rights guaranteed by the Covenant and encompasses all internationally 
prohibited grounds of discrimination. </b></p>

<p>62. <b>The entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights recently adopted by the General Assembly should enable those 
suffering from violations of their economic, social and cultural rights to seek remedies 
and to hold those responsible to account for their actions. In a joint press statement of 
10 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur and 35 other special procedures 
mandate-holders expressed their sincere hope that the views adopted by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights under the Optional Protocol procedures will be used 
by the human rights community to assist States in taking concrete steps to realize the rights 
of all and to reach out to the most marginalized and disadvantaged, who are the most likely 
to have their rights violated. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the promotion of the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights may ultimately contribute to enhancing 
religious tolerance and preventing discrimination.
