<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders conducted a country visit to Brazil from 5 to 21 December 2005 during which she met 
with senior officials of the Government, a wide range of human rights defenders and 
representatives of intergovernmental organizations and States.  The objective of the visit was to 
assess the situation and role of human rights defenders in Brazil. 
</p>
<p> Following an introductory section, in section II the Special Representative describes the 
human rights community and the strategies they have adopted to confront the various trends that 
result in the violation of human rights.  This section highlights the struggle for the attainment of 
economic, social and cultural rights, and emphasizes the political and social significance of 
social movements in Brazil and their relevance to the strong constitutional framework for the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  The Special Representative concludes that these 
social movements constitute an asset for and add value to Brazilian democracy.  They have 
developed modes of social action and participation and are evolving rules of engagement that 
limit the possibility of the use of violence in social action.  She believes that the role of defenders 
in promoting and supporting these movements should receive better recognition.   
</p>
<p> In section III, the Special Representative examines the environment in which defenders 
operate and concludes that despite positive developments, there are serious concerns regarding 
the security of human rights defenders.  In their efforts to attain social, economic, environmental 
and cultural rights; in seeking to expose human rights violations and to end impunity for these 
violations; and in resisting discrimination and marginalization, human rights defenders continue 
to be threatened and harmed. 
</p>
<p> In section IV, the report outlines the initiatives taken by Government that have the 
potential to create an environment that is conducive to activities for the defence of human rights.  
The Special Representative is, nevertheless, aware that there are serious obstacles that the 
Government has to overcome in order to fulfil that potential, and that gaps between the declared 
policy and its implementation, and between creating mechanisms and making them effective 
remain to be addressed. 
</p>
<p> In section V the Special Representative describes the trends that impede progress in 
ensuring the protection of human rights defenders against abuse and violence.  In this context, 
she discusses the role of State agencies, the judiciary, the parliament and the media.  She 
identifies the main negative factors that affect the safety and work of human rights defenders.  
Such factors include persistent impunity for violations of the rights of defenders, attempts to 
discredit them and their activities, and the disparity of commitment between the federal and the 
state Governments to address the problems. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Special Representative formulates her conclusions and recommendations for 
consideration by the Government. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/61 and 2003/64, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders conducted an 
official visit to Brazil from 5 to 21 December 2005 at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Representative would like to thank the Government of Brazil for the 
excellent cooperation extended to her in preparation of and during her mission.  She wishes in 
particular to acknowledge the support she received from the staff of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and of the Special Secretariat for Human Rights throughout her visit.  During her visit 
she was able to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Ministers of Mines and Energy 
and of Justice, the Ministry of Labour, the Head of the Secretariat for Human Rights, the 
Vice-President of the Federal Supreme Court, the President of the Superior Court of Justice and 
other senior members of Government and parliament.  She regrets that she did not get the 
opportunity to meet with the President. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition to Bras&#237;lia, the Special Representative visited the States of Par&#225;, Bahia, 
Pernambuco, S&#227;o Paulo and Santa Catarina where she had the opportunity to meet with 
federal authorities, members of state legislatures and the judiciary, and law enforcement 
agencies.  She also met with human rights defenders engaged with a broad range of human rights 
issues.  She thanks all organizations and individuals who worked hard to coordinate her meetings 
with the defender community.  Their efforts were instrumental in securing a particularly rich 
non-governmental programme during her visit.  She also thanks the Office of the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator for its assistance with the programme and logistics of the visit. 
</p>
<p><b>II. HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN BRAZIL:  AN ASSET 
FOR DEMOCRACY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  An informed and vibrant civil society 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the course of her visit, the Special Representative met with a host of civil society 
representatives remarkable by their number, enthusiasm and level of collective organization.  
She was struck by the vibrancy of the human rights movement in Brazil, despite the difficult 
challenges that the social and political climate in the country presents. 
</p>
<p>5. It is generally acknowledged that the struggle against military dictatorship greatly 
contributed to building awareness of civil and political rights and to forming strong national 
networks of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  During that period, members of the 
Catholic Church, political organizations, the academic community and intellectuals also created 
centres for human rights education and developed pastoral social initiatives in defence of human 
rights.  Civil society organizations working on human rights continued to grow in the 1990s.  
Initially, most organizations concentrated their efforts on reporting violations of civil and 
political rights.  However, they gradually expanded the scope of their mandate and have now 
adopted an inclusive approach to the defence of human rights, focusing in particular on 
economic, social, environmental and cultural rights and on discrimination based on race, sexual 
orientation and gender. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>6. The struggle for democratic rights during the military dictatorship generated popular 
mobilization that developed into important social movements.  While many defenders work 
within NGOs, much of the human rights activity in Brazil is rooted in collective action at the 
grass-roots level.  By organizing themselves at the federal as well as the state level, these 
organizations and groups have been able to impact on national as well as local policies.  
Defenders have put in place thematic human rights networks, as well as regional and national 
platforms, including a well-coordinated national network of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Social movements and emerging trends in social action 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Constitution of Brazil marks extraordinary progress in the consolidation of 
fundamental rights and guarantees and is one of the most comprehensive such documents in this 
respect.  The constitutional framework has been instrumental in providing an impetus to 
activities for the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly in the field of economic, 
social and cultural rights.  The Special Representative has particularly noted article 5 XXIII 
which guarantees the right to property, but makes it conditional on the socially beneficial use of 
the property.  This provision is the nexus for the issues around which social struggles and 
environmental rights activism are constructed.  Furthermore, the right to popular participation 
enshrined in the Constitution, and the law, provides a sound basis for interaction and 
constructive engagement between State institutions and human rights defenders.  This is 
manifested in the role of human rights defenders.  While there is strong criticism of the failures 
of Government, the defenders&#8217; community genuinely seeks to assist the Government in devising 
policies and initiatives to address pressing issues and to alleviate conditions that result in human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p>8. Constitutional provisions have allowed social movements to use the legal forums to 
overcome the inadequacy of laws or the absence of enabling policies for the realization of 
guaranteed rights.  They also give legitimacy to defenders&#8217; demands and advocacy for reform or 
implementation of laws and policies that enhance the recognition of and respect for human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>9. Notable examples of this trend are the Movement for the Right to Housing (MSTC) and 
the Landless Workers Movement (MST).  These movements have relied on constitutional 
provisions to legitimize the occupation of property that does not fulfil its social function or has 
been illegally appropriated by land grabbers. 
</p>
<p>10. During her visit, the Special Representative had the opportunity to examine the situation 
of defenders involved in social movements, such as those for the rights of landless rural workers, 
peasants, indigenous communities and people of African descent, sexual minorities, the 
homeless, and people affected by dams. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Representative has observed with interest the manner in which social action 
strategies are increasingly being influenced by the human rights Paradigm.  There is a growing 
consciousness amongst activists that they are entitled to the protection of international human 
rights law and standards in conducting activities for the promotion and protection of economic, </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights.  This consciousness has instilled a degree of discipline in collective 
action that has diminished the scope of violence emerging from social action.  Interaction 
between movements and human rights organizations has also become more meaningful and 
mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Representative had the opportunity to visit a settlement organized and 
managed by MST in the State of Par&#225;.  She witnessed how this movement has consciously 
incorporated democratic structures in its organization and is promoting social responsibility 
amongst the beneficiaries of its activities.  The settlements of landless people created by MST 
function on the basis of the principle of participation of all members and follow rules of 
self-governance that are, at least at the conceptual level, also sensitive to gender participation.  
The system that they have evolved emphasizes a decentralized structure of leadership and 
authority, and allows effective national coordination of its activities. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Representative believes that these social movements constitute an asset for 
and add value to Brazilian democracy.  They have developed modes of social action and 
participation and are evolving rules of engagement that limit the possibility of the use of violence 
in social action.  She believes that this aspect of the role of defenders in social movements must 
be publicized by the State as well as the media. 
</p>
<p><b>III. SECURITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND 
FACILITATION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>14. It is unfortunate that in real terms neither the return to democracy and a sound legal 
framework for the defence of human rights, nor the presence of an active and experienced civil 
society has provided sufficient protection to human rights defenders or their activities.  In their 
efforts to attain social, economic, environmental and cultural rights; in seeking to expose human 
rights violations and to end impunity for these violations; and in resisting discrimination or 
marginalization, human rights defenders continue to be threatened and harmed. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Attacks against the physical integrity of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the course of her meetings, the Special Representative was deeply perturbed by the 
numerous accounts of assassinations, attempts on their lives and threats against defenders.  She 
notes that the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) reported that 39 leaders of rural workers were 
killed in 2004 and 38 in 2005. 
</p>
<p>16. In rural areas such as the State of Par&#225;, most of the violence against defenders is rooted in 
conflicts over land, use and control of natural resources, prevention of environmental 
degradation, and preservation of the rights of minorities and indigenous communities and of 
rural workers.  In the absence of effective State protection against powerful social forces and 
economic interests, the rural population is left vulnerable to exploitation.  Their efforts to 
organize for their survival or to secure their rights are frequently suppressed through violence.  
Owners of large estates, lumber companies and other national and international economic 
interests are amongst those responsible for the violation of the rights of peasants, rural workers, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>indigenous people and Quilombola communities<b>1</b> and those working for rural welfare.  In a 
majority of cases powerful non-State actors, who frequently benefit from the collusion of local 
and State authorities, perpetrate these acts.  The Special Representative was deeply distressed at 
the plight of widows of killed rural workers who are now leading the movement and who face 
daily threats in the form of attempts to discredit them socially and undermine their work by 
labelling them as prostitutes. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Land rights activists 
</b></p>
<p>17. While the Constitution provides for the right to land, the implementation of this provision 
has largely been initiated by rural communities themselves, with powerful forces resisting 
realization of the social objectives of the Constitution through violent means.  Leaders of these 
communities have been targeted in order to silence activists and weaken the movements.  
Leaders of rural workers&#8217; unions and land rights movements have been killed or suffer daily 
threats to their lives and their families because of their struggle against land-grabbing, 
environmental destruction and slave labour.  The Special Representative was told that in the 
State of Par&#225; alone, CPT has reported 97 assassinations of rural workers and 400 cases of death 
threats since 2000. 
</p>
<p>18. The reports received by the Special Representative show that in most cases land rights 
activists are murdered by hired gunmen or private militias commissioned by powerful 
landowners.  Generally, the violence is committed in order to punish the leaders for their protest 
against illegal acquisition of land, or for their support of landless poor people occupying vacant 
and non-productive land.  The murder of Sister Dorothy Stang, a member of CPT who had been 
active in denouncing threats and intimidation against rural workers by owners of a large estate, 
loggers and <i>grileiros</i> (illegal land grabbers) in Anapu in 2005, is illustrative of this pattern.  
Dorothy Stang was shot dead by two men reportedly hired by a large estate owner from the area 
shortly after she participated in a public hearing organized by federal authorities to tackle the 
issue of agrarian reform and the problem of violence against human rights defenders.  During the 
visit of the Special Representative, two of the accused in this case were tried and sentenced. 
</p>
<p>19. Another example of this trend is the situation of the rural workers&#8217; union (STR) of 
Rondon do Par&#225;, an organization fighting for the rights of rural workers and against slave labour 
which has seen three of its leaders murdered in the past six years.  Amongst cases reported to the 
Special Representative is that of Dezinho, the then President of the organization, who had been 
receiving threats because of his denunciation of the illegal appropriation of the land and was 
killed in 2000.  In 2002, &#8220;Brasilia&#8221;, then President of STR in the village of Castelo dos Sonhos, 
was also killed.  Two years later, Ribamar Francisco dos Santos, head of the organization in 
Rondon do Par&#225;, was also killed.  Maria Joel da Costa, the current President, repeatedly receives

</p>
<p>death threats and is warned against defending rural workers.  Considering the pattern of past 
assassinations of leaders of the organization, the Special Representative is deeply apprehensive 
regarding her safety.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>20. Land rights activists also suffer constant harassment, intimidation and threats from large 
estate owners, often in collusion with local authorities.  Their villages and communities are 
regularly raided and they are illegally evicted by private militia, in many instances with the help 
of local police forces.  In June 2003, in the State of Par&#225;, Jo&#227;o Alberto In&#225;cio J&#250;nior, a leader of 
the landless community of Rasgadinho, suffered an armed attack by gunmen identified as 
employees of a local landowner who raided and shot at his home. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Indigenous and Quilombola communities 
</b>21. Article 231 of the Constitution guarantees the rights of indigenous communities and the 
law provides for the restoration of land historically owned by these communities.  The rights of 
the Quilombola communities are protected by article 68 of the Act on the Transitional 
Constitutional Provisions.<b>3</b>  However, the process of demarcation and repossession of these lands 
has also been resisted and conflict has ensued.  These conflicts have created an unstable 
environment in which the safety of leaders of indigenous and Quilombola communities has been 
seriously jeopardized.  The Special Representative had the opportunity to travel to the Truk&#225; 
Indian reservation in Cabrob&#243; (Pernambuco) and met with representatives of several 
communities including the Truk&#225;, Xukuru, Pankar&#225;, Pipip&#227;, Kapinaw&#225;, Atikum and Tubalala and 
with the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI).  She was able to observe that in many 
instances, indigenous and Quilombola communities live in constant fear of harm to themselves 
and to their families. 
</p>
<p>22. CIMI reported that in 2005, 33 members of indigenous communities were murdered at 
the instigation of powerful landowners, in many cases with the collusion of local authorities and 
the direct support of local police forces.  Indigenous communities have been targets of numerous 
attempted killings and death threats, especially in the process of repossession of land.  For 
instance, the leader of the Truk&#225; people, who had been actively involved in the process of the 
restoration of land to this community, was murdered together with his son in Pernambuco, 
allegedly at the hands of the military police during a peaceful celebratory ceremony.  CIMI 
points out that most of these crimes are not registered as human rights violations but as &#8220;passion 
crimes&#8221;, mostly perpetrated by unknown assailants. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The Government of Brazil, in its comments on the present report, has informed the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative that Maria Joel da Costa is currently under police protection through the 
Programme on Human Rights Defenders of the State of Par&#225;, functioning under the supervision 
of the National Coordinating body on Human Rights Defenders.

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Environmental rights activists 
</b></p>
<p>23. Human rights defenders working for the preservation of the environment become even 
more vulnerable because of the remoteness of the areas in which they are active.  It was reported 
that many defenders who denounce illegal logging and large-scale fishing and those working to 
preserve wildlife habitats in the Amazon region and in the south and north-east regions of the 
country face attacks and threats against their lives. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Attacks against officials and elected representatives 
</b></p>
<p>24. State and federal officials, civil servants and elected representatives working to enforce 
the rule of law in order to protect human rights have also suffered attacks and received threats.  
In many cases they are targeted with the apparent intention of preventing the establishment of 
State authority in the remote rural areas, so that violations of social and economic rights of the 
rural population remain unaddressed. 
</p>
<p>25. Judges who attempt to investigate organized crime and human rights abuses and bring 
perpetrators to justice have suffered attempts on their lives; some have been assassinated.  In 
March 2003, Alexandre Martins de Castro Filho, a judge and a member of the federal 
Government &#8220;task force&#8221; to investigate organized crime in the State of Esp&#237;rito Santo, was 
murdered by two men on motorcycles outside his gym. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of civil servants from federal and state institutions such as the National 
Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCRA), the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) or IBAMA 
have also been the targets of killings and threats for attempting to carry out federal policies on 
agrarian reforms, land demarcation and environmental protection.  In May 2005, an INCRA 
employee in the State of Bahia was ambushed, surrounded and threatened by a group 
of 200 armed men while conducting a demarcation exercise.  In 2004, three labour inspectors 
were assassinated in the State of Minas Gerais while carrying out an inspection related to 
allegations of the use of slave labour. 
</p>
<p>27. In the State of Par&#225;, the President of the Human Rights Commission of the state 
legislative assembly, who headed a Parliamentary Investigative Commission (CPI) on child 
prostitution, was threatened on Assembly premises by other state representatives involved in the 
cases being investigated. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Defenders working in urban settings 
</b></p>
<p>28. In the urban context defenders have suffered the most severe attacks when publicly 
denouncing police violence, torture and ill-treatment in prisons and attempting to tackle the issue 
of organized crime, or so-called &#8220;extermination groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>29. A number of defenders working to denounce the operations of death squads have been 
killed and others live in hiding under constant threat.  For example, two witnesses of arbitrary 
executions, in Pedras de Fogo (Par&#225;) and Santo Ant&#244;nio de Jesus (Bahia), were murdered shortly 
after having met with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>during a visit to Brazil.  More recently, Ana Maria dos Santos, founding member of the 
Santo Ant&#244;nio de Jesus Human Rights Forum, continues to receive threats.  These threats are 
related to the organization&#8217;s denunciation of the &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; carried out by death squads in 
the municipality of Santo Ant&#244;nio de Jesus in Bahia, reportedly with the support of State 
authorities and local businessmen.  On the issue of extermination groups, the Special 
Representative draws attention to the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary execution (E/CN.4/2004/7/Add.3) that also depicts several cases of human rights 
defenders working in the urban areas of the country. 
</p>
<p>30. NGO members monitoring and reporting on the practice of torture by the security forces 
and in Brazilian prisons have also been the targets of numerous threats.  In January 2005, Maria 
Concei&#231;&#227;o Paganele, President of the Associa&#231;&#227;o das M&#227;es e Amigos da Crian&#231;a e do 
Adolescente em Risco (AMAR), a mothers&#8217; organization in S&#227;o Paulo, started receiving regular 
death threats over the phone and being followed.  In connection with her exposure of a case of 
collective torture in a detention centre for adolescents (FEBEM), which had resulted in the 
imprisonment of the staff involved.  Social workers and educators also reported that their 
activities on behalf of street children or adolescents are regularly obstructed.  In some instances, 
security forces are reported to have physically assaulted educators and the children with whom 
they work. 
</p>
<p>31. Journalists reporting on human rights issues, in particular those investigating death 
squads and corruption, have been killed.  Others have been assaulted by police forces and in a 
few instances by politicians, or sued in court for libel, insults or defamation.  In April 2004, a 
radio show host who had denounced local government officials&#8217; involvement in organized crime 
was shot dead in Matto Grosso do Sul.  As a result of this situation, journalists are forced to 
exercise a degree of self-censorship out of fear. 
</p>
<p>32. Activists advocating the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons 
have also been targets of threats.  In most cases these threats emanate from non-State entities.  
For instance, the Directors of Coturno de Venus, a lesbian feminist association in Brasilia, 
reported receiving death threats from a neo-fascist organization in September 2005 because of 
their activities on the occasion of the celebration of the day for lesbians in August 2005.  In 
another instance, Claudio Alves dos Santos, an activist for the rights of homosexuals who 
worked for the Referral Centre against Homosexual Violence and Discrimination in 
Rio de Janeiro, was killed after being severely beaten and tortured in October 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  A climate of fear 
</b></p>
<p>33. Considering the high number of defenders who have been killed throughout Brazil, 
the Special Representative voices her most serious concern that death threats against defenders 
are for the most part not investigated by local and federal authorities.  Human rights 
organizations repeatedly pointed out that in most cases defenders who were killed had previously 
reported threats to authorities but that no action had been taken.  They particularly pointed out 
the lack of action by the authorities on the numerous threats received by Dezinho, &#8220;Brasilia&#8221; and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Sister Dorothy before their deaths.<b>4</b>  The police forces with whom the Special Representative met 
in Par&#225; generally admitted that threats are often not investigated because of their categorization 
as &#8220;lesser crimes&#8221; within domestic law and lack of available resources for investigation. 
</p>
<p>34. In certain states, defenders claimed that there were &#8220;hit lists&#8221; containing some of their 
names along with the amount of &#8220;prize money&#8221; that would be paid for their execution.  They 
reported that in Par&#225;, despite the publication by CPT of the names of defenders whose names had 
been placed on such hit lists no investigation had been undertaken by the State authorities.  The 
Special Representative, however, was not shown the list published by CPT. 
</p>
<p>35. The number of cases reported to the Special Representative indicates a pattern of 
violations against human rights defenders for which there is little accountability or deterrence.  
This has created an environment in which human rights defenders live and work in a state of 
constant insecurity.  A number of defenders have had to leave their homes and families and 
abandon their work out of fear for their safety.  The Special Representative thanks the defenders 
who had been in hiding for years but who chose to meet with her despite the obvious risks. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Criminalization of human rights activities and 
of the mobilization for collective action 
</b></p>
<p>36. Human rights defenders in the south and in urban centres of the country reported that 
their work is being increasingly hampered by the criminalization of their activities by State 
authorities.  Defenders, especially those working in social movements, face repeated arrests and 
prosecutions.  Many are under surveillance and suffer from the violent behaviour of security 
forces. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Representative was informed that in November 2004 an internal police 
memo was discovered instructing the civil police in S&#227;o Paulo to monitor trade unions, NGOs 
and social movements such as MST. 
</p>
<p>38. She received reports of arrests of several human rights defenders, particularly leaders 
of social movements who had organized or participated in collective public action.  The 
Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB) reported that its leaders and members are 
constantly arrested and detained because of their action in defence of those affected by dams.  In 
one instance, 10 MAB coordinators in Campos Novos were arrested under a judicial order for

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  In the case of Sister Dorothy Stang, the Government informed the Special Representative, in 
</p>
<p>its comments on the report, that in fact she was offered physical protection by the Government 
before she was killed, but she had refused the offer.  The Government therefore maintains that 
&#8220;this information demonstrates action by official authorities regarding her situation before her 
regrettable death&#8221;.  The Special Representative acknowledges the position taken by the 
Government in this particular case.  However, in the light of the section of the report on the 
National Programme for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (paras. 55-62), she maintains 
her conclusion contained in paragraph 35. </p>

</p>
<p>&#8220;preventive custody&#8221; just a few days before a demonstration scheduled to take place 
on 14 March for the international day for the struggle against dams.  They were held in 
detention for 25 days. 
</p>
<p>39. Human rights defenders face numerous civil and criminal proceedings linked to their 
activities to mobilize for peaceful collective action to protest or resist violations of human rights.  
Such activities have resulted in charges against defenders of &#8220;forming criminal gangs&#8221;, 
&#8220;obstructing public roads&#8221;, creating &#8220;public disorder&#8221;, &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221;, &#8220;inciting to crime&#8221;, 
&#8220;intimidating the police&#8221;, &#8220;trespassing&#8221;, &#8220;libel and defamation&#8221; and &#8220;material damages&#8221;.  In 
several instances, malicious prosecutions have been brought against defenders on fabricated 
criminal charges in order to discredit their work.  MAB reported that 107 of its leaders currently 
face criminal charges, with some individuals accused in as many as 15 proceedings. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Representative was told that in the State of Par&#225;, six rural workers were 
arrested in 2002 at the Manduacari estate in Anapu.  They were accused of &#8220;forming gangs&#8221;, of 
&#8220;mugging&#8221; and of &#8220;carrying weapons&#8221; and detained for four months for having participated in 
the occupation of land that had already been classified as unproductive by INCRA. 
</p>
<p>41. In some instances members or sympathizers of human rights movements and 
organizations have also been charged.  It was reported to the Special Representative that 
Ariel de Castro, a human rights lawyer and member of the National Human Rights Movement, 
currently faces charges of &#8220;libel&#8221; and &#8220;false documentation&#8221; in connection with an interview he 
gave to the press, in which he had raised concerns about the treatment of children and 
adolescents in detention. 
</p>
<p>42. In some cases prosecutions have resulted in heavy sentences.  MAB reported 
some 36 of its leaders and members prosecuted in criminal suits had received sentences ranging 
from 1 to 30 years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violent policing of collective action 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Representative was seriously concerned about the role of law enforcement in 
suppressing public gatherings and the use of excessive force against peaceful assemblies.  She 
received credible accounts that in several states heavily armed state military police had been 
deployed at peaceful demonstrations in an attempt to intimidate protesters. 
</p>
<p>44. On 8 March 2005, the military police in Minas Gerais violently broke up a protest against 
the construction of the Jurumirim Dam, reportedly beating up 35 farmers including women and 
children.  Student organizations in Florian&#243;polis also reported that their demonstrations to 
demand free public transportation were met with violence by the police who used rubber bullets 
and beat demonstrators.  Similar violent action against student demonstrations took place in 
Recife, Pernambuco, in November 2005.  In some instances, the Army is reported to have been 
called in to police protests. 
</p>
<p>45. It was reported that peaceful sit-ins and occupations of land and buildings are also 
frequently dealt with violently.  Evictions from land occupation sites are often carried out with 
violent methods by massive numbers of heavily armed police officers.  The Special 
Representative heard reports of houses being burnt, encampments being destroyed by bulldozers, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>shots being fired, and defenders and community members being insulted, brutalized and 
humiliated.  She was informed that in a number of cases evictions were arbitrarily carried out by 
armed private militias, who are sometimes off-duty officers of the military police, without 
judicial authorization. 
</p><p>46. Defenders reported the frequent and indiscriminate use of so-called &#8220;non-lethal weapons&#8221; 
such as rubber bullets and, in some instances, of live ammunition against peaceful 
demonstrators in order to disperse assemblies.  Such use is a matter of grave concern to the 
Special Representative.  The authorities in the states she visited could not give any satisfactory 
answers to her questions regarding procedures that would streamline authorization and 
monitoring of such use. 
</p>
<p>47. While she does not discount allegations made by some state governments of violence 
accompanying collective action in some instances, she has noted with grave concern that 
peaceful public action for the defence of human rights has frequently been met with the use of 
disproportionate force.  She has received credible accounts from human rights and other civil 
society organizations, including video recordings of demonstrations, that document the brutality 
used against peaceful protestors by the police. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT, 
OBSTACLES AND SHORTCOMINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Institutions and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Representative appreciates the initiatives that the Federal Government has 
taken to give prominence to the promotion and protection of human rights in its policies.  The 
fact that Brazil is now a signatory to the principal international human rights treaties also 
enhances the prospects for human rights protection and respect for the work of human rights 
defenders. 
</p>
<p>49. There is also a visible interest at the federal level in strengthening national institutions 
and mechanisms to deal with human rights abuses.  She found that the work of human rights 
defenders is generally respected within the governmental structures and that authorities engage 
with the civil society and seek its participation and involvement in the design and 
implementation of human rights initiatives.  Two examples of such cooperation are the National 
Council to Promote Racial Equality, which includes civil society organizations in its 
composition, and the Witness Protection Programme (PROVITA) based on cooperation between 
a federal ministry and an NGO that is administering the programme at the grass-roots level. 
</p>
<p><i>National Programme on Human Rights 
</i></p>
<p>50. At the federal level, the Government has set up a number of institutions and programmes 
to tackle human rights issues.  In 1996, it launched the National Programme on Human Rights 
(NPHR), which was amended in 2002 and includes civil and political as well as social, 
economical and cultural rights in its agenda.  A number of defenders emphasized that the 
inclusion of human rights in national policies represents progress.  It is, however, still a very 
recent step and decisive measures have yet to be taken if an effective human rights system is to 
be established to deal with the complex problems that exist. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p><i>The Special Secretariats for Human Rights and Racial Equality and the Ministry for 
Women&#8217;s Affairs 
</i>51. In 1997, the national Special Secretariat for Human Rights (SEDH) was established with 
the mandate to coordinate and support the implementation of the National Programme.  While 
the creation of this Secretariat is a major step forward, the mandate of the Secretariat is too 
limited and it has yet to be given political weight within the Government and the resources 
necessary to achieve its objectives.  The ministerial status of the Secretariat was recently restored 
after protest by human rights organizations against the downgrading of the department.  Despite 
the several weaknesses pointed out by defenders that hamper the effectiveness of this initiative, 
the Special Representative has noted the sensitivity of the Special Secretariat on the issue of 
security for defenders.  She is, therefore, optimistic about the role that this institution can play in 
creating an enabling and safe environment for defenders to conduct their work freely in all fields 
of human rights that they are engaged in. 
</p>
<p>52. The Federal Government has also created a Special Secretariat for Racial Equality with 
the mandate to coordinate programmes for the rights of the Afro-Brazilian population, and a 
Ministry for Women&#8217;s Affairs.  Both these initiatives are signs of the Government&#8217;s commitment 
to address issues of inequality and social justice for the more marginalized sections of the 
population. 
</p>
<p><i>Human Rights Commission of the National Parliament 
</i>53. The Special Representative met with members of the Human Rights Commission of the 
National Parliament, which has been active in setting up various commissions to investigate and 
inquire into specific human rights issues.  They indicated that the Commission had received 
several public complaints regarding human rights violations.  However, a lack of resources had 
constrained their ability to be fully functional so that they are not able to travel and investigate 
all the complaints that they received. 
</p>
<p>54. The human rights committees of the parliament and state legislative assemblies are 
generally active on human rights issues and are accessible to human rights defenders.  However, 
the legislature as an institution needs to be more sensitive to human rights issues and assign 
higher priority to the protection of activities for the defence of human rights in their legislative 
agenda.  There is a general apprehension that political polarization within the legislative bodies 
has undermined many human rights-related initiatives. 
</p>
<p><i>National Programme for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders 
</i>55. In 2003, SEDH appointed a working group which, over a period of four months, 
developed guidelines for what ultimately became the Permanent State Policy for the Protection 
of Human Rights Defenders.  The National Programme for the Protection of Human Rights 
Defenders was officially launched in October 2004. 
</p>
<p>56. The programme aims at providing physical police protection to defenders, setting up a 
database to register defenders at risk, developing strategies to address impunity and sensitizing 
the population on the role and importance of defenders.  A National Steering Committee was set 
up at the federal level to coordinate and monitor the overall implementation of the programme.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>The Committee includes representatives of the civil society, the parliament, the Federal and 
Transport Police, the Federal Public Ministry, and officials of state governments and members of 
the state judiciary representing the steering committees established at state level.  Par&#225;, 
Pernambuco and Espirito Santo were chosen to initiate pilot programmes for defenders&#8217; 
protection. 
</p>
<p>57. The civil society has welcomed the establishment of this programme, but points out 
several institutional and methodological weaknesses that have slowed its progress.  As yet Par&#225; 
is the only state where an organized structure to implement the pilot programme has started 
working.  The Special Representative was able to attend one of the Par&#225; steering committee 
meetings and noted the genuine efforts at cooperation between state authorities and the civil 
society.  The committee has developed a strategy for the implementation of the programme in 
Par&#225; and assessments of defenders at risk have started with a few defenders already receiving 
protection. 
</p>
<p>58. In Pernambuco, the steering committee was set only just prior to the Special 
Representative&#8217;s visit and had just started to gather information about defenders at risk.  So far 
no one is being protected under the programme.  The programme is not yet functional in 
Espirito Santo. 
</p>
<p>59. NGOs expressed dissatisfaction with the structural design of the programme which 
assigns primary responsibility for its implementation to state authorities, with SEDH only acting 
as a coordinator.  Considering that many violations reportedly occur at the hands of or in 
collusion with state authorities, especially the state police, the defenders do not find it realistic to 
expect local authorities to have the level of commitment needed to effectively protect defenders.  
It is apparent that there is much more public confidence in the Federal Police than the State 
Military Police.  The Federal Police, however, have been reluctant to take on responsibility for 
the protection of defenders under this programme and have reportedly claimed that this is 
beyond the scope of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>60. NGOs are also concerned that the absence of guaranteed financial resources makes the 
sustainability of the programme uncertain.  Both state and federal authorities have failed to 
secure the programme against such unpredictability.  The situation of the pilot programme in 
Par&#225; is a case in point.  Failure of SEDH to arrange for federal funds for this programme has 
resulted in the police responsible for protection not being appropriately trained and the state 
authorities not being able to follow the agreed guidelines for protection.  This has resulted in a 
lack of confidence in the programme and some of the defenders at risk have refused police 
protection. 
</p>
<p>61. In addition, defenders claim that requests for protection have often not received adequate 
responses.  Despite the relatively better situation of the programme in Par&#225;, defenders reported 
that only 5 defenders are currently being protected, whereas there are over 100 that are believed 
to be at risk.  In S&#227;o Paulo, despite a formal request to SEDH in February 2005, the President of 
AMAR was not provided with protection with the justification that the programme does not exist 
in the state, although the defender concerned did receive protection from the State Military 
Police for three months, by order of the then State Secretary for Justice and Citizenship of </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>S&#227;o Paulo.<b>5</b>  Nevertheless, some defenders expressed dissatisfaction with the programme to the 
extent that they were considering withdrawing from the National Steering Committee.  Others 
were sceptical about the efficacy of the programme as without more comprehensive strategies to 
promote the work of human rights defenders, physical protection was meaningless. 
</p>
<p>62. Despite the reservations expressed in relation to the initiatives undertaken by the 
Government, the Special Representative is optimistic about their potential for the advancement 
of human rights and the protection of human rights defenders.  She is, nevertheless, aware that 
there are serious obstacles that the Government has to overcome to fulfil that potential.  She also 
agrees with the view that serious concerns regarding the situation of human rights defenders 
persist in Brazil because of a wide gap between the declaration of the policy and its 
implementation, and between the creation of mechanisms and their effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b>V. TRENDS THAT IMPEDE PROGRESS IN ENSURING 
PROTECTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The role of State agencies 
</b></p>
<p>63. Based on the Constitution, which provides for the economic, social and cultural rights of 
different communities in the country, the State has created agencies with mandates to bring about 
conditions - economic, social and political - that provide an enabling environment for the 
defence of human rights.  Failures on the part of these agencies to perform their functions 
adequately have placed defenders at risk.  Lack of resources and failure to resolve disputes 
expeditiously, including because of bureaucratic delays, are only part of the problem. 
</p>
<p>64. In her interviews with some of these agencies, the Special Representative detected a 
serious lack of commitment to their responsibilities, and a lack of understanding of how their 
failure affects the security of human rights defenders.  NGOs and activists drew her attention to 
the performance of INCRA and IBAMA, two agencies with critical roles in land- and 
environment-related issues.  In numerous cases, denunciations of environmental damage by 
corporate interests and illegal land grabbing by socially powerful entities received no response 
from these agencies.  Where investigations are initiated, they seldom yield any results or any 
measures to deter the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>65. The failure of these agencies to respond to complaints and to take proactive measures 
against illegal actions creates a situation in which defenders are harmed.  The Special 
Representative recalls the report of the External Commission of the Senate set up to monitor the 
Stang case which denounced the &#8220;continued neglect&#8221; with which State authorities handled 
complaints of invasions and violence against settlers of INCRA-created projects in Anapu, and 
of illegal deforestation of areas assigned to INCRA projects in 2003. 
</p><p>66. Land rights activists underlined that delays in the implementation of declared policies 
perpetuate land conflicts and directly affect their security.  It was reported that INCRA was 
unable to ensure timely surveys of land for plotting, registration, demarcation and repossession 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  As reported by the Government in its comments on the present report. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>needed to legalize settlement project areas.  Expropriation of property by INCRA, in particular, 
only occurs when there is popular pressure through occupation of land by the landless.  This 
compelled social movements to use collective action to pressure institutions to take action.  This 
compulsion, at times, has created situations that are volatile and dangerous for defenders. 
</p>
<p>67. In a few instances, defenders reported that some representatives of institutions in charge 
of dealing with human rights, notably IBAMA and FUNAI, have actually obstructed their work.  
Allegations were made before the Special Representative that members of IBAMA were 
involved in illegal timber operations.  It was alleged that their collusion had allowed illegal 
entities not only to violate human rights of the rural population, but had also been a cause of 
violence against defenders.  In Bahia State, NGOs working with the Kiriri community and 
leaders of the community reported that the FUNAI administrator in the area was restricting the 
freedom of movement of community members by forcing them to get travel authorizations to 
leave the reservation to sell their arts and crafts and had barred NGOs from entering the 
reservation.  He is also reported to have made threats against a leader who was reporting 
violations to human rights NGOs. 
</p>
<p>68. Human rights defenders involved in the protection of the rights of indigenous people are 
also facing a similar situation.  The Constitution provided for the demarcation of land historically 
owned by the indigenous communities by 1993.  The failure of FUNAI, the federal agency 
responsible for this task, to complete this process and its controversial decisions regarding the 
exclusion of vast areas of land from its list has also fomented social conflict.  Several leaders of 
indigenous communities have been killed or threatened with harm because of their struggle to 
secure their social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>69. Another problem that contributes to delays in the resolution of social conflicts is the lack 
of coordinated effort and development of a common understanding on the protection of rights 
amongst federal and state institutions in charge of implementing laws and policies.  Even judicial 
action has, in many instances, contradicted the declared social policy of the State and has treated 
human rights activity as violations of law. 
</p>
<p>70. Defenders supporting or participating in the movement against dams are also made 
vulnerable because of the weaknesses of laws and policy or delays in their implementation.  
Disputes over expropriation of land for construction of dams and compensation for those 
affected dominate areas in which such projects are being undertaken.  In the absence of an 
adequate legal framework and clear State guidelines, entitlements and compensation are 
determined on an ad hoc basis.  Grievances emanating from this arbitrary system have led to 
occupation of construction sites by those affected and other forms of public collective action.  
</p>
<p>71. While organizations such as MAB are permitted to attend policy meetings and 
consultations held by the Ministry of Mine and Energy on the situation of those affected by 
dams, defenders feel that this participation is not very meaningful as their recommendations are 
not given sufficient consideration by the authorities.  Defenders noted however that avenues for 
dialogue had been opened with the current Administration and acknowledged that &#8220;negotiation 
tables&#8221; had been set up as of 2003 which had brought some transparency to the process of 
creating new power plants.  Nevertheless, they insisted that while dialogue does exist it has not </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>brought about concrete solutions as the Government does not offer protection for rights holders 
against private companies.  Any mediating role that Government played was only formal and did 
not oblige the private companies involved to abide by any rules. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Persistent impunity 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Representative is encouraged by the steps undertaken by the Government to 
address the issue of impunity for violence against human rights defenders.  In particular, she 
welcomes the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators in the killing of Sister Dorothy.  
She nevertheless remains concerned that in many other similar incidents impunity persists.  
In her meeting with the Ministry of Justice, the Minister conceded that so far only certain 
&#8220;high-visibility&#8221; cases have benefited from effective and speedy processes, while for the 
majority the system remains slow.  It is true that many of the cases involving defenders suffer 
due to the weaknesses of the criminal justice process and the judicial system on the whole.<b>6</b>  
Nevertheless, there are specific trends that are more visible in cases concerning defenders. 
</p>
<p>73. In many cases, investigations have not been carried out by the police or were never 
concluded.  A number of prosecutors, judges and representatives of the Minist&#233;rio P&#250;blico 
confirmed that in many cases lack of appropriate investigation or evidence has made prosecution 
impossible.  Often, the police have not executed arrest warrants issued against perpetrators, in 
particular influential landowners and their hired gunmen.  Consequently, only a few perpetrators 
have ever been tried or sentenced for harming human defenders. 
</p>
<p>74. In an attempt to deal with impunity, defenders have been asking for the implementation 
of the constitutional amendment allowing for human rights-related crimes to become federal 
crimes and for such crimes to be transferred from the state to the federal judiciary.  In the case of 
the murder of Sister Dorothy, the Supreme Court denied civil society pleas for the case to be 
tried in a federal court.  It was, however, suggested to the Special Representative that the Federal 
Government was able to use the recent constitutional amendment as leverage in this case to 
ensure that the state court would not allow impunity to prevail. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Discrediting human rights defenders and their activities 
</b></p>
<p>75. It is generally acknowledged that human rights defenders working on civil and political 
rights have received recognition for their positive contribution to democracy and the rule of law.  
Many of them have been honoured with prestigious awards and some have even gained political 
prominence and have been elected to public offices.  On the other hand, human rights defenders, 
particularly social activists, striving to protect and promote economic, social and cultural rights 
still face hostility from various sections of the society as well as the State.  Defenders believe 
that this is largely due to their challenges to powerful social and economic interests in order to 
eliminate social and economic inequities and injustice. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  The Special Representative refers to the assessment regarding impunity made by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers in his report on his visit to Brazil 
(E/CN.4/2005/60/Add.3). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Representative noticed that in a number of states the security forces 
perceived human rights defenders and social activists as troublemakers.  There is a tendency to 
equate poverty with crime and to use public fear of crime to depict human rights defenders as 
obstacles to the maintenance of public order.  This is particularly true in the case of defenders 
advocating the rights of the landless and the homeless and participating in public action to resist 
or protest violation of their rights. 
</p>
<p>77. In a number of cases leaders of movements or NGOs have been the object of vilification 
campaigns aimed at discrediting their work.  In S&#227;o Paulo, defenders reported that the Governor 
had publicly accused the National Movement for Human Rights and AMAR of causing riots in 
FEBEM, the detention centre for adolescents in S&#227;o Paulo. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>78. Many defenders and some journalists who met with the Special Representative 
maintained that the mainstream media tends to promote views sympathetic to big businesses, 
large estate owners and conservative segments of society.  Human rights issues rarely receive 
attention in the media.  When their activities receive coverage, defenders are usually portrayed in 
an unfavourable light.  In particular, social action for economic and social rights, even when it is 
peaceful, generally elicits a negative reaction from the media.  The Special Representative was 
told that defenders from organizations such as MST working for land rights are often described 
as &#8220;criminals&#8221;, &#8220;guerillas&#8221; or &#8220;anarchists&#8221;, while members of MAB working for the rights of 
those affected by dams have been described as &#8220;hooligans&#8221; by some sections of the media.  Even 
defenders working on civil and political rights have been described as &#8220;friends of criminals&#8221;, 
mostly because of their advocacy against the death penalty and for due process and the rule of 
law.  
</p>
<p>79. The media play a crucial role in depicting the work of human rights defenders and their 
struggles for justice.  Public perceptions of defenders can be easily influenced by the tone of the 
media.  Public support for human rights defenders and recognition of the value and legitimacy of 
their work are crucial for their safety.  Perceptions created by the media are, therefore, of 
significance to the protection of human rights defenders.  The State can play a role in building 
the correct image of human rights defenders and is able to influence the role of the media in this 
respect.  If media reports continue to depict defenders as a threat to social order rather than as 
actors in the creation of conditions to defuse social conflict, it will become more difficult to 
ensure protection of their lives and physical integrity.  
</p>
<p><b>E.  The role of the parliament and state legislators 
</b></p>
<p>80. While parliamentary committees have played a role in investigating human rights abuses 
and recommending measures to address issues raised in such investigations, parliament and state 
legislative assemblies have by and large been slow to adopt laws to strengthen the human rights 
framework.  A draft bill seeking to amend the law establishing the Programme for the Protection 
of Victims and Witnesses (PROVITA) to add provisions and a protocol for the special protection 
of human rights defenders was deemed to be unconstitutional by the Chamber of Deputies and 
has been stalled in the parliament since 2004.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>81. The fate of a report of the mixed Parliamentary Investigative Commission formed by the 
Human Rights Commission of the Federal Parliament illustrates the negative effects of political 
polarization on efforts to address human rights issues.  After extensive investigation for two 
years, the Commission concluded that the root causes of rural violence are linked to ownership 
of land and the absence of land reform.  The report was rejected and an alternative report was 
adopted, due to the powerful influence of large estate owners in the Congress.  This alternative 
report recommended the adoption of two laws which defined land occupation as an &#8220;act of 
terrorism&#8221;.  It also recommended the indictment of five MST leaders for the crimes of 
&#8220;formation of criminal gangs&#8221;, &#8220;extortion&#8221; and other felonies.  Similar difficulties were 
encountered by the head of the mixed commission on summary execution whose report faced 
great difficulties before being approved due to opposition to its findings by some members of 
parliament. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  The role of the judiciary 
</b>82. Human rights defenders have little faith in the judiciary and believe that, so far, it has not 
played any significant role in promoting social justice or protecting defenders from abuse and 
violence.  In their opinion, the judiciary has by and large perpetuated the status quo and has not 
used its constitutional powers with consistency to enforce human rights guarantees.  The 
institution, in general, has been too conservative in its pronouncements on human rights, in 
particular social and economic rights.  Judicial decisions have, therefore, not contributed towards 
any change in the social environment or inspired any confidence in the objective enforcement of 
State accountability through the judicial system. 
83. Many of the defenders felt that the judicial decisions frequently reflect a bias against 
defenders, and that the judiciary views the activities of defenders as endangering public order 
and, thus, needing to be restrained.  Some defenders cited instances when judges have publicly 
stigmatized defenders and their activities, particularly in the context of collective action for 
social rights.  One such example is a public comment by a judge to the effect that letting the 
landless loose is like sowing the seeds of evil in society. 
</p>
<p>84. The negative perception of the role of the judiciary in the context of human rights 
defenders has largely emerged from judicial orders that, according to these defenders, impede 
social action.  They believe, for instance, that orders for the eviction of the landless and the 
homeless and those authorizing the use of force against peaceful assemblies are issued with 
undue promptness.  In this respect, the defenders expressed the grievance that courts tend to 
endorse the use of force in eviction operations as a first resort and that no space is permitted for 
negotiating peaceful solutions to social claims and conflicts. 
</p>
<p>85. Defenders recounted their experiences in attempting to use the judicial system to promote 
or protect human rights.  They felt that in their overall experience they had found that they could 
not depend on the judicial process to attain justice or to break the cycle of impunity for human 
rights violations.  Many defenders engaged in this activity said that they had been able to use the 
regional human rights system more successfully than the judicial system at the federal or the 
state level. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>86. The reports that the Special Representative received in this context indicate that there are 
very few proactive initiatives by the judiciary to enforce the rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution.  In the case of the rights to land and housing in particular, there seems to be a gap 
in the understanding of these provisions between those struggling to secure these rights and the 
judiciary responsible for applying them in cases that come before the courts.  This has created 
contradictions between the social perception of rights and the legal application of constitutional 
provisions. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Representative raised this issue in her meeting with judges of the Supreme 
Court.  Their response showed that the higher judiciary fully appreciates the potential of the 
constitutional provisions on human rights and fundamental freedoms to ease social conflict and 
enforce accountability of State structures for violations of these rights.  Nevertheless, the Special 
Representative found that this understanding and appreciation was not universal amongst the 
judges that she met in the states that she visited. 
</p><p>88. She was, however, encouraged by the fact that there is a realization of the existence of 
this contradiction by some within the federal and state governments.  In his meeting with the 
Special Representative, the Minister of Justice acknowledged that the justice system remains 
weighted in favour of the social status quo.  This has resulted in biases within the lower tiers of 
the judiciary that affect the realization of rights in the proper spirit of the Constitution.  He 
informed the Special Representative that the Federal Government was committed to addressing 
these issues and that initiatives to reform the judiciary had started at the federal level.  He noted 
that some states had already taken initiatives to address these issues and have set up mechanisms 
to monitor the work of local judges. 
89. The Special Representative acknowledges that, in some cases, the judiciary has taken 
initiatives, particularly for ending impunity for human rights violations.  She notes with 
appreciation efforts of the judiciary in the State of Par&#225; to develop a system to periodically 
review the status of the 578 cases of killings of rural workers recorded and reported by civil 
society organizations.  A working group has also been set up to monitor progress in the 
prosecution of these cases.  She also welcomes the circular issued by the presiding judge to all 
state local courts asking them to monitor and report on such cases regularly.  She believes that 
this is a positive first step towards addressing the issue of impunity for abuses against defenders.  
</p>
<p><b>G.  Disparity in commitment between the federal and state levels 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Representative believes that a more uniform commitment and 
complementary efforts by the federal and state Governments could mitigate many of the 
concerns regarding the situation of human rights defenders in Brazil.  The civil society is 
generally of the opinion that state authorities have demonstrated less sensitivity to the protection 
of human rights defenders and given far less consideration to resolving the issues concerning 
their security.  Because of the strong federal system, the uneven level of commitment has diluted 
the local-level impact and the effectiveness of policies and programmes initiated by the Federal 
Government.  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Representative observed that in some of the states she visited the authorities 
were far less enthusiastic about improving the situation of human rights defenders compared to 
the responses she received from the Federal Government.  In their discussions with her, </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>authorities from the State Secretariat for Security in one state consistently denied that there 
were any incidents affecting the work or safety of human rights defenders, even though 
well-documented cases had been brought to their attention.  In another state, the chief of security 
denied the existence of any violations against defenders and declared that he was not aware of &#8220;a 
single case of police misconduct against defenders in the state&#8221;.  The Chief of Military Police in 
Pernambuco, when confronted with reports of incidents involving police action against defenders 
dismissed any concerns in this regard with the comment that during the year &#8220;more policemen 
were killed by criminals than criminals by the police&#8221;.  This comment seemed to support the 
allegation of some defenders that in a number of states the security forces perceive human rights 
defenders and social activists as troublemakers or criminals. 
</p>
<p>92. With the exception of legislators who have made efforts to promote the protection of 
human rights defenders, the state legislative assemblies are not only uninterested, but sometimes 
also hostile towards human rights initiatives.  In Bahia, several members of the State Human 
Rights Committee of the House of Representatives reported that the Committee has been 
paralyzed because of a lack of a quorum due to the opposition of some representatives to its 
human rights work. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Government of Brazil has a good understanding of the issues relevant to the 
protection of human rights defenders, and is making efforts to progressively overcome the 
hurdles in improving the environment for their effective functioning and for their protection.  
The comprehensive policies and initiatives on human rights adopted by the government in its 
efforts for better implementation of the strong legal framework provided by the Constitution for 
the protection of human rights is a significant part of this effort. 
</p>
<p>94. The work of human rights defenders is generally respected within the governmental 
structures and the authorities engage with the civil society and seek its participation and 
involvement in the design and implementation of human rights initiatives.  
</p>
<p>95. However, despite government initiatives and the efforts of an active and experienced civil 
society, serious concerns regarding the situation of human rights defenders persist because of a 
wide gap between the declared policy and its implementation and between the creation of 
mechanisms and their effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>96. In their efforts to attain social, economic and cultural rights, in seeking to expose human 
rights violations and to end impunity for these violations and in resisting discrimination or 
marginalization human rights defenders are experiencing serious harm.  Their right to life, liberty 
and physical security continues to be threatened.  They are subjected to unfair and malicious 
prosecution, harassment and vilification as retaliatory action by state as well as by powerful and 
influential non-state entities.  Leaders and supporters of social movements, in particular, have 
suffered and are placed at serious risk for activities in defence of human rights.  Even 
government functionaries performing their tasks have not been safe and the Special 
Representative received reports of labour inspectors, as well as civil servants who were targeted. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>97. The damage that incidents of violence and threats have caused to the security of human 
rights defenders, many of whom have had to flee their homes and have been living away from 
their families for a long time, should not be underestimated.  Such a situation has perpetuated a 
climate of distrust and lack of faith in existing mechanisms and initiatives for human rights. 
</p>
<p>98. While the Special Representative does not discount allegations made by some state 
governments of violence accompanying collective action in some instances, she has noted, with 
grave concern, that peaceful public action for defence of human rights has frequently been met 
with disproportionate use of force.  She is particularly concerned at the use of &#8220;non-lethal 
weapons&#8221; like rubber bullets by security forces in their operations during such events.  She has 
also expressed concern that the procedures that streamline authorization and monitoring of such 
use are questionable.  She has also noted the serious allegations of violence against defenders 
and abuse of powers by the State Military Police. 
</p>
<p>99. Much of the violence against defenders is rooted in conflicts over land and environmental 
protection.  The social movements that have emerged to resist the violation of economic, social 
and cultural rights are an asset for Brazilian democracy.  The role of human rights defenders in 
strengthening these movements deserves better projection by the media and stronger political 
support by the State. 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Representative has concluded that more uniformity of commitment and 
complementary efforts to implement human rights policies by the Federal and State governments 
could remove many of the hurdles in the way of progress in creating an enabling environment for 
human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>With a view to address the serious problem of criminalization of human rights 
activity, it is recommended that the Special Secretariat for Human Rights and the Federal 
Minist&#233;rio P&#250;blico make joint efforts to collect and analyse the cases brought against 
human rights defenders in order to propose legislation or policy guidelines to prevent 
prosecution of defenders for carrying out activities in defence of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The State must play a more proactive role in mediation of social conflict and in 
giving legitimacy to interventions by human rights defenders to promote and protect 
economic, social and cultural rights.  In particular defenders must not be left isolated in 
their struggle for or support of social justice against powerful or influential social entities 
and economic interests.  In this regard the Government must consider creating 
mechanisms to oversee the performance of agencies such as INCRA, IBAMA and FUNAI.  
This would be a step towards addressing the serious issue of delays in the implementation 
of policies or completion of processes that relate to allocation or restoration of land. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Federal Government must negotiate with state governments to broaden the 
programme established for the protection of human rights defenders.  Guidelines for 
selection and training of the police for this programme should be drawn and followed 
uniformly in the country.  There must be a wider awareness of the United Nations 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders amongst all Federal and state agencies involved in </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/37/Add.2 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>this programme.  However, physical protection can only be a temporary measure and 
faster progress must be achieved in alleviating social, political and economic conditions 
that place defenders at greater risk.</b> 
</p>
<p>104.<b> The Government may consider convening a convention of the leaders of social 
movements, representatives of human rights organizations, and other interested and 
relevant actors to develop a National Plan of Action for the protection of human rights 
defenders and for facilitation of their activities. </b> 
</p>
<p>105.<b> The review of existing mechanisms for the monitoring and accountability of state 
security apparatus, particularly the state military police, is strongly recommended.  There 
is a general lack of confidence in the competence, vigilance and independence of the 
existing mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> There is a need for a special mechanism to receive complaints and investigate 
violations of the rights of defenders, including inquiry into conduct of law enforcement 
agencies in policing public gatherings.  The Special Secretariat for Human Rights could 
explore the appropriate structure for such a mechanism.  
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The National Coordinating Council for Human Rights Defenders may consider 
making periodical public announcement of its proposals, their adoption by the concerned 
agencies in the Federal and state governments, the progress in and results achieved by the 
initiatives already underway.  This would enhance the transparency of such a coordinating 
body and also allow the civil society and the public in general to remain informed 
regarding the situation of human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> Finally, the Special Representative urges the Government to ensure adequate 
resources for the initiatives it has already taken for the protection of defenders.
