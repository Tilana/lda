Q2 Report | For the period ended June 30, 2016
Encana delivers significant efficiency improvements with strong second quarter results
Company is positioned for growth and to strengthen balance sheet
Calgary, Alberta (July 21, 2016) TSX, NYSE: ECA
Encana’s  relentless  focus  on  execution  excellence  during  the  second  quarter  has  driven  another  step  change  in  efficiency
improvements and returns. As a result, the company has lowered cash costs, such as transportation, processing and operating
expenses,  and  improved  capital  efficiency  in  its  updated  2016  guidance.  Driven  by  efficiency  improvements,  Encana  is  also
raising its 2016 production guidance. The company expects to use proceeds from announced dispositions to further strengthen its
balance sheet and increase its capital investment into high return opportunities in its core four assets.
Highlights from the quarter include:
●   cash flow up over 75 percent from the previous quarter to $182 million or $0.21 per share
●   operating earnings of $89 million or $0.10 per share, up from a first quarter operating loss of $130 million or $0.15 per
share
●   95 percent of capital invested in high return wells in the core four assets; the Permian, Eagle Ford, Duvernay and Montney
●   maintained scale in the core four assets which delivered 268,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), representing
73 percent of the company’s 368,300 BOE/d total production
●   new Permian 14-well pad peaked at 12,000 BOE/d and is currently producing over 10,000 BOE/d gross
●   announced Gordondale and DJ Basin divestitures are expected to close by the end of July 2016
“We are one of the lowest cost, highest performing operators in each of our core four plays,” said Doug Suttles, Encana President
& CEO. “Our success in capturing significant capital efficiency gains continues to increase our returns. By reinvesting savings and
modestly increasing capital, we are adding 50 percent more drilling and completions activity to our 2016 program.”
“We expect to use proceeds from announced divestitures to strengthen our balance sheet and modestly increase our 2016 capital
program. We anticipate this additional activity will deliver approximately 13,000 BOE/d of production from our core four assets in
the fourth quarter of this year and between 30,000 to 35,000 BOE/d in 2017, of which approximately 75 percent will be liquids,”
added Suttles.
Increased capital efficiency and operational performance in core four assets
Encana  beat  its  2016  drilling  and  completions  cost  reduction  targets  in  the  first  quarter.  In  the  second  quarter  the  company
continued to lower drilling and completion costs across its four core assets and they are now over 30 percent lower compared to
the 2015 full-year average. In addition, Encana delivered new pacesetter performance and has a track record of rapidly converting
pacesetter benchmarks into average costs.
In the Permian, Encana built on its track record as a leading innovator by completing the Midland Basin’s first 14-well pad. This
peaked at 12,000 BOE/d and is currently producing over 10,000 BOE/d gross. In addition, it delivered a 10 percent quarter-over-
quarter reduction in average drilling and completions costs. These costs are 31 percent lower than the full-year 2015 average.
Encana is now the second largest producer in the core of the Midland Basin.
In the Eagle Ford, Encana delivered a new pacesetter well at a cost of $3 million. Average drilling and completions costs in the
second quarter in the play were 38 percent lower than the 2015 average.
Encana Corporation
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
In the Duvernay, Encana delivered a $6.8 million pacesetter well. The second quarter average drilling and completions costs
were approximately 40 percent lower than the company’s 2015 average.
In  the  Montney,  Encana  continued  to  deliver  strong  results  from  its  condensate-rich  wells  in  the  Tower,  Dawson  South  and
Pipestone  areas.  Combined,  these  areas  offer  a  potential  inventory  of  almost  6,000  condensate-rich  well  locations.  Second
quarter average drilling and completions costs were down 14 percent compared to the first quarter and 33 percent lower than the
full-year 2015 average.
Continued cost and capital efficiency and disciplined balance sheet management
Encana continued to capture significant cost savings during the second quarter. As a result, the company is lowering its guidance
for  transportation,  processing  and  operating  costs  by  $100  million  for  the  year.  Encana  expects  the  full-year  benefit  of  these
savings will be even greater in 2017.
Encana is reinvesting savings from continued capital efficiency improvements and expects to use a portion of proceeds from its
Gordondale and DJ Basin divestitures to increase its 2016 capital program by $200 million. As a result, after adjusting for the
Gordondale  divestiture,  the  company  is  increasing  its  2016  production  guidance  and  expects  fourth  quarter  exit  production
decline from its core four assets to be cut from 10 percent to five percent. Encana’s Gordondale and DJ Basin divestitures are
expected to close by the end of July delivering proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion.
Second quarter results
Encana’s core four assets contributed 268,300 BOE/d or approximately 73 percent of total second quarter production of 368,300
BOE/d. Total liquids production averaged 132,000 barrels per day (bbls/d) and natural gas production averaged 1.4 billion cubic
feet per day (Bcf/d).
Encana generated second quarter cash flow of $182 million or $0.21 per share, compared to $181 million or $0.22 per share in
the  second  quarter  of  2015.  The  company  recorded  second  quarter  operating  earnings  of  $89  million  or  $0.10  per  share
compared to an operating loss of $167 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter net loss of
$601 million, or $0.71 per share, is largely attributable to non-cash items such as after-tax ceiling test impairments and an after-tax
unrealized hedging loss.
Encana’s updated guidance, which reflects asset sales, cost reductions, increased capital investment and production in the core
four  assets,  can  be  downloaded

Encana Corporation
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Encana Corporation
Encana is a leading North American energy producer that is focused on developing its strong portfolio of resource plays, held
directly  and  indirectly  through  its  subsidiaries,  producing  natural  gas,  oil  and  natural  gas  liquids  (NGLs).  By  partnering  with
employees,  community  organizations  and  other  businesses,  Encana  contributes  to  the  strength  and  sustainability  of  the
communities where it operates. Encana common shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol
ECA.
Important Information
Encana reports in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Production, sales and reserves estimates are reported on an after-royalties
basis, unless otherwise noted. Per share amounts for cash flow and earnings are on a diluted basis. The term liquids is used to
represent  oil,  NGLs  and  condensate.  The  term  liquids  rich  is  used  to  represent  natural  gas  streams  with  associated  liquids
volumes. Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, reference to Encana or to the company includes reference
to subsidiaries of and partnership interests held by Encana Corporation and its subsidiaries.
NOTE 1: Non-GAAP measures
This news release contains references to non-GAAP measures as follows:
●   Cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from operating activities excluding net change in other assets and
liabilities, net change in non-cash working capital and cash tax on sale of assets.
●   Operating earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP measure defined as net earnings (loss) excluding non-recurring or non-cash
items  that  management  believes  reduces  the  comparability  of  the  company’s  financial  performance  between  periods.
These  after-tax  items  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  unrealized  hedging  gains/losses,  impairments,  restructuring
charges,  non-operating  foreign  exchange  gains/losses,  gains/losses  on  divestitures,  gains  on  debt  retirement,  income
taxes  related  to  divestitures  and  adjustments  to  normalize  the  effect  of  income  taxes  calculated  using  the  estimated
annual effective income tax rate.
These  measures  have  been  described  and  presented  in  this  news  release  in  order  to  provide  shareholders  and  potential
investors with additional information regarding Encana’s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.
ADVISORY REGARDING OIL AND GAS INFORMATION - The conversion of natural gas volumes to barrels of oil equivalent
(“BOE”)  is  on  the  basis  of  six  thousand  cubic  feet  to  one  barrel.  BOE  is  based  on  a  generic  energy  equivalency  conversion
method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent economic value equivalency at the wellhead. Readers are
cautioned that BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.
Pacesetter well costs for a particular play are a composite of the best drilling performance and best completions performance
wells  in  the  current  quarter  in  such  play  and  are  presented  for  comparison  purposes.  Drilling  and  completions  costs  in  the
Permian, Eagle Ford, Duvernay and Montney have been normalized based on lateral lengths of 7,500 feet, 5,000 feet, 8,200 feet
and 9,000 feet, respectively.
This  news  release  discloses  estimated  well  locations,  which  include  proved,  probable,  contingent  and  unbooked  locations.
These estimates are prepared internally based on Encana’s prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells
that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review. Approximately 20 percent of all locations in the
Montney are booked as either reserves or resources, as prepared by independent qualified reserves evaluators using forecast
prices and costs as of December 31, 2015. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources and have been
identified by management as an estimation of Encana’s multi-year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic,
seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that Encana will drill all unbooked locations and
if  drilled  there  is  no  certainty  that  such  locations  will  result  in  additional  oil  and  gas  reserves,  resources  or  production.  The
locations on which Encana will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the
availability  of  capital,  regulatory  and  partner  approvals,  seasonal  restrictions,  equipment  and  personnel,  oil  and  natural  gas
prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained, production rate
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Encana Corporation
recovery, transportation constraints and other factors. While certain of the unbooked locations have been de-risked by drilling
existing wells in relative close proximity to such locations, many of other unbooked locations are farther away from existing wells
where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether
wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional proved or
probable reserves, resources or production.
ADVISORY  REGARDING  FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS  -  This  news  release  contains  certain  forward-looking
statements or information (collectively, “FLS”) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation. FLS include: expectation of
meeting or exceeding the targets in Encana’s 2016 corporate guidance, including its cost savings target; expected proceeds from
divestitures, expectation that the closing conditions and regulatory approvals will be satisfied, the timing of closing thereof and the
use of proceeds therefrom, including expected reduction to debt and increase in capital investment and drilling and completions
activity; allocation of capital and expected returns; well performance and costs relative to peers and within plays; future growth in
cash  flow  and  production,  including  from  its  core  four  assets  and  anticipated  commodity  mix;  pacesetting  operational  metrics
being  indicative  of  average  future  well  performance  and  costs;  anticipated  capital  and  cost  efficiencies,  including  drilling  and
completion,  operating,  corporate,  transportation  and  processing  costs,  and  sustainability  thereof;  estimated  well  locations;
expected  offset  to  production  reduced  through  divestiture;  anticipated  production  and  decline  rate;  reductions  to  cash  outlay;
anticipated  hedging  and  outcomes  of  risk  management  program,  including  amount  of  hedged  production;  the  expectation  to
continue to strengthen Encana’s balance sheet and create additional financial flexibility; anticipated dividends; and future filings
and the form thereof.
Readers  are  cautioned  against  unduly  relying  on  FLS  which,  by  their  nature,  involve  numerous  assumptions,  risks  and
uncertainties  that  may  cause  such  statements  not  to  occur,  or  for  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  or  implied.
These  assumptions  include:  assumptions  contained  in  Encana’s  2016  corporate  guidance  and  in  this  news  release;  data
contained in key modeling statistics; availability of attractive hedges and enforceability of risk management program; results from
innovations; expectation that counterparties will fulfill their obligations under gathering, midstream and marketing agreements;
access to transportation and processing facilities where Encana operates; effectiveness of Encana’s resource play hub model to
drive productivity and efficiencies; enforceability of transaction agreements and the ability of the parties to such transactions to
satisfy closing conditions and regulatory approvals; the value of adjustments to the expected proceeds from the transactions; and
expectations and projections made in light of, and generally consistent with, Encana’s historical experience and its perception of
historical trends, including with respect to the pace of technological development, the benefits achieved and general industry
expectations.
Risks and uncertainties that may affect these business outcomes include: risks inherent to closing announced divestitures on a
timely basis or at all and adjustments that may reduce the expected proceeds and value to Encana; commodity price volatility;
timing  and  costs  of  well,  facilities  and  pipeline  construction;  ability  to  secure  adequate  product  transportation  and  potential
pipeline curtailments; business interruption and casualty losses or unexpected technical difficulties; counterparty and credit risk;
fluctuations in currency and interest rates; risk and effect of a downgrade in credit rating, including below an investment-grade
credit rating, and its impact on access to capital markets and other sources of liquidity; variability and discretion of Encana’s
Board to declare and pay dividends, if any; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet Encana’s obligations; failure to
achieve  anticipated  results  from  cost  and  efficiency  initiatives;  risks  inherent  in  marketing  operations;  risks  associated  with
technology; Encana’s ability to acquire or find additional reserves; imprecision of reserves estimates and estimates of recoverable
quantities  of  natural  gas  and  liquids  from  resource  plays  and  other  sources  not  currently  classified  as  proved,  probable  or
possible  reserves  or  economic  contingent  resources,  including  future  net  revenue  estimates;  changes  in  or  interpretation  of
royalty, tax, environmental, greenhouse gas, carbon, accounting and other laws or regulations; risks associated with existing and
potential future lawsuits and regulatory actions made against Encana; risks associated with past and future divestitures of certain
assets or other transactions or receive amounts contemplated under the transaction agreements (such transactions may include
third-party capital investments, farm-outs or partnerships, which Encana may refer to from time to time as “partnerships” or “joint
ventures” and the funds received in respect thereof
Encana Corporation
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
which Encana may refer to from time to time as “proceeds”, “deferred purchase price” and/or “carry capital”, regardless of the legal
form) as a result of various conditions not being met; and other risks and uncertainties impacting Encana’s business, as described
in its most recent MD&A, financial statements, Annual Information Form and Form 40-F, as filed on SEDAR and EDGAR.
Although  Encana  believes  the  expectations  represented  by  such  FLS  are  reasonable,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  such
expectations will prove to be correct. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions, risks and uncertainties referenced above are
not  exhaustive.  FLS  are  made  as  of  the  date  of  this  news  release  and,  except  as  required  by  law,  Encana  undertakes  no
obligation  to  update  publicly  or  revise  any  FLS.  The  FLS  contained  in  this  news  release  are  expressly  qualified  by  these
cautionary statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for Encana Corporation (“Encana” or the “Company”) should be read with
the unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended June 30, 2016 (“Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements”), as well as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and MD&A for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and comparative information have been prepared in accordance with
United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and in U.S. dollars, except where another currency
has been indicated. References to C$ are to Canadian dollars. Encana’s financial results are consolidated in Canadian dollars;
however, the Company has adopted the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency to facilitate a more direct comparison to other North
American oil and gas companies. Production volumes are presented on an after royalties basis consistent with U.S. oil and gas
reporting standards. The term “liquids” is used to represent oil, natural gas liquids (“NGLs” or “NGL”) and condensate. The term
“liquids rich” is used to represent natural gas streams with associated liquids volumes. This document is dated July 20, 2016.
For convenience, references in this document to “Encana”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our” and “its” may, where applicable, refer
only  to  or  include  any  relevant  direct  and  indirect  subsidiary  corporations  and  partnerships  (“Subsidiaries”)  of  Encana
Corporation, and the assets, activities and initiatives of such Subsidiaries.
Certain  measures  in  this  document  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning  as  prescribed  by  U.S.  GAAP  and,  therefore,  are
considered non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are commonly used in the oil and gas industry and by Encana to provide
shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the Company’s liquidity and its ability to generate funds
to  finance  its  operations.  Non-GAAP  measures  include:  Cash  Flow;  Free  Cash  Flow;  Operating  Earnings  (Loss);  Upstream
Operating  Cash  Flow,  excluding  Hedging;  Operating  Netback;  Debt  to  Debt  Adjusted  Cash  Flow;  and  Debt  to  Adjusted
Capitalization. Further information regarding these measures can be found in the Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD&A,
including  reconciliations  of  Cash  from  Operating  Activities  to  Cash  Flow  and  Free  Cash  Flow,  and  of  Net  Earnings  (Loss)
Attributable to Common Shareholders to Operating Earnings (Loss).
The  following  volumetric  measures  may  be  abbreviated  throughout  this  MD&A:  thousand  cubic  feet  (“Mcf”);  million  cubic  feet
(“MMcf”) per day (“MMcf/d”); barrel (“bbl”); thousand barrels (“Mbbls”) per day (“Mbbls/d”); barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) per day
(“BOE/d”); thousand barrels of oil equivalent (“MBOE”) per day (“MBOE/d”); million British thermal units (“MMBtu”).

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Encana’s Strategic Objectives
Encana  is  a  leading  North  American  energy  producer  that  is  focused  on  developing  its  strong  portfolio  of  resource  plays
producing natural gas, oil and NGLs. Encana is committed to growing long-term shareholder value through a disciplined focus on
generating profitable growth. The Company is pursuing the key business objectives of balancing its commodity portfolio, focusing
capital investments in a limited number of core, high return and scalable projects, maintaining portfolio flexibility to respond to
changing market conditions, maximizing profitability through operating efficiencies, reducing costs and preserving balance sheet
strength.
Encana continually strives to improve operating efficiencies, foster technological innovation and lower its cost structures, while
reducing its environmental footprint through play optimization. The Company’s resource play hub model utilizes highly integrated
production facilities to develop resources by drilling multiple wells from central pad sites. Capital and operating efficiencies are
achieved  through  repeatable  operations,  optimizing  equipment  and  processes  and  by  applying  continuous  improvement
techniques.
Encana  hedges  a  portion  of  its  expected  natural  gas,  oil  and  NGLs  production  volumes.  The  Company’s  hedging  program
reduces volatility and helps sustain Cash Flow and Operating Netbacks during periods of lower prices. Further information on the
Company’s commodity price positions as at June 30, 2016 can be found in the Results Overview section of this MD&A and in
Note 19 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additional  information  on  expected  results  can  be  found  in  Encana’s  Corporate  Guidance  on  the  Company’s  website
www.encana.com.
Encana’s Business
Reportable Segments
Encana’s reportable segments are determined based on the Company’s operations and geographic locations as follows:
●   Canadian Operations includes the exploration for, development of, and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs and other
related activities within Canada. Plays in Canada primarily include: Montney in northern British Columbia and northwest
Alberta;  Duvernay  in  west  central  Alberta;  Wheatland  in  southern  Alberta;  and  Deep  Panuke  located  offshore  Nova
Scotia.
●   USA Operations includes the exploration for, development of, and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs and other
related activities within the U.S. Plays in the U.S. primarily include: Eagle Ford in south Texas; Permian in west Texas; DJ
Basin in northern Colorado; San Juan in northwest New Mexico; and Piceance in northwest Colorado.
●   Market Optimization  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  sale  of  the  Company’s  proprietary  production.  These  results  are
reported in the Canadian and USA Operations. Market optimization activities include third party purchases and sales of
product to provide operational flexibility and cost mitigation for transportation commitments, product type, delivery points
and customer diversification. These activities are reflected in the Market Optimization segment. Market Optimization sells
substantially  all  of  the  Company’s  upstream  production  to  third  party  customers.  Transactions  between  segments  are
based on market values and are eliminated on consolidation. Financial information is presented on an after eliminations
basis within this MD&A.
Corporate  and  Other  mainly  includes  unrealized  gains  or  losses  recorded  on  derivative  financial  instruments.  Once  the
instruments are settled, the realized gains and losses are recorded in the reporting segment to which the derivative instruments
relate.
Comparative figures for 2015 have been updated to present property taxes and certain other levied charges within production,
mineral and other taxes. Further information regarding the reclassification can be found in the Results of Operations section of this
MD&A.

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Core Four Assets
Encana continually reviews and evaluates its strategy and capital investment plans in response to changing market conditions. In
the current commodity price environment, Encana is focused on accelerating growth from high return scalable projects, referred to
as the Core Four Assets, comprising Montney, Duvernay, Eagle Ford and Permian.
●   Montney development is focused on exploiting natural gas and condensate in the deep basin of the Montney formation,
exclusively using horizontal well technology and the application of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. Encana has access to
natural  gas  processing,  gathering  and  compression  capacity  under  contract  with  third  parties,  as  well  as  ownership
interest in additional processing plants in the play.
●   Duvernay development is focused on exploiting shale gas and condensate in the Duvernay formation using horizontal
well technology with pad drilling and the application of the resource play hub model. Encana holds ownership interest in
natural gas processing plants and gathering and compression capacity in the play.
●   Eagle Ford development is focused on exploiting tight oil in the thickest portion of the Eagle Ford shale located in the
Karnes Trough, using horizontal wells drilled with tighter cluster spacing and the resource play hub model to optimize well
and completions design. Encana’s position is located in an area with easy access to oil markets via pipeline or truck. The
Company also has access to natural gas gathering and processing capacity under contract with third parties.
●   Permian development is focused on exploiting oil in the Midland basin, where properties are characterized by multiple
producing  horizons  which  can  accommodate  multiple  completions  per  well  with  the  potential  for  both  vertical  and
horizontal  drilling.  Encana  has  focused  development  using  horizontal  well  technology  and  multi-well  horizontal  pad
drilling to maximize resource recovery and minimize developmental footprint. The play has an established transportation
infrastructure for easy access to markets via pipeline or truck.

satisfaction of normal closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
●   Completed  tender  offers  (collectively,  the  “Tender  Offers”)  announced  in  March  2016  for  certain  of  the  Company’s
outstanding senior notes (collectively, the “Notes”) and accepted for purchase $489 million of Notes. The Company paid
an aggregate amount of $406 million, including accrued and unpaid interest of $6 million and an early tender premium of
$14 million, which resulted in the recognition of a net gain on the early debt retirement of $89 million, before tax.
●   Completed  workforce  reductions  announced  in  February  2016  to  better  align  staffing  levels  and  the  organizational
structure  with  the  Company’s  reduced  capital  spending  program  as  a  result  of  the  current  low  commodity  price
environment. Encana incurred restructuring charges of $31 million and reduced its workforce by approximately 16 percent.

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Factors Impacting Quarterly Net Earnings
Encana’s  quarterly  net  earnings  can  be  significantly  impacted  by  fluctuations  in  commodity  prices,  realized  and  unrealized
hedging  gains  and  losses,  production  volumes,  foreign  exchange  rates,  ceiling  test  impairments  and  gains  or  losses  on
divestitures,  which  are  provided  in  the  Financial  Results  table  and  the  Prices  and  Foreign  Exchange  Rates  table  within  this
MD&A. Quarterly net earnings are also impacted by Encana’s interim income tax expense calculated using the estimated annual
effective income tax rate and a gain on debt retirement as discussed in the Other Operating Results section of this MD&A, as well
as by divestiture transactions as discussed in the Net Capital Investment section of this MD&A.
Ceiling Test Impairments
Under full cost accounting, the carrying amount of Encana’s natural gas and oil properties within each country cost centre is
subject  to  a  ceiling  test  performed  quarterly.  Ceiling  test  impairments  are  recognized  when  the  capitalized  costs,  net  of
accumulated depletion and the related deferred income taxes, exceed the sum of the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from
proved reserves as calculated under Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements using the 12-month average
trailing prices and discounted at 10 percent.
In the second quarter and first six months of 2016, the Company recognized after-tax non-cash ceiling test impairments of $166
million and $361 million, respectively, in the Canadian Operations and $165 million and $577 million, respectively, in the USA
Operations. The non-cash ceiling test impairments primarily resulted from the decline in the 12-month average trailing prices.
Further  declines  in  the  12-month  average  trailing  prices  could  reduce  proved  reserves  volumes  and  values  and  result  in  the
recognition of future ceiling test impairments.
Future  ceiling  test  impairments  are  difficult  to  reasonably  predict  and  depend  on  commodity  prices,  as  well  as  changes  to
reserves estimates, future development costs, capitalized costs and unproved property costs. Proceeds received from upstream
divestitures  are  generally  deducted  from  the  Company’s  capitalized  costs  and  can  reduce  the  likelihood  of  ceiling  test
impairments.
The Company has calculated the estimated effects that certain price changes would have had on its ceiling test impairment for the
six months ended June 30, 2016. Using the average of the price on the first day of each month from the most recent nine months
ended  June  30,  2016  and  commodity  futures  prices  for  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2016,  the  12-month  average
trailing prices for the six months ended June 30, 2016 would have been $42.96 per bbl for WTI, C$53.01 per bbl for Edmonton
Light Sweet, $2.28 per MMBtu for Henry Hub, and C$2.01 per MMBtu for AECO, while holding all other inputs and assumptions
constant.  Based  on  these  estimated  prices,  an  additional  after-tax  ceiling  test  impairment  of  $54  million  for  the  Canadian
Operations would have been recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016. No additional impairment would have been
recognized for the USA Operations. The additional estimated after-tax ceiling test impairment is partly a result of a two percent
decrease in proved undeveloped reserves as certain locations would not be economic at these revised prices. This estimate
strictly  isolates  the  potential  impact  of  commodity  prices  on  the  Company’s  proved  reserves  volumes  and  values.  Due  to
uncertainties in estimating proved reserves, the additional after-tax ceiling test impairment described and resulting implications
may not be indicative of Encana’s future development plans, operating or financial results.
The Company believes that the discounted after-tax future net cash flows from proved reserves required to be used in the ceiling
test calculation are not indicative of the fair market value of Encana’s natural gas and oil properties or the future net cash flows
expected to be generated from such properties. The discounted after-tax future net cash flows do not consider the fair market
value  of  unamortized  unproved  properties,  or  probable  or  possible  natural  gas  and  liquids  reserves.  In  addition,  there  is  no
consideration given to the effect of future changes in commodity prices. Encana manages its business using estimates of reserves
and resources based on forecast prices and costs.

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Three months ended June 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2015
Cash Flow of $182 million increased $1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and was impacted by the following
significant items:
●   Average realized natural gas prices, excluding financial hedges, of $1.35 per Mcf decreased $1.02 per Mcf from 2015
reflecting lower benchmark prices. Lower realized natural gas prices decreased revenues $135 million. Average realized
liquids  prices,  excluding  financial  hedges,  of  $33.67  per  bbl  decreased  $10.16  per  bbl  from  2015  reflecting  lower
benchmark prices. Lower realized liquids prices decreased revenues $117 million.
Average natural gas production volumes of 1,418 MMcf/d decreased 150 MMcf/d from 2015 primarily due to the sale of
●   Average natural gas production volumes of 1,418 MMcf/d decreased 150 MMcf/d from 2015 primarily due to the sale of
Haynesville natural gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2015, natural declines and lower production from Deep Panuke,
partially offset by successful drilling programs in the Core Four Assets. Lower natural gas volumes decreased revenues
$31 million. Average oil and NGL production volumes of 132.0 Mbbls/d increased 4.7 Mbbls/d from 2015 primarily due to
successful drilling programs in the Core Four Assets, partially offset by natural declines. Higher oil and NGL volumes
increased revenues $17 million.
●   Realized financial hedging gains before tax were $129 million compared to $161 million in 2015.
●   Transportation and processing expense decreased $55 million primarily due to the expiration and renegotiation of certain
transportation contracts, the sale of Haynesville natural gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2015, lower activity in Other
Upstream Operations and the lower U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate, partially offset by higher liquids processing fees
in Montney and Duvernay.
●   Operating  expense  decreased  $63  million  primarily  due  to  lower  activity,  cost-saving  initiatives  and  the  sale  of
Haynesville natural gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.
●   Interest expense decreased $171 million primarily due to a one-time payment of $165 million in 2015 associated with the
April 2015 early debt redemptions.
Operating Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 were $89 million compared to an Operating Loss of $167 million in 2015 due to
lower depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”), foreign exchange gains on settlements and changes in deferred tax as
well as the items discussed in the Cash Flow section above.
Net Loss in the second quarter of 2016 was $601 million compared to $1,610 million in 2015 due to the items discussed in the
Cash Flow and Operating Earnings sections above. Net Loss in the second quarter of 2016 was also impacted by after-tax non-
cash ceiling test impairments, an after-tax unrealized hedging loss and an after-tax non-operating foreign exchange loss.

Six months ended June 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2015
Cash Flow of $284 million decreased $392 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and was impacted by the following
significant items:
●   Average realized natural gas prices, excluding financial hedges, of $1.55 per Mcf decreased $1.45 per Mcf from 2015
reflecting lower benchmark prices. Lower realized natural gas prices decreased revenues $404 million. Average realized
liquids  prices,  excluding  financial  hedges,  of  $28.63  per  bbl  decreased  $10.51  per  bbl  from  2015  reflecting  lower
benchmark prices. Lower realized liquids prices decreased revenues $248 million.
●   Average natural gas production volumes of 1,466 MMcf/d decreased 246 MMcf/d from 2015 primarily due to the sale of
Haynesville natural gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2015, natural declines and lower production from Deep Panuke,
partially offset by successful drilling programs in the Core Four Assets. Lower natural gas volumes decreased revenues
$113 million. Average oil and NGL production volumes of 131.4 Mbbls/d increased 7.4 Mbbls/d from 2015 primarily due to
successful drilling programs in the Core Four Assets, partially offset by natural declines. Higher oil and NGL volumes
increased revenues $55 million.
●   Realized financial hedging gains before tax were $300 million compared to $401 million in 2015.
●   Transportation  and  processing  expense  decreased  $124  million  primarily  due  to  the  expiration  and  renegotiation  of
certain  transportation  contracts,  the  sale  of  Haynesville  natural  gas  assets  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  the  lower
U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate and lower activity  in  Other  Upstream  Operations,  partially  offset  by  higher  liquids
processing  fees  in  Montney  and  Duvernay,  and  higher  natural  gas  volumes  and  gathering  and  processing  fees  in
Montney.
●   Operating  expense  decreased  $70  million  primarily  due  to  cost-saving  initiatives,  lower  activity  and  the  sale  of
Haynesville natural gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.
●   Interest expense decreased $193 million primarily due to a one-time payment of $165 million in the second quarter of
2015 associated with the April 2015 early debt redemptions as well as lower interest on debt following these redemptions
and the March 2016 early debt retirement.
Operating  Loss  in  the  first  six  months  of  2016  was  $41  million  compared  to  $148  million  in  2015  primarily  due  to  the  items
discussed in the Cash Flow section above. Operating Loss in first six months of 2016 was also impacted by lower DD&A, foreign
exchange gains on settlements and changes in deferred tax.
Net Loss in the first six months of 2016 was $980 million compared to $3,317 million in 2015 due to the items discussed in the
Cash Flow and Operating Earnings sections above. Net Loss in the first six months of 2016 was also impacted by after-tax non-
cash ceiling test impairments, an after-tax unrealized hedging loss, an after-tax non-operating foreign exchange gain, an after-tax
gain on debt retirement, and changes in deferred tax.

Encana’s financial results are influenced by fluctuations  in  commodity  prices,  price  differentials  and  the  U.S./Canadian  dollar
exchange  rate.  In  the  second  quarter  and  first  six  months  of  2016,  Encana’s  average  realized  natural  gas  price,  excluding
hedging, reflected lower benchmark prices compared to 2015. Hedging activities contributed $0.51 per Mcf to Encana’s average
realized natural gas price in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.48 per Mcf in the first six months of 2016.
In the second quarter and first six months of 2016, Encana’s average realized oil and NGL prices, excluding hedging, reflected
lower benchmark prices compared to 2015. Hedging activities contributed $8.00 per bbl to Encana’s average realized oil price in
the second quarter of 2016 and $11.80 per bbl in the first six months of 2016. Hedging activities contributed $0.05 per bbl to
Encana’s average realized NGL price in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.02 per bbl in the first six months of 2016.

Financial Hedge Agreements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Prepared using U.S. GAAP in US$
As a means of managing commodity price volatility and its impact on cash flows, Encana enters into various financial hedge
agreements. Unsettled derivative financial contracts are recorded at the date of the financial statements based on the fair value of
the contracts. Changes in fair value result from volatility in forward commodity prices and changes in the balance of unsettled
contracts  between  periods.  The  changes  in  fair  value  are  recognized  in  revenue  as  unrealized  hedging  gains  and  losses.
Realized hedging gains and losses are recognized in revenue when derivative financial contracts are settled.

Capital  investment  during  the  first  six  months  of  2016  was  $574  million  compared  to  $1,479  million  in  2015  which  reflects
disciplined capital spending focused on the Core Four Assets and a reduced capital spending program as a result of the current
low commodity price environment.

Natural Gas Production Volumes
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
In the second quarter of 2016, average natural gas production volumes of 1,418 MMcf/d decreased 150 MMcf/d from 2015. In the
first six months of 2016, average natural gas production volumes of 1,466 MMcf/d decreased 246 MMcf/d from 2015.
In  the  second  quarter  and  first  six  months  of  2016,  the  USA  Operations  volumes  were  lower  primarily  due  to  the  sale  of
Haynesville natural gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2015 and natural declines in Piceance, partially offset by successful drilling
programs in Permian and Eagle Ford.
In the second quarter and first six months of 2016, the Canadian Operations volumes were higher primarily due to successful
drilling programs in Montney and Duvernay, partially offset by production declines at Deep Panuke resulting from a higher water
production rate and a longer platform shutdown in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015.
Oil and NGL Production Volumes
In the second quarter of 2016, average oil and NGL production volumes of 132.0 Mbbls/d increased 4.7 Mbbls/d from 2015. In the
first six months of 2016, average oil and NGL production volumes of 131.4 Mbbls/d increased 7.4 Mbbls/d from 2015.
In the second quarter and first six months of 2016, the USA Operations volumes were higher primarily due to successful drilling
programs in Permian and Eagle Ford, partially offset by natural declines in Other Upstream Operations.
In the second quarter and first six months of 2016, the Canadian Operations volumes were higher primarily due to successful
drilling programs in Duvernay and Montney, partially offset by natural declines on Montney oil wells and the sale of certain assets
in Wheatland in January 2015.

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Three months ended June 30, 2016 versus June 30, 2015
Operating Cash Flow of $54 million decreased $117 million and was impacted by the following significant items:
●   Lower natural gas prices reflected lower benchmark prices, which decreased revenues $110 million. Lower liquids prices
reflected lower benchmark prices, which decreased revenues $12 million.
●   Average natural gas production volumes of 971 MMcf/d were higher by 90 MMcf/d, which increased revenues $20 million.
Average oil and NGL production volumes of 30.4 Mbbls/d were higher by 4.1 Mbbls/d, which increased revenues $14
million. Changes in production volumes are discussed in the Production Volumes section of this MD&A.
●   Realized financial hedging gains were $55 million compared to $101 million in 2015.
●   Transportation and processing expense decreased $15 million primarily due to the expiration of certain contracts, lower
activity in Other Upstream Operations and the lower U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate, partially offset by higher liquids
processing fees in Montney and Duvernay.

DD&A decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a lower depletion rate and
the lower U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate, partially offset by higher production volumes. The depletion rate was primarily
impacted by the sales of certain assets in Wheatland and certain natural gas gathering and compression assets in Montney in the
first quarter of 2015, the impact of a ceiling test impairment recognized in the first quarter of 2016 and the lower U.S./Canadian
dollar exchange rate.
In  the  second  quarter  and  first  six  months  of  2016,  the  Canadian  Operations  recognized  before-tax  non-cash  ceiling  test
impairments of $226 million and $493 million, respectively. The impairments primarily resulted from the decline in the 12-month
average trailing prices, which reduced the Canadian Operations proved reserves volumes and values as calculated under SEC
requirements.
The  12-month  average  trailing  prices  used  in  the  ceiling  test  calculations  were  based  on  the  benchmark  prices  below.  The
benchmark prices were adjusted for basis differentials to determine local reference prices, transportation costs and tariffs, heat
content and quality.

impairments  primarily  resulted  from  the  decline  in  the  12-month  average  trailing  prices,  which  reduced  the  USA  Operations
proved reserves volumes and values as calculated under SEC requirements.
The  12-month  average  trailing  prices  used  in  the  ceiling  test  calculations  were  based  on  the  benchmark  prices  below.  The
benchmark prices were adjusted for basis differentials to determine local reference prices, transportation costs and tariffs, heat
content and quality.

Market  Optimization  revenues  and  purchased  product  expense  relate  to  activities  that  provide  operational  flexibility  and  cost
mitigation for transportation commitments, product type, delivery points and customer diversification. Revenues and purchased
product expense decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower commodity prices
offset by higher third-party volumes for optimization activity. Transportation and processing relates to downstream transportation
contracts and commitments resulting from certain property divestitures.

Revenues mainly includes unrealized hedging gains or losses recorded on derivative financial contracts which result from the
volatility  in  forward  curves  of  commodity  prices  and  changes  in  the  balance  of  unsettled  contracts  between  periods.
Transportation and processing expense reflects unrealized financial hedging gains or losses related to the Company’s power
financial  derivative  contracts.  DD&A  includes  amortization  of  corporate  assets,  such  as  computer  equipment,  office  buildings,
furniture and leasehold improvements.
Corporate and Other results include revenues and operating expenses related to the sublease of office space in The Bow office
building.  Further  information  on  The  Bow  office  sublease  can  be  found  in  Note  10  to  the  Interim  Condensed  Consolidated

Administrative expense in the first six months of 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to lower salaries and benefits as a result
of  a  lower  headcount,  a  provision  for  a  well  control  incident  in  the  second  quarter  of  2015,  the  lower  U.S./Canadian  dollar
exchange rate and lower office costs, partially offset by higher long-term compensation costs due to the increase in the Encana
share price in the second quarter of 2016. Administrative expense in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 was impacted
by  the  items  discussed  above  as  well  as  lower  restructuring  costs  of  $16  million.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  Encana
completed workforce reductions announced in February 2016 to better align staffing levels and the organizational structure with
its reduced capital spending program as a result of the current low commodity price environment. Encana incurred restructuring
costs of $31 million during the first six months of 2016 and 2015.
Interest expense in the second quarter of 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to a one-time payment of $165 million in the
second quarter of 2015 associated with the April 2015 early redemptions of the Company’s $700 million 5.90 percent notes due
December 1, 2017 and its C$750 million 5.80 percent medium-term notes due January 18, 2018. Interest expense in the first six
months of 2016 decreased from 2015 primarily due to the one-time payment associated with the redemptions as discussed above
and  lower  interest  on  debt  following  these  redemptions  as  well  as  the  early  retirement  of  long-term  debt  in  March  2016  as
discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A.
Foreign exchange gains and losses result from the impact of the fluctuations in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In the
second quarter of 2016, Encana recorded foreign exchange losses on the translation of U.S. dollar long-term debt issued from
Canada  and  the  translation  of  intercompany  notes  compared  to  foreign  exchange  gains  in  2015,  partially  offset  by  foreign
exchange gains on settlements in the second quarter of 2016 compared to foreign exchange losses in 2015. In the first six months
of 2016, Encana recorded foreign exchange gains on the translation of U.S. dollar long-term debt issued from Canada and on
settlements compared to foreign exchange losses in 2015.
Gain on divestitures in the first six months of 2015 primarily includes a before tax gain on the sale of the Encana Place office
building in Calgary.
Other in the first six months of 2016 primarily includes a before tax gain of $89 million on the early retirement of long-term debt as
discussed in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this MD&A, partially offset by a one-time third party payment relating
to a previously divested asset.

Total income tax recovery of $768 million in the first six months of 2016 was lower than 2015 primarily due to changes in net
earnings (loss) before tax, mainly resulting from lower non-cash ceiling test impairments, and changes in the estimated annual
effective income tax rate. The net earnings variances are discussed in the Financial Results section of this MD&A.
Encana’s interim income tax expense is determined using the estimated annual effective income tax rate applied to year-to-date
net  earnings  before  tax  plus  the  effect  of  legislative  changes  and  amounts  in  respect  of  prior  periods.  The  estimated  annual
effective income tax rate is impacted by expected annual earnings, statutory rate and other foreign differences, non-taxable capital
gains and losses, tax differences on divestitures and transactions, and partnership tax allocations in excess of funding.
Tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate are
subject to change. As a result, there are tax matters under review. The Company believes that the provision for taxes is adequate.

Operating Activities
Net cash from operating activities in the second quarter of 2016 of $83 million decreased $215 million from 2015 primarily due to
net changes in non-cash working capital. In the second quarter of 2016, the net change in non-cash working capital was a deficit
of $94 million compared to a surplus of $110 million in 2015.
Net  cash  from  operating  activities  in  the  first  six  months  of  2016  of  $240  million  decreased  $540  million  from  2015.  These
changes  are  primarily  a  result  of  the  Cash  Flow  variances  discussed  in  the  Financial  Results  section  of  this  MD&A  and  net
changes in non-cash working capital. In the first six months of 2016, the net change in non-cash working capital was a deficit of
$35 million compared to a surplus of $104 million in 2015.
The Company had a working capital deficit of $99 million at June 30, 2016 compared to a surplus of $274 million at December 31,
2015.  The  decrease  in  working  capital  is  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  risk  management  assets  and  an  increase  in  risk
management  liabilities,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities.  At  June  30,  2016,  working
capital included cash and cash equivalents of $293 million compared to $271 million at
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Prepared using U.S. GAAP in US$
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
December 31, 2015. Encana expects it will continue to meet the payment terms of its suppliers. The current working capital deficit
is expected to improve upon receipt of proceeds from announced divestitures. Encana’s primary sources of liquidity are discussed
in the Financing Activities section of this MD&A.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 2016 was $614 million compared to $413 million in 2015. The
change was primarily due to lower proceeds from divestitures and lower cash in reserve released from escrow, partially offset by
lower  capital  expenditures.  Further  information  on  capital  expenditures  and  divestitures  can  be  found  in  the  Net  Capital
Investment section of this MD&A.
Financing Activities
Net cash from financing activities in the first six months of 2016 was $387 million compared to net cash used of $202 million in
2015. The change was primarily due to proceeds of $1,088 million from the issuance of common shares in the first quarter of
2015,  partially  offset  by  a  lower  repayment  of  long-term  debt  in  2016  and  a  higher  net  issuance  of  revolving  long-term  debt
compared to 2015.
Credit Facilities
The following table outlines the Company’s committed revolving bank credit facilities at June 30, 2016:

Encana is currently in compliance with, and expects that it will continue to be in compliance with, all financial covenants under its
credit  facility  agreements.  Management  monitors  Debt  to  Adjusted  Capitalization  as  a  proxy  for  Encana’s  financial  covenant
under its credit facility agreements, which requires debt to adjusted capitalization to be less than 60 percent. The definitions used
in the covenant under the credit facilities adjust capitalization for cumulative historical ceiling test impairments that were recorded
as  at  December  31,  2011  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s  January  1,  2012  adoption  of  U.S.  GAAP.  Debt  to  Adjusted
Capitalization was 31 percent at June 30, 2016 and 28 percent at December 31, 2015.
During  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  Encana  received  a  downgrade  in  its  credit  rating  by  Moody’s  Investors  Service,  along  with
confirmed investment grade credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, DBRS Limited and Fitch Ratings, Inc. As a
result of the split ratings, the Company no longer has access to its U.S. Commercial Paper program and there was a nominal
increase in the cost of short-term borrowings on the Company’s credit facilities. The Company continues to have full access to its
$4.5  billion  committed  revolving  bank  credit  facilities  of  which  $3.0  billion  remained  unused  at  June  30,  2016.  The  facilities
remain  committed  through  July  2020.  The  split  ratings  have  not  impacted  the  Company’s  ability  to  fund  its  operations,
development activities or capital program. For further information on credit ratings, refer to the Company’s AIF.
Long-Term Debt
Encana’s long-term debt totaled $5,690 million at June 30, 2016 and $5,333 million at December 31, 2015. There was no current
portion of long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The long-term debt balances reflect Encana’s
January 1, 2016 retrospective adoption of accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs, as described in the Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A.
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Prepared using U.S. GAAP in US$
On March 16, 2016, Encana announced Tender Offers for certain of the Company’s outstanding Notes. The announced Tender
Offers were for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million, excluding accrued and unpaid interest. The consideration for each
$1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase included an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000
principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase, provided the Notes were validly tendered at or prior to the early tender date of
March  29,  2016.  All  Notes  validly  tendered  and  accepted  for  purchase  also  received  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  up  to  the
settlement date.
On  March  30,  2016,  Encana  announced  an  increase  in  the  aggregate  purchase  price  of  the  Tender  Offers  to  $400  million,
excluding accrued and unpaid interest, and accepted for purchase (i) $156 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15 percent
notes  due  2041,  (ii)  $295  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  6.50  percent  notes  due  2038  and  (iii)  $38  million  aggregate
principal amount of 6.625 percent notes due 2037. The Company paid an aggregate amount of $406 million, including accrued
and unpaid interest of $6 million and an early tender premium of $14 million, for Notes accepted for purchase. The Company used
cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund the Tender Offers.
Encana also recognized a gain on the early debt retirement of $103 million, before tax, representing the difference between the
carrying amount of the Notes accepted for purchase and the consideration paid. The gain on the early debt retirement net of the
early tender premium totaled $89 million, which is included in other expenses in the Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement
of Earnings.
At June 30, 2016, Encana had an outstanding balance of $1,493 million under the Company’s revolving credit facility, which
reflected principal obligations related to LIBOR loans maturing at various dates with a weighted average interest rate of 2.38
percent. A portion of the outstanding balance represents amounts drawn to fund the Tender Offers. The LIBOR loans are fully
supported and Management expects they will continue to be supported by the revolving credit facility which matures in July 2020.
At December 31, 2015, Encana had an outstanding balance of $210 million under the Company’s revolving credit facility which
reflected principal obligations related to LIBOR loans maturing at various dates with a weighted average interest rate of 1.87
percent. At December 31, 2015, Encana also had an outstanding balance under the Company’s revolving credit facility of $440
million which reflected U.S. Commercial Paper issuances maturing at various dates with a weighted average interest rate of 1.13
percent.
Encana has the flexibility to refinance maturing long-term debt or repay debt maturities from existing sources of liquidity. Encana’s
primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, revolving bank credit facilities, operating cash flow and proceeds
from asset divestitures.
Shelf Prospectus
Encana has in place a short form base debt shelf prospectus whereby the Company may issue from time to time up to $6.0 billion,
or the equivalent in foreign currencies, of debt securities, common shares, preferred shares, subscription receipts, warrants and
units  in  Canada  and/or  the  U.S.  During  2015,  the  Company  filed  a  prospectus  supplement  to  the  base  shelf  prospectus  and
issued 98,458,975 common shares of Encana, including common shares issued under an over-allotment option, for aggregate
gross  proceeds  of  approximately  C$1.44  billion  ($1.13  billion).  At  June  30,  2016,  $4.9  billion,  or  the  equivalent  in  foreign
currencies,  remained  accessible  under  the  shelf  prospectus,  the  availability  of  which  is  dependent  upon  certain  eligibility
requirements and market conditions. The shelf prospectus expires on July 26, 2016 and will be renewed.

During the first six months of 2016, Encana issued 86,848 common shares under the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan
(“DRIP”) compared with 2,872,237 common shares in 2015. The number of common shares issued under the DRIP decreased in
2016 primarily as a result of the lower dividend paid per share in the first six months of 2016 as well as Encana’s December 14,
2015 announcement that any dividends subsequent to December 31, 2015 distributed to shareholders participating in the DRIP
will be issued from its treasury without a discount to the average market price of the common shares.

Capital Structure
The  Company’s  capital  structure  consists  of  total  shareholders’  equity  plus  long-term  debt,  including  the  current  portion.  The
Company’s objectives when managing its capital structure are to maintain financial flexibility to preserve Encana’s access to
capital  markets  and  its  ability  to  meet  financial  obligations  and  finance  internally  generated  growth,  as  well  as  potential
acquisitions.  Encana  has  a  long-standing  practice  of  maintaining  capital  discipline  and  managing  and  adjusting  its  capital
structure according to market conditions to maintain flexibility while achieving the Company’s objectives.
To manage the capital structure, the Company may adjust capital spending, adjust dividends paid to shareholders, issue new
shares, issue new debt or repay existing debt. In managing its capital structure, the Company monitors the following non-GAAP
financial  metrics  as  indicators  of  its  overall  financial  strength,  which  are  defined  in  the  Non-GAAP  Measures  section  of  this
MD&A.

agreements  with  VMLP.  Additional  information  can  be  found  in  Note  14  to  the  Interim  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.  Encana  also  has  significant  development  commitments  with  joint  venture  partners,  a  portion  of  which  may  be
satisfied by the Drilling and Field Services commitments included in the table above.
Further to the Commitments disclosed above, Encana also has obligations related to its risk management program and to fund its
defined  benefit  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefit  plans.  Contractual  obligations  arising  from  long-term  debt,  asset
retirement obligations, The Bow office building and capital leases are recognized on the Company’s balance sheet. Additional
information can be found in the note disclosures to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Divestiture transactions can reduce certain commitments and obligations disclosed above. The Company expects to fund its 2016
commitments and obligations from Cash Flow and cash and cash equivalents.
Contingencies
Encana is involved in various legal claims and actions arising in the course of the Company’s operations. Although the outcome
of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect
on Encana’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. If an unfavourable outcome were to occur, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated net earnings or loss in the period in which the outcome is
determined. Accruals for litigation and claims are recognized if the Company determines that the loss is probable and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes it has made adequate provision for such legal claims.

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Risk Management
Encana’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases its reputation, are
impacted by risks that can be categorized as follows:
●   financial risks;
●   operational risks; and
●   environmental, regulatory, reputational and safety risks.
Encana  aims  to  strengthen  its  position  as  a  leading  North  American  energy  producer  and  grow  shareholder  value  through  a
disciplined focus on generating profitable growth. Encana continues to focus on developing a balanced portfolio of low-risk and
low-cost long-life plays, enabling the Company to respond to market uncertainties. Management adjusts financial and operational
risk strategies to proactively respond to changing economic conditions and to mitigate or reduce risk.
Issues  that  can  affect  Encana’s  reputation  are  generally  strategic  or  emerging  issues  that  can  be  identified  early  and  then
appropriately managed, but can also include unforeseen issues that must be managed on a more urgent basis. Encana takes a
proactive  approach  to  the  identification  and  management  of  issues  that  affect  the  Company’s  reputation  and  has  established
appropriate policies, procedures, guidelines and responsibilities for identifying and managing these risks.
Financial Risks
Encana defines financial risks as the risk of loss or lost opportunity resulting from financial management and market conditions
that could have an impact on Encana’s business.
Financial risks include, but are not limited to:
●   market pricing of natural gas and liquids;
●   credit and liquidity;
●   foreign exchange rates; and
●   interest rates.
Encana partially mitigates its exposure to financial risks through the use of various financial instruments and physical contracts.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed under formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board. All
derivative  financial  agreements  are  with  major  global  financial  institutions  or  with  corporate  counterparties  having  investment
grade credit ratings. Encana has in place policies and procedures with respect to the required documentation and approvals for
the use of derivative financial instruments and specifically ties their use to the mitigation of financial risk in order to support capital
plans and strategic objectives.
To partially mitigate commodity price risk, the Company may enter into transactions that fix, set a floor or combine to set floors and
caps on price exposures. To help protect against regional price differentials, Encana executes transactions to manage the price
differentials between its production areas and various sales points. Further information, including the details of Encana’s financial
instruments as at June 30, 2016, is disclosed in Note 19 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Counterparty  credit  risks  are  regularly  and  proactively  managed.  A  substantial  portion  of  Encana’s  credit  exposure  is  with
customers in the oil and gas industry or financial institutions. Credit exposures are managed through the use of Board-approved
credit policies governing the Company’s credit portfolio, including credit practices that limit transactions and grant payment terms
according to industry standards and counterparties’ credit quality.
The Company manages liquidity risk using cash and debt management programs. The Company has access to cash equivalents
and a range of funding alternatives at competitive rates through committed revolving bank credit facilities as well as debt and
equity capital markets. Encana closely monitors the Company’s ability to access cost-

effective credit and ensures that sufficient liquidity is in place to fund capital expenditures and dividend payments. The Company
minimizes its liquidity risk by managing its capital structure which may include adjusting capital spending, adjusting dividends
paid to shareholders, issuing new shares, issuing new debt or repaying existing debt.
Operational Risks
Operational risks are defined as the risk of loss or lost opportunity resulting from the following:
●   operating activities;
●   capital activities, including the ability to complete projects; and
●   reserves and resources replacement.
The  Company’s  ability  to  operate,  generate  cash  flows,  complete  projects,  and  value  reserves  and  resources  is  subject  to
financial risks, including commodity price volatility mentioned above, continued market demand for its products and other factors
outside of its control. These factors include: general business and market conditions; economic recessions and financial market
turmoil; the overall state of the capital markets, including investor appetite for investments in the oil and gas industry generally and
the Company’s securities in particular; the ability to secure and maintain cost-effective financing for its commitments; legislative,
environmental and regulatory matters; unexpected cost increases; royalties; taxes; partner funding for their share of joint venture
and partnership commitments; the availability of drilling and other equipment; the ability to retain leases and access lands; the
ability  to  access  water  for  hydraulic  fracturing  operations;  weather;  the  availability  and  proximity  of  processing  and  pipeline
capacity; transportation interruption and constraints; technology failures;  the  ability  to  assess  and  integrate  new  assets;  cyber
security  breaches;  accidents;  the  availability  and  ability  to  attract  qualified  personnel  and  service  providers;  type  curve
performance; and reservoir quality. If Encana fails to acquire or find additional natural gas and liquids reserves and resources, its
reserves,  resources  and  production  will  decline  materially  from  their  current  levels  and,  therefore,  its  cash  flows  are  highly
dependent  upon  successfully  exploiting  current  reserves  and  resources  and  acquiring,  discovering  or  developing  additional
reserves and resources. To mitigate these risks, as part of the capital approval process, the Company’s projects are evaluated on
a fully risked basis, including geological risk, engineering risk and reliance on third party service providers.
When making operating and investing decisions, Encana’s highly disciplined, dynamic and centrally controlled capital allocation
program  ensures  investment  dollars  are  directed  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  Company’s  strategy.  Encana  also
mitigates operational risks through a number of other policies, systems and processes as well as by maintaining a comprehensive
insurance program.
In  January  2016,  the  Alberta  Government  released  the  Modernized  Royalty  Framework  (“MRF”)  outlining  changes  to  the
province’s royalty structure. The MRF will result in the modernization and simplification of the royalty structure with changes to the
royalty framework for crude oil, liquids and natural gas applying to new wells drilled after January 1, 2017 and existing royalties
remaining in effect for 10 years on wells drilled (spud) before 2017. The Company continues to assess the impact of the changes
to the royalty structure and believes the MRF will not have a negative impact on its operations.
Environmental, Regulatory, Reputational and Safety Risks
The Company is committed to safety in its operations and has high regard for the environment and stakeholders, including the
public and regulators. The Company’s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for,
development  of  and  production  of  natural  gas,  oil  and  NGLs  and  the  operation  of  midstream  facilities.  When  assessing  the
materiality of environmental risk factors, Encana takes into account a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but
not  limited  to,  the  financial,  operational,  reputational  and  regulatory  aspects  of  each  identified  risk  factor.  These  risks  are
managed by executing policies and standards that are designed to comply with or exceed government regulations and industry
standards. In addition, Encana maintains a system that identifies, assesses and controls safety, security and environmental risk
and requires regular reporting to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board. The Corporate Responsibility, Environment,
Health and Safety Committee of Encana’s Board provides recommended environmental policies for approval by Encana’s Board
and oversees compliance with government laws and regulations. Monitoring and reporting

programs  for  environmental,  health  and  safety  performance  in  day-to-day  operations,  as  well  as  inspections  and  audits,  are
designed to provide assurance that environmental and regulatory standards are met. Emergency response plans are in place to
provide  guidance  during  times  of  crisis.  Contingency  plans  are  in  place  for  a  timely  response  to  environmental  events  and
remediation/reclamation strategies are utilized to restore the environment.
Encana’s operations are subject to regulation and intervention by governments that can affect or prohibit the drilling, completion,
including  hydraulic  fracturing  and  tie-in  of  wells,  production,  the  construction  or  expansion  of  facilities  and  the  operation  and
abandonment of fields. Changes in government regulation could impact the Company’s existing and planned projects as well as
impose a cost of compliance.
In the state of Colorado, several cities have passed local ordinances limiting or banning certain oil and gas activities, including
hydraulic fracturing. These local rule-making initiatives have not significantly impacted the Company’s operations or development
plans in the state to date. Encana continues to work with state and local governments, academics and industry leaders to respond
to hydraulic fracturing related concerns in Colorado. The Company recognizes that additional hydraulic fracturing ballot and/or
local rule-making limiting or restricting oil and gas development activities are a possibility in the future and will continue to monitor
and respond to these developments in 2016.
In Canada, the federal government and several provincial governments, including Alberta and British Columbia, have announced
an enhanced focus on climate change policy in 2016. Encana continues to monitor developments, engage in consultations as
appropriate  and  is  actively  managing  the  implementation  of  new  climate-related  policy  and  regulations  in  order  minimize  the
potential impact on its business.
In  the  U.S.,  the  federal  government  has  noted  climate  change  action  as  a  priority  for  the  current  administration  and  the
Environmental Protection Agency has outlined a series of steps to address methane and volatile organic compound emissions
from the oil and gas industry, including a new goal to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels
by 2025. The reductions will be achieved through proposed regulatory and voluntary measures. Encana continues to monitor
these developments, provide comment as appropriate and assess the potential impact on its business.
A  comprehensive  discussion  of  Encana’s  risk  management  is  provided  in  the  Company’s  annual  MD&A  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2015.

Accounting Policies and Estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Changes in Accounting Policies and Practices
On January 1, 2016, Encana adopted the following ASUs issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) which
have not had a material impact on the Company’s Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:
●   ASU  2014-12, Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation:  Accounting  for  Share-Based  Payments  When  the  Terms  of  an
Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period. The update requires
that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a
performance condition. The amendments have been applied prospectively.
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Prepared using U.S. GAAP in US$
●   ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The update requires limited partnerships and similar entities to
be  evaluated  under  the  variable  interest  and  voting  interest  models,  eliminate  the  presumption  that  a  general  partner
should  consolidate  a  limited  partnership,  and  simplify  the  identification  of  variable  interests  and  related  effect  on  the
primary beneficiary criterion when fees are paid to a decision maker. The amendments have been applied using a full
retrospective approach.
●   ASU  2015-03, Simplifying  the  Presentation  of  Debt  Issuance  Costs and  ASU  2015-15, Presentation  and  Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. The updates require debt issuance
costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related liability. Previously,
debt  issuance  costs  were  presented  as  a  deferred  charge  within  assets.  The  updates  further  clarify  that  regardless  of
whether there are outstanding borrowings, debt issuance costs arising from credit arrangements can be presented as an
asset  and  subsequently  amortized  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  arrangement.  These  amendments  have  been  applied
retrospectively and resulted in a $30 million decrease in Other Assets, with a corresponding $30 million decrease in Long-
Term Debt as at December 31, 2015.
New Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted
As of January 1, 2018, Encana will be required to adopt ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers under Topic 606,
which replaces Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and other industry-specific guidance in the Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”). The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized on the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or
services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Deferral of Effective Date for Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, but permits early adoption using the original effective date of January 1, 2017.
The standard can be applied using one of two retrospective application methods at the date of adoption. Encana is currently
assessing the potential impact of the standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
As  of  January  1,  2019,  Encana  will  be  required  to  adopt  ASU  2016-02, Leases  under  Topic  842,  which  replaces  Topic  840
Leases.  The  new  standard  will  require  lessees  to  recognize  right-of-use  assets  and  related  lease  liabilities  for  all  leases,
including  leases  classified  as  operating  leases,  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The  dual  classification  model  requiring
leases recognized to be classified as either finance or operating leases was retained for the purpose of subsequent measurement
and presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The new standard also
expands disclosures related to the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard will be applied
using  a  modified  retrospective  approach  and  provides  for  certain  practical  expedients.  Encana  is  currently  assessing  the
standard, and expects the new standard will have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Measures
Certain  measures  in  this  document  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning  as  prescribed  by  U.S.  GAAP  and,  therefore,  are
considered  non-GAAP  measures.  These  measures  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar  measures  presented  by  other  issuers.
These measures are commonly used in the oil and gas industry and by Encana to provide shareholders and potential investors
with additional information regarding the Company’s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. Non-GAAP
measures include: Cash Flow; Free Cash Flow; Operating Earnings (Loss); Upstream Operating Cash Flow, excluding Hedging;
Operating  Netback;  Debt  to  Debt  Adjusted  Cash  Flow;  and  Debt  to  Adjusted  Capitalization.  Management’s  use  of  these
measures is discussed further below.
Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow
Cash  Flow  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  commonly  used  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  and  by  Encana  to  assist  Management  and
investors in measuring the Company’s ability to finance capital programs and meet financial obligations. Cash Flow is defined as
cash from operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities, net change in non-cash working capital and
cash tax on sale of assets.
Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as Cash Flow in excess of capital investment, excluding net acquisitions and
divestitures, and is used to determine the funds available for other investing and/or financing activities.

Operating Earnings
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Prepared using U.S. GAAP in US$
Operating Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders by
non-operating items that Management believes reduces the comparability of the Company’s underlying financial performance
between periods. Operating Earnings (Loss) is commonly used in the oil and gas industry and by Encana to provide investors
with information that is more comparable between periods.
Operating Earnings (Loss) is defined as Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders excluding non-recurring or
non-cash items that Management believes reduces the comparability of the Company’s financial performance between periods.
These after-tax items may include, but are not limited to, unrealized hedging gains/losses, impairments, restructuring charges,
non-operating  foreign  exchange  gains/losses,  gains/losses  on  divestitures,  gains  on  debt  retirement,  income  taxes  related  to
divestitures and adjustments to normalize the effect of income taxes calculated using the estimated annual effective income tax
rate.

Capitalization includes debt, total shareholders’ equity and an equity adjustment for cumulative historical ceiling test impairments
recorded as at December 31, 2011 in conjunction with the Company’s January 1, 2012 adoption of U.S. GAAP.

  ●  the possible impact and timing of accounting pronouncements, rule changes and standards
Readers  are  cautioned  against  unduly  relying  on  forward-looking  statements  which,  by  their  nature,  involve  numerous
assumptions,  risks  and  uncertainties  that  may  cause  such  statements  not  to  occur,  or  results  to  differ  materially  from  those
expressed or implied. These assumptions include:
●  assumptions contained in the Company’s current corporate guidance
  ●  availability of attractive hedges and enforceability of risk management program
  ●  effectiveness of the Company’s resource play hub model to drive productivity and efficiencies
  ●  results from innovations
  ●  the expectation that counterparties will fulfill their obligations under the gathering, midstream and marketing agreements
  ●  access to transportation and processing facilities where Encana operates

the value of post- closing and other adjustments associated with announced divestitures and impact to expected proceeds
●  expectations  and  projections  made  in  light  of,  and  generally  consistent  with,  Encana’s  historical  experience  and  its
perception of historical trends, including with respect to the pace of technological development, the benefits achieved and
general industry expectations

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Risks and uncertainties that may affect these business outcomes include: the ability to generate sufficient Cash Flow to meet the
Company’s obligations; risks inherent to closing announced divestitures on a timely basis or at all and adjustments that may
reduce the expected proceeds and value to Encana; commodity price volatility; ability to secure adequate product transportation
and potential pipeline curtailments; variability and discretion of Encana’s Board to declare and pay dividends, if any; the timing
and  costs  of  well,  facilities  and  pipeline  construction;  business  interruption  and  casualty  losses  or  unexpected  technical
difficulties; counterparty and credit risk; risk and effect of a downgrade in credit rating, including below an investment-grade credit
rating,  and  its  impact  on  access  to  capital  markets  and  other  sources  of  liquidity;  fluctuations  in  currency  and  interest  rates;
assumptions based upon the Company’s 2016 corporate guidance; failure to achieve anticipated results from cost and efficiency
initiatives; risks inherent in marketing operations; risks associated with technology; changes in or interpretation of royalty, tax,
environmental, greenhouse gas, carbon, accounting and other laws or regulations; risks associated with existing and potential
future lawsuits and regulatory actions made against the Company; the Company’s ability to acquire or find additional reserves;
imprecision of reserves estimates and estimates of recoverable quantities of natural gas and liquids from resource plays and other
sources not currently classified as proved, probable or possible reserves or economic contingent resources, including future net
revenue estimates; risks associated with past and future divestitures of certain assets or other transactions or receive amounts
contemplated  under  the  transaction  agreements  (such  transactions  may  include  third-party  capital  investments,  farm-outs  or
partnerships, which Encana may refer to from time to time as “partnerships” or “joint ventures” and the funds received in respect
thereof which Encana may refer to from time to time as “proceeds”, “deferred purchase price” and/or “carry capital”, regardless of
the legal form) as a result of various conditions not being met; and other risks and uncertainties impacting Encana’s business as
described from time to time in its most recent MD&A, financial statements, AIF and Form 40-F, as filed on SEDAR and EDGAR.
Although Encana believes that the expectations represented by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no
assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions, risks and uncertainties
referenced above are not exhaustive. The forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of the date of this
document  and,  except  as  required  by  law,  Encana  undertakes  no  obligation  to  update  publicly  or  revise  any  forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.
Encana is required to disclose events and circumstances that occurred during the period to which this MD&A relates that are
reasonably likely to cause actual results to differ materially from material forward-looking statements for a period that is not yet
complete that Encana has previously disclosed to the public and the expected differences thereto. Such disclosure can be found
in  Encana’s  news  release  dated  July  21,  2016,  which  is  available  on  Encana’s  website  at www.encana.com,  on  SEDAR  at
www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov.

Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Oil and Gas Information
National Instrument 51-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators imposes oil and gas disclosure standards for Canadian
public companies engaged in oil and gas activities. The Canadian protocol disclosure is contained in Appendix A and under
“Narrative Description of the Business” in the AIF. In addition, certain disclosures have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
disclosure  requirements.  The  Company’s  U.S.  protocol  disclosure  is  included  in  Note  27  (unaudited)  to  the  Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in Appendix D of the AIF.
A description of the primary differences between the disclosure requirements under the Canadian standards and under the U.S.
standards is set forth under the heading “Reserves and Other Oil and Gas Information” in the AIF.
Natural Gas, Oil and NGLs Conversions
The conversion of natural gas volumes to BOE is on the basis of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel. BOE is based on a generic
energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent economic value equivalency
at the wellhead. Readers are cautioned that BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.
Play and Resource Play
Play is a term used by Encana which encompasses resource plays, geological formations and conventional plays. Resource play
is a term used by Encana to describe an accumulation of hydrocarbons known to exist over a large areal expanse and/or thick
vertical section, which, when compared to a conventional play, typically has a lower geological and/or commercial development
risk and lower average decline rate.
Additional Information
Further information regarding Encana Corporation, including its AIF, can be accessed under the Company’s public filings found
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, on EDGAR at www.sec.gov and on the Company’s website at www.encana.com.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP in US$
Q2 Report  |  For the period ended June 30, 2016
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  (unaudited)
(All amounts in $ millions unless otherwise specified)
1.  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
Encana Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Encana” or “the Company”) are in the business of the exploration for, the development
of, and the production and marketing of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”). The term liquids is used to represent
Encana’s oil, NGLs and condensate.
The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Encana and are presented in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).
The  interim  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include  the  accounts  of  Encana  and  entities  in  which  it  holds  a
controlling interest. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Undivided interests in natural
gas and oil exploration and production joint ventures and partnerships are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in
non-controlled  entities  over  which  Encana  has  the  ability  to  exercise  significant  influence  are  accounted  for  using  the  equity
method.
The  interim  Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have  been  prepared  following  the  same  accounting  policies  and
methods of computation as the annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, except
as  noted  below  in  Note  2.  The  disclosures  provided  below  are  incremental  to  those  included  with  the  annual  audited
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Certain  information  and  disclosures  normally  required  to  be  included  in  the  notes  to  the
annual  audited  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have  been  condensed  or  have  been  disclosed  on  an  annual  basis  only.
Accordingly, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015.
These unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect, in the opinion of Management, all normal and
recurring  adjustments  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  financial  position  and  results  of  the  Company  as  at  and  for  the  periods
presented.  Interim  condensed  consolidated  financial  results  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  consolidated  financial  results
expected for the fiscal year.
2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Changes in Accounting Policies and Practices
On January 1, 2016, Encana adopted the following accounting standards updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”), which have not had a material impact on the Company’s interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements:
●  ASU 2014-12, “Compensation - Stock Compensation: Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award
Provide  That  a  Performance  Target  Could  Be  Achieved  After  the  Requisite  Service  Period”.  The  update  requires  that  a
performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. The amendments have been applied prospectively.
●  ASU 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis”. The update requires limited partnerships and similar entities to be
evaluated  under  the  variable  interest  and  voting  interest  models,  eliminate  the  presumption  that  a  general  partner  should
consolidate  a  limited  partnership,  and  simplify  the  identification  of  variable  interests  and  related  effect  on  the  primary
beneficiary criterion when fees are paid to a decision maker. The amendments have been applied using a full retrospective
approach.
●  ASU  2015-03,  “Simplifying  the  Presentation  of  Debt  Issuance  Costs”  and  ASU  2015-15,  “Presentation  and  Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements”. The updates require debt issuance costs
to be presented on the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related liability. Previously, debt issuance
costs  were  presented  as  a  deferred  charge  within  assets.  The  updates  further  clarify  that  regardless  of  whether  there  are
outstanding borrowings, debt issuance costs arising from credit arrangements can be presented as an asset and subsequently
amortized ratably over the term of the arrangement. These amendments have been applied retrospectively and resulted in a
$30 million decrease in Other Assets, with a corresponding $30 million decrease in Long-Term Debt as at December 31, 2015.

2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)
New Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted
As of January 1, 2018, Encana will be required to adopt ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” under Topic
606,  which  replaces  Topic  605,  “Revenue  Recognition”,  and  other  industry-specific  guidance  in  the  Accounting  Standards
Codification (“ASC”). The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized on the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Deferral of Effective Date for Revenue from Contracts with
Customers”,  which  deferred  the  effective  date  of  ASU  2014-09,  but  permits  early  adoption  using  the  original  effective  date  of
January 1, 2017. The standard can be applied using one of two retrospective application methods at the date of adoption. Encana
is currently assessing the potential impact of the standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of January 1, 2019, Encana will be required to adopt ASU 2016-02, “Leases” under Topic 842, which replaces Topic 840
“Leases”.  The  new  standard  will  require  lessees  to  recognize  right-of-use  assets  and  related  lease  liabilities  for  all  leases,
including  leases  classified  as  operating  leases,  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The  dual  classification  model  requiring
leases recognized to be classified as either finance or operating leases was retained for the purpose of subsequent measurement
and presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The new standard also
expands disclosures related to the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard will be applied
using a modified retrospective approach and provides for certain practical expedients. Encana is currently assessing the standard
and expects the new standard will have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
3.  Segmented Information
Encana’s reportable segments are determined based on the Company’s operations and geographic locations as follows:
●  Canadian Operations includes the exploration for, development of, and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs and other
related activities within the Canadian cost centre.
●  USA Operations includes the exploration for, development of, and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs and other related
activities within the U.S. cost centre.
●  Market Optimization is primarily responsible for the sale of the Company’s proprietary production. These results are reported
in  the  Canadian  and  USA  Operations.  Market  optimization  activities  include  third  party  purchases  and  sales  of  product  to
provide operational flexibility and cost mitigation for transportation commitments, product type, delivery points and customer
diversification. These activities are reflected in the Market Optimization segment. Market Optimization sells substantially all of
the Company’s upstream production to third party customers. Transactions between segments are based on market values and
are eliminated on consolidation.
Corporate  and  Other  mainly  includes  unrealized  gains  or  losses  recorded  on  derivative  financial  instruments.  Once  the
instruments are settled, the realized gains and losses are recorded in the reporting segment to which the derivative instruments
relate.
The  interim  Condensed  Consolidated  Statement  of  Earnings  for  the  comparative  period  ended  June  30,  2015  and  the
accompanying segmented information disclosed in this note have been updated to present property taxes and certain other levied
charges within production, mineral and other taxes. Formerly, these property taxes and other charges were presented in either
transportation and processing expense or operating expense.  Encana  has  updated  its  presentation  to  more  accurately  reflect
these charges within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings based on the nature of the expense recognized and to
more closely align with the Company’s peers. As a result, for the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Canadian Operations
reclassified $1 million from transportation and processing expense and $7 million from operating expense to production, mineral
and other taxes. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Canadian Operations reclassified $3 million from transportation and
processing expense and $13 million from operating expense to production, mineral and other taxes. In addition, for the three and
six  months  ended  June  30,  2015,  the  USA  Operations  reclassified  $4  million  and  $14  million,  respectively,  from  operating
expense to production, mineral and other taxes.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, divestitures in the USA Operations were $6 million. For the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, divestitures in the USA Operations were $87 million and $84 million, respectively. Divestitures primarily included
the sale of certain properties that did not complement Encana’s existing portfolio of assets.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, divestitures in the Canadian Operations were $50 million and $879 million,
respectively. Divestitures primarily included the sale of certain assets in Wheatland located in central and southern Alberta for
proceeds of approximately C$558 million ($468 million), after closing adjustments, the sale of certain natural gas gathering and
compression assets in Montney in northeastern British Columbia for proceeds of approximately C$454 million ($358 million), after
closing adjustments and the sale of certain properties that did not complement Encana’s existing portfolio of assets.
Amounts received from divestiture transactions were deducted from the respective Canadian and U.S. full cost pools.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, Corporate and Other acquisitions and divestitures primarily included the purchase and
subsequent sale of the Encana Place office building located in Calgary, which resulted in a gain on divestiture of approximately
$12 million.

Encana’s interim income tax expense is determined using an estimated annual effective income tax rate applied to year-to-date
net  earnings  before  income  tax  plus  the  effect  of  legislative  changes  and  amounts  in  respect  of  prior  periods.  The  estimated
annual effective income tax rate is impacted by the expected annual earnings, statutory rate and other foreign differences, non-
taxable capital gains and losses, tax differences on divestitures and transactions, and partnership tax allocations in excess of
funding.

Canadian Operations and USA Operations property, plant and equipment include internal costs directly related to exploration,
development and construction activities of $72 million, which have been capitalized during the six months ended June 30, 2016
(2015 - $128 million). Included in Corporate and Other are $59 million ($58 million as at December 31, 2015) of international
property costs, which have been fully impaired.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized before-tax ceiling test impairments of $226 million (2015 -
nil) in the Canadian cost centre and $258 million (2015 - $2,081 million) in the U.S. cost centre. For the six months ended June
30, 2016, the Company recognized before-tax ceiling test impairments of $493 million (2015 - nil) in the Canadian cost centre and
$903 million (2015 - $3,997 million) in the U.S. cost centre. The impairments are included within accumulated DD&A in the table
above and resulted primarily from the decline in the 12-month average trailing prices which reduced proved reserves volumes
and values.
The  12-month  average  trailing  prices  used  in  the  ceiling  test  calculations  were  based  on  the  benchmark  prices  below.  The
benchmark prices were adjusted for basis differentials to determine local reference prices, transportation costs and tariffs, heat
content and quality.

(1) Notes accepted for purchase in the March 2016 Tender Offers.
(2) Long-Term Debt for 2015 has been restated due to the adoption of ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs”, as described in
Note 2.
As at June 30, 2016, total long-term debt had a carrying value of $5,690 million and a fair value of $5,740 million (as at December
31, 2015 - carrying value of $5,333 million and a fair value of $4,630 million). The estimated fair value of long-term borrowings is
categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and has been determined based on market information, or by discounting
future payments of interest and principal at interest rates expected to be available to the Company at period end.
On March 16, 2016, Encana announced tender offers (collectively, the “Tender Offers”) for certain of the Company’s outstanding
senior  notes  (collectively,  the  “Notes”).  The  announced  Tender  Offers  were  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $250  million,
excluding  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  The  consideration  for  each  $1,000  principal  amount  of  Notes  validly  tendered  and
accepted for purchase included an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase,
provided the Notes were validly tendered at or prior to the early tender date of March 29, 2016. All Notes validly tendered and
accepted for purchase also received accrued and unpaid interest up to the settlement date.
On  March  30,  2016,  Encana  announced  an  increase  in  the  aggregate  purchase  price  of  the  Tender  Offers  to  $400  million,
excluding accrued and unpaid interest, and accepted for purchase: i) $156 million aggregate principal amount of 5.15 percent
notes  due  2041;  ii)  $295  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  6.50  percent  notes  due  2038;  and  iii)  $38  million  aggregate
principal amount of 6.625 percent notes due 2037. The Company paid an aggregate amount of $406 million, including accrued
and unpaid interest of $6 million and an early tender premium of $14 million, for Notes accepted for purchase. The Company used
cash on hand and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund the Tender Offers.
Encana also recognized a gain on the early debt retirement of $103 million, before tax, representing the difference between the
carrying amount of the Notes accepted for purchase and the consideration paid. The gain on the early debt retirement net of the
early  tender  premium  totals  $89  million,  which  is  included  in  other  expenses  in  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Statement  of
Earnings.

at a price of C$14.60 per common share, pursuant to an underwriting agreement. The aggregate gross proceeds from the Share
Offering were approximately C$1.44 billion ($1.13 billion). After deducting underwriter’s fees and costs of the Share Offering, the
net proceeds received were approximately C$1.39 billion ($1.09 billion).

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, Encana paid dividends of $0.015 per common share totaling $12 million (2015 -

Encana  has  share-based  compensation  plans  that  allow  employees  to  purchase  common  shares  of  the  Company.  Option
exercise  prices  are  not  less  than  the  market  value  of  the  common  shares  on  the  date  the  options  are  granted.  All  options
outstanding as at June 30, 2016 have associated Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights (“TSARs”) attached. In lieu of exercising the
option, the associated TSARs give the option holder the right to receive a cash payment equal to the excess of the market price of
Encana’s common shares at the time of the exercise over the original grant price.
In addition, certain stock options granted are performance-based whereby vesting is also subject to Encana attaining prescribed
performance relative to predetermined key measures. Historically, most holders of options with TSARs have elected to exercise
their stock options as a Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) in exchange for a cash payment. As a result, Encana does not consider
outstanding TSARs to be potentially dilutive securities.
Encana Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”)
Encana has a share-based compensation plan whereby eligible employees are granted RSUs. An RSU is a conditional grant to
receive  an  Encana  common  share,  or  the  cash  equivalent,  as  determined  by  Encana,  upon  vesting  of  the  RSUs  and  in
accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan and Grant Agreement. The Company intends to settle vested RSUs in cash on the
vesting date. As a result, Encana does not consider RSUs to be potentially dilutive securities.

In 2008, Encana entered into a contract for the design, construction and operation of the PFC at its Deep Panuke facility. Upon
commencement of operations in December 2013, Encana recognized the PFC as a capital lease asset. Under the lease contract,
Encana has a purchase option and the option to extend the lease for 12 one-year terms at fixed prices after the initial lease term
expires in 2021.
As a result of the purchase option and fixed price renewal options, Encana has determined it holds variable interests and that the
related  leasing  entity  qualifies  as  a  variable  interest  entity  (“VIE”).  Encana  is  not  the  primary  beneficiary  of  the  VIE  as  the
Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance. Encana
is  not  required  to  provide  any  financial  support  or  guarantees  to  the  leasing  entity  or  its  affiliates,  other  than  the  contractual
payments under the lease and operating agreements. Encana’s maximum exposure is the expected lease payments over the
initial contract term. As at June 30, 2016, Encana had a capital lease obligation of $336 million ($340 million as at December 31,
2015) related to the PFC.
Veresen Midstream Limited Partnership
On  March  31,  2015,  Encana,  along  with  the  Cutbank  Ridge  Partnership  (“CRP”),  entered  into  natural  gas  gathering  and
compression  agreements  with  Veresen  Midstream  Limited  Partnership  (“VMLP”),  under  an  initial  term  of  30  years  with  two
potential five-year renewal terms. As part of the agreement, VMLP agreed to undertake future expansion of midstream services if
required  by  Encana  and  the  CRP  in  support  of  the  anticipated  future  development  of  the  Montney  play.  In  addition,  VMLP
provides to Encana and the CRP natural gas gathering and processing under agreements that were contributed to VMLP by its
partner Veresen Inc., and have remaining terms of 16 years and up to a potential maximum of 10 one-year renewal terms.
Encana  has  determined  that  VMLP  is  a  VIE  and  that  Encana  holds  variable  interests  in  VMLP.  Encana  is  not  the  primary
beneficiary  as  the  Company  does  not  have  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  VMLP’s  economic
performance. These key activities relate to the construction, operation, maintenance and marketing of the assets owned by VMLP.
The variable interests arise from certain terms under the long-term service agreements which include: i) a take or pay for volumes
committed to certain gathering and processing assets; ii) an operating fee of which a portion can be converted into a fixed fee
once VMLP assumes operatorship of certain compression assets; and iii) a potential payout of minimum costs associated with
certain  gathering  and  compression  assets.  The  potential  payout  of  minimum  costs  will  be  assessed  in  the  eighth  year  of  the
assets’ service period and is based on whether there is an overall shortfall of total system cash flows from natural gas gathered
and compressed under certain service agreements. The potential payout amount can be reduced in the event VMLP markets
unutilized capacity to third party users. Encana is not required to provide any financial support or guarantees to VMLP.

14.  Variable Interest Entities (continued)
Veresen Midstream Limited Partnership (continued)
As a result of Encana’s involvement with VMLP, the maximum total exposure, which represents the potential exposure to Encana
in the event the assets under the agreements are deemed worthless, is estimated to be $1,414 million as at June 30, 2016. The
estimate comprises the take or pay volume commitments and the potential payout of minimum costs. The take or pay volume
commitments  associated  with  certain  gathering  and  processing  assets  are  included  in  Note  20  under  Transportation  and
Processing. The potential payout requirement is highly uncertain as the amount is contingent on future production estimates, pace
of  development  and  the  amount  of  capacity  contracted  to  third  parties.  As  at  June  30,  2016,  accounts  payable  and  accrued
liabilities included $0.2 million related to the take or pay commitment.
15.  Restructuring Charges
In February 2016, Encana announced workforce reductions to better align staffing levels and the organizational structure with the
Company’s reduced capital spending program as a result of the current low commodity price environment. Encana incurred total
restructuring charges of $31 million, before tax, primarily related to severance costs, of which $6 million remains accrued as at
June 30, 2016. The majority of the remaining amounts accrued are expected to be paid in 2017.
During  the  first  quarter  of  2015,  Encana  revised  its  plans  to  align  the  organizational  structure  in  continued  support  of  the
Company’s strategy that was announced in 2013. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, transition and severance costs of
$31 million, before tax, were incurred.
Restructuring charges are included in administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
16.  Compensation Plans
Encana has a number of compensation arrangements under which the Company awards various types of long-term incentive
grants to eligible employees. They include TSARs, Performance TSARs, SARs, Performance Share Units (“PSUs”), Deferred
Share Units (“DSUs”) and RSUs. These compensation arrangements are share-based.
Encana  accounts  for  TSARs,  Performance  TSARs,  SARs,  PSUs  and  RSUs  held  by  employees  as  cash-settled  share-based
payment transactions and, accordingly, accrues compensation costs over the vesting period based on the fair value of the rights
determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton and other fair value models.
As at June 30, 2016, the following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the share units held by
employees:
Risk Free Interest Rate

18.  Fair Value Measurements
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accrued revenues, and accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value of cash in reserve
approximates its carrying amount due to the nature of the instrument held.
Recurring fair value measurements are performed for risk management assets and liabilities and other derivative liabilities, as
discussed  further  in  Note  19.  These  items  are  carried  at  fair  value  in  the  Condensed  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  and  are
classified within the three levels of the fair value hierarchy in the tables below. There have been no significant transfers between
the hierarchy levels during the period.

(1) Netting  to  offset  derivative  assets  and  liabilities  where  the  legal  right  and  intention  to  offset  exists,  or  where  counterparty  master  netting  arrangements
contain provisions for net settlement.
The Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 risk management assets and liabilities consist of commodity fixed price contracts, NYMEX
fixed price swaptions, NYMEX three-way options, NYMEX costless collars, WTI-based fixed price swaptions and basis swaps
with terms to 2018. Level 2 also includes other derivative liabilities as discussed in Note 19. The fair values of these contracts are
based on a market approach and are estimated using inputs which are either directly or indirectly observable at the reporting date,
such as exchange and other published prices, broker quotes and observable trading activity.

18.  Fair Value Measurements (continued)
Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s Level 3 risk management assets and liabilities consist of power purchase contracts and WTI
three-way options with terms to 2017. The fair values of the power purchase contracts are based on the income approach and are
modelled internally using observable and unobservable inputs such as forward power prices in less active markets. The WTI
three-way options are a combination of a sold call, bought put and a sold put. These contracts allow the Company to participate in
the upside of commodity prices to the ceiling of the call option and provide the Company with partial downside price protection
through the combination of the put options. The fair values of the WTI three-way options are based on the income approach and
are modelled using observable and unobservable inputs such as implied volatility. The unobservable inputs are obtained from
third parties whenever possible and reviewed by the Company for reasonableness.
Changes  in  amounts  related  to  risk  management  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  in  revenues  and  transportation  and
processing expense according to their purpose.

implied volatility for the WTI three-way options would cause a corresponding $2 million ($2 million as at December 31, 2015)
increase or decrease to net risk management assets and liabilities.

C)  Risks Associated with Financial Assets and Liabilities
The  Company  is  exposed  to  financial  risks  including  market  risks  (such  as  commodity  prices,  foreign  exchange  and  interest
rates), credit risk and liquidity risk. Future cash flows may fluctuate due to movement in market prices and the exposure to credit
and liquidity risks.
Commodity Price Risk
Commodity price risk arises from the effect fluctuations in future commodity prices may have on future cash flows. To partially
mitigate exposure to commodity price risk, the Company has entered into various derivative financial instruments. The use of
these derivative instruments is governed under formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board of Directors. The
Company’s policy is to not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Natural Gas - To partially mitigate natural gas commodity price risk, the Company uses NYMEX-based contracts such as fixed
price  contracts,  fixed  price  swaptions,  options  and  costless  collars.  Encana  also  enters  into  basis  swaps  to  manage  against
widening price differentials between various production areas and various sales points.
Crude Oil and NGLs - To partially mitigate crude oil and NGLs commodity price risk, the Company uses WTI-based contracts
such  as  fixed  price  contracts,  fixed  price  swaptions  and  options.  Encana  also  enters  into  basis  swaps  to  manage  against
widening price differentials between various production areas and various sales points.
Power - The Company has entered into Canadian dollar denominated derivative contracts to manage its electricity consumption
costs.

The  table  below  summarizes  the  sensitivity  of  the  fair  value  of  the  Company’s  risk  management  positions  to  fluctuations  in
commodity prices, with all other variables held constant. The Company has used a 10 percent variability to assess the potential
impact of commodity price changes. Fluctuations in commodity prices could have resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting
pre-tax net earnings for the six months ended June 30 as follows:

Credit risk arises from the potential that the Company may incur a loss if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its
obligation  in  accordance  with  agreed  terms.  This  credit  risk  exposure  is  mitigated  through  the  use  of  Board-approved  credit
policies  governing  the  Company’s  credit  portfolio  including  credit  practices  that  limit  transactions  according  to  counterparties’
credit  quality.  Mitigation  strategies  may  include  master  netting  arrangements,  requesting  collateral  and/or  transacting  credit
derivatives.  The  Company  executes  commodity  derivative  financial  instruments  under  master  agreements  that  have  netting
provisions that provide for offsetting payables against receivables. As at June 30, 2016, the Company had no significant credit
derivatives in place and held no collateral balances.
As at June 30, 2016, cash equivalents include high-grade, short-term securities, placed primarily with financial institutions and
companies  with  strong  investment  grade  ratings.  Any  foreign  currency  agreements  entered  into  are  with  major  financial
institutions in Canada and the U.S. or with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings.
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable are with customers in the oil and gas industry and are subject to
normal industry credit risks. As at June 30, 2016, approximately 87 percent (95 percent as at December 31, 2015) of Encana’s
accounts receivable and financial derivative credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties.
As  at  June  30,  2016,  Encana  had  four  counterparties  whose  net  settlement  position  individually  accounted  for  more  than  10
percent of the fair value of the outstanding in-the-money net risk management contracts by counterparty. As at June 30, 2016,
these counterparties accounted for 30 percent, 22 percent, 16 percent and 15 percent of the fair value of the outstanding in-the-
money net risk management contracts. As at December 31, 2015, Encana had two counterparties whose net settlement position
accounted for 13 percent and 11 percent of the fair value of the outstanding in-the-money net risk management contracts.
During 2015, Encana entered into agreements resulting from divestitures, which may require Encana to fulfill certain payment
obligations on the take or pay volume commitments assumed by the purchaser. The circumstances that would require Encana to
perform  under  the  agreement  includes  events  where  the  purchaser  fails  to  make  payment  to  the  guaranteed  party  and/or  the
purchaser is subject to an insolvency event. The agreements have remaining terms from five to eight years with a fair value of $26
million ($29 million as at December 31, 2015). The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments is $420 million
as at June 30, 2016, and is considered unlikely.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity  risk  arises  from  the  potential  that  the  Company  will  encounter  difficulties  in  meeting  a  demand  to  fund  its  financial
liabilities as they come due. The Company manages liquidity risk using cash and debt management programs.
The  Company  has  access  to  cash  equivalents  and  a  range  of  funding  alternatives  at  competitive  rates  through  committed
revolving bank credit facilities and debt and equity capital markets. As at June 30, 2016, the Company had committed revolving
bank credit facilities totaling $4.5 billion which included $3.0 billion on a revolving bank credit facility for Encana and $1.5 billion
on a revolving bank credit facility for a U.S. subsidiary, the latter of which remained unused. Of the $3.0 billion revolving bank
credit facility, $1,493 million of LIBOR loans were drawn and $1,507 million remained unused. The facilities remain committed
through July 2020.
Encana also has accessible capacity under a shelf prospectus for up to $4.9 billion, or the equivalent in foreign currencies, the
availability of which is dependent on certain eligibility requirements and market conditions, to issue debt and/or equity securities
in Canada and/or the U.S. The shelf prospectus expires in July 2016.
The Company believes it has sufficient funding through the use of these facilities to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.

19.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management (continued)
C)  Risks Associated with Financial Assets and Liabilities (continued)
Liquidity Risk (continued)
The  Company  minimizes  its  liquidity  risk  by  managing  its  capital  structure.  The  Company’s  capital  structure  consists  of
shareholders’  equity  plus  long-term  debt,  including  the  current  portion.  The  Company’s  objectives  when  managing  its  capital
structure  are  to  maintain  financial  flexibility  to  preserve  Encana’s  access  to  capital  markets  and  its  ability  to  meet  financial
obligations  and  to  finance  internally  generated  growth  as  well  as  potential  acquisitions.  To  manage  the  capital  structure,  the
Company may adjust capital spending, adjust dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, issue new debt or repay existing
debt.
The timing of expected cash outflows relating to financial liabilities is outlined in the table below:

Included in Encana’s long-term debt obligations of $9,973 million at June 30, 2016 are $1,493 million in principal obligations
related to LIBOR loans. These amounts are fully supported and Management expects they will continue to be supported by credit
facilities which are fully revolving for up to five years. Based on the July 2020 maturity dates of the credit facilities, these amounts
are included in cash outflows for the period disclosed as 4 - 5 Years. Further information on Long-Term Debt is contained in Note
9.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from changes in foreign exchange rates that may affect the fair value or future cash flows of the
Company’s  financial  assets  or  liabilities.  As  Encana  operates  primarily  in  North  America,  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate
between  the  U.S.  and  Canadian  dollars  can  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  Company’s  reported  results.  Encana’s  financial
results are consolidated in Canadian dollars; however, the Company reports its results in U.S. dollars as most of its revenue is
closely tied to the U.S. dollar and to facilitate a more direct comparison to other North American oil and gas companies. As the
effects of foreign exchange fluctuations are embedded in the Company’s results, the total effect of foreign exchange fluctuations is
not separately identifiable.
As  at  June  30,  2016,  Encana  had  $5.7  billion  in  U.S.  dollar  debt  issued  from  Canada  that  was  subject  to  foreign  exchange
exposure ($5.4 billion as at December 31, 2015). To mitigate the exposure to the fluctuating U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate,
Encana may enter into foreign exchange derivatives. There were no foreign exchange derivatives outstanding as at June 30,
2016.
Encana’s foreign exchange (gain) loss primarily includes foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation and settlement of
U.S. dollar denominated debt issued from Canada, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of U.S. dollar
denominated risk management assets and liabilities held in Canada, foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation and
settlement of foreign denominated intercompany balances and foreign exchange gains and losses on U.S. dollar denominated
cash  and  short-term  investments  held  in  Canada.  A  $0.01  change  in  the  U.S.  to  Canadian  dollar  exchange  rate  would  have
resulted in a $43 million change in foreign exchange (gain) loss as at June 30, 2016 (2015 - $50 million).
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk arises from changes in market interest rates that may affect the fair value or future cash flows from the Company’s
financial assets or liabilities. The Company partially mitigates its exposure to interest rate changes by holding a mix of both fixed
and floating rate debt and may also enter into interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate effects of fluctuations in market interest
rates. There were no interest rate derivatives outstanding as at June 30, 2016.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had floating rate debt of $1,493 million (2015 - $1,397 million). Accordingly, the sensitivity in
net earnings for each one percent change in interest rates on floating rate debt was $11 million (2015 - $10 million).

Included  within  transportation  and  processing  in  the  table  above  are  certain  commitments  associated  with  midstream  service
agreements with VMLP as described in Note 14. Divestiture transactions can reduce certain commitments disclosed above.
Contingencies
Encana is involved in various legal claims and actions arising in the course of the Company’s operations. Although the outcome
of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect
on Encana’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. If an unfavourable outcome were to occur, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated net earnings or loss in the period in which the outcome is
determined. Accruals for litigation and claims are recognized if the Company determines that the loss is probable and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes it has made adequate provision for such legal claims.

(1) Cash  Flow  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  defined  as  cash  from  operating  activities  excluding  net  change  in  other  assets  and
liabilities, net change in non-cash working capital and cash tax on sale of assets.
(2) Operating Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure defined as net earnings (loss) excluding non-recurring or non-cash items
that Management believes reduces the comparability of the Company’s financial performance between periods. These after-
tax  items  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  unrealized  hedging  gains/losses,  impairments,  restructuring  charges,  non-
operating  foreign  exchange  gains/losses,  gains/losses  on  divestitures,  gains  on  debt  retirement,  income  taxes  related  to
divestitures and adjustments to normalize the effect of income taxes calculated using the estimated annual effective income
tax rate.
(3) In Q2 2015, organizational structure changes were formalized which resulted in a revision to the Q1 2015 Operating Earnings
to exclude restructuring charges incurred in the first quarter.
(4) Net earnings (loss), operating earnings (loss) and cash flow per common share are calculated using the weighted average
