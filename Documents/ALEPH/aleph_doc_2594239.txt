are furnishing Proxy Materials to our stockholders via the Internet. &nbsp;If 
you received a &#147;Notice of Internet Availability,&#148; you will not receive
a printed copy of the Proxy Materials unless you specifically request a printed

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Bravo will pay 
the expenses of the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors. 
&nbsp;Proxies can be solicited on our behalf by directors, officers or 
employees, without additional remuneration, in person or by telephone, by mail, 
electronic transmission and facsimile transmission. &nbsp;Solicitation of 
proxies by mail is expected to commence on August 18, 2016. &nbsp;We have hired 
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., to distribute and solicit proxies. 
&nbsp;We will pay Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. a fee of approximately 
$2,500.00, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, for its services.</P>

this service.

Work</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Bravo&#146;s 
board of directors is asking for your proxy. &nbsp;Giving us your proxy means 
that you authorize us to vote your shares at the 2016 Annual Meeting in the 
manner that you direct, or if you do not direct us, in the manner as recommended
by the board of directors in this Proxy Statement. &nbsp;You can vote for the 
director nominees or withhold your vote for one or all nominees. &nbsp;You also 
can vote for or against the other proposals or abstain from voting. &nbsp;If you
request a proxy card, and return your signed proxy card, but do not give voting 
instructions, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted &#147;FOR&#148;
each proposal as recommended by the board of directors. &nbsp;The individuals 
named in the proxy card are our chairman and one of our directors. &nbsp;A 
stockholder wishing to appoint some other person (who needs not be a stockholder
of Bravo Multinational Incorporated) to represent him at the meeting has the

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Stockholders of 
record at the close of business on August 1, 2016 (the &#147;Record Date&#148;),
are entitled to notice of and to vote at the 2016 Annual Meeting and at any 
adjournments thereof. &nbsp;On the Record Date, our authorized capital stock 
consisted of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. &nbsp;Each
share of the common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter properly 
brought before the 2016 Annual Meeting. &nbsp;In addition, the holders of our 
Series A preferred stock have the voting rights as discussed below.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">As of the Record
Date, 371,300,924 shares of our common stock were outstanding, fully paid and 
non-assessable. &nbsp;Each share of the common stock outstanding entitles the 
holder to one vote on all matters brought before the common stockholders. 
&nbsp;In addition, as of the Record Date, 5,000,000 shares of the Series A 
preferred stock of Bravo were issued and outstanding. &nbsp;Pursuant to our 
Certificate of Designation establishing the Series A preferred stock, a holder 
of shares of the Series A preferred stock is entitled to the number of votes of 
the holders of common stock equal to the number of shares of the Series A 
preferred stock held by such holder multiplied by 100 on all matters submitted 
to a vote of our stockholders. &nbsp;Therefore, the holders of our Series A 
preferred stock have the power to vote 500,000,000 shares of our common stock, 
which is more than the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the 
Record Date.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">This summary of 
the voting rights of our Series A preferred stock is, however, qualified in its 
entirety by and subject to the more complete information set forth in our 
Certificate of Designation establishing the Series A preferred stock filed with 
the Secretary of State of Delaware on March 24, 2015, a copy of which is

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Three directors 
are to be elected at the 2016 Annual Meeting to hold office until their 
successors are elected. &nbsp;The board of directors is composed of three 
directors. &nbsp;At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors will be 
elected to hold office until their successors are elected. &nbsp;There are no 
family relationships among any of the directors, director nominees or the 
executive officers of Bravo.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The board of 
directors has nominated Paul Parliament, Douglas Brooks, and Richard Kaiser to 
be elected at the 2016 Annual Meeting. &nbsp;Martin Wolfe, one of our current 
directors does not wish to stand for reelection due to personal reasons. 
&nbsp;Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do 
so is not withheld, for the election of the nominees named above. &nbsp;If, 
however, any of the proposed directors are unable to serve, or for good cause 
decline to serve at the time of the 2016 Annual Meeting, the proxy may be voted 
for a substitute nominee designated by the board of directors to fill the 
vacancy. &nbsp;Each person nominated for election has agreed to serve if 
elected, and Bravo has no reason to believe that any of the nominees for 
election will not be available to serve his prescribed term.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The name of each
current director and the nominees for election as directors and certain

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The affirmative 
vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the 2016 Annual Meeting is required to 
elect the three nominees as directors. &nbsp;This means that the three nominees 
will be elected if they receive more affirmative votes than any other 
person.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The board of 
directors has unanimously approved the nominees for election as directors at the

assemble a board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills 
derived from high quality business and professional experience. &nbsp;In doing 
so, the board will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business 
backgrounds.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Other than the 
foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although 
the board may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in our best 
interests as well as our stockholders. &nbsp;In addition, the board identifies 
nominees by first evaluating the current members of the board willing to 
continue in service. &nbsp;Current members of the board with skills and 
experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in 
service are considered for re-nomination. &nbsp;If any member of the board does 
not wish to continue in service or if the board decides not to re-nominate a 
member for re-election, the board then identifies the desired skills and
experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. &nbsp;Current 
members of the board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the 
criteria described above. &nbsp;The board may also engage in research to 
identify qualified individuals. &nbsp;To date, we have not engaged third parties
to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we
reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search firm, if 
necessary. &nbsp;The board does not typically consider stockholder nominees 
because it believes that its current nomination process is sufficient to 
identify directors who serve our best interests.</P>

United States federal income tax consequences under the 2016 Plan. &nbsp;It is 
based on existing United Sates laws and regulations, and there can be no 
assurance that those laws and regulations will not change in the future. 
&nbsp;The summary does not purport to be complete and does not discuss the tax 
consequences upon a participant&#146;s death, or the provisions of the income 
tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which the participant 
may reside, or all possible tax consequences of the receipt or exercise of stock
rights under the 2016 Plan, which consequences may vary depending upon a 
participant&#146;s individual tax and financial circumstances.</FONT></P>

Issuance</I>. &nbsp;With respect to the receipt of a stock award not subject to 
any restrictions under the 2016 Plan, the participant would have ordinary 
income, at the time of receipt, in an amount equal to the difference between the
fair market value of the stock received at such time and the amount, if any, 
paid by the holder for the stock award.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Limitation on
Tax Deductions for Bravo</I>. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, no
federal income tax deduction is allowed for compensation paid to a &#147;covered
employee&#148; in any taxable year of Bravo to the extent that such compensation
exceeds $1,000,000. &nbsp;The $1,000,000 limitation is reduced (but not below 
zero) by the amount (if any) that would have been included in the compensation 
of a covered employee for a taxable year but for being disallowed by reason of 
being a golden parachute payment under Internal Revenue Code &#167;280G. 
&nbsp;For this purpose, &#147;covered employees&#148; are generally the chief 
executive officer of Bravo and the four highest compensated officers of Bravo, 
and the term &#147;compensation&#148; generally includes amounts includable in 
gross income as a result of the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation 
rights, or the receipt of restricted stock. &nbsp;This deduction limitation does
not apply to compensation that is commission based compensation, performance 
based compensation or compensation that would not be includable in an 
employee&#146;s gross income.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8.35pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Base

our board of directors.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8.35pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Additional

Incentive</I>. &nbsp;Stock grants and options are awarded to executive officers 
based on their positions and individual performance. &nbsp;Stock grants and 
options provide incentive for the creation of stockholder value over the long 
term and aid significantly in the recruitment and retention of executive 
officers. &nbsp;The board of directors or compensation committee considers the 
recommendations of the chief executive officer for stock grants and options to 
executive officers (other than the chief executive officer) and approves, 
disapproves or modifies such recommendation. &nbsp;Stock grants and options for

shares of the Common Stock that exceeds 4.99% (&#147;Maximum Percentage&#148;) 
of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such conversion. &nbsp;For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the 
number of shares of the Common Stock beneficially owned by a Person and its 
affiliates shall include the number of shares of the Common Stock issuable upon 
conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are subject to a 
pending conversion notice for which the determination of whether the Maximum 
Percentage had been exceeded is being determined, but shall exclude the number 
of shares of the Common Stock which would be issuable upon (a) conversion of any
remaining, nonconverted shares of Series A Preferred Stock beneficially owned by
such Person or any of its affiliates not subject to a pending conversion notice,
and (b) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any 
other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any warrants) 
beneficially owned by such Person or any of its affiliates that are similarly 
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation 
contained in this Paragraph 14. &nbsp;Except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, for purposes of this Paragraph 14, beneficial ownership shall be 
calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended. &nbsp;For purposes of this Paragraph 14, in determining the 
number of outstanding shares of the Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the 
number of outstanding of shares of the Common Stock as reflected in (A) the 
Company&#146;s most recent Form 8-K, Form 10-Q, or Form 10-K, as the case may 
be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company, or (C) any other 
notice by the Company or its transfer agent setting forth the number of shares 
of the Common Stock outstanding. &nbsp;Upon the written request of any Holder, 
the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day 
following the receipt of such notice, confirm orally and in writing to any such 
Holder the number of shares of the Common Stock then outstanding. &nbsp;In any 
case, the number of outstanding shares of the Common Stock shall be determined 
after giving effect to all conversions of shares of Series A Preferred Stock by 
such Holder and its affiliates that had occurred since the date as of which such
number of outstanding Common Stock was reported. &nbsp;By written notice to the 
Company, the Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other
percentage specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will 
not be effective until the sixty-first day after such notice is delivered to the
Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder 
and not to any other Holder.</P>

&nbsp;Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a

threatened, pending or completed action, claim, suit or proceeding, whether 
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, any appeal in such an action,

action, suit or proceeding (a &#147;Proceeding&#148;), by reason of the fact 
that such individual is or was a director or officer of the Company, or while a 
director or officer of the Company is or was serving at the request of the 
Company as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, 
employee, agent or similar functionary of another corporation, partnership, 
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be indemnified and held 
harmless by the Company from and against any judgments, penalties (including 
excise taxes), fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses 
(including court costs and attorneys&#146; fees) actually incurred by such 
person in connection with such Proceeding if it is determined that he acted in 
good faith and reasonably believed (A) in the case of conduct in his official 
capacity on behalf of the Company that his conduct was in the Company&#146;s 
best interests; (B) in all other cases, that his conduct was not opposed to the 
best interests of the Company; and (C) with respect to any Proceeding which is a
criminal action, that he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was 
unlawful; provided, however, that in the event a determination is made that such
person is liable to the Company or is found liable on the basis that personal 
benefit was improperly received by such person, the indemnification is limited 
to reasonable expenses actually incurred by such person in connection with the 
Proceeding and shall not be made in respect of any Proceeding in which such 
person shall have been found liable for willful or intentional misconduct in the
performance of his duty to the Company. &nbsp;The termination of any Proceeding 
by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself be determinative of whether the person did 
not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or 
not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any 
Proceeding which is a criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe that 
his conduct was unlawful. &nbsp;A person shall be deemed to have been found 
liable in respect of any claim, issue or matter only after the person shall have
been so adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all 
appeals therefrom.</P>

that such person has met the applicable standard of conduct. &nbsp;Such 
determination shall be made (A) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of 
directors who at the time of the vote are not named defendants or respondents in
the Proceeding; (B) if such quorum cannot be obtained, by a majority vote of a

majority of all directors, consisting solely of two or more directors who at the
time of the vote are not named defendants or respondents in the Proceeding; (C) 
by special legal counsel (in a written opinion) selected by the Board of 
Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors by a vote as set forth in 
clause (A) or (B) of this Paragraph 6.2, or, if such quorum cannot be obtained

plan or other enterprise, shall be paid by the Company at reasonable intervals 
in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, and without the 
determination specified in the foregoing Paragraph 6.2, upon receipt by the 
Company of a written affirmation by such person of his good faith belief that he
has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Article
VI, and a written undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay the amount
paid or reimbursed by the Company if it is ultimately determined that he is not 
entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in this Article VI.

as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent,
or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, 
joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other 
enterprise against any liability, claim, damage, loss or risk asserted against 
such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity or arising out of 
the status of such person as such, irrespective of whether the Company would 
have the power to indemnify and hold such person harmless against such liability
under the provisions hereof. &nbsp;If the insurance or other arrangement is with
a person or entity that is not regularly engaged in the business of providing 
insurance coverage, the insurance or arrangement may provide for payment of a 
liability with respect to which the Company would not have the power to 
indemnify the person only if including coverage for the additional liability has
been approved by the stockholders of the Company. &nbsp;Without limiting the 
power of the Company to procure or maintain any kind of insurance or other 
arrangement, the Company may, for the benefit of persons indemnified by the 
Company, (A) create a trust fund; (B) establish any form of self-insurance; (C) 
secure its indemnity obligation by grant of a security interest or other lien on
the assets of the Company; or (D) establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or 
surety arrangement. &nbsp;The insurance or other arrangement may be procured, 
maintained, or established within the Company or with any insurer or other 
person deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors regardless of whether all or
part of the stock or other securities of the insurer or other person are owned 
in whole or part by the Company. &nbsp;In the absence of fraud, the judgment of 
the Board of Directors as to the terms and conditions of the insurance or other 
arrangement and the identity of the insurer or other person participating in the
arrangement shall be conclusive and the insurance or arrangement shall not be 
voidable and shall not subject the directors approving the insurance or 
arrangement to liability, on any ground, regardless of whether directors 
participating in the approval are beneficiaries of the insurance or 
arrangement.</P>

civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, any appeal in such an action,

action, suit or proceeding (a &#147;Proceeding&#148;), by reason of the fact 
that such individual is or was a director or officer of the Company, or while a 
director or officer of the Company is or was serving at the request of the 
Company as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, 
employee, agent or similar functionary of another corporation, partnership, 
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be indemnified and held 
harmless by the Company from and against any judgments, penalties (including 
excise taxes), fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses 
(including court costs and attorneys&#146; fees) actually incurred by such 
person in connection with such Proceeding if it is determined that he acted in 
good faith and reasonably believed (A) in the case of conduct in his official 
capacity on behalf of the Company that his conduct was in the Company&#146;s 
best interests; (B) in all other cases, that his conduct was not opposed to the 
best interests of the Company; and (C) with respect to any Proceeding which is a
criminal action, that he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was 
unlawful; provided, however, that in the event a determination is made that such
person is liable to the Company or is found liable on the basis that personal 
benefit was improperly received by such person, the indemnification is limited 
to reasonable expenses actually incurred by such person in connection with the 
Proceeding and shall not be made in respect of any Proceeding in which such 
person shall have been found liable for willful or intentional misconduct in the
performance of his duty to the Company. &nbsp;The termination of any Proceeding 
by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself be determinative of whether the person did 
not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or 
not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any 
Proceeding which is a criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe that 
his conduct was unlawful. &nbsp;A person shall be deemed to have been found

determination specified in the foregoing Paragraph 6.2, upon receipt by the 
Company of a written affirmation by such person of his good faith belief that he

maintained, or established within the Company or with any insurer or other 
person deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors regardless of whether all or
part of the stock or other securities of the insurer or other person are owned 
in whole or part by the Company. &nbsp;In the absence of fraud, the judgment of 
the Board of Directors as to the terms and conditions of the insurance or other 
arrangement and the identity of the insurer or other person participating in the
arrangement shall be conclusive and the insurance or arrangement shall not be 
voidable and shall not subject the directors approving the insurance or 
arrangement to liability, on any ground, regardless of whether directors 
participating in the approval are beneficiaries of the insurance or 
arrangement.</P>

transfer agent shall carry forward any fractional share until all certificates 
of that holder have been presented for exchange such that consideration for 
fractional shares for any one person shall not exceed the value of one (1) share

Paragraph 6 hereof, or other agreement between the parties, such shares shall be

includes a fractional share, such number shall be rounded to the nearest whole

died or become legally incompetent, they shall be delivered to the 
Participant&#146;s estate or legal guardian, as the case may be, in accordance 
with the foregoing; provided that, if the Participant dies with a Deferral 
Election pursuant to Paragraph 6 hereof in effect, the Committee shall deliver 
all remaining undelivered shares to the Participant&#146;s estate immediately.

2016, Goldland Holdings, Co. (the &#147;registrant&#148;) changed its corporate

directors of the registrant, pursuant to Section 242 of the Delaware General 
Corporation Law, determined it was in the best interests of the registrant that 
the name of the registrant should be changed to Bravo Multinational 
Incorporated, with such change of name to be effective upon compliance with all 
regulatory requirements mandated by FINRA. &nbsp;Further, as a result of the 
change of the registrant&#146;s name and upon satisfaction of all regulatory 
requirements, the trading symbol for the shares of the registrant&#146;s common 
stock should be changed to &#147;BRVO,&#148; and the registrant&#146;s CUSIP 
identifier be changed to a newly issued number. &nbsp;FINRA granted its approval
of the change of the registrant&#146;s name on April 6, 2015. &nbsp;As a result 
of the change of name of the registrant, the registrant&#146;s trading symbol 
was changed to &#147;BRVO&#148; and the CUSIP identifier was changed to 
10568F109.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We were 
originally formed as Montrose Ventures, Inc. in the State of Delaware on May 25,
1989. &nbsp;On April 23, 1996, our name was changed to Java Group, Inc., which 
tried and failed to start a chain of coffee bars. &nbsp;On September 1, 2004, 
our name was changed to Consolidated General Corp., which tried to buy tier 2 
and 3 professional sports teams, including the Vancouver Ravens lacrosse team 
and the San Diego Soccers soccer team. &nbsp;On August 7, 2007, our name was 
changed to Goldcorp Holdings Co. &nbsp;On October 15, 2010, our name was changed
to GoldLand Holdings Co. &nbsp;On April 6, 2016, our name was changed to Bravo 
Multinational Incorporated.</P>

before:always"><B>Former Business</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Over the years, 
and prior to our entry into the business of the leasing of gaming equipment 
described below, we have been engaged in the business of leasing mining claims. 
&nbsp;On September 14, 2007, we acquired an interest in 174.82 acres of land on 
War Eagle Mountain in Idaho from Bisell Investments Inc. and New Vision 
Financial Ltd., two of our then major stockholders, for a total of 90,000,000 
shares of our common stock. &nbsp;We acquired a 100% interest in 103 acres, and 
a 29.167% interest in 76.63 acres, respectively. &nbsp;We also leased five 
placer claims on War Eagle Mountain from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (the
&#147;BLM&#148;), each of which covered approximately 20 acres, or approximately
100 acres in total. &nbsp;Subsequently, as a result of a survey we allowed our 
original BLM claims to lapse, and reapplied for new lode claims that are better 
oriented in the direction of the three veins in the mountain. &nbsp;As a result,
we own 14 unpatented lode claims covering 262.85 acres and 76.63 acres within 
seven patented claims with a 29.167% ownership interest. &nbsp;We may look to 
expand on our mining claims holdings in the future.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">For a complete 
discussion of the mining activities on our mining claims conducted by other 
parties, please see our previous Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks filed with the SEC.
&nbsp;However it should be noted that at no time was Goldland Holdings a mining 
operator. &nbsp;As descried above, Goldland Holdings owns and or maintains 
mining claims which are leased to a third party. Since the mining operations of
our lessee no longer have any relevance to our new business of the leasing of 
gaming equipment, we will only include financial information relating to 
revenues, expenses, and results of operations and other relevant information 
with respect to the former mining activities of the lessee of our mining 
properties.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Current Business</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We are currently
engaged in the business of the leasing of gaming equipment. &nbsp;On September 
19, 2013, Universal Equipment SAS, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered 
into an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain gaming equipment from 
Universal Entertainment SAS, Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of the 
Country of Colombia, for 17,450,535 shares of our common stock (post reverse-
split on March 6, 2014). &nbsp;The closing occurred on March 6, 2014. &nbsp;The 
gaming equipment includes approximately 67 video poker and slot machines; eight 
blackjack and miscellaneous game tables, and related furniture and equipment; 
roulette table and related furniture and equipment; bingo equipment and 
furniture; casino chips, bill acceptors, coin counter and related equipment, and
miscellaneous office equipment, like chairs and tables.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Upon closing of 
the acquisition of the gaming equipment, through our wholly owned subsidiary 
Universal Entertainment SAS, Inc. on March 6, 2014, we leased the gaming 
equipment to Vomblom &amp; Pomare S.A., a company formed under the laws of the 
Country of Colombia, and controlled by Claudia Fuentes Robales, pursuant to a 
lease agreement which provided for lease payments of $700,000 per year, payable 
in the amount of $58,333 per month, with a term of five years with one five year
renewal option. &nbsp;The gaming equipment was to be used primarily in the 
operation of a casino that is owned and operated by the lessee on San Andres 
Isla, Colombia. &nbsp;However, some of the gaming equipment, such as video poker
and slot machines, could have been placed in retail locations under agreements 
with the retail merchants to divide winnings from the machines.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The above 
referred to lease agreement was cancelled by Universal Equipment SAS, Inc., on 
June 18, 2015, due to non-payment of the lease payments. &nbsp;We are now 
assessing new opportunities for the leasing of the gaming equipment.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Risks Related to Our Gaming 
Equipment Operations</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We are affected 
by the risks faced by foreign casino owners who we expect will be our future 
customers. &nbsp;Our prospective gaming machine customers are engaged in 
economically sensitive and competitive businesses. &nbsp;As a result, we will be
indirectly affected by all the risks facing foreign casino owners, which are 
beyond our control. &nbsp;Our results of operations will depend, in part, on the
financial strength of our customers and our customers&#146; ability to compete 
effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. &nbsp;Many of these risks
are discussed below.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><BR>

<P style="margin:0pt"><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt; page-break-
before:always"><I>Reductions in Consumer and Corporate Spending.</I> 
&nbsp;Consumer demand for hotel/casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and
for luxury amenities is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and 
the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. 
&nbsp;Changes in discretionary consumer spending or corporate spending on 
conventions and business travel could be driven by many factors, such as 
perceived or actual general economic conditions; any further weaknesses in the 
job or housing market; additional credit market disruptions; high energy, fuel 
and food costs; the increased cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; 
perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth; fears of recession 
and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; or fears of war and future 
acts of terrorism. &nbsp;These factors could reduce consumer and corporate 
demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities of our customers, thus
imposing additional limits on pricing and harming our operations.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Regulations 
Affecting Casinos.</I> &nbsp;Casinos are subject to extensive regulation and the
cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may have an 
adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations or 
cash flows. &nbsp;Casinos are required to obtain and maintain licenses from the 
jurisdictions in which they operate, and are subject to extensive background 
investigations and suitability standards. &nbsp;In some cases, a casino license 
may be subject to revocation at any time by government officials. &nbsp;There 
can be no assurance that our prospective casino customers will be able to obtain
new licenses or renew any of their existing licenses, or that if such licenses 
are obtained, that such licenses will not be conditioned, suspended or revoked. 
&nbsp;The loss, denial or non-renewal of any of their licenses could have a 
material adverse effect on their and our business, financial condition, results 
of operations or cash flows.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Casinos are 
Subject to Anti-Money Laundering Laws.</I> &nbsp;Our prospective casino 
customers will deal with significant amounts of cash in their operations and 
will be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. 
&nbsp;Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations, or any 
accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money
laundering activities, by any of the properties, employees, or customers of our 
prospective casino customers could have a material adverse effect on their 
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Travel 
Concerns.</I> &nbsp;Casinos are sensitive to the willingness of customers to 
travel. &nbsp;Only a small amount of our potential casino customers&#146; 
business will be generated by local residents. &nbsp;Most of their customers 
travel to reach their properties. &nbsp;Acts of terrorism may severely disrupt 
domestic and international travel, which would result in a decrease in customer 
visits to our potential customers&#146; properties. &nbsp;Regional conflicts 
could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel. &nbsp;We 
cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel 
as a result of any further terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities or escalation 
of war would have on our potential casino customers&#146; financial condition, 
results of operations or cash flows.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Win 
Rates.</I> &nbsp;Win rates for casinos gaming operations depend on a variety of 
factors, some beyond their control. &nbsp;Consequently, the winnings of a 
casino&#146;s gaming customers could exceed the casino&#146;s winnings. 
&nbsp;The gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. &nbsp;In 
addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors,
including the players&#146; skill and experience, the mix of games played, the 
financial resources of the players, the spread of table limits, the volume of 
bets placed and the amount of time played. &nbsp;Our potential casino 
customers&#146; gaming profits are expected to mainly derive from the difference
between their casino winnings and the casino winnings of their gaming customers.
&nbsp;Since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, our 
potential casino customers will not have full control over their winnings or the
winnings of their gaming customers. &nbsp;If the winnings of their gaming 
customers exceed their winnings, they may record a loss from gaming operations, 
which could have a material adverse effect on their (and our) business, 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Fraud and 
Cheating Issues.</I> &nbsp;Casinos face the risk of fraud and cheating. 
&nbsp;Our potential casino customers&#146; will most likely face attempts by 
some of their customers to commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. 
&nbsp;Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or 
other tactics, possibly in collusion with a casino&#146;s employees. 
&nbsp;Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through 
collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or 
gaming area staff. &nbsp;Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely 
manner could result in losses to our potential casino customers gaming 
operations. &nbsp;In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could
have an adverse effect on our potential casino customers&#146; reputations, 
likely causing a material adverse effect on their (and our) business, financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Limited 
Markets.</I> &nbsp;Because we expect to be dependent primarily upon gaming 
operations in two markets,
&nbsp;
Central and South America, initially in Columbia, for all of our cash flow, we 
will be subject to greater risks than competitors with more casino customers or 
which operate in more markets. &nbsp;We do not currently have any casino 
equipment leasing operations. &nbsp;As a result, we do not have any current cash
flow from operations.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Given that our 
operations are initially expected to be conducted only in Columbia, we will be 
subject to greater degrees of risk than competitors with more operating 
properties or that operate in more markets. &nbsp;The risks to which we will 
have a greater degree of exposure will include the following:</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Tax Laws and 
Regulations.</I> &nbsp;Changes in tax laws and regulations could impact our 
financial condition and results of operations. &nbsp;We will be subject to 
taxation and regulation by various governmental agencies, primarily in Columbia,
and other Central and South American countries, and the United States (federal, 
state and local levels). &nbsp;From time to time, U.S. federal, state, local and
foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of
these rules, which could result in higher taxes than would be incurred under 
existing tax law or interpretation. &nbsp;In particular, governmental agencies 
may make changes that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize
from our non-U.S. operations. &nbsp;Like most U.S. companies, our effective 
income tax rate will reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside 
the U.S. is taxed at local rates, which are often lower than U.S. tax rates. 
&nbsp;If changes in tax laws and regulations were to significantly increase the 
tax rates on non-U.S. income, these changes could increase our income tax 
expense and liability, and therefore, could have an adverse effect on our 
effective income tax rate, financial condition and results of operations.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Financial 
Markets Financing Concerns.</I> &nbsp;Disruptions in the financial markets could
have an adverse effect on our ability to raise additional financing. &nbsp;To 
expand our casino equipment leasing business, we will need to finance the 
purchase of new casino equipment. &nbsp;We currently do not have any 
arrangements to obtain debt or equity capital to finance new equipment 
purchases, and if we do not obtain such capital we may be unable to expand our 
anticipated operations. &nbsp;Severe disruptions in the commercial credit 
markets in the recent past have resulted in a tightening of credit markets 
worldwide. &nbsp;Liquidity in the global credit markets was severely contracted 
by these market disruptions, making it difficult and costly to obtain new lines 
of credit or to refinance existing debt. &nbsp;The effect of these disruptions 
was widespread and difficult to quantify. &nbsp;While economic conditions have 
recently improved, that trend may not continue and the extent of the current 
economic improvement is unknown. &nbsp;Any future disruptions in the commercial 
credit markets may impact liquidity in the global credit market as greatly, or 
even more, than in recent years.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our business and
financing plan may be dependent upon completion of future financings. &nbsp;If 
the credit environment worsens, it may be difficult to obtain any additional 
financing on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our ability
to complete our planned projects, and as a consequence, our results of 
operations and business plans. &nbsp;Should general economic conditions not 
improve, if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding or applicable government 
approvals such that completion of planned projects is not probable, or should 
management decide to abandon certain projects, all or a portion of our 
investment to date in our planned projects could be lost and would result in an 
impairment charge.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Currency 
Risks.</I> &nbsp;Our potential casino customers will be subject to currency 
risks. &nbsp;Our gaming equipment lease provides for lease payments in U.S. 
dollars, while our lessees will conduct business in the currency of the country 
where the lessee is located. &nbsp;Accordingly, our lessees&#146; ability to 
make lease payments will be subject to our lessees&#146; ability to convert the 
foreign currency into U.S. dollars. &nbsp;As a result, our lessee&#146;s ability
to make lease payments will be subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of 
the applicable foreign currency against the U.S. dollar, as well as local laws 
and regulations which may limit or impair a foreign person or entity&#146;s 
ability to convert the subject foreign currency to U.S. dollars.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Our Legal 
Rights and Remedies are Uncertain in the Event of a Default by a Lessee.</I> 
&nbsp;In the event we are required to take any legal action under a lease of our
casino equipment, such as to repossess our equipment, we would be required to do
so in the courts, and under the laws, of the country where the equipment is 
located. &nbsp;The legal systems of foreign countries may not allow for the 
repossession of equipment as quickly and as cost-effectively as in the U.S., 
with the result that we may face greater delays and expenses in exercising any 
rights under our leases. &nbsp;Consequently, losses due to a default by a lessee
may be greater than otherwise would be the case.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt"><I>Conflict of 
Interest.</I> &nbsp;Paul Parliament, our chairman, president, chief executive
officer, and director, has an indirect conflict of interest inasmuch as he has a
private business relationship with Game Touch Technologies Inc., a company 
controlled by one of our consultants and current major stockholder, Julios 
Kosta, from whom Mr. Parliament purchased gaming equipment. &nbsp;Game Touch has
no business relationship with Goldland Holdings.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Competition</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">To the extent we
expand leasing our casino equipment to more than one operator we will face 
competition from casino equipment suppliers, leasing affiliates of casino 
equipment suppliers, and independent leasing companies. &nbsp;Most of our 
potential competitors have far greater resources than we have and have far 
greater experience in the casino industry than we possess.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Markets and Major 
Customers</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">While all

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Because we 
intend to lease our gaming equipment pursuant to master leases, we do not expect
that our revenues and earnings from our casino equipment line of business will 
be affected by seasonal factors. &nbsp;However, casino lessees may be located in
resort or vacation locations, which make their operations subject to seasonal 
fluctuations, which may affect our cash flows.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our future 
operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a 
variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. &nbsp;Our anticipated
expense levels are based, in part, on our estimates of future revenues and may 
vary from projections. &nbsp;We may be unable to adjust spending rapidly enough 
to compensate for any unexpected revenues shortfall. &nbsp;Accordingly, any 
significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our planned expenditures would 
materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial 
condition. &nbsp;Further, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our 
operating results are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future

mining operations by our lessee have been terminated on our mining leases, the 
following discussion of Risk Factors relates only to our gaming equipment

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Goldland

equipment business and prospects. &nbsp;You must consider the risks and 
uncertainties frequently encountered by companies whose businesses deal with 
gaming equipment leasing. &nbsp;If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks
and uncertainties, our business, results of operations and financial condition 
will be materially and adversely affected.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; page-break-before:always"><B>Our 
auditors have stated we may not be able to stay in business.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our auditors 
have issued a going concern opinion, which means that there is substantial doubt
that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. &nbsp;Unless
we can raise additional capital, we may not be able to achieve our objectives 
and may have to suspend or cease operations. &nbsp;See &#147;Item 7. 
&nbsp;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations.&#148; &nbsp;In the future, we may raise additional 
capital though equity or debt offerings.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Our future revenues are 
unpredictable and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
significantly.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Although 
Goldland Holdings was incorporated in 1989, we have had only a limited operating
history, and have no recent revenues. &nbsp;We cannot forecast with any degree 
of certainty whether our proposed gaming equipment leasing business will ever 
generate revenue or the amount of revenue to be generated. &nbsp;In addition, we
cannot predict the consistency of our quarterly operating results.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We estimate that
we will need at least $300,000 to fund our operations over the next 12 months, 
in addition to repaying or refinancing promissory notes, which are due within 12
to 24 months. &nbsp;The outstanding liabilities include $158, 498 due to 
directors.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>We may have difficulty in 
attracting and retaining management and outside independent members to our board
of directors as a result of their concerns relating to their increased personal 
exposure to lawsuits and stockholder claims by virtue of holding these positions
in a publicly held company.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our shares of 
common stock are publicly traded on the &#147;OTCPK&#148; operated by OTC 
Markets Group, Inc. discussed below. &nbsp;The directors and management of 
publicly traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their
personal exposure to lawsuits and stockholder claims, as well as governmental 
and creditor claims which may be made against them, particularly in view of 
recent changes in securities laws imposing additional duties, obligations and 
liabilities on management and directors. &nbsp;Due to these perceived risks, 
directors and management are also becoming increasingly concerned with the 
availability of directors and officers&#146; liability insurance to pay on a 
timely basis the costs incurred in defending such claims. &nbsp;We currently do 
not carry directors and officers&#146; liability insurance. &nbsp;Directors and 
officers&#146; liability insurance has recently become much more expensive and 
difficult to obtain. &nbsp;If we are unable to provide directors and 
officers&#146; liability insurance at affordable rates or at all, it may become 
increasingly more difficult to attract and retain qualified outside directors to
serve on our board of directors.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Compliance with changing 
regulation of financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure 
may result in additional expenses and diversion of management time and attention
from operational activities.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Compliance with 
changing laws, regulations and standards relating to financial reporting, 
corporate governance and public disclosure, including new accounting standards, 
SEC regulations, and FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) rules, are 
time consuming and expensive. &nbsp;We have spent substantial amounts of 
management time and have incurred substantial legal and accounting expense in 
the past in complying with these federal securities laws. &nbsp;Complying with 
these laws and regulations also creates uncertainty for companies such as ours. 
&nbsp;These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying
interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. &nbsp;As a 
result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is 
provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing 
uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by 
ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Any claims or threats of 
litigation could distract us from business operations and strategic planning, 
and costs of litigation or settlement could adversely affect our financial 
condition or results of operations.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Any claims made 
or litigation commenced against us, or our officers or directors, may distract 
our board of directors, management, or other key employees from business 
operations and strategic planning. &nbsp;There may also be an increase versus 
prior periods in potential claims or litigation relative to our operational 
growth. &nbsp;Claims resolution frequently entails a cost/benefit analysis, 
which would include consideration of the potential risks, expenses and impact to
business operations. &nbsp;We may determine to litigate or settle such claims 
(including threatened claims) even if we believe those claims have little or no 
merit. &nbsp;The cost of litigation or settlements could adversely affect our 
financial condition or our results of operations.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>We have a very small management
team and the loss of any member of this team may prevent us from implementing 
our business plan in a timely manner; our management has substantial outside 
business interests.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We have four 
executive officers and a limited number of additional consultants. &nbsp;Our 
success depends largely upon the continued services of Paul Parliament, our 
chairman, president, chief executive officer, and director, Martin Wolfe, our 
chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, and director, Douglas 
Brooks, our vice president and director, and Richard Kaiser, our secretary and 
corporate governance officer. &nbsp;We need additional executive personnel in 
order to fulfill our business plan and satisfy our reporting obligations as a 
public company in a timely fashion. &nbsp;We do not maintain key person life 
insurance policies on the lives of any of our officers. &nbsp;The loss of any of
our officers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results 
of operations. &nbsp;In such an event, we may not be able to recruit personnel 
to replace our officers in a timely manner, or at all, on acceptable terms.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Furthermore, the
employment agreements with our executive officers permit them to have outside 
business interests, such that they are not required to devote 100% of their 
working time to our business. &nbsp;Mr. Parliament estimates that he spends 
about 80% of his working time on activities related to the activities of Bravo 
Multinational Incorporated . &nbsp;Mr. Wolfe estimates that he spends about 60% 
of his working time on our activities. &nbsp;Mr. Brooks estimates that he spends
about 60% of his working time on activities of Bravo Multinational 
Incorporated . &nbsp;Mr. Kaiser estimates that he spends about 60% of his 
working time on activities of Bravo Multinational Incorporated . &nbsp;The fact 
that Messrs. Parliament, Wolfe, Brooks, and Kaiser have outside business 
interests could lessen their focus on our business.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>We have substantial commitments
that may require that we raise capital.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">As of December 
31, 2015, we had current assets of $441,952 current liabilities of 
$278,898Included in current assets are prepaid expenses related to a marking 
agreement capital deficit of $237,914. &nbsp;A substantial part of our current 
liabilities consist of debts that we only have to pay if funds are available, 
such as amounts due related parties of $6,328. &nbsp;However, we have $168,262 
of accounts payable to third parties. &nbsp;Our officers also have agreed to
receive a portion their salaries in the form of shares of our common stock. 
&nbsp;If our officers do not agree to receive our stock in payment of their 
salaries, and we are unable to make payments in cash, we will have to raise 
capital in order to pay our liabilities, which we expect would be dilutive to 
existing stockholders.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>The continuing uncertainty in 
national and global economic conditions could negatively affect our business, 
results of operations and financial condition.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The recent 
financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the 
continuing uncertainty in national and global economic conditions resulted in a 
tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial 
markets and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. 
&nbsp;It is difficult to estimate the exact impact of the economic crisis on our
business. &nbsp;There could still be a number of unforeseen or unidentified 
follow-on effects from these economic developments on our business and our 
potential casino customers. &nbsp;National economic risks that we have 
considered in our planning processes in the past 12 months include risks 
associated with the inability or unwillingness of banks to fund draws on 
revolving credit facilities, failure of our potential customers to pay us on a 
timely basis or at all, and delays in business and litigation-related 
expenditures by our potential customers. &nbsp;If the global economy or the U.S.
economy remains uncertain or weakens further, the consequences could have an 
adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.</P>

Properties</I></B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">As we discussed 
above, although we still own our mining properties, we do not have a lessee

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>We have minimal revenue to date
from our mining properties, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve 
our business objectives.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Since acquiring 
our mining properties in September 2007, we have experienced losses from our 
operations.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>The properties in which we have
an interest do not have any known reserves.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">None of the 
properties in which we have an interest have any known reserves. &nbsp;To date, 
we have engaged in only limited preliminary exploration activities on the 
properties. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient information upon which to 
assess the ultimate success of our exploration efforts.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Silver Falcon, our lessee, has 
a limited operating history as a mining company, which may hinder Silver 
Falcon&#146;s ability to make lease and royalty payments to us.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We do not have 
any operating history as a mining company upon which to base an evaluation of 
our current business and future prospects. &nbsp;We have only owned mining 
properties since our acquisition of properties on War Eagle Mountain in 
September 2007. &nbsp;Silver Falcon has only a limited operating history as a 
mining company. &nbsp;Silver Falcon first entered the mining industry when it 
leased our properties on War Eagle Mountain in October 2007. &nbsp;We do not 
have an established history of locating and developing properties that have 
mining reserves. &nbsp;Currently, Silver Falcon is in default with respect to
our lease and is not conducting any mining operations on our mining 
properties.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt" align=justify><B>There are 
uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. &nbsp;Any defects in 
such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and 
jeopardize our business operations.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our mineral 
properties consist of private mineral rights, leases covering private lands, 
leases of patented mining claims and unpatented mining claims. Many of our 
mining properties in the United States are unpatented mining claims located on 
lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (&#147;BLM&#148;), 
Idaho State Office to which we have only possessory title. &nbsp;Because title 
to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, it is 
difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims. &nbsp;These 
uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper 
location and posting and marking of boundaries, and possible conflicts with 
other claims not determinable from descriptions of record. &nbsp;We believe a 
substantial portion of all mineral exploration, development and mining in the 
United States now occurs on unpatented mining claims, and this uncertainty is 
inherent in the mining industry.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The present 
status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the 
right to mine and remove valuable minerals, such as precious and base metals, 
from the claims conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting
programs. &nbsp;We also are generally allowed to use the surface of the land 
solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral-bearing ores. 
&nbsp;However, legal ownership of the land remains with the United States. 
&nbsp;We remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the 
United States or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with 
statutory requirements. &nbsp;Prior to 1994, a mining claim locator who was able
to prove the discovery of valuable, locatable minerals on a mining claim, and to
meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures 
pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims, 
had the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the 
mining claim from the Federal government. &nbsp;The right to pursue a patent, 
however, has been subject to a moratorium since October 1994, through federal 
legislation restricting the BLM from accepting any new mineral patent 
applications. &nbsp;If we do not obtain fee title to our unpatented mining 
claims, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain compensation 
in connection with the forfeiture of such claims.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">There may be 
challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material 
interest. &nbsp;If there are title defects with respect to any properties, we 
might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in 
the affected property. &nbsp;Also, in any such case, the investigation and 
resolution of title issues would divert our management&#146;s time from ongoing 
production, exploration and development programs.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We only own a 
29.167% undivided interest in 76.63 acres of land on War Eagle Mountain. 
&nbsp;Under Idaho law, we are required to pay the other joint tenant owners of 
the land their pro rata share of any net revenues we derive from minerals 
extracted from their property, less operating costs we incur. &nbsp;We do not 
have any formal agreement with the majority owners of the 76.63 acres of land on
War Eagle Mountain regarding the allocation of revenues between 76.63 acres in 
which they have an interest and the other acreage we own or lease on War Eagle 
Mountain, or the determination and allocation of costs properly chargeable
against revenues allocated to their interests. &nbsp;Accordingly, there is a 
possibility that we may get into disputes with the majority owners of the 76.63

a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float, 
limited operating history and lack of net revenues which could lead to wide 
fluctuations in our share price. &nbsp;The price at which you purchased our 
common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading
market.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The market for 
our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared 
to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more
volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. &nbsp;As a 
consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small 
quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the 
price of those shares in either direction. &nbsp;The price for our shares could,
for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of
our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared
to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse 
impact on its share price.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Secondly, we are
a speculative or &#147;risky&#148; investment due to our lack of current 
revenues. &nbsp;As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse 
investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the 
event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their 
shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the 
case with the stock of a seasoned issuer.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>An investor may be unable to 
sell his common stock at or above his purchase price, which may result in 
substantial losses to the investor.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">The following 
factors may add to the volatility in the price of our common stock: actual or 
anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; government 
regulations, announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships 
or joint ventures; our capital commitments; and additions or departures of our 
key personnel. &nbsp;Many of these factors are beyond our control and may 
decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating 
performance. &nbsp;We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the 
prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as 
to whether our common stock will sustain the current market price, or as to what
effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any 
time will have on the prevailing market price.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>We may need to raise additional
capital. &nbsp;If we are unable to raise necessary additional capital, our 
business may fail or our operating results and our stock price may be materially
adversely affected.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We need to 
secure adequate funding. &nbsp;We hope to be able to fund our business through 
the revenues from operations. &nbsp;If our revenues are insufficient, we will 
need to raise the necessary capital through equity or debt offerings, which may 
reduce the value of our outstanding securities. &nbsp;We may be unable to secure
additional financing on favorable terms or at all.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Selling 
additional shares of our common stock, either privately or publicly, would 
dilute the equity interests of our stockholders. &nbsp;If we borrow more money, 
we will have to pay interest and may also have to agree to restrictions that 
limit our operating flexibility. &nbsp;If we are unable to obtain adequate 
financing, we may have to curtail our operations and our business would 
fail.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>Our issuance of additional 
common stock in exchange for services or to repay debt would dilute a 
stockholder&#146;s proportionate ownership and voting rights and could have a 
negative impact on the market price of our common stock.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our board of 
directors may generally issue shares of common stock to pay for debt or 
services, without further approval by our stockholders based upon such factors 
as our board of directors may deem relevant at that time. &nbsp;It is likely 
that we will issue additional securities to pay for services and reduce debt in 
the future. &nbsp;In fact, our current employment agreements with Messrs. 
Parliament, Wolfe, Brooks, and Kaiser, as well as various consultants, call for 
the issuance of shares of our common stock to pay a portion, if not all, of the 
compensation to be due to them. &nbsp;It is possible that we will issue 
additional shares of common stock under circumstances we may deem appropriate at
the time.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt"><B>The elimination of monetary 
liability against our directors, officers and employees under our certificate of
incorporation and the existence of indemnification rights for our directors, 
officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by <FONT 
FACE="Times New Roman">Bravo Multinational </FONT> and may discourage lawsuits 
against our directors, officers and employees.</B></P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our certificate 
of incorporation contains provisions which eliminate the liability of our 
directors for monetary damages to <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Bravo 
Multinational </FONT> and our stockholders. &nbsp;Our bylaws also require us to 
indemnify our officers and directors. &nbsp;We may also have contractual
indemnification obligations under our agreements with our directors, officers 
and employees. &nbsp;The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in 
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Bravo Multinational </FONT> incurring substantial 
expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors,
officers and employees, which we may be unable to recoup. &nbsp;These provisions
and resultant costs may also discourage <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Bravo

employees for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage 
the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors,

Richard Corrigan, acting as a debtor in possession in his personal bankruptcy 
case, filed an adversary proceeding against us to recover amounts allegedly due 
under a consulting agreement dated July 1, 2009. &nbsp;The consulting agreement 
stated that Mr. Corrigan would provide certain consulting, mapping and assaying 
services on three lode claims owned by Goldland Holdings on War Eagle Mountain. 
&nbsp;The consulting agreement further provided that Mr. Corrigan&#146;s 
compensation would be a bonus of 150,000 shares of our common stock, valued by 
mutual agreement at approximately $150,000, and monthly consulting payments of 
$5,000 per month. &nbsp;The consulting agreement also provided that Mr. Corrigan
was entitled to monthly transportation expenses of $250 per month. &nbsp;We 
terminated Mr. Corrigan on December 8, 2009, for non-performance. &nbsp;In 2011,
Mr. Corrigan&#146;s filed a Chapter 7 proceeding seeking recovery of the alleged
$150,000 bonus and the balance of the unpaid consulting fees and travel expense 
allowance of $60,900, for a total of $210,900, plus interest and attorney 
fees.</P>

default judgment. &nbsp;On September 15, 2014, the court ordered the payment of 
150,000 shares of our common shares to Mr. Corrigan to conclude the matter.
&nbsp;We issued the shares on January 13, 2015.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Our financial 
statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States. &nbsp;Preparing financial 
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. &nbsp;These 
estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of 
accounting policies. &nbsp;Critical accounting policies include revenue 
recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We recognize 
revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, &#147;Revenue 
Recognition in Financial Statements.&#148; &nbsp;Sales are recorded when 
products are shipped to customers. &nbsp;Provisions for discounts and rebates to
customers, estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided 
for in the same period the related sales are recorded.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">We evaluate our 
long-lived assets for financial impairment on a regular basis in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, &#147;Accounting for the 
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; which evaluates the 
recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by measuring the carrying 
amount of the assets against the estimated discounted future cash flows 
associated with them. &nbsp;At the time such evaluations indicate that the 
future discounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to 
recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair
values.</P>

of our transactions, including those with foreign suppliers and customers, in 
U.S. dollars. We are therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign 
currency fluctuations and do not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments
in an attempt to minimize such risks. &nbsp;Demand from foreign customers and 
the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to 
us may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or 
supplier&#146;s domestic currency to the value of the U.S. dollar. 
&nbsp;Furthermore, changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar may change 
the price of our products relative to the prices of our foreign competitors.</P>

cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification. 
&nbsp;These amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the 
Accounting Standards Codification and conforming amendments related to fair 
value measurements. &nbsp;The amendments in this update were effective for

350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment&#148; in 
Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02. &nbsp;This update amends ASU 2011-08, 
Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived 
Intangible Assets for Impairment and permits an entity first to assess 
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an 
indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether
it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with 
Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - General Intangibles Other 
than Goodwill. &nbsp;The amendments are effective for annual and interim 
impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. 
&nbsp;Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim impairment 
tests performed as of a date before July 27, 2012, if a public entity&#146;s 
financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet 
been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for

&nbsp;This update defers the requirement to present items that are reclassified 
from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in both the statement 
of income where net income is presented and the statement where other 
comprehensive income is presented. &nbsp;The adoption of ASU 2011-12 is not

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities&#148; (&#147;ASU 2011-11&#148;). &nbsp;This 
Update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related 
arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the 
effect of those arrangements on its financial position. &nbsp;The objective of 
this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare 
their financial statements on the basis of U.S. GAAP and those entities that 
prepare their financial statements on the basis of IFRS. &nbsp;The amended 
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January
1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. &nbsp;We are currently
evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this pronouncement may have

&nbsp;We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the 
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and 
principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined) in Exchange Act Rules 13a &#150; 15(c) and 15d &#150; 
15(e)). &nbsp;Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief 
financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period ended December 31,
2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective (1) to ensure 
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or 
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, 
within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms and (2) to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we 
file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to us, 
including our chief executive and chief financial officers, as appropriate to 
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:7.35pt; text-indent:39.6pt">The term 
disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an 
issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by 
the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (15 
U.S.C. 78a, <I>et seq.</I>) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, 
within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. 
&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls 
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by 
an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is 
accumulated and communicated to the issuer&#146;s management, including its 
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing 
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required 
disclosure.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:7.35pt; text-indent:39.6pt">Our 
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, 
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal 
controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. &nbsp;A 
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system 
are met. &nbsp;Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact 
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be 
considered relative to their costs. &nbsp;Because of inherent limitations in all
control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or 
detect misstatements, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute 
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the 
registrant have been detected. &nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>

<P style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:10pt; text-indent:36pt">Other than the 
foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although 
the board may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in our best 
interests as well as our stockholders. &nbsp;In addition, the board identifies 
nominees by first evaluating the current members of the board willing to 
continue in service. &nbsp;Current members of the board with skills and 
experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in 
service are considered for re-nomination. &nbsp;If any member of the board does 
not wish to continue in service or if the board decides not to re-nominate a 
member for re-election, the board then identifies the desired skills and 
experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. &nbsp;Current 
members of the board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the 
criteria described above. &nbsp;The board may also engage in research to 
identify qualified individuals. &nbsp;To date, we have not engaged third parties
to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we
reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search firm, if 
necessary. &nbsp;The board does not typically consider stockholder nominees 
because it believes that its current nomination process is sufficient to 
identify directors who serve our best interests.</P>

Mr. Wolfe) of 3,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and 87,116,985

CO.</B></P>
<P style="line-height:13pt; margin-top:7.5pt; margin-bottom:0pt; padding-
left:13.7pt" align=justify>We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of 
Bravo Multinational Corporation formerly Goldland Holdings Co. as of December
31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then 
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audit.</P>
<P style="line-height:13pt; margin-top:7.5pt; margin-bottom:0pt; padding-
left:13.7pt" align=justify>We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged 
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our 
audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a 
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no 
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P style="line-height:13pt; margin-top:7.5pt; margin-bottom:0pt; padding-
left:13.7pt" align=justify>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bravo 
Multinational Corporation formerly Goldland Holdings Co. at December 31, 2015 
and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows 
for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.</P>
<P style="line-height:13pt; margin-top:7.5pt; margin-bottom:0pt; padding-
left:13.7pt" align=justify>The accompanying financial statements have been 
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As 
discussed in Note 11, the Company has incurred significant accumulated deficits,
recurring operating losses and a negative working capital. This and other 
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a 
going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also discussed 
in Note 11. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might 
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

&#147;we&#148; or &#147;us&#148;) was originally formed as Montrose Ventures, 
Inc. in the State of Delaware on May 25, 1989. On April 23, 1996, the 
Company&#146;s name was changed to Java Group, Inc., and on September 1, 2004 
the name was changed to Consolidated General Corp. &nbsp;On August 7, 2007, the 
company&#146;s name was changed to GoldCorp Holdings Co. On October 15, 2010, 
our name was changed to GoldLand Holdings Co. On April 6, 2016, we. changed our 
corporate name to Bravo Multinational Incorporated. &nbsp;On March 22, 2016, the
board of directors of the company, pursuant to Section 242 of the Delaware 
General Corporation Law, determined it was in the best interests of the company 
that the name of the company should be changed to Bravo Multinational 
Incorporated, with such change of name to be effective upon compliance with all 
regulatory requirements mandated by FINRA. &nbsp;Further, as a result of the 
change of the company&#146;s name and upon satisfaction of all regulatory 
requirements, the trading symbol for the shares of the compant&#146;s common 
stock should be changed to &#147;BRVO,&#148; and the company&#146;s CUSIP 
identifier be changed to a newly issued number. &nbsp;FINRA granted its approval
of the change of the company&#146;s name on April 6, 2015. &nbsp;As a result of 
the change of name of thecompany, the company&#146;s trading symbol was changed 
to &#147;BRVO&#148; and the CUSIP identifier was changed to 10568F109.</P>
<P style="line-height:12.8pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:36pt">The company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC on April 7, 2016, 
announcing the change of name, trading symbol, and CUSIP identifier.</P>
<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>The Company owns land
and lease claims on War Eagle Mountain in the state of Idaho. &nbsp;The Company 
has entered into a lease agreement with Silver Falcon Mining, Inc. (&#147;Silver
Falcon&#148;) under which Silver Falcon is entitled to mine the land and the 
Company is entitled to a 15% net royalty on all minerals extracted by Silver 
Falcon from tailing piles on the premises or through shafts or adits located on 
the premises.</P>
<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>On September 19, 
2013, our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into an asset purchase agreement to 
acquire certain gaming equipment from Universal Entertainment SAS, Ltd., a 
corporation formed under the laws of the Country of Colombia, for 17,450,513 
shares of our common stock (post-split). Closing was conditioned on our 
completion of a 1 for 10 reverse stock split, among other things. The equipment 
includes approximately 67 video poker and slot machines; 8 blackjack and 
miscellaneous game tables and related furniture and equipment; roulette table 
and related furniture and equipment; bingo equipment and furniture; casino 
chips, bill acceptors, coin counter and related equipment; and miscellaneous 
office equipment, like chairs, tables, etc. We completed the reverse split in
March 2014, and completed the purchase on March 6, 2014. Upon closing of the 
acquisition, we simultaneously leased the equipment to VOMBLOM &amp; POMARE 
S.A., a company formed under the laws of Colombia, which provides for lease 
payments of $700,000 per year, payable $58,333 per month, and a term of five 
years with one five year renewal option. This lease was subsequently 
suspended.</P>

<P style="margin-top:3.35pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>Cash and cash

  Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the 
useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and recorded at
cost. The facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line 
method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated 
productive lives, which do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, of such 
facilities based on proven and probable reserves.</P>

Long-Lived Assets</I></B></P>
<P style="margin-top:3.35pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>The Company 
reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable.</P>
<P style="margin-top:3.35pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>An impairment is 
considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted 
basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets, including goodwill, if 
any.</P>
<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>An impairment loss is
measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future 
cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected 
gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, 
price trends and related factors), production levels and operating costs of 
production and capital, all based on life-of-mine plans. Existing proven and 
probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including 
mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that 
is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included 
when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and,
subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term 
&#147;recoverable minerals&#148; refers to the estimated amount of gold or other
commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore 
processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such 
exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management&#146;s
relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets 
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that
are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The 
Company&#146;s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions 
and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different
than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold 
and other commodity prices, production levels and operating costs of production 
and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.</P>
<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" 
align=justify><B><I>Goodwill</I></B></P>
<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>The Company 
evaluates, on at least an annual basis during the fourth quarter, the carrying 
amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances 
indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish 
this, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to 
their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its 
estimated fair value, the Company compares the implied fair value of the 
reporting unit&#146;s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the 
carrying value over the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company&#146;s 
fair value estimates are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that 
actual fair value will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual 
future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, 
production levels and operating costs of production and capital are each subject
to significant risks and uncertainties.</P>

<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:6.65pt" align=justify>The Company&#146;s
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the 
Company&#146;s Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the 
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience 
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these 
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>Basic earnings per 
common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by 
the weighted average number of common shares assumed to be outstanding during 
the period of computation. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to 
basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the 
potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were
dilutive. Because we have incurred net losses, basic and diluted loss per share 
are the same since additional potential common shares would be anti-
dilutive.</P>

<P style="margin-top:3.35pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>In July 2013, ASC 
guidance was issued related to the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit 
when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit 
carryforward exists. The updated guidance requires an entity to net its 
unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same
jurisdiction net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or tax credit 
carryforwards. A gross presentation will be required only if such carryforwards 
are not available or would not be used by the entity to settle any additional 
income taxes resulting from disallowance of the uncertain tax position. The 
update is effective prospectively for the Company&#146;s fiscal year beginning 
January&nbsp;1, 2014. The Company is still evaluating the impact of the updated 
guidance on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash

owned and leased acreage on War Eagle Mountain, Idaho to Silver Falcon. 
&nbsp;Silver Falcon is responsible for all mining activities on our land, and we
are entitled to annual lease payments of $1,000,000 per year payable monthly, a 
non accountable expense allowance of $10,000 per month for any month in which 
ore is mined from our property, and a net royalty of 15% from any proceeds 
payable to Silver Falcon by the refiner of ore produced from tailing piles on 
the premises or through shafts or adits located on the premises. &nbsp;The lease
initially provided that lease payments must commence April 1, 2008. 
&nbsp;Because Silver Falcon has been unable to commence operations according to 
its original schedule, we have agreed to extend the commencement date several 
times, to January 1, 2012. &nbsp;</P>
<P style="margin-top:5pt; margin-bottom:0pt" align=justify>In the first quarter 
of 2011, we amended the above-described lease with Silver Falcon. &nbsp;The 
amendment provided that the annual lease payments would be deferred for a 
fifteen-month period from October 2010 to December 2011, and the term of the 
Lease would be extended for an equal amount of time. Silver Falcon remains 
remain obligated to pay any royalties or the non-accountable fee that accrues 
during the deferral period. &nbsp;Several of our officers and directors were 
also officers and directors of Silver Falcon. It is the intention of the company
to enforce collection of all amounts owing under the lease, however, due to the 
uncertainty of collection, no amounts have been included in the current

expenses of $250 per month. We terminated Mr. Corrigan on December 8, 2009 for 
non-performance. &nbsp;In 2011, Mr. Corrigan&#146;s filed a Chapter 7 case. In
