</p>
<p>1. During the course of the visit of the Special Rapporteur to New Zealand between 18 
and 24 July 2010, he met with Government authorities, representatives of Maori 
communities and organizations, and others, in places in and around Auckland, Wellington, 
Waitangi, Hamilton and Whanganui. The Special Rapporteur visited a number of Maori 
communities in both rural and urban areas, and collected information from various sources. 
He expresses his appreciation for the support of the Government, in particular the Ministry 
of Maori Affairs, and the Maori individuals and organizations that provided indispensible 
support in planning and coordinating the visit. The Special Rapporteur would especially 
like to thank those Maori peoples that invited him into their marae and communities, and 
shared with him aspects of their unique and vibrant culture. 
</p>
<p>2. At the invitation of the Government, and with the encouragement of Maori leaders, 
the Special Rapporteur visited New Zealand to follow up on the work of Rodolfo 
Stavenhagen, the previous Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, who visited the country in 2005.   
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur observed several positive aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s legal 
and policy landscape, as well as ongoing challenges, in relation to Maori issues. A unique 
feature of New Zealand is the Treaty of Waitangi of 1840, which is understood to be one of 
the country&#8217;s founding instruments. The principles of the Treaty provide a foundation for 
Maori self-determination based on a real partnership between Maori and the State of New 
Zealand, within a framework of respect for cross-cultural understanding and the human 
rights of all citizens. The Special Rapporteur learned of steps being taken within this 
framework, which can be described as constituting a good practice in the making, and 
hopes that concerted efforts will continue to be made in this regard.  
</p>
<p>4. It should be noted that certain initiatives under way in New Zealand represent 
important steps towards advancing the purpose and objectives of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This Declaration, far from affirming 
rights that place indigenous peoples in a privileged position, aims at repairing the ongoing 
consequences of the historical denial of the right to self-determination and other basic 
human rights. The Special Rapporteur is very pleased to note that New Zealand recently 
declared its endorsement of the Declaration, thus joining the overwhelming majority of 
States that have expressed their support for this historic instrument.  
</p>
<p>5. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was especially interested in examining the 
process for settling historical and contemporary claims based on the Treaty of Waitangi, a 
matter that was addressed in detail in the report of his predecessor. The Special Rapporteur 
notes that the treaty settlement process is clearly one of the most important examples in the 
world of an effort to address historical and ongoing grievances of indigenous peoples, and 
that settlements already achieved have provided significant benefits in several cases. The 
Waitangi Tribunal, which is connected to the treaty settlement process, itself provides an 
important venue for examining Maori claims. The Special Rapporteur notes the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to the ongoing functioning of the Waitangi Tribunal and steps 
it has taken to improve and accelerate the treaty settlement process, and he encourages 
further efforts towards this end.   
</p>
<p>6. However, during his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard complaints about the treaty 
settlement process that are similar to those reported by his predecessor. These include 
complaints about the inherent lack of bargaining power on the part of Maori in the 
settlement negotiations, the resulting lack of settlement outcomes that provide full and 
adequate redress to Maori grievances, and policies that restrict the transference of lands 
back into Maori ownership or control.   
</p>
<p>7. These complaints were highlighted to the Special Rapporteur in accounts of the 
recent refusal of the Government to allow for the possibility of the return of lands within </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.9 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>the Urewera National Park to the Tuhoe iwi (tribe). He respectfully urges the Government 
to reconsider this decision in the light of the merits of the Tuhoe claim and considerations 
of restorative justice, and to not preclude return of these lands to the Tuhoe in the future 
even if such return is not included in a near-term settlement.  
</p>
<p>8. Another matter raised by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor was the Foreshore 
and Seabed Act of 2004. The Special Rapporteur would like to take note of the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to repeal and reform this act, which he sees as a positive development 
since his predecessor&#8217;s visit. While recognizing that this process is still under way, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to urge the Government to ensure that the reform process 
includes an adequate dialogue with Maori people, and that the new legislative arrangement 
avoids any discriminatory effects and establishes measures to recognize and protect rights 
of iwi over the foreshore and seabed.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that all these concerns lend support 
to the assertion he repeatedly heard during his visit that the principles enshrined in the 
Treaty of Waitangi and related internationally protected human rights must be provided 
with constitutional security. The Special Rapporteur observed that the Treaty&#8217;s principles 
appear to be vulnerable to political discretion, resulting in their perpetual insecurity and 
instability. The Special Rapporteur understands that the Government has committed to 
undergo a process of review of constitutional arrangements as they relate to Maori people 
and encourages the Government to carry out these efforts with the full and adequate 
participation of Maori. 
</p>
<p>10. Finally, the Special Rapporteur cannot help but note the extreme disadvantage in the 
social and economic conditions of Maori people, which are dramatically manifested in the 
continued and persistent high levels of incarceration of Maori individuals. These troubling 
conditions undoubtedly result from the historical and ongoing denial of the human rights of 
Maori, which must continue to be addressed as a matter of upmost priority. In this regard, 
the Special Rapporteur is pleased to learn about a number of Government programmes to 
address this disadvantage, including the Whanau Ora programme, an initiative currently 
being developed by the Government, to be carried out in partnership with Maori people to 
address socio-economic concerns, especially through the strengthening of Maori families.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur will continue to examine these and other issues that have 
been brought to his attention in further detail, and will be issuing a full report providing 
observations and recommendations addressing these concerns. The Special Rapporteur 
looks forward to ongoing engagement and cooperation with the Government of New 
Zealand and Maori representatives with a view towards advancing the human rights of 
Maori people in Aotearoa.
