2.3 On or about 25th January 2006 on the Defendant's representation that he would look after the affairs of the Plaintiff's land and sugar cane Farm No. 13095, the Defendant requested the Plaintiff to execute certain documents at the office of Mr Sheik Shah.

2.4 The Defendant's representation was executing of the documents intended to allow the Defendant to manage the cane farm of the Plaintiff and her sister Rajebul Nisha under the said Fiji Sugar Corporation Contract No. 13095.

2.5 The Plaintiff alleged that she was induced by the Defendant to execute several documents at Mr Sheik Shah's Office and the Defendant accompanied her.

2.6 The Plaintiff later discovered the documents executed at Mr Shah's Office, Crop Lien over Farm No. 13095 and Mortgage over the Native Lease No. 26896 and the said instruments were registered as Mortgage No. 581827 and Crop Lien No. 81/2006. The said documents were prepared by Gibson & Company and Defendant took the documents to Mr Shah's Office for execution.

(l) Although the Defendant is owed the sum of $34,000, he only obtained a mortgage in the sum of $20,000. The Defendant was prepared to forego the sum of $14,000 as the Plaintiff and Rajebul Nisha are his daughters.

(21) The Plaintiff filed her Reply to Defence and Defence to Counter Claim on 3rd August 2010.

(22) Minutes of Pre-Trial Conference was filed on 8th February 2012.

Agreed facts:

1. The Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of all that piece of land comprised in Native Lease No. 26806 known as Turio No. 3 on Plan No. M1652.

2. Lease was acquired on 22nd day of May 2003 and is covered by Sugar Cane Contract No. 13095.

3. The said lease is encumbered to the Defendant pursuant memorandum of mortgage number 581827 registered on 7th February 2006 for a sum of $20,000.00.

4. The Defendant holds a Crop Lien over the said Farm No. 13095 at Wailevu Sector for a sum of $20,000.00.

The issues raised in the pre-trial conference limited to this issues:

1. Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs and orders sought by the Plaintiff in the pleadings?

2. Whether the Defendant is entitled to the reliefs and orders sought by the Defendant in the pleadings?

(23) The trial was taken up for hearing on 21st of June 2013 and the following witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff:

(i) The Plaintiff, Sarimun Nisha;

(ii) Shalendra Singh, Officer from Fiji Sugar Corporation.

The following witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the Defendant:

(i) Mohammed Hassan (the Defendant);

(ii) Sheik Shah;

(iii) Rajibul Nisha;

(iv) Mohammed Yashin;

(v) Mohammed Shahin.

(24) Before considering the legal submissions it's a matter for this court to satisfy whether the Plaintiff had proved her case.

24.1 The issues raised in the Pre-Trial Conference had been limited to 2 broad issues:

(a) as to whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs and orders sought by the Plaintiff in the pleadings?

(b) as to whether the Defendant is entitled to the reliefs and orders sought by the Defendant in the pleadings?

 As such the evidence before this case has to be properly analyzed, to make conclusions in this case.

24.2 There was no dispute with regard to Native Lease No. 26806 which is subject matter of this case marked as P1 in these proceedings.

24.3 Sarimun Nisha, the Plaintiff in her evidence admitted that the land was acquired by her father on her behalf. I reproduce the Plaintiff's evidence:

"&&..In 2003 I was living with my father, lease was given in 2003. Father paid all the costs. He paid $2,500.00 to the Native Land Trust Board. He paid further monies&&.."

Under cross-examination, the Plaintiff admitted that apart from the payments to NLTB monies were paid to the Mataqalis and the Application was made for the lease by the Defendant on behalf of the Plaintiff on an expired lease.

"Q. In 2003, you were aware father (the Defendant) made an application on your behalf on an expired lease?
A. Yes

Q. After expiry of the lease, Mataqalis have to give consent to NLTB?
A. Yes

Q. Mataqalis demand money?
A. Yes

Q. Father paid monies to Mataqalis as goodwill, yes?
A. Yes"

 Further, the Plaintiff admitted under cross examination there were two houses built by the father one for the Plaintiff and the other one for her sister Rajebul Nisha.

"Q. Father built two houses?
A. Yes. One for me and one for my sister.

Q. In 2004, your sister cultivated the land?
A. Yes. In 2005 too.

Q. When was the relationship deteriorated with the sister?
A. In 2006, harvesting season, because money was not distributed. In 2006 there was Crop Lease executed to the father to distribute the income on tonnage basis."

24.3 The above positions taken up by the Plaintiff supports the Defendant's version of the evidence.

 The Plaintiff admitted father had made payments to Mataqalis but doesn't know the amount of the payment. The Defendant says he paid $5,000.00 and further monies; in absence of any evidence in contrary the court has to accept the evidence of the Defendant. The Defendant further explained why the payment was made:

"Without good will payment Mataqali's won't give their consent to lease the land. I needed this land because it was used as graveyard of my grandparents. Native Land Board cannot give a lease without the consent of the Mataqalis."

The conclusion that this court can arrive is that the Plaintiff had paid $5,000 to the Mataqali's to obtain the consent for the lease.

 It was also stated by the Plaintiff in her evidence that $2,500.00 was paid to the NLTB which was admitted by the Defendant too. It was also stated by the Plaintiff that she made to understand $10,000.00 was paid to the NLTB and she didn't see any receipt.

24.6 Prior to getting the lease in favour of the Plaintiff, the Defendants position was that:

1. The subject land was used as a grave yard of the ancestors;

2. The lease of the land was expired and the Defendant was to obtain the lease with the consent of the land owning Mataqalis;

3. The Defendant intended to obtain the lease in his name, however, he could not get the lease for the reason he had another lease from NLTB;

4. Then he wanted the lease in the joint names of the Plaintiff and his other daughter Rajebul Nisha which didn't took place because the leases by NLTB was not issued in joint names (pleaded in paragraph 3(a) to (c ) of the Statement of Defence).

24.7 The above position of the Plaintiff was unchallenged and corroborated by the evidence of Rajebul Nisha, and Mohammed Yasin.

24.8 Considering the evidence led before me, I find the following:

(i) The Defendant's intention was to obtain the lease in his name or in the joint names of the 2 daughters to secure the graveyard of his ancestors;

(ii) The Defendant could not obtain the lease in his name for the reason that he had obtained another lease from NLTB previously;

(iii) The Defendant could not get the lease in the joint names of the daughters Sarimun Nisha (the Plaintiff) and Rajebul Nisha since NLTB did not grant Native Lease in joint names;

(iv) The Defendant's intention of giving the land for the occupation of the two daughters was evident by constructing 2 houses on the land and one house were occupied by the Plaintiff to date and the other one by Rajebul Nisha from 2003 to 2009;

(v) The evidence led, established that the Defendant had made payments to the NLTB, Mataqali's for goodwill to get the consent and incurred expenses for clearing of the land by using machineries;

(vi) There is no evidence to establish that the Plaintiff was unduly or fraudulently induced by the Defendant to execute a Mortgage and Crop Lien in favour of the Defendant. In this regard Mr Sheik shah who executed the Mortgage Bond and Crop Lien (marked as P2 and P4 by the Plaintiff and the Defendant forwarded originals of these 2 documents marked D2 and D3). Mr Shah stated to the court in his evidence D2 and D3 were witnessed by him and the contents of those documents were explained to the Plaintiff.

I quote the relevant portion of Mr Shah's evidence:

"&..P2 and P4 were shown to the witness. I witnessed these documents. Mortgagor is Sarimun Nisha. I have to identify the person. I explained the documents to her. Documents were prepared by Gibson and Company. We never get our clients to sign documents prepared by us. Original Mortgage Document tendered marked as D2. I witnessed another document too. Shown original Crop Lien tendered marked as D3, executed on the same day. I explained all the contents to the Plaintiff and I witnessed the documents."

This position was never challenged by the Plaintiff at the cross examination. I conclude the Plaintiff executed the documents with full knowledge and there was no false representation by the Defendant and Mr Sheik Shah who witnessed the documents had explained P2 and P4 and the Plaintiff was aware of the nature of the documents. As such the Plaintiff fails in her claim that she signed the Mortgage and Crop Lien without any knowledge and I find the said Memorandum of Mortgage and Crop Lien are valid documents.

24.9 I further conclude there were monies due and owing to the Defendant in terms of Memorandum of Mortgage Bond No. 581827 registered on 7th February 2006 for a sum of $20,000.00. As per the terms of the Mortgage, there was no interest chargeable neither the Defendant claim interest. The Defendant's evidence was that the Mortgage Bond was executed for the purpose of securing the expenses incurred by him as such by not including the rate of interest the evidence of the Defendant is corroborated. I am satisfied that the Defendant wanted to recover the expenses incurred for acquiring and developing the land. 

The Plaintiff's counsel attempted to submit through the evidence, for the expenses there was no invoices raised and no proper accounts being prepared, no signatures being obtained for the payments made to the Plaintiff and her sister Rajebul Nisha. This court has to view the said position taking into consideration of:

(a) the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, being daughter and father;

(b) the intention of the father by acquiring the land he intended to:

(i) secure the graveyard of his ancestors;

(ii) to get his two daughters (the Plaintiff, Sarimun Nisha and Rajebul Nisha) to occupy the land jointly and use the land jointly.

When the Plaintiff acted against the wishes of the father, father had decided to get the Mortgage and the Crop Lien, until the relationships were deteriorated for the monies expended there was no necessity to issue vouchers or invoices to the daughter (Plaintiff). As such I conclude in this case, the court need not to rely on the Accounts, Statements, Invoices, or Vouchers. This court has to make its conclusions on the basis of the oral evidence led before it and considering where the balance of probability lies. It is not necessary for the court to go through to verify each and every piece of documents to prove the liability for the reason that the Accounts were not properly kept by the Defendant for each and every transaction because of the relationship between the parties.

24.10 The officer from the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) gave evidence before this court. According to his evidence, FSC has paid $28,675.00 to Mohammed Hassan's Account, (the Defendant's Account) that is for the period from 2006 to 2011.

24.11 The Plaintiff in her claim stated she claims $27,265.41 was received by the Defendant and out of which the Defendant had reimbursed her only $3023.00.

24.12 The FSC officer's evidence was not challenged by the Defendant as such I conclude that the total payment received by the Defendant was $28,675.00 (from 2006 to 2011).

24.13 The Plaintiff stated she got $3023.00 out of the said payment; she failed to produce any documents supporting it. When she alleges her father did not kept proper accounts then she too was obliged to keep the accounts/or records. However, the father kept a ledger book and the Plaintiff's sister gave evidence stating that she received $8000.00 from the Defendant as her share and she cultivated the land up to 2009. She got the letter from the Plaintiff to vacate the land in 2010 and she vacated in 2011. The Plaintiff's position was since 2006 Rajebul Nisha didn't cultivate the land. By evidence led before me it was clear that she cultivated the land up to 2009. I am satisfied with the evidence led in this case and conclude there was share farming in the land.

24.14 Having concluded as above, there was share farming and the Mortgage and Crop Lien being executed in favour of the Defendant. Defendant was the recipient of the proceeds of the sugar cane who holds the monies in Trust which was distributed among three beneficiaries including the Defendant.

24.15 Having considered all the evidence led before me, my findings are:

1. From 2006 to 2011, the Defendant received $28,675.00 from FSC as proceeds of the share farming;

2. The Defendant had paid as per evidence $7,000.00 to the Plaintiff being her share on the share farming;

3. I am satisfied with the evidence that $34,000.00 was expended by the Defendant for development of the land inclusive of payments made to the NLTB, Mataqali's and putting up of the house for the Plaintiff.;

4. However, the Memorandum of Mortgage was executed for only $20,000.00 with 0% interest; I conclude that the Defendant is entitled to recover only the said $20,000.00 from the Plaintiff.

Accordingly, I make the following Orders:

(a) Plaintiff's claim is dismissed;

(b) Defendant's counter claim under paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) of the Statement of Defence are dismissed;

(c) The Counter Claim made under paragraph (c) of the Statement of Defence is varied and the Plaintiff is ordered to pay $20,000.00 to the Defendant and on payment of the said sum of $20,000.00 the Defendant should discharge the Mortgage No. 581827 and Crop Lien No. 81/2006 forthwith;

(d) The Plaintiff is further ordered to pay the said sum of $20,000.00 within 3 months from the date of this Judgment and if the said payment of $20,000.00 is defaulted, the Defendant is entitled to proceed on the Mortgage Sale of the Native Lease No. 26806 known as Tuiro No. 3 on Plan No. M1652;

(e) Both parties should bear their own costs.

Delivered at Suva this 24th day of January, 2014.
