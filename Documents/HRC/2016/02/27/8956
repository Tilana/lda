<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur visited Kenya from 16 to 25 February 2009 in order to ascertain 
the types and causes of unlawful killings; to investigate whether those responsible for such 
killings are held to account; and to propose constructive measures to reduce the incidence of 
killings and impunity. The main focus was on killings by the police, violence in the Mt. Elgon 
District, and killings in the post-election period. 
</p>
<p> Interviews were conducted with Government officials, representatives of civil society, 
victims and witnesses, in five of the eight administrative provinces or areas in Kenya, as well as 
with officials of United Nations agencies and members of the diplomatic community. Over 
100 lengthy witness interviews were conducted. In advance of the mission, the Special 
Rapporteur reviewed detailed reports from Government and civil society sources, and during the 
mission a strong effort was made to hear diverse perspectives and consider conflicting 
information in order to arrive at a fair and balanced understanding of the issues. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur came to the conclusion that police in Kenya frequently execute 
individuals and that a climate of impunity prevails. Most troubling is the existence of police 
death squads operating on the orders of senior police officials and charged with eliminating 
suspected leaders and members of criminal organizations. Such groups harass and kill Kenyans, 
and strong policing is required to counter the threat. Carte blanche killing by the police, 
however, does nothing to eradicate such criminality; rather, it perpetuates the sense that the 
police are good at killing and bad at law enforcement. For policing to truly create security, it 
must be conducted with respect for the human rights of all, including those of suspects and 
victims. A lack of police accountability for killings results from the absence of effective internal 
or external investigation or oversight mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that, in Mt. Elgon, both the Sabaot Land Defence Force 
militia and the Government&#8217;s security forces are engaged in widespread brutality, including 
torture and unlawful killings, against Mt. Elgon&#8217;s residents. Detailed reports from a broad range 
of sources documenting this abuse have not been seriously investigated by the police or the 
military. Both groups remain in denial of such abuses and their response to systematic civil 
society reporting has been to methodically intimidate human rights defenders and witnesses. 
</p>
<p> Widespread violence followed the general elections held in December 2007. A national 
commission of inquiry, chaired by Justice Waki, detailed the circumstances and causes of 
1,113 killings that occurred in that period. The Government deserves significant credit for 
establishing this successful and independent inquiry. However, despite the pressing need for 
measures to address the systemic causes of the violence and to provide accountability for abuses, 
the recommendations made by the Waki Commission have yet to be implemented. Those 
responsible for the post-election violence, including police force members responsible for 
extrajudicial executions and officials who organized or instigated violence, remain immune from 
prosecution almost 18 months later. Witnesses to many of these killings are terrified to speak 
out. A witness-protection programme that has already absorbed significant resources has yet to 
protect a single witness.</p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> Many of the human rights defenders who testified before the Special Rapporteur during his 
mission were threatened and harassed by members of the security forces and other Government 
officials. Two activists who had been particularly active in reporting on police death squads were 
murdered just two weeks after the mission ended. There has been a systematic attempt to silence 
criticism of Kenyan security forces. 
</p>
<p> While the existing situation is bad, it is far from intractable. If it so chooses, Kenya can 
significantly reduce the prevalence of unlawful killings. Much of the institutional and legal 
structures needed to carry the reform process forward is in place. The international community is 
keen to support a genuine reform programme. Kenyan citizens are politically engaged and civil 
society is professional and serious, and contributes substantially to the protection of human 
rights by monitoring abuses and proposing reforms. 
</p>
<p> The causes of many unlawful killings are well defined, and relatively straightforward steps 
could be taken to improve the situation. The Government of Kenya can choose to deny the 
existence of problems or insist that they are under control, while the killings and impunity 
continue; such a path will lead inexorably to chaos and large-scale violence within a relatively 
short time. Or it can choose to acknowledge the scale of the problem and implement a reform 
programme to end extrajudicial executions, thus sending the message that impunity will not be 
tolerated. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION AND APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL LAW 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Kenya from 16-25 February 2009. My principal focus was on allegations of 
unlawful killings by the police in their day to day work, by the military (especially in relation to 
the conflict in Mt Elgon), and by diverse actors in the violence that followed the December 2007 
general elections. Of particular concern was the impunity enjoyed by those responsible for the 
vast majority of these killings. 
</p><p>2. A briefing on the contents of my preliminary findings was provided in person to the 
Minister of Justice and a copy of the conclusions and recommendations presented at the press 
conference was provided well in advance to both the principal liaison officer for the mission, at 
the Ministry of Justice, as well as to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p>3. Kenya is a party to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. International law prohibits the &#8220;arbitrary 
deprivation of life&#8221;,<b>1</b> and obligates governments to both &#8220;respect and ensure&#8221; the right to life.<b>2</b> 
Thus, governments themselves must desist from unlawful killings, and must protect their people 
from killings by others.<b>3</b> In order to save lives, lethal force may be used by law enforcement 
officers, as long as it satisfies the twin safeguards of necessity and proportionality.<b>4</b> Thus, police 
officers may shoot to kill only when it is clear that an individual is about to kill someone 
(making lethal force proportionate) and there is no other available means of detaining him or her 
(making lethal force necessary).<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>4. Kenya&#8217;s international obligations also require it to effectively investigate, prosecute, and 
punish all those responsible for unlawful killings.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS BY POLICE 
</b></p>
<p>5. Killings by the police are widespread. Some killings are opportunistic, reckless or 
personal. Many others are carefully planned. It is impossible to estimate reliably how many 
killings occur, because the police do not keep a centralized database. But police shootings are

</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The obligation to protect is also mandated in Kenyan domestic law: Police Act, s 14; Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure Code, s 62.  
<b>4
</b>  I have discussed the principles of necessity and proportionality, including on their elaboration 
</p>
<p>in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and in the Basic Principles on the 
Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials in a report to the General Assembly, 
A/61/311, paras. 33-45.

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>reported nearly every day of the week by the press and the total number is certainly unacceptably 
high. In just a five month period in 2007, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights 
(KNCHR) documented approximately 500 people killed or disappeared.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>6. There are six primary factors which account for the frequency with which police can kill at 
will in Kenya: (i) official sanctioned targeted killings of suspected criminals; (ii) a dysfunctional 
criminal justice system incentivizes police to counter crime by killing suspected criminals, rather 
than arresting them; (iii) internal and external police accountability mechanisms are virtually 
non-existent; there is little check on, and virtually no independent investigations of, alleged 
police abuses; (iv) use of force laws are contradictory and overly permissive; (v) witnesses to 
abuse are often intimidated, and fear reporting or testifying; and (vi) the police force lacks 
sufficient training, discipline and professionalism. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Context 
</b></p>
<p>7. Kenyans are subjected to significant levels of both indiscriminate and organized violent 
criminality. Armed robbery, carjacking, and violent street crime are all common.<b>7</b> In addition, 
criminal organizations exercise vicious control over significant geographical areas and 
infrastructure in slums in Nairobi and Central Province. 
</p>
<p>8. There are many such criminal groups, but the Mungiki have become particularly 
prominent.<b>8</b> In many slums in and around Nairobi, there have historically been high levels of 
insecurity, and few state services. In the early 1990s, the Mungiki, initially a cultural-religious 
movement, began providing security and basic services in slums.<b>9</b> While many of these activities 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  KNCHR, <i>The Cry of Blood: Report on Extra-Judicial Killings and Disappearances 
</i></p>
<p>(September 2008). 
<b>7
</b>  According to information provided by the police, robbery rates were as follows: 2004 (2251), 
</p>
<p>2005 (2511), 2006 (1257), 2007 (759). Robbery with violence: 2004 (5018), 2005 (4010), 
2006 (3594), 2007 (2643); murder: 2004 (1595); 2005 (1260); 2006 (1286), 2007 (1261). 
<b>8
</b>  Other criminal organizations operating in Kenya include: the Sungu Sungu, the Kisungu 
</p>
<p>Sungu, and the Taliban (a predominantly ethnic Luo vigilante group, operating in slums in 
eastern Nairobi). For academic analysis of the Mungiki, <i>see</i>: Mutuma Ruteere, &#8220;Dilemmas of 
Crime, Human Rights and the Politics of Mungiki Violence in Kenya&#8221; (2008);

Affairs </i>(2002) 101, 531; Grace Nyatugah Wamue, &#8220;Revisiting our Indigenous Shrines through 
<i>Mungiki</i>&#8221;, <i>African Affairs </i>(2001) 100, 453; Peter Mwangi Kagwanja, &#8220;Facing Mount Kenya or 
Facing Mecca? The Mungiki, ethnic violence and the political of the Moi succession in Kenya, 
1987-2002&#8221;, <i>African Affairs </i>(2003) 102, 25.  
<b>9
</b>  Most accounts of the origins of the Mungiki date them to the late 1980s. They started in the 
</p>
<p>Rift Valley, drawing members from the Kikuyu tribe. Early organizers drew upon the Mau Mau 
struggle, and articulated their aims in terms of liberation from oppression, and a return to 
indigenous traditions. Membership grew in the Rift Valley in the early 1990s, as the Kikuyu 
increasingly became victims of ethnic violence. Membership then spread to the slums of

</p>
<p>were originally appreciated by slum residents, as the Mungiki grew, so did its level of control, 
and ruthless tactics were employed to preserve it. Today, the Mungiki are responsible for a large 
number of crimes, including murder. I spoke with many people who live and work in areas now 
controlled by the Mungiki.<b>10</b> Residents and business owners are extorted for &#8220;protection&#8221; fees.<b>11</b> 
Matatu (bus) drivers are harassed on a daily basis. Those who resist organized criminal 
organizations are threatened, beaten or killed, often in an especially brutal manner, and residents 
are increasingly terrified of the progressively more violent criminal control of their 
neighborhoods.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Evidence of widespread killings by police 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Government has a clear obligation to protect citizens from Mungiki and other criminal 
violence, while respecting human rights, including the right to life. Suspects should be arrested, 
charged, tried and punished accordingly. In a context of violent criminality, police will 
inevitably be required to use force on occasion, and sometimes lethal force in order to protect 
life. The police, including the Police Commissioner, assured me that there have been no unlawful 
police killings. However, as I detail below, the evidence is compelling that the police 
respond - frequently - with unlawful force: murdering, rather than arresting suspects. Further, 
investigations by police are so deficient and compromised that claims by the police that all 
killings are lawful are inherently unreliable and unsustainable.  
</p>
<p>10. During my mission, I received compelling evidence that death squads - including one 
called <i>Kwekwe</i> - exist within the police force in Kenya, and that these squads were set-up to 
eliminate the Mungiki and other high-profile suspected criminals, upon the orders of senior 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>Nairobi. In the slums, the Mungiki initially cleaned the sewerage and toilet systems and 
connected water supplies, and began campaigns against alcohol/drug abuse and rent hikes and 
conducted HIV/AIDS awareness. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  Mungiki activities primarily affect those living in Nairobi and Central Province. According to 
information provided to me by provincial officials in Central Province, the areas most affected 
by Mungiki activities in Central Province are the districts of: Thika, Kiambu, Murang&#8217;a South, 
Nyandarua, and Murang&#8217;a North. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  Fees depend on location and &#8220;service&#8221;. For example, each matatu is generally required to pay 
a daily fee of between 100-200 KSH. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  At various times, Mungiki-matatu violence has flared. For example, in March 2007, 
some 600 matatu owners and drivers held a demonstration against Mungiki activities along bus 
routes from Kiambu, Banana, and Githurai to Nairobi. According to Government accounts of the 
incident, matatu drivers burned the homes of suspected Mungiki members. Two matatu drivers 
were subsequently murdered. In April 2009, violence erupted between the Mungiki and a 
vigilante group (&#8220;the Hague&#8221;), apparently formed by residents to counter Mungiki control. 
Some 30 people were killed. </p>

</p>
<p>police officials. Detailed evidence was provided by civil society investigations,<b>13</b> witnesses to the 
squad&#8217;s activities, survivors of attempted killings, family members of deceased or disappeared 
victims, and victim autopsy reports indicating shots at close range and back entry wounds. A 
further key component of this evidence is the now public testimony of a police whistleblower, 
who recorded his statement in July 2008, before he was murdered while in hiding in 
October 2008. His account provides, in precise and often excruciating, detail the composition 
and operations of the death squad in which he was a part, and the circumstances of the murder of 
67 persons between February 2007 and July 2008. Together, this evidence implicates the 
Commissioner of Police, and senior police officials from the Criminal Investigation Division, 
Special Crime Unit, and the Criminal Intelligence Unit. From this large amount of testimony, it 
is possible to set-out in detail the operations of the death squads: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The suspected Mungiki or other criminal suspects appear to nearly always be known 
and individually targeted by police in advance. The police carrying out the operations 
(those driving the vehicles and committing the murders) are generally ordered by senior 
police to pick up a specified individual at a particular location (often his home, 
workplace, or a road on which he is believed to be traveling).<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; While most suspects are individually targeted, police will generally also detain others 
who may be accompanying the target at the time of arrest. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Very often, the initial detention is witnessed by family members, co-workers, or 
bystanders.<b>15</b> In one well-known case, a man was actually photographed by a member of 
the press while being arrested.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Some suspects are murdered at the location of arrest. They are generally ordered by the 
police to lie down on the ground and are then shot. Police then attempt to set the crime 
scene to look like a &#8220;shoot out&#8221; occurred between criminals and police - weapons will 
be placed next to the bodies of the suspect, and fired into the air to give the appearance 
of an exchange of fire. Such victims are often taken to the mortuary by the police.<b>17</b>

</p>
<p>&#8226; In other cases, the suspects are not immediately murdered, but are taken from the site of 
initial detention in generally unmarked police vehicles or private vehicles.<b>18</b> The squads 
frequently work in convoys of 2-5 vehicles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Once detained, the suspect is most often held irregularly, and no record of the detention 
is made in the police Occurrence Book. Some suspects will be taken to police stations, 
or moved between multiple stations. Others are held in vehicles for a number of hours. 
Once family members realize that their relative was arrested or is missing, they 
generally embark on a search of police stations.<b>19</b> Family members usually report 
obstruction or intimidation from officials in this process. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In some cases, the police demand a ransom from the detainee, or call the relatives and 
demand a ransom upon threat of death to the detainee. In many cases, payment of the 
ransom is sufficient to obtain the detainee&#8217;s release. Some victims have been detained 
and forced to pay ransoms on multiple occasions. Others have paid the ransom, but were 
then followed by police and subsequently murdered.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Those suspects who are murdered in locations other than the site of initial detention are 
generally eventually taken in vehicles to a remote area, such a forest or farmland. Many 
of these individuals are interrogated and tortured for a number of hours. Those who are 
suspected Mungiki are asked about their role in the Mungiki sect, and for the names and 
details of other Mungiki members or leaders.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; During the detention or interrogation period, there is often communication via mobile 
phone between the interrogating officers, and senior officers at headquarters or police 
stations. In at least one case, the interrogations were tape-recorded, and played back via 
phone to senior police.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Those suspects taken to remote areas are typically killed through strangulation, or by 
being beaten to death by pangas (machetes), rungus (sticks), or other means. Their 
bodies are generally left in the forest or farm area, and found by local residents.<b>23</b>

only the tip of the iceberg of police killings in Kenya. In addition to the death squad killings 
described above, I received detailed information on a wide range of circumstances in which 
unlawful killings have taken place. Sometimes, the police kill in the context of a bribery or 
extortion attempt. Some incidents appear to be motivated by purely private reasons (such as a 
personal dispute).<b>25</b> In others, the evidence suggests that the police were shooting 
indiscriminately or recklessly.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Lethal force is also commonly used in legitimate law enforcement operations in which the 
police could have readily made an arrest. Some of these killings would be prevented through the 
provision of unambiguous guidelines on when police may use lethal force. The use of force by 
police is regulated by the Constitution of Kenya, the Police Act, and the Force Standing 
Orders.<b>27</b> In addition to being unclear and contradictory, these laws do not meet the requirements 
of international law which requires the use of force to be both necessary and proportionate, and 
permits intentional lethal force only where it is required to protect life.<b>28</b> The Constitution of 
Kenya, for example, states that there is no violation of the right to life if, <i>inter alia, </i>the death 
occurred as a result of reasonably justifiable force used to protect a person from violence, to 
defend property, to effect a lawful arrest, to prevent an escape, to suppress a riot, or to prevent 
the commission of a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Official response to allegations 
</b></p>
<p>13. Some Government officials stated that if killings occurred, they were committed 
infrequently and by &#8220;rogue&#8221; officers. To their credit, a small number of Government officials did 
acknowledge the magnitude of the killings. But senior police officials were unwilling to 
acknowledge the problem at all: in essence, their response was one of denial, stone-walling, and 
obfuscation. In the provinces, my efforts were stymied by blanket denials by police, the 
provision of partial or inconclusive data, or by referring me back to police headquarters in 
Nairobi. The official police account of any killing is generally predictable: the suspect was an 
armed criminal, there was a &#8220;shoot-out&#8221;, and the police reacted with appropriate force. Senior

<p>police flatly denied to me any knowledge of the <i>Kwekwe </i>death squad. And yet its existence was 
confirmed in Parliament by the Minister of State for Provincial Administration and Internal 
Security, Professor George Saitoti.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>14. On the first day of my mission I provided the Police Commissioner with a short list of 
issues on which I sought information. At the end of the mission, I received a written response. It 
largely refused to provide even basic information. For instance, the initial response to my request 
for the numbers of police employed in Kenya was, &#8220;not immediately available&#8221;. A subsequent 
response also declined to provide the information for national security reasons, but suggested a 
population to police ratio of 1:800. 
</p>
<p>15. During my mission, the police stated that they could not tell me how many people were 
killed by the police (whether in self-defence or otherwise), because there was no centralized 
data-keeping or monitoring; rather, records were kept in the inquest file register maintained at 
each police station. My press statement at the conclusion of my mission noted that this was 
simply unacceptable. Following my mission, I have been informed by the Government that the 
committee reviewing police standing operation procedures has been directed to draft a regulation 
establishing an updated database at police headquarters on all killings by police. I welcome this 
positive development. 
</p>
<p>16. In other respects, however, the police response to my visit has consisted of continued 
denials of all wrongdoing, ad hominem attacks against me, and apparent police involvement in 
the broad daylight assassination of two human rights defenders with whom I met. Rather than in 
any way addressing the substance of the allegations contained in my initial statement, some 
police officials have sought to structure public debate so that criticisms of police actions are 
equated with condoning criminal activity. In this way, the police have tried to position civil 
society - and also my own reporting - as aligned with the interests of criminal organizations. This 
in turn sets up the police to launch further attacks against the Mungiki and others, while failing 
to take any steps to address the real issues. Efforts to monitor and reform policing so that it is 
carried out with respect for human rights do not mean being &#8220;soft&#8221; on crime. Security policies 
only truly provide security if the rights of all - victims, the general public, police, and 
criminals - are respected. The violent police response to crime has done nothing to promote 
security. Innocent bystanders have been shot by police, the public has lost faith that the police 
force can protect them, and the police have undertaken few if any measures to investigate and 
prosecute those Mungiki and other criminals who continue to terrorize and extort private 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>17. Criminals should be arrested, not taken to a forest and tortured to death. In Kenya, 
members of criminal organisations - because of their regular intimidation of residents - are easily 
identifiable. This was repeatedly noted by witnesses to Mungiki violence and matatu drivers. If

also like to say that there is a body called <i>Kwekwe </i>Squad that has been talked about here. We 
had that body and I would like to inform this House that, instructions were given out for its 
disbanding.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>the police were serious about crime control, they would be able to locate and arrest suspects. 
Unfortunately, in many Mungiki controlled areas, police profit from criminal control by 
accepting bribes to permit continued Mungiki control. And in cases reported directly to me in the 
presence of the police, when called to respond to Mungiki extortion police officers have taken no 
action against the criminals, but instead exploited for themselves the opportunity to extort the 
public. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Removal of the Police Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>18. The regular police force is under the command and direction of the Commissioner of 
Police, who is appointed directly by the President.<b>30</b> There is no mandated consultation, no 
recruiting guidelines, and no formal vetting for the appointment. 
</p>
<p>19. While the current Police Commissioner was originally seen as a potential reformer, and 
rapidly established a highly centralized leadership style, he has since become the major single 
obstacle to police reform. As section II. B above indicates, there is abundant evidence linking 
him to a central role in devising and overseeing the policy of extrajudicially executing large 
numbers of &#8220;suspected criminals&#8221;. He flatly refuses to acknowledge that any unlawful killings 
are taking place, derides detailed and compelling reports to the contrary, blocks investigations, 
and prevents all transparency. 
</p>
<p>20. Most importantly in terms of the interests of the Kenyan population, he has utterly failed to 
devise any law enforcement strategy worthy of the name for dealing with Mungiki and other 
forms of criminality. Widespread killings of suspects and innocents alike, combined with a 
failure to reign in rampant corruption on the part of key officials, do not add up to a strategy for 
policing. 
</p>
<p>21. The President of Kenya should remove the current Police Commissioner, and formal 
guidelines, consultation, and vetting should be institutionalised for future appointments. Ideally, 
this would take place through a newly created Police Service Commission, as recommended by 
the Waki Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Accountability and the criminal justice system 
</b>22. Failures in the criminal justice system, and in internal and external police accountability 
mechanisms, encourage the commission of unlawful killings by police. 
</p>
<p>23. The criminal justice system as a whole was widely described as &#8220;terrible&#8221;. Investigation, 
prosecution, and judicial processes are slow and corrupt. Predictably, this leads to widespread 
distrust of the system, and impunity for criminals (particularly for those with power and money). 
It also acts as an incentive for police to kill, rather than arrest suspects: because of the low 
probability of securing convictions, many police think it is easier and more effective to take 
&#8220;justice&#8221; into their own hands. And, significantly, police themselves also benefit from the 
systemic faults - they are rarely held to account for the abuses they commit.  
</p>

</p>
<p>24. In theory, if a killing occurs, the police provide the relevant information to a magistrate, so 
that an inquest can be opened.<b>31</b> Where investigations disclose evidence that a private individual 
or a police officer is criminally responsible for a death, a murder case file is opened, and the case 
is prosecuted in Kenya&#8217;s High Court by state counsel from the Attorney-General&#8217;s office. The 
reality is very different.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Police investigations 
</b></p>
<p>25. Police investigations of murders are generally inadequate, due in large part to resource, 
training, and capacity constraints. But investigations are especially poor when the police 
themselves are implicated in a death. The cause of this is in part institutional: there is no 
independent internal affairs unit within the police force. Such cases are generally investigated by 
the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) - the division responsible for all complex or serious 
investigations. But the problem is also one of will: those at the top of the force lack the 
determination to investigate themselves, or the will to institute the reforms that would improve 
transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>26. The police response to the KNCHR&#8217;s report on extrajudicial executions is a typical 
example of police unwillingness to conduct serious investigations. The police report on the 
KNCHR investigations challenges the investigative capacity and skill of the KNCHR, criticizes 
the KNCHR for reporting the allegations to the President of Kenya and the UN, and concludes 
that there was &#8220;no&#8221; evidence of police complicity in the killings.<b>32</b> A similar response was given 
in response to the KNCHR&#8217;s public release of the whistleblower testimony in February 2009. 
The police issued a statement challenging the reputation of the whistleblower, questioning why 
the KNCHR released the statement when it did, questioning the KNCHR&#8217;s commitment to 
human rights, and intimating that KNCHR officers receive payments from the Mungiki.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>27. During my visit, police officials throughout the country blocked my attempts to find 
detailed information on investigations and inquests. For instance, the response to my written 
request for the number of inquiries opened by the police in response to complaints received 
against the police, was simply to state that every &#8220;action against a police officer is preceded by 
an inquiry file which is guided by the following regulations&#8221;, and then to quote the law. 
Nevertheless, particularly damning evidence of the quality of police investigations is revealed in 
communications between the police and the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General provided 
me a significant volume of correspondence between his office and police headquarters with 
respect to various cases in which police were alleged to have killed. The correspondence 
consisted of repeated letters from the Attorney-General directing the police to charge certain

<p>individuals or to conduct further investigations. In one matter, two police officers opened fire at 
a group of youths on 31 December 2001. One person was killed, and three were seriously 
wounded. In March 2002, the police forwarded the investigation file to the Attorney-General. In 
May 2002, the Attorney-General directed the police to charge two police officers with murder 
and unlawful wounding, once certain gaps in investigations were remedied. After a number of 
months and reminder letters from the Attorney-General, the two policemen were eventually 
charged. However, a Magistrate dismissed the murder case because of a lack of evidence. The 
police had failed to conduct the additional investigations requested. In another murder case, the 
Attorney-General, through the DPP, sent letters to no avail in April, June, August, and 
September 2008, and January 2009 requesting the police to conduct further investigations so that 
a trial could proceed. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Attorney-General is a constitutional office-holder, a member of the National 
Assembly, a member of the Judicial Service Commission, the principal legal advisor to the 
Government, and has the constitutional power to conduct or stop prosecutions.<b>34</b> For offences 
which can be heard in Magistrate&#8217;s Courts (including, for example, robbery), prosecutorial 
functions are delegated by the Attorney-General to the police. For offences over which only the 
High Court has jurisdiction (such as murder), prosecutorial functions are delegated to the 
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The DPP has no security of tenure. His is a department of 
the office of the Attorney-General, not an independent office. 
</p>
<p>29. The Attorney-General has security of tenure, for life, and has been in office since 1991. He 
has overseen, for nearly two decades, a system that clearly does not work. The Attorney-General 
has the constitutional power to &#8220;require&#8221; the Police Commissioner to investigate any matter 
relating to an alleged offence.<b>35</b> As documents provided by the Attorney-General clearly 
indicate, he is all too aware of the grave deficiencies in police investigations. But instead of 
using his constitutional powers to force individual investigations, and to promote essential 
institutional reforms, letters simply go back and forth for years, with cases neither investigated 
sufficiently, nor prosecuted. In addition, the repeated failure to prosecute <i>any </i>senior officials for 
their role in large-scale election violence over a period of many years (discussed below in section 
IV on post-election violence) has led to a complete loss of faith in the commitment of his office 
to prosecute those in Government with responsibility for crimes. 
</p>
<p>30. The Attorney-General and successive police commissioners have engaged in a game in 
which each insists the ball is in the court of the other, while both know that it has in fact been 
hidden so that no outcome can ever be declared. The Attorney-General then presents himself as 
the helpless victim of the intransigence or malfeasance of others. But this is a complete 
misrepresentation of the situation of an individual who has wielded immense power through a 
succession of government. In fact, his unrelenting failure to prosecute any senior officials 
implicated in extrajudicial executions renders him not just complicit in, but absolutely

<p>indispensable to, a system which has institutionalized impunity in Kenya. In order to restore the 
integrity of the office, the current Attorney-General should resign or be required to leave office. 
In future, prosecutions should be undertaken by a constitutionally entrenched and independent 
Department of Public Prosecutions. The powers to prosecute and to intervene in prosecutions 
should not be held by a political office-holder. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The judiciary 
</b>31. The judiciary in Kenya is an obstacle in the path to a well-functioning criminal justice 
system.<b>36</b> Its central problems are crony opaque appointments, and extraordinary levels of 
corruption. I received considerable evidence of judges and magistrates being paid to slow the 
progress of cases, to &#8220;lose&#8221; files, or to decide a case in a particular manner. Many reports over 
the last decade have documented this, and significant structural reforms have repeatedly been 
proposed to increase the transparency and accountability of the judiciary.<b>37</b> The Kibaki 
Government botched its 2003 &#8220;radical surgery&#8221; strategy,<b>38</b> and has done little since, despite the 
strongly proclaimed views of the Prime Minister and the former Minister of Justice that drastic 
reforms are required. The Chief Justice is of the view that the courts generally function well, and 
that corruption and discipline are being adequately dealt with by the Judicial Service 
Commission (JSC). In fact the JSC has done precious little to improve the functioning of the 
courts. , and they are in need of radical reform.  
</p>
<p>32. It is essential that the judicial appointments procedure, and oversight of discipline of 
judges and magistrates is reformed. To this end, the JSC should be transformed so that its 
membership is representative; judicial officials are transparently vetted before appointment; 
merit-based criteria are met by appointees; and the Commission should have a more significant 
and transparent role in monitoring and removing judges. It should also establish an independent 
complaints procedure in relation to judicial behaviour. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>36
</b>  The structure and powers are set out in the Constitution of Kenya, Chapter IV; the Judicature 
</p>
<p>Act; the Magistrates Courts Act.  
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  See, &#8220;Report of the Committee on the Administration of Justice&#8221; (1998) (the Kwach report) 
(detailing allegations that there was &#8220;actual payment of money to judges and magistrates to 
influence their decisions.&#8221;); Constitution of Kenya Review Commission, &#8220;Report of the 
Advisory Panel of Eminent Commonwealth Judicial Experts&#8221; (2002) (concluding that &#8220;the 
Kenyan judicial system suffers from a serious lack of public confidence and is generally 
perceived as being in need of fundamental structural reform.&#8221;). Also see yearly reports on Kenya 
by Transparency International (reporting the judiciary as one of the most corrupt institutions in 
Kenya).  
<b>38
</b></p>
<p>  The Government set up an &#8220;Integrity and Anti-Corruption Committee of the Judiciary in 
Kenya&#8221;, which released its report (the Ringera Report) in 2003. The report implicated 5 (out 
of 9) Court of Appeal justices, and 18 (out of 36) High Court justices, and 82 (out of 254) 
magistrates in corruption. Many of the named justices and magistrates resigned, others 
challenged the report&#8217;s findings. See International Commission of Jurists, &#8220;Kenya: Judicial 
Independence, Corruption and Reform&#8221; (April 2005).  </p>

</p>
<p><b>4.  External oversight of police 
</b></p>
<p>33. External oversight of the police - through ombudsmen, oversight boards, or other 
institutional models - is essential in any system designed to ensure police accountability. The 
Kenyan police have long lacked such oversight, and this is a key systemic flaw ensuring 
impunity and continued killings.  
</p>
<p>34. While the police have demonstrated little will to promote real accountability, they should 
in fact be the first to support improved oversight. It would permit them to demonstrate to the 
public that they are professional, transparent, and trustworthy. 
</p>
<p><i>Public Complaints Standing Committee 
</i></p>
<p>35. A Public Complaints Standing Committee (PCSC) was set up on 21 June 2007.<b>39</b> Its 
mandate is to receive complaints from the public against public servants, including the judiciary 
and police. I met with the PCSC, and its members are serious, and well-intentioned. However, 
the PCSC has no investigative capacity, and - short of the ability to receive complaints and 
channel them to the relevant Government department for response - no power. In fact, the PCSC 
often refers cases to the KNCHR because of the KNCHR&#8217;s greater capacity to investigate and 
follow-up on cases. At the time of my visit to Kenya, the PCSC had three complaints of killings 
by police before it. The complainants conducted their own investigations. The PCSC brought the 
cases to the attention of the police, but no progress had been made. The PCSC clearly does not 
have the teeth necessary to bring to account police perpetrators of abuse.  
</p>
<p><i>Police Oversight Board 
</i></p>
<p>36. On 4 September 2008, the Minister of State for Provincial Administration and Internal 
Security established a Police Oversight Board (POB).<b>40</b> While the creation of such a board 
should have been a positive, it exists on paper only, devoid of offices, a secretariat, any full-time 
members, and the powers it would need to be effective. 
</p>
<p>37. It can &#8220;receive&#8221; complaints from the public and &#8220;evaluate&#8221; them, but its investigative 
powers are entirely inadequate. It can do no more than make recommendations to the 
Commissioner of Police, and has no authority to enforce its recommendations, make any binding 
decisions, or impose disciplinary measures on police officers. The board was set-up not by 
legislation, but by the Minister through a gazette notice. It can thus be dismantled by decision of 
the Minister. Its members are appointed and dismissed by the Minister, and no requisite 
qualifications are set out. In sum, the board lacks the independence and powers required to 
achieve even minimal accountability.

<p><b>III.  EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS IN MT. ELGON 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>38. The general background to the Mt Elgon violence is well recorded elsewhere, and I will 
only outline its basic contours here.<b>41</b> From the mid-1960s, various phases of a settlement 
scheme (Chepyuk Settlement Scheme, Phases I, II and III) were initiated by the Government to 
resettle and provide land to the Ndorobo and Soy sub-clans of the Sabaot people. 
</p>
<p>39. The Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) militia was born out of disputes over the fairness 
of allocations in Phase III.<b>42</b> The early membership of the SLDF appears to have primarily drawn 
its ranks from those who were unhappy with the results of Phase III and believed there was little 
alternative but to resist by force.<b>43</b> The SLDF also used varying degrees of intimidation and force 
to increase its ranks.<b>44</b> If members later became discontented with the activities of the SLDF, 
they were unable to leave without fear of fatal reprisals.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Sabaot Land Defence Force operations and militia atrocities (2006-2008) 
</b>40. It is clear that the residents of Mt Elgon district were terrorized by the SLDF militia for 
approximately two years (2006-2008). I spoke with many victims of SLDF abuse, and also with 
former members of the SLDF. From their testimonies, and together with police, Government, 
and civil society accounts, I have been able to form a detailed picture of the SLDF&#8217;s operations 
and abuses. Intimidation, physical abuse, and killings appear to have been carried out for three 
primary reasons. 
</p>
<p>

<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  In Phase III, 1732 plots of 2.5 acres each were available for allocation. The plots were divided 
equally between the Ndorobo and Soy sub-clans, with each clan getting 866 plots. But some 
7000 sought the 1732 plots.

</p>
<p>41. First, those occupying land desired by the SLDF - especially members of the Ndorobo 
sub-clan, who most SLDF saw as their &#8220;enemy&#8221; in land allocations - were chased out or killed.<b>46</b> 
Soy and others who were seen to be benefiting from the land allocations, or who criticized the 
land reform aims of the SLDF, also became victims.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>42. Second, as the SLDF increased its control over villages in the Mt Elgon region, anyone 
living in those areas who failed to follow SLDF rules or orders was punished commonly through 
having an ear cut off. Residents who refused to &#8220;donate&#8221; food or pay levies were beaten or 
killed.<b>48</b> The SLDF used &#8220;informers&#8221; within the villages, and those who were believed to have 
divulged information to the police were killed.<b>49</b> Such SLDF killings could take place anywhere, 
but typically took place at designated areas in the forests, where the victims&#8217; bodies were often 
just left on the ground surface, with previous victims. 
43. Third, some killings were politically motivated. The members of the Mt Elgon District 
Security and Intelligence Committee (DSIC) acknowledged that the SLDF began and operated 
with political backing. The SLDF supported the candidacy of Fred Kapondi in the 2007 
elections, and for each ward, the SLDF had its favoured candidate, based on that candidate&#8217;s 
support for the land reallocations that the SLDF wanted. Supporters of rival parties, and 
especially of John Serut, who was running against Kapondi, were targeted by the SLDF. 
</p>
<p>44. Over 700 killings and 120 disappearances by the SLDF have to date been individually 
documented by local organisations; although this is likely a fraction of the total number. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Two years of insufficient Government action 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government did far too little to protect civilians during what the District 
Commissioner for Mt Elgon district called this period of &#8220;total terror&#8221;. Inaction was not due to a 
lack of knowledge about the SLDF&#8217;s activities. The Mt Elgon DSIC informed me that they sent 
monthly minutes to the Provincial Security Committee, asking for security reinforcements to 
counter the SLDF, and stating that the security situation was &#8220;out of hand&#8221;.<b>50</b> Local and 
international civil society and humanitarian organisations repeatedly called for action against the 
SLDF. But their requests were largely ignored. Within Mt Elgon, local police all too often 
looked the other way in exchange for payments from the SLDF.

<p>46. The Provincial Government did launch a small operation called <i>Tafuta Amani </i>(&#8220;Seeking 
Peace&#8221;). But it had little effect. As a result, during the 2006-2008 period, many civilians were 
effectively caught between the police and the SLDF, and villages would be attacked by both 
sides.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The only explanation proffered by observers to explain the Government&#8217;s failure to send 
real security reinforcements before 2008 was that it did not want to intervene before the 2007 
general elections. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Joint military-police operation (2008) 
</b>48. The Government finally launched a major joint military-police operation 
on 10 March 2008. The Mt Elgon DSIC informed me that Operation <i>Okoa Maisha </i>(Save Lives) 
was composed of a military detachment, Kenyan Police, the General Service Unit, the 
Administration Police, and the Anti-Stock Theft police. The DSIC stated that it was composed of 
about 400 security force members, including 120 from the military (the 20 Para Battalion). The 
Chief of General Staff and the Assistant Minister for Defence stated that they deployed 
approximately 300 soldiers from two companies (the Alpha Company of the First Kenya Rifles, 
and the Alpha Company of the 20 Para Battalion). 
</p>
<p>49. The police have consistently stated that the military were asked to &#8220;assist&#8221; the police 
operation, and were involved in &#8220;logistics&#8221; only. The Mt Elgon DSIC told me that the operation 
was directed by the Western Province Provincial Police Officer, and that he directed both the 
police and the military. They said that the police were responsible for arrests and interrogations. 
The military involvement was to provide vehicles (to transport suspects), and to help cordon 
areas in which the police carried out arrests. The DSIC stated that 13 people were killed during 
the operation, due to &#8220;cross-fire&#8221;, and that the operation netted over 100 assorted weapons. 
</p>
<p>50. My meeting with military officials in Nairobi provided a somewhat different account. The 
Chief of General Staff stated that they divided Mt Elgon into two operational areas. The upper 
area - the forested area where most of the SLDF were hiding - was where the military primarily 
operated, with minimal police input. Military officials stated that they mounted ground 
operations to find the SLDF forest camps, and arrest members. They said that they met little 
overall organized resistance, but that during fighting eight suspected SLDF members were killed. 
The lower area was the inhabited area, and, according to the military, operations there were 
primarily conducted by the police with minimal military presence.  
</p>
<p>51. Once suspects were detained, they were mostly taken to Kapkota - a temporary security 
force &#8220;base&#8221; that was used as a screening center. There, detained persons were interrogated as to 
their connections to, or knowledge about, the SLDF. Informants were extensively used at 
Kapkota to identify SLDF members. The Mt Elgon DSIC stated that 3,265 individuals were 
detained at Kapkota military camp: 2,187 were released after questioning, and 1,078 were 
arraigned in court. According to records provided to me by the military, 3,839 individuals were 
&#8220;screened&#8221; at Kapkota.

<p><b>E.  Abuses by security forces 
</b></p>
<p>52. Detailed reports by a wide range of credible observers estimate that hundreds of men were 
tortured and killed in the 2008 operation by the Government&#8217;s security forces. Before I visited 
Mt Elgon, I was able to study the comprehensive reporting on abuses by the Western Kenya 
Human Rights Watch (WKHRW), the KNCHR, the Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU), 
Medecins sans frontieres (MSF), and Human Rights Watch (HRW).<b>52</b> The number of persons 
killed or disappeared by the security forces is conservatively estimated at over 200. 
</p>
<p>53. I received detailed and credible reports from witnesses and victims that abuses by the 
security forces happened throughout the various stages of the operation. A significant number of 
detained persons were beaten at the time of first contact with authorities - when they were 
detained either in the village cordoning process, or individually targeted for detention.<b>53</b> At this 
point, they were beaten in a comparatively unstructured or sporadic fashion. They would be 
repeatedly kicked or hit with implements by security forces. At Kapkota, witness testimony 
indicates that they were tortured in a significantly more planned and controlled manner. They 
were frequently stripped naked, kicked, beaten on the genitals, forced to repeatedly jump up and 
down, forced to lie in the sun for long periods, and detainees were forced to beat each other.<b>54</b> 
Unsurprisingly, these beatings led to a large number of deaths.<b>55</b>  
</p>
<p>54. The bodies were either taken to mortuaries, or dumped in the forests. There remain a large 
number of missing persons, last seen in security force custody, and presumed dead.<b>56</b> The only 
real assistance family members have received in finding their disappeared relatives have come 
from civil society an humanitarian organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Official responses to allegations of abuse 
</b></p>
<p>55. I asked Government officials, and police and military officials for their response to the 
various allegations of abuses by the police and the military. I received a range of wholly 
unsatisfactory denials.

</p>
<p>56. Some officials attempted to deny altogether knowledge of the allegations put by NGOs. 
When I asked the District Security Committee in Mt Elgon for their response to NGO reports of 
abuses, some members stated that they were not aware of their documentation of torture or 
unlawful killings. Some members then stated that they were aware of (but had not read) the 
reports. They also had not read the report prepared by the parliamentary committees on 
Administration and National Security, and Defence and Foreign Relations, which found that 
&#8220;there are cases of human rights abuses by the security forces&#8221;.<b>57</b> It recommended that such cases 
be further investigated. Unfortunately, no such action has been taken. 
</p>
<p>57. Other officials told me that the various NGOs were biased. I was told that they had only 
documented abuses by the security forces, and failed to acknowledge or properly document 
SLDF abuses. As a factual matter, this claim is simply untrue. The HRW report on Mt Elgon, for 
example, contains substantial sections on abuses by the SLDF and by the security forces, and 
addresses responsibility for both sets of abuses.<b>58</b> The WKHRW has extensively recorded 
individual human rights abuses by the SLDF. In any event, an NGO report about abuses by a 
Government operation are not irrelevant because it does not also extensively report on the prior 
violations of non-state actors. The primary responsibility for monitoring and responding to 
abuses by criminal gangs or militias rests with the Government. Insofar as a Government fails in 
these responsibilities, NGOs will often take up a monitoring role. This of course explains the 
extensive involvement of NGOs in monitoring SLDF abuses during the two-year period that the 
Government largely ignored the violence. But it is also the case that, by 2008 at least, the abuses 
by the SLDF were well-known and acknowledged by the Government. What was less clear, and 
in need of serious investigation in 2008 was the nature of the Government&#8217;s security operation. 
Allegations had been made of abuses by Government forces. The Government denied these 
allegations. This gave rise to a need to investigate in detail and report on the security force 
abuses. 
</p>
<p>58. Officials also responded by citing the results of a police inquiry into the Mt Elgon 
violence, which concluded that, &#8220;the alleged reports on torture were found to be unreliable, 
misleading, obnoxious, unsubstantiated and made in bad faith.&#8221;<b>59</b> I have studied this report very 
closely, and my team met extensively with the police responsible for its preparation. It is a 
whitewash. The investigation they conducted was superficial and misdirected. Insofar as 
witnesses were named in NGO reports, the police attempted to find them by going to their 
villages. Most of them could not be found, or refused to speak with the police. The police also 
asked NGOs to provide the names and locations of those who had alleged abuses by the security 
forces. Out of appropriate concern for the safety of witnesses and victims, NGOs refused to do 
this. The police were thus largely left without witnesses willing to speak with them. From this, 
the police simply concluded that the allegations of abuse were baseless. The police report fails to

</p>
<p>acknowledge that a victim of police abuse would reasonably be fearful of reporting that abuse to 
the police. The report also claimed that civil society and humanitarian organisations, including 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, &#8220;lack investigation ability, mandate, expertise and 
capacity.&#8221; The report does not substantiate this claim, and in fact noted that an ICRC report 
required &#8220;further thorough inquiry&#8221; because of its serious allegations of torture and extrajudicial 
executions. Further, while senior officials sought to impugn the reputation of the WKHRW, 
police who had actually met and worked with WKHRW stated that their reporting was &#8220;very 
balanced&#8221;, &#8220;credible&#8221;, and &#8220;not biased&#8221;. These police did not want to be identified because they 
feared recriminations from police headquarters. 
</p>
<p>59. In response to my query about military involvement in abuses, I was informed by military 
officials that most civilians are not able to tell the difference between police and military officers 
during such operations because their uniforms are so similar. This is likely true. The inability of 
victims to identify perpetrators was hindered by the practice, confirmed to me by many witnesses 
and also by the District Commissioner of Mt Elgon, of the security forces failing to wear or 
display any form of individual identification on their uniforms. Nevertheless, I was provided 
with credible information, including from citizen informants who worked directly with the 
military to capture the SLDF, that members of the army were involved in abuses.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>60. The military also told me of one case in which a person who instituted a legal action 
against the military for torture had subsequently retracted his allegation, and asserted instead that 
he had been beaten by his neighbours and saved by members of the army. According to an 
undated affidavit allegedly prepared by this individual and provided to me by the military, the 
individual claims that NGO representatives paid him to allege that the abuses were committed by 
the military. In light of the campaign of reputation-smearing and intimidation that security 
officials have embarked on in response to NGO work, there are strong reasons to be skeptical 
about the authenticity and consensual nature of the individual&#8217;s alleged &#8220;retraction&#8221;. 
Nevertheless, if the retraction is true, this would vindicate the military in this particular case. But 
it is no basis upon which to extrapolate and draw the conclusion that all allegations are 
unfounded. 
</p>
<p>61. Finally, military officials suggested that witness accounts I received of abuses may be 
fabrications by SLDF sympathisers. Given the intimidation and threats that are meted out to 
those who speak out against security force abuses, it is unclear why so many individuals would 
put their personal and family safety on the line in this manner. In any event, I certainly spoke 
with those who had been SLDF members and sympathisers. From them, I obtained extensive 
information on the two years of abuses committed by the SLDF. But I also spoke with many 
people who were victims of SLDF violence, and who actually offered their services to the police 
and military to help track down the SLDF. These are not people with a pre-existing bias against 
the police or military. They wanted the security forces to come and restore order in Mt Elgon. 
They did not want to have their relatives and neighbors tortured and killed in the process.

</p>
<p><b>G.  Independent investigations and reform 
</b></p>
<p>62. In light of the sheer quantity and quality of the evidence of serious wrongdoing, the 
Mt Elgon events must be independently investigated. Given the official responses to the 
allegations, it is clear that a credible investigation cannot be conducted either by the police or the 
military. Reports on tactics used in other security operations (in El Wak and Mandera) give 
cause for concern that the security force tactics employed in Mt Elgon have been employed 
elsewhere, and increase the need for independent investigations.<b>61</b> An independent commission, 
with powers and composition modeled on the Waki Commission, should be immediately 
established. Its mandate should include abuses by the SLDF (including the role of officials in 
supporting the SLDF), abuses by the police and the military, and the reasons for the lengthy 
delay in Government intervention to stop the SLDF. Until such an investigation is undertaken, 
the military units deployed to Mt Elgon should be barred from participating in UN or African 
Union peace-keeping operations. 
</p>
<p>63. Independent forensic analysis of mass graves in Mt Elgon should also take place. In the 
forests of Mt Elgon there are mass graves and sites where bodies were simply dumped on the 
forest floor. It is likely that both victims of the SLDF and the security forces are contained in 
those sites. Government authorities have made no systematic or transparent attempts to protect 
these sites or have them examined by independent forensic experts. NGOs who have attempted 
to study the sites have received veiled threats and been prevented from doing so. The District 
Commissioner for Mt Elgon assured me that future attempts to study those sites would not be 
obstructed, and the Government should ensure that access is unimpeded. 
</p>
<p>64. Without a fair allocation of land in Mt Elgon, there is a strong likelihood of renewed 
violence. Many remain landless and homeless, and the underlying causes of the formation and 
growth of the SLDF have not been addressed. The Government should ensure that renewed 
re-allocation efforts are not accompanied by the same favouritism and corruption that defined 
previous allocations. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS DURING THE 
POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p>65. Despite the exceedingly well-documented nature of the grave abuses that occurred in 
Kenya in the wake of the 27 December 2007 general election, no concrete steps have yet been 
taken to prosecute the perpetrators, and especially those perpetrators with the greatest 
responsibility for abuses. This is not because of a lack of available evidence. Significant amounts 
of investigative work have now been carried out.

</p>
<p><b>A.  The Waki Commission 
</b></p>
<p>66. Key among these investigative efforts have been those of the Waki Commission, 
established by the Government of Kenya to investigate the post-election violence (PEV).<b>62</b> 
Kenya deserves much credit for establishing what was, in many respects, a model commission of 
inquiry.<b>63</b> The Waki Commission produced a comprehensive 518 page report. The Commission 
found that 1,113 people were killed during the PEV. Those provinces with the highest levels of 
violence were the Rift Valley, Nyanza, and Nairobi; with 744, 134 and 125 deaths, respectively. 
</p>
<p>67. The report records both spontaneous and organized violence. In terms of failures by state 
actors, the Waki Commission found that officials failed to act on intelligence regarding potential 
violence; failed to respond adequately to violence; and that police lacked discipline and 
impartiality, and used unjustified force in responding to post-election demonstrations and 
violence. Shockingly, police were responsible for 405 deaths (35.7% of the total). In Nyanza, 
79.9% of the PEV deaths were caused by police. The report also identified specific individuals 
from political parties who should be prosecuted for crimes relating to the PEV. The Commission 
recommended that a Special Tribunal should be created to investigate and prosecute those 
persons. And it recommended that, if the Special Tribunal is not established, the Prosecutor for 
the International Criminal Court should be provided the list of names. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Failure of accountability 
</b></p>
<p>68. At the time of this report, initial efforts to create the Special Tribunal had been defeated. It 
is unclear whether the will exists to establish it. Kenya cannot afford to let the Waki Commission 
report achieve little more than recording abuses. Election related violence also occurred in 1992 
and 1997. Despite the Akiwumi Commission and the Kiliku Committee reports documenting in

<p>  The Waki Commission had a clearly defined but sufficiently wide mandate. Independent and 
expert commission members were appointed, and staff with specialized expertise were hired. 
International commissioners and staff were brought in to maximize impartiality, and no serving 
members of the state security forces were permitted to apply for Commission positions. The 
Commission had the power to summon any person to testify and to produce any documents. 
Despite these many positive aspects, the Commission did encounter obstacles. While it could 
hold private hearings to protect witness identity, it did not have a comprehensive witness 
protection program. And, some Government officials interviewed were slow in producing 
requested documents or did not produce the proper materials.  </p>

</p>
<p>detail those periods of violence and naming the perpetrators, no officials were ever punished for 
their role in the violence. It is essential that prosecutions take place to provide justice to victims, 
and to address impunity before the next general elections. 
</p>
<p>69. Without the special mechanisms recommended by the Waki Commission, there is little 
prospect for accountability. This was made clear during my investigations into the post-election 
violence, which I focused on Eldoret (Rift Valley Province) and Kisumu (Nyanza Province). 
</p>
<p>70. The town of Eldoret in the Rift Valley was one of the first sites of post-election violence, 
with attacks initially directed at the Kikuyu population. Much of the anti-Kikuyu violence 
appears to have been intended to push them out of the province: many were threatened and told 
to leave the area, and their homes and businesses were destroyed. Attackers formed groups of 
fifteen plus individuals, and specifically targeted Kikuyu homes or villages.<b>64</b> Other groups 
patrolled public areas, and used ID cards to identify Kikuyu persons.<b>65</b> In some areas, 
significantly larger groups (of up to 2,000) formed - armed with machetes, bows and arrows, 
projectiles filled with petrol - and created road blocks and carried out large-scale attacks. 
71. Provincial level officials in the Rift Valley were largely in denial about the findings of the 
Waki Commission. The Commission found that police planning was scant, and that they were 
&#8220;poorly prepared&#8221;. When I asked the officials for their response to this, they admitted that they 
could not handle the violence that erupted, but argued nevertheless that they were prepared. 
Worryingly, they stated that there had been no serious changes to policing or planning in 
response to the PEV. In terms of accountability, I was assured that many PEV complaints had 
been registered, and that they were at various stages of the criminal justice system. When I asked 
about police conduct, I was first told that no inquests into police misconduct had been opened, 
and that no complaints had been received. I was subsequently told that there had been some 
cases, and that the information would be provided to me. It never was. 
</p>
<p>72. In Nyanza, I attempted to find out what investigations had been conducted by police into 
the many reports of police killings committed during the PEV.<b>66</b> The Waki Commission found 
that the police indiscriminately used live ammunition, and that over half of the gunshot victims 
had wounds from the back (calling into question what threat to life they could have presented at 
the time of the shooting). Nyanza provincial police officials said to me that they had recorded 
82 cases of individuals killed by bullet wounds during the PEV. When I asked them for 
information about the progress of these investigations, and for their assessment of the 
appropriateness of the use of force in each case, they were able to tell me nothing, beyond the 
basic fact that they had conducted investigations, and that 60 files had been sent to the 
Attorney-General for assessment. In comparison, they showed me extensive documentary

<p>evidence of the looting that occurred in the PEV period. After my visit, I was provided additional 
materials by the Attorney-General, which indicated that <i>one</i> trial was currently on-going of a 
police officer who shot and killed two youths following riots in Kisumu. 
</p>
<p>73. At the direction of the Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions created a 
team of State Counsels to undertake a review of all 2007 post election violence cases, together 
with officers from the Criminal Investigations Division.<b>67</b> The team was to determine whether 
there was sufficient evidence in support of the charges, and recommend whether the case should 
proceed to trial or be withdrawn. The team found that inquest files in &#8220;all the affected provinces&#8221; 
were &#8220;far from complete&#8221;.<b>68</b> Their report notes that, across Kenya, &#8220;considering the high number 
of deaths reported there should have been more inquest files opened or murder files 
forwarded&#8221;.<b>69</b> Of 51 files of deaths in Nyanza received by the team, 44 files related to killings by 
police. Of those, 42 files were returned to the police for further investigations. The counsel 
review notes that the types of evidence missing from the files included such basic evidence as: 
eye witness statements, ballistics evidence, and statements from police officers involved in the 
operation. With respect to the Rift Valley, they found that &#8220;a very high number of cases&#8221; 
required further investigations. Most Rift Valley files only contained the statement of the 
complainant, with no further investigations whatsoever.<b>70</b> This report is clearly a damning 
indictment of investigations, and strongly suggests that serious prosecutions of police and 
officials are unlikely to take place within the criminal justice system.

<p>74. Discussion, especially in Kenya&#8217;s Parliament, about how to achieve accountability in light 
of the failures in the current system has tended to be presented as a choice <i>between</i> the Special 
Tribunal and the ICC. This contributed to the defeat of the Special Tribunal proposal in 
January 2009. Some felt that only an international tribunal could provide the needed 
accountability and so voted against a local tribunal. But for those who genuinely want to end 
impunity, the approaches should not be treated as mutually exclusive. A domestic tribunal is 
essential to address a large number of perpetrators, and to promote national ownership of 
accountability. But until an effective Special Tribunal is established, the Prosecutor for the ICC 
should undertake investigations. Given the evidence already available, the ICC would be able to 
move quickly. While an international tribunal is clearly designed to try only a small number of 
the most serious offenders, the extent of abuses during the PEV, their recent occurrence, and the

<p>certainty of further violence at the next elections in the absence of accountability makes this a 
critical case for the Prosecutor to take up. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  KENYA NATIONAL COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>75. The KNCHR, Kenya&#8217;s national statutory human rights institution has the authority to 
investigate complaints of human rights violations.<b>71</b> It is a highly professional organization of 
committed and skilled staff. In the absence of other well-functioning accountability mechanisms, 
it has played a critical role in bringing to light serious human rights issues. Yet its legitimacy is 
questioned by officials, and especially by the police, every time it issues a report. Its carefully 
researched reports rarely draw a substantive response. Instead, officials opt to attack its mandate, 
credibility or expertise, and the police accuse its members of being in the pay of the Mungiki.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  INTIMIDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
</b></p>
<p>76. Human rights defenders (HRDs) were intimidated, harassed and threatened in a systematic 
manner by Government and security force officials during and after my visit (see Appendix III). 
Intimidation was particularly severe in Mt Elgon, but took place in Nairobi and elsewhere. As a 
result, a large number of HRDs have been forced to go into hiding or exile. The intimidation was 
clearly designed to silence individual activists, prevent civil society investigations of abuses, and 
to instill widespread fear amongst civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>77. Those who have control over the security forces - including the President, the Defence 
Minister, and the Internal Security Minister - have offered no substantive response to the 
complaints issued by myself and the United Nations about this intimidation. They have issued no 
public statements acknowledging harassment, and have taken no measures to hold to account 
those responsible or to protect threatened activists. The Human Rights Council ignores this 
contempt for its Special Procedures system at its peril. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  WITNESS PROTECTION 
</b></p>
<p>78. In the Kenyan context - where many potential witnesses are justifiably afraid that testifying 
will lead to reprisals<b>73</b> - an effective and reliable witness protection program is a necessary 
component of efforts to fight impunity. It will be one of the most vital factors in the success or 
otherwise of attempts to prosecute those accused of offences during the PEV, in Mt Elgon, and 
in relation to police killings. Without a trusted and well-functioning witness protection program, 
many people will simply be unwilling to testify, and there will consequently be insufficient

</p>
<p>Commissioner of Police). (&#8220;Our detectives started investigating information to the effect that 
some officers from the KNHRC have been regularly receiving payments from the outlawed 
Mungiki sect followers. Kenyans must ask themselves the services the Mungiki is paying for.&#8221;). 
<b>73
</b></p>
<p>  See Appendix II: Case 5, Case 9, Case 10, Case 13, Case 22, Case 25, Case 28. </p>

</p>
<p>evidence to prosecute. And without protection, far too many of those who do testify will be 
putting their lives at risk. 
</p>
<p>79. A number of important steps have recently been taken to set up a witness protection 
program. In September 2008, a witness protection law came into effect.<b>74</b> The Attorney-General 
promulgated regulations pursuant to the Act in December 2008, and began the process of setting 
up a Witness Protection Unit in his office.<b>75</b> But to date, witness protection exists on paper only: 
the Director of Public Prosecutions informed me that the unit has not yet provided protection to 
any witness. 
</p>
<p>80. The current design of the program is also likely to lead to significant problems in the 
Kenyan context. The Attorney-General is provided the &#8220;sole responsibility&#8221; to decide whether to 
include a witness in the witness protection program.<b>76</b> The set-up of this program can be 
expected to work well where witnesses are testifying against private actors or criminal 
organizations. But this expectation is unlikely to hold true where witness testimony implicates 
police and Government officials. In light of the history of impunity and intimidation, witnesses 
and civil society justifiably have little faith in a program that entrusts their safety to the very 
system they fear. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  COMPENSATION 
</b></p>
<p>81. The families of victims unlawfully killed have little redress. Throughout the country, I met 
children and widows whose parents or husbands had been murdered. The family members have 
been left with few avenues to obtain sufficient funds to meet even basic necessities such as 
housing, food, and school fees. The Government should ensure that compensation is paid to the 
families of victims. 
</p>
<p>82. There is a one-year statute of limitations period for claims in tort against government 
officials. Given the factual complexity of many cases, the difficulties in accessing lawyers for 
many Kenyans, and the widespread displacement that the post-election violence caused, the 
limitation period has prevented many families of victims of the PEV from bringing civil suits 
against police or other officials. The DPP acknowledged that this was a problem. For unlawful 
killings and other serious abuses, the one-year limitation period should be removed. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  THE DEATH PENALTY 
</b></p>
<p>83. Kenya has had a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty since 1987. However, the 
death sentence continues to be handed down on a regular basis, and in a manner that violates 
international law. International law prohibits the mandatory death penalty, and requires 
                                                 
</p>

</p>
<p>No. 110 of 2008).

<p>individualized sentencing to prevent the arbitrary deprivation of life.<b>77</b> International law also 
strictly limits the crimes for which the death penalty can be applied to cases where it can be 
shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life.<b>78</b> Further, the death 
penalty is unlawful where it follows a trial that violates basic due process guarantees.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p>84. However, Kenya has the mandatory death penalty for treason, murder, robbery with 
violence, and attempted robbery with violence.<b>80</b> The provision of the death penalty for robbery 
with violence is particularly concerning: the elements of the crime create a low threshold for 
conviction, robbery is very common, and there are many thousands convicted each year. In the 
period 2004-2007, 15,265 people were convicted of robbery with violence. There is no legal aid 
for those charged with robbery with violence, and only limited legal aid is provided for those 
charged with murder. In practice, this means that individuals face a death sentence often without 
the assistance of legal counsel. The high levels of corruption in the judiciary further call into 
serious question the fairness of trials. 
</p>
<p><b>X.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Killings by police 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The President should publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending unlawful 
killings by the police. To this end: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Police Commissioner should be replaced immediately; 
 (b) Unambiguous public orders should be issued that under no circumstances will 
unlawful killings by the security forces be tolerated. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Police death squad killings should be prevented, investigated, and punished: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Minister for Internal Security should order the disbandment of all death 
squads, and report to Parliament on the measures he has taken to ensure that the squads 
no longer operate; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Government should establish an independent inquiry into the operation of 
police death squads. To secure the inquiry&#8217;s integrity and independence, Kenya should 
invite foreign police investigators (such as the FBI, or Scotland Yard) to assist. The

<p><b>inquiry&#8217;s work should begin by investigating the detailed allegations contained in reports 
of the KNCHR, and in the testimony of the police whistleblower. It should report its 
findings to Parliament, and be empowered to provide evidence and names for criminal 
prosecution to the Government; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) All individuals under investigation for their involvement in police death squads 
should be removed from active duty during that period. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>A review of the use of force provisions in the Constitution of Kenya, the Police Act, 
and the Standing Force Orders should be undertaken to bring them into line with Kenya&#8217;s 
obligations under international law. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Across-the-board vetting of the current police is necessary. This needs to be part of a 
comprehensive reform of the police, including the creation of a Police Service Commission, 
as recommended by the Waki Commission.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government should ensure that its expressed commitment to centralize the 
records of police killings at police headquarters in Nairobi is implemented. All police 
stations should be required to report such cases to headquarters within 24 hours. The 
complete statistics of police killings should be made public by the police headquarters on a 
monthly basis, and the past records of police killings should be made publicly accessible. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Killings by the Mungiki 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Mungiki should immediately cease their harassment, abuse, and murder of 
Kenyans</b>.  
</p>
<p>91. <b>The Mungiki political leadership should publicly condemn killings and other abuses 
by their members, and take action to prevent all such crimes.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability for police killings 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Internal and external accountability for police should be improved through the 
following institutional reforms: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) An internal affairs division should be created within the police force, with an 
element of autonomy from senior management, composed of police who are specially 
tasked to investigate complaints against the police; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) An independent civilian police oversight body with sufficient resources and 
power to investigate and institute prosecutions against police responsible for abuses should 
be established by Act of Parliament, in line with Waki Commission recommendation 2 for 
the police. 
</b></p>
<p><b>D.  Criminal justice system 
</b>93. <b>The Attorney-General should resign. This is necessary to restore public trust in the 
office, and to end its role in promoting impunity. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Political control over prosecutions should be eliminated and the prosecutorial powers 
currently held by the Attorney-General should be vested in an independent Department of 
Public Prosecutions.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>To reduce corruption and incompetence in the judiciary: 
 (a) Radical surgery needs to be undertaken to terminate the tenure of the majority 
of the existing judges and replace them with competent and non-corrupt appointees; 
 (b) Judicial appointment procedures should be made more transparent, and all 
appointments made following a merits-based review of the appointee; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Judicial Service Commission should be reformed so that its membership is 
representative; and its role in appointments, discipline and dismissal of judicial officers be 
clarified and strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Judicial Service Commission should create a complaints procedure on 
judicial conduct. 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Accountability for post-election violence 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Parliament should establish a constitutionally entrenched Special Tribunal, as 
recommended by the Waki Commission. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The prosecutor of the ICC should immediately undertake, of his own volition, an 
investigation into the commission of crimes against humanity by certain individuals in the 
aftermath of the 2007 elections. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Investigations and prosecutions within the regular criminal justice system should also 
continue. The Office of Attorney-General should publicly report within one month 
following the publication of this report, and in six month intervals thereafter, on the 
progress of investigations and prosecutions of post-election related violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b>F.  Killings in Mt. Elgon 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Government should immediately set up an independent commission for 
Mt Elgon, modeled on the Waki Commission, to investigate human rights abuses during 
the period 2005-2008. The mandate of the commission should include abuses by the SLDF 
(including the role of officials in supporting the SLDF), abuses by the police and the 
military, and the reasons for the lengthy delay in Government intervention to stop the 
SLDF. Independent forensic analysis of the mass graves in Mt Elgon should also take place. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Government should make available to the ICRC and the KNHRC, with 
assurances of appropriate confidentiality, the names of all those detained at Kapkota 
military camp, along with photographic and other documentary evidence of the detention 
and screening regime. This would facilitate the quest to resolve disappearances and enable 
a thorough accounting to be undertaken. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>101. <b>The Government should provide funding and other assistance to the families of those 
who remain disappeared following the police-military intervention. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Government should ensure that evidence of killings, and especially the mass 
graves in Mt Elgon, is not destroyed. Civil society should not be prevented from visiting 
these sites. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>In light of the seriousness of the allegations against the military, the units deployed to 
Mt Elgon should be barred from participating in UN or African Union peace-keeping 
operations until independent investigations have taken place. Those found to have 
committed abuses or to have command responsibility for abuses should be prosecuted and 
dismissed from the military. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>These measures should be encouraged and supported by the international 
community, and particularly those countries providing military aid to Kenya. 
</b></p>
<p><b>G.  Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>A well-funded witness protection program that is institutionally independent from the 
security forces and from the Office of the Attorney-General should be created as a matter 
of urgency. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The international community should continue to support Kenya&#8217;s efforts to create an 
effective witness protection program. 
</b></p>
<p><b>H.  Compensation and civil redress 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Government should ensure that compensation is provided to the families of those 
victims unlawfully killed by the police or other security forces. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>For unlawful killings and other serious human rights abuses, the one-year statutory 
limitation period on suits in tort against public officials should be removed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  Kenya National Commission on Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Police officials should cease their frequent accusations that KNCHR staff are paid by 
or work with criminal organizations. If the police have evidence of criminal behaviour by 
any person, such persons should be investigated, charged and prosecuted according to 
regular procedure.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Reports by the KNCHR should be tabled in Parliament as soon as practicable after 
they are presented to the Minister for Justice. The Government should provide a

<p><b>J.  Intimidation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Government of Kenya should immediately issue instructions to the police, the 
military, and district and provincial officials to cease and desist from acts of intimidation 
and harassment of human rights defenders. The text of these instructions should be made 
public. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Government should ensure that independent investigations take place to 
determine who was responsible for carrying out and ordering the intimidation. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Government should accept international offers to provide criminal investigation 
assistance to identify those responsible for the 5 March 2009 killings of two prominent 
human rights defenders from the Oscar Foundation Free Legal Aid Clinic, 
Mr Oscar Kamau Kingara and Mr John Paul Oulu. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The Government should report, publicly and to the UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, within 3 months following the publication of this report, on the steps it is 
taking to prevent and prosecute intimidation of human rights defenders.  
</b></p>
<p><b>K.  The death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Kenya should amend its death penalty laws so that it only applies to the crime of 
intentional deprivation of life, and is not mandatory following conviction. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Kenya at the invitation of the Government from 16-25 February 2009. I travelled 
to Nairobi, Rift Valley Province (Nakuru, Eldoret and Kiambaa), Western Province (Bungoma 
and Kapsokwony), Nyanza Province (Kisumu), and Central Province (Nyeri). 
</p>
<p>2. From the Government of Kenya, I met with officials at all levels, including: the Prime 
Minister; the Minister and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, National Cohesion 
and Constitutional Affairs; the Assistant Minister and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of 
Defence; the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of State for Provincial Administration and 
Internal Security; the Chief of Staff of the Kenyan Armed Forces; the Commissioner of Police, 
and police from the General Service Unit, the Administration Police, and the Criminal 
Investigations Department; members of the National Security Intelligence Service; the Public 
Complaints Standing Committee; the Police Oversight Board; the Director of Public 
Prosecutions; the Chief Justice and Registrar of the High Court; the Chairs and members of 
parliamentary committees on international affairs, internal security, justice, and outlawed 
organizations; the Provincial Commissioners and Provincial Security and Intelligence 
Committees for the Rift Valley, Nyanza and Central provinces; and the District Commissioners 
and District Security and Intelligence Committees for Uasin Gishu District (Rift Valley 
Province) and Mount Elgon District (Western Province). Subsequent to my visit, I was provided 
additional information from the Government of Kenya, including from the Attorney-General, the 
defence forces, and the police. 
</p>
<p>3. I met with a large number of representatives of the diplomatic community. 
</p>
<p>4. I spoke with many representatives from international, national and local civil society 
organizations. I also met with the commissioners and staff of the Kenya National Commission on 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. Before I visited Kenya, I was able to analyse in detail the many reports prepared on human 
rights issues in Kenya, including reports by the Government, parliamentary committees, 
commissions of inquiry, police, and international, national and local civil society organisations. 
</p>
<p>6. My team and I conducted over 100 individual interviews with victims, witnesses, and 
family members of victims of human rights abuses. They included victims of and witnesses to 
militia and gang violence, criminal violence, and police and military violence. 
</p>
<p>7. I also met with the UN Resident Coordinator, his Senior Human Rights Advisor and 
representatives from many UN agencies present in Kenya. I am grateful to the Resident 
Coordinator&#8217;s Office for facilitating my mission. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Appendix II 
</b></p>
<p><b>SELECTED CASES 
</b></p>
<p> In this report I have taken particular caution in naming and identifying victims and 
witnesses. Most witnesses did not want their names or other identifying material made public in 
any way, or provided to the Government, even in confidence. Many of those with whom I spoke 
claimed to live in fear of the Government&#8217;s security forces and felt that exposing their identities 
would open them up to (further) intimidation or worse. The very serious instances of 
intimidation against those who testified before me - detailed in section VI and Appendix III of 
this report - which took place both during and after my visit indicate clearly that such fears are 
warranted. For this reason, although my team and I conducted over 100 lengthy witness 
interviews, only a small number of individual cases containing identifying information are 
referred to in this report. In most of the selected cases summarized below, significant identifying 
material has been withheld to protect the witnesses and their families.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Case 1: </b>Dr. James Nganga Kariuki Muiruri (29 years old) was killed on 24 January 2009. He 
had a law degree, a master&#8217;s degree, and had just completed a PhD, all from universities in the 
UK. While visiting his family in Nairobi, he went out one night with his brother. Following a 
disagreement at a hotel, on their way home, their vehicle was blocked by two other cars. James 
got out of the car, and was harassed by the passengers from the other vehicles. One ordered 
James to handcuff himself. When he asked why, James was fatally shot. The assailants drove off. 
Subsequently, a police officer reported that he had shot a &#8220;bank robber&#8221; and &#8220;Mungiki member&#8221;. 
When it became known to the police that James&#8217; brother was a witness to the event, that James&#8217; 
father was a well-known former member of Parliament, and that James was a respected scholar, 
they claimed that the officer who shot James was new to the force and &#8220;trigger happy&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 2: </b>A group of six people were walking at night in May 2007. The group was taking a 
young child to hospital for emergency treatment. The group heard what they described as a hail 
of gunfire and threw themselves to the ground. Shortly thereafter, they were approached by men 
who identified themselves as police. The police asked why the group was walking at night, and 
stated that &#8220;only bandits walk at night&#8221;. The group explained that they had been taking a child to 
hospital, and the police apologized for firing at them. Their shooting, however, had killed one 
male adult, a female adult and her 16 month old child. The post-mortem reports for the mother 
and the child indicated that one bullet killed both of them (the mother was holding the child). 
Family members made complaints, but there had been no progress on holding the police to 
account.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Case 3: </b>Benson Mwangi Waraga was a tailor, and photographed by the media while being 
arrested by police on 17 May 2007. Apparently, the police had entered the tailor&#8217;s building in 
pursuit of suspected criminals. Mr Waraga and his employees were arrested along with a number 
of other people found in the building. At the police station, Mr Waraga was taken to a separate 
room from the other detainees and from his employees. His employees were released from 
custody on 18 May. Mr Waraga&#8217;s family unsuccessfully attempted to find him at the police 
station. On 19 May, they found his body at City Mortuary. (The body was recorded as 
&#8220;unknown&#8221;). The family was told by mortuary staff that police had brought the body to the 
mortuary. A pathologist report states that Mr Waraga died due to &#8220;multiple organ injuries due to 
multiple gunshots&#8221; and that the &#8220;fatal bullets were shot from behind.&#8221; According to the police </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p>whistleblower testimony, the tailor and three other suspects were picked up from the Kamukunji 
police station, taken to City Park, and shot at 7.00 pm. Firearms were planted on the men. 
According to family members, they made complaints to the police, but the CID officer they 
reported to stated that he could not get statements from the officers believed to be responsible 
because they were his seniors. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 4: </b>The witness, the mother of the victim, testified that her son was arrested by police while 
traveling on a matatu in November 2007. The mother went to the police station where her son 
was being held, and told to pay 30,000 KSH. She was told, &#8220;If you do not bring the money by 
tomorrow, we will kill him, because he is a Mungiki.&#8221; The next day, her son was released, 
despite non-payment by the mother. But a few days later, he was again arrested while traveling 
on a matatu, in front of a large number of witnesses. The mother has not seen her son since. She 
was told by CID that there was nothing they could do to help.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Case 5: </b>The witness was arrested in August 2007. He paid the police 10,000 KSH, and they let 
him go with a warning not to say anything to anyone about what occurred. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 6: </b>In a killing detailed by the police whistleblower, a suspected Mungiki named &#8220;Kibe&#8221; 
was arrested at Kariobangi Light Industries roundabout. He was taken to a police station, but 
instead of being detained in a cell, was interrogated in a police vehicle. He was told to get a bribe 
for the arresting police officers, and he raised 50,000 Kenyan shillings. When he gave this to the 
police, they released him. However, two of the officers followed Kibe, with the intent of 
re-arresting him. According to the police whistleblower, &#8220;It was planned in such a way that the 
relatives won&#8217;t suspect these police officers who had previously arrested him. Their argument 
was that as long as they saw him give bribe and subsequently being released, there is no way 
these relatives would suspect them to re-arrest him.&#8221; The two officers stopped Kibe, boarded his 
vehicle, and ordered him to drive to a secluded area (a forest). Four vehicles of police followed 
Kibe&#8217;s vehicle. At the forest, Kibe was strangled with a rope, and beaten with pangas (machetes) 
and rungus (sticks). After he died, his body was then dragged for some 100 metres behind his 
vehicle, with the rope that was tied around his neck. He was then untied and left along the 
roadside. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 7: </b>On 21 June 2007, Kimani Ruo (an alleged Mungiki leader) was leaving court after 
charges against him had been dismissed. Various photographs were taken of him by the press, 
while he was walking out of court. Police officers are amongst those in the photos, walking next 
to Kimani. Witnesses saw Kimani speaking with police officers. Kimani told one of his 
acquaintances that he needed to go with the police. He then disappeared. His family and friends 
searched in police stations, but did not find him. According to the police whistleblower 
testimony, the members of the special police squad were instructed to go to the Nairobi Law 
Courts. Once there, they received instructions to detain Kimani. At approximately 12.30 pm, 
Kimani was told to get in the vehicle being driven by the whistleblower. The whistleblower was 
instructed to keep the tinted windows of the vehicle rolled up, and to not let Kimani make any 
calls or leave the vehicle. The whistleblower&#8217;s vehicle was subsequently joined by three other 
vehicles occupied by police officers. They drove to Ngong Forest, where Kimani (along with 
two other Mungiki suspects brought in the other vehicles) was interrogated, and tortured. The </p>

</p>
<p>interrogation was tape recorded, and played back to senior officers over a telephone. Kimani was 
held overnight, and the next day taken in a convoy of five vehicles to an unoccupied farm area 
where he was killed with ropes, pangas and rungus. The officers involved were subsequently all 
given 12,000 KSH by senior officials. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 8: </b>The mother and wife of a male victim both testified that in 2008 the victim was asked to 
meet a police inspector at a restaurant. The man was accompanied by his wife and a male friend. 
As they left, the police inspector made a phone call, and two vehicles drove up to the front of the 
restaurant. The two men were put into the vehicles, and have not been seen since. The wife and 
her relatives made complaints to the Provincial Police Officer and the CID, but the case remains 
unresolved. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 9: </b>On 9 April 2008, the wife of Maina Njenga (a Mungiki leader currently in prison) and 
her driver were killed. (Earlier in the year, police had gone to the home of the driver&#8217;s parents 
and told them that the police would kill their children. The police used one of the children to 
locate the homes of the two brothers they were particularly looking for, one of whom was the 
driver). A friend of Maina&#8217;s wife was on the phone with her the day she was killed. While in her 
car, Maina&#8217;s wife told her friend, &#8220;we&#8217;re in trouble&#8221;. Her phone then disconnected, and remained 
switched off. Her and the driver&#8217;s body were found, mutilated, in a forested area a few days later. 
According to the police whistleblower, while driving, the two were blocked by three police 
vehicles, and taken first to Ngong Forest, and then to Machakos District. There, they were killed. 
The bodies were dumped in Gatundu. Two weeks later, on 28 April 2008, the driver&#8217;s brother 
was shot and killed while driving his car. According to the police whistleblower, he was tracked 
down and shot by the police. Most of the family members of the three deceased are in hiding, 
and fear reporting or pursuing the cases because they assume they will also &#8220;disappear&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 10: </b>A victim was fatally shot 3 times by police. The incident was witnessed by a group of 
people. But they all refused to give statements to the police for fear that they would suffer 
reprisals. The wife of the victim was forced to relocate. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 11: </b>The victim was arrested by police on 30 June 2008 from a bus station. He was 
photographed by a member of the press while being handcuffed. The victim was put in a police 
car. A bus driver who knew the victim called the victim&#8217;s wife and informed her of what had 
occurred. The wife, with other members of her family, searched for four days in a large number 
of police stations. On 6 July, the wife found her husband in the City Mortuary. Records there 
indicated that her husband had been brought to the mortuary on 1 July by police officers. The 
husband had been strangled. The wife and her family members made complaints to the police, 
and believe an inquest file was opened, but nothing has happened since. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 12: </b>The female witness went to a police station to report that her male relative had been 
shot in the leg by a stray bullet fired by police. She was seeking compensation for the medical 
treatment. When she reported the matter, the police were aggressive and denied that the event 
had taken place. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 13: </b>The witnesses were family members of a victim who was last seen being arrested by 
the police. The family attempted to find their relative, but searched in police stations and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p>mortuaries in vain. Two members of the family, who had been particularly active in looking for 
their relative, were asked to report to the police station. They then also disappeared, and at the 
time of my interview with the remaining family members, had not been found. The remaining 
family members live in fear, and have been forced to relocate. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 14: </b>The witness, from Mt Elgon, was forced to join the SLDF in early 2007. The SLDF 
came to his home and told him that, while he did nothing to secure his land, they were fighting 
on his behalf in the forest. They forced him to go to the forest with them. His duties in the SLDF 
camp were to chop firewood and cook for the approximately 300 other members who lived in the 
camp. While he was with the SLDF in the forest, his wife was abducted and killed by the SLDF 
because she was a Ndorobo. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 15: </b>The witness, a former SLDF member, joined the SLDF voluntarily in 2006. He lost 
some land in the land allocations, and - together with many other men from his village - joined 
the SLDF so that they could force the return of their land. He stayed in his village as an 
&#8220;informer&#8221; for the SLDF. Members of the SLDF subsequently raped his wife, and the witness 
fled from the area, and began to assist the police with intelligence about the location and 
operations of the SLDF. When the joint police-military operation began in March 2008, he 
provided further information to the security forces. He was provided a camouflage military 
uniform, and assisted in identifying SLDF members, and locating SLDF forest base camps. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 16: </b>The witness, a former SLDF member, initially joined the SLDF voluntarily in 2006. He 
joined because he was not allocated land during the land allocations, and the land he had been 
living on was allocated to someone else. One of his neighbours, a senior SLDF member, told the 
witness about the SLDF and its aims. The witness then joined the SLDF so that he could &#8220;fight 
for [his] land&#8221;. At least 20 other men from the witness&#8217;s village also joined. They resided in the 
forests around Mt Elgon. His brother was subsequently murdered by other SLDF members in a 
dispute over land allocations (the brother had been formally allocated land, and so he was 
considered by the SLDF to be a collaborator). The witness wanted to leave the SLDF at that 
point, but believed that if he left, he would be killed. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 17: </b>The witness, a former SLDF member, was forced to join in 2006. He left the SLDF 
after members of the group killed his brother in 2007. The witness formed another small armed 
group, composed largely of SDLF defectors. This group was subsequently attacked by the 
SLDF, and some of its members were killed. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 18: </b>In February 2008, the SLDF went to the female witnesses house in Mt Elgon at 
approximately 10 pm. The SLDF shot in the air, and took her family&#8217;s cows by force. When her 
husband attempted to stop them, he was shot. The witness took her husband to the local hospital, 
but he died the next morning. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 19: </b>The witness&#8217;s husband was killed by the SLDF in January 2007. In the months before 
the murder, her husband had frequently invited the police to his house for tea or meals. On the 
day her husband was shot by the SLDF, the police had come to the victim&#8217;s home just hours 
prior. Her husband was rushed to a nearby health centre, but was pronounced dead on arrival. 
The witness believed that the circumstances of the killing suggested that the SLDF shot the 
victim because he was judged to be a &#8220;collaborator&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p><b>Case 20: </b>The witness&#8217;s husband was taken by the SLDF in late 2007. A group of six SLDF came 
to the home of the witness and her husband late in the night. The SLDF broke the front door, two 
of them grabbed the husband by the arms, and took him outside. The SLDF also took two cows 
owned by the family. The militia members were armed with long knifes, and had covered their 
faces with pieces of cloth so that only their eyes were showing. Most of the homes in the village 
- occupied primarily by those of Ndorobo ethnicity - were burnt down by the SLDF. The next 
day, the witness saw a number of bodies in the destroyed village, but did not find her husband. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 21: </b>The witness&#8217;s brother, a school teacher in Mt Elgon, was close friends with a senior 
police officer. In October 2007, a large group of SLDF went to the witness&#8217;s brother&#8217;s home. 
They killed the brother, and forced the brother&#8217;s young son to watch. The SLDF told the son that 
they were killing his father because he was a &#8220;friend to the police&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 22: </b>Three male witnesses were detained by the security forces in March 2008. They were 
transported in an army truck to Kapkota camp. On the way, a fourth man - who other witnesses 
had seen being beaten by security officials - died in the vehicle. At Kapkota, the three witnesses 
were stripped naked. They were told not to look at the security officials, who wore camouflage 
military fatigues. The detained men were told to jump up and down, and were kicked by security 
officials. They were also beaten on the genitals. They were &#8220;screened&#8221; for SLDF membership, a 
process that involved being taken in turns before a vehicle, and told to call out their names. 
Detained men were either told to walk to one side of the vehicle and put their clothes on, or walk 
to the other side. Each of the three witnesses were determined not to be SLDF members. None of 
them reported to any official the abuse they suffered as they feared further abuse. The family 
members of the deceased man were never able to find his body. When they attempted to report 
the death to the police station, the police refused to take the complaint, and told the family to 
look for the body in the local mortuary. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 23: </b>In March 2008, security officials went to the home of the witness in Mt Elgon. They 
detained her husband. She never saw him again. She searched surrounding police stations, 
prisons and mortuaries, and checked Kapkota camp. She was told by a teacher who had been 
detained at Kapkota that her husband had been one of a group who were tortured at the camp. 
The teacher witnessed the husband being released from custody upon determination that he was 
not an SLDF member, but collapse and die at the camp. The teacher saw the body covered by 
tarpaulin by security officials. At the time of the interview with the witness, she still had not 
found her husband. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 24: </b>The witness was arrested at a market in Mt Elgon by security officials in March 2008. 
He was taken in a military lorry to a small military camp in Mt Elgon. Security officials at the 
camp removed the witness&#8217;s clothes and tortured him. He was then taken to a local police 
station. The police released him, and the witness&#8217;s family took him to a health centre for 
treatment for his wounds. The witness believes that he was detained because a male relative of 
his was a prominent public figure, and had been accused of being a member of the SLDF. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 25: </b>The witness, a female relative of the victim, was told by a Government official in 
Mt Elgon that the men in her family were invited to a meeting with the official. Two of her male 
relatives attended the &#8220;meeting&#8221;, at which they were beaten by security officials and taken in an </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>army vehicle to Kapkota camp. There, one of her male relatives received particularly severe 
torture. The next day, he was taken to Webuye prison. He died in prison that day. The witness 
found his body in the mortuary the following day. The family of the victim was told by the 
Government official not to pursue the matter or talk about it. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 26</b>: The witness lived in Mt Elgon. From mid-2006, the SLDF started coming to her village 
during the night. They would arrive in large groups, and two or three SLDF members would 
approach the homes of those they were looking for. Sometimes they would kill, abduct or beat 
the male head of a household. The SLDF called this &#8220;disciplining&#8221;, and it was targeted against 
those who were reported to have criticized the SLDF. In mid-2007, the police started going to 
her village, to look for SLDF. The police also killed and beat residents. The witness and her 
relatives fled to another area to escape the SLDF and police operations. In March 2008, a male 
relative of the witness was arrested from his home by security forces. At the time of arrest, he 
was beaten with batons. The witness was raped at her home by security officers. The male 
relative was taken to Kapkota camp. Another male detainee at the camp told the witness that he 
had seen her male relative beaten at Kapkota, and that he was then left lying on the ground, and 
died there. The family of the deceased man never found his body. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 27: </b>In April 2008, seven security force officials and three neighbours went to the home of 
the witness in Mt Elgon. The witness&#8217;s male relative was arrested, put in an army truck, and 
taken to Kapkota. The witness went to Kapkota the next day, but was told that her relative was 
being questioned and she was told to go home. The following day, she again went to Kapkota, 
but she was told to go to the police station. The police told her that her relative had been brought 
in to the police two days earlier, but that he had been returned to Kapkota. She went to Kapkota 
again, and was told to go to Bungoma prison. Prison officials stated that her relative was not 
detained there. She searched in nearby towns, but could not find her relative. She was later told 
by another male who had been detained in Kapkota that he relative had died there. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 28: </b>The male witness, from Mt Elgon, was arrested early in the morning in his village by 
security officials, together with two male relatives, and a group of other men in March 2008. The 
head of the security officers identified himself as an &#8220;Army Major&#8221;. The men were ordered to lie 
down, and the officials beat them. The witness showed the officials his employment card, and he 
was released. His male relatives were taken to Kapkota. The witness searched for his relatives, 
but did not find them. In June 2008, the witness went to the police station. He was told not to ask 
about the relatives again, because, according to the police officer, they were &#8220;criminals&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 29: </b>Witnesses and victims of the church massacre in Kiambaa (a small town near Eldoret) 
described being corralled inside the church, and watching their attackers block entrances, and 
stack mattresses against the church walls. The attackers set fire to the mattresses. Those who 
managed to escape from the burning church were chased, and when caught, beaten to death. 
Others were forced back inside the church. One witness described watching as an attacker threw 
a young child back into the burning church through a window. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 30: </b>In the Rift Valley, on 31 December 2007 at approximately 4 p.m.,<b> </b>the victim was shot 
in the arm, from the back, while he walked past a group of police officers. He was taken to a 
health centre by some other people who saw him injured on the street. Civil society groups 
assisted the victim to make a complaint to the police. At the time of the interview, no outcome of 
police investigations was known. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.6

</p>
<p><b>Case 31: </b>On 30 December 2007, the witness&#8217;s village (primarily Kikuyu) was attacked by a 
large group of armed youth. The witness and her husband ran from the house, together with 
many of their neighbours. The attackers started burning their homes. They attacked and killed 
the witness&#8217;s husband with machetes and sticks. She also saw three other people similarly 
murdered. The witness reported the death of her husband to the police, but has received no notice 
of any follow-up. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 32: </b>Before the elections, the Kikuyu witness was told by Kalenjin colleagues that he 
should consider leaving the Rift Valley before the voting, because of possible violence. The 
witness decided to stay, and was walking on 3 January 2008 with two male relatives, and one 
male friend. They were confronted by a group of approximately ten Kalenjin youths, armed with 
metal bars and sticks, and asked to produce identification. The group of ten was then joined by 
another group of approximately thirty. They demanded from the witness and his relatives and 
friend their valuables. They beat the witness (leading to a broken arm and severe cuts), and beat 
to death his two relatives. The witness reported the incident to the police, but had received no 
follow-up and does not expect any. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 33: </b>The witness lived in a mixed Kalenjin, Kikuyu, Kisii, Luo village in the Rift Valley. 
On 31 December 2007, attackers came to her village, were escorted by residents to Kisii and 
Kikuyu homes, and burnt down those homes. There are now no Kisii or Kikuyu homes left in the 
village. At the time of the interview, the witness was still living in tents with her son and other 
relatives. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 34: </b>The witness went to visit his mother in a village in the Rift Valley on 
29 December 2007. He could not immediately get to her because her village was surrounded and 
being attacked by a group of 50 + youth, armed with pangas, machetes, and bows and arrows. 
His mother later died from the injuries inflicted on her during the attack.<b> 
Case 35: </b>The witness&#8217;s brother was killed during an attack on the witness&#8217;s village by a group of 
100 + armed youth. The witness and other family members recorded complaints with the police. 
There has been no follow-up from the police. When they attempted to ask the police what action 
had been taken, they were told that the post-election violence was an &#8220;old story&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 36: </b>The Kikuyu female witness watched as her husband was hacked to death metres in 
front of her house by a group of men armed with machetes. The witness also saw the attackers 
kill a small boy at the same time. Approximately eight police were sitting in a car near her home, 
and did not intervene. When the witness subsequently asked them why they did not stop the 
attack, they said that it was not their duty. After the killing, the police took the two bodies to the 
mortuary. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 37: </b>The witness, from Nyanza, was shot by police just in front of his home in 
January 2008, while with his mother and his children. At the time of the shooting, he was sitting 
and talking with his mother. Medical reports and x-rays showed that he was shot in the lower 
abdomen. He now has difficulty walking, and his urinary tract functioning has been impaired. 
The witness believed that he was simply shot recklessly or indiscriminately. He reported the 
shooting to the police. They took no action, so the witness retained lawyers in mid-2008 to seek 
compensation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6

</p>
<p><b>Case 38: </b>On 28 January 2008, in Nyanza, the male victim was shot in the back of the head by 
police. The victim worked at a school. In the morning, there was confusion outside the school, 
and the victim went outside with school guards to assess the situation. He was then shot without 
warning, and he fell and died instantly. Three witnesses saw the incident. Witnesses believed that 
the shooting was either an accident or simply reckless. Relatives made a complaint to the police, 
but the police were hostile. When it became clear to the family that the police were doing little to 
investigate, they retained a lawyer to institute a civil suit. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 39: </b>In late December 2007, an 11 year old girl was fatally shot by police when bullets went 
through the family&#8217;s front door. When the family attempted to make complaints with the police, 
they were simply told &#8220;sorry&#8221;. The family had received no follow-up from the police. 
</p>
<p><b>Case 40: </b>The male victim was shot from the back on 30 December 2007. He was on a street in 
an estate, 4-5 kilometres from Kisumu. A group of looters began running up the street, and he 
started to run with them. He saw one police vehicle, chasing the looters, with police shooting 
into the air and at looters from the vehicle. The witness was shot, and fell to the ground. He also 
saw two other men fall, and subsequently die. He made complaints to the police, but never 
received any follow-up communication. </p>

<p><b>Appendix III 
</b></p>
<p><b>INTIMIDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
</b></p>
<p>1. Before, during, and after the visit of the Special Rapporteur to Kenya, human 
rights defenders were systematically intimidated by the police, military, and Government 
officials. 
</p>
<p>2. In Mt Elgon, human rights defenders (HRDs) were told not to bring witnesses or victims to 
meet with the Special Rapporteur. Human Rights defenders were also told not to personally 
testify before the Special Rapporteur about abuses committed by the police or military. They 
were told to speak only about abuses by the Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) armed group. 
HRDs were warned by text message, telephone calls, and in person. In one instance, officials 
addressed an internally displaces persons (IDP) camp. They told the residents that they should 
tell the Special Rapporteur about killings by the SLDF, but not about those by the Government. 
The officials told the IDP camp residents that if they followed these instructions, they would 
continue to receive food aid from the Government. 
</p>
<p>3. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Mt Elgon, National Security Intelligence Officers 
unsuccessfully attempted to obtain from NGOs the list of witnesses with whom he was going to 
meet. Civil society organizations were harassed repeatedly for information about the program 
and schedule of the Special Rapporteur, and for details of the NGO involvement in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mission. During meetings, the Special Rapporteur was alerted to the nearby 
presence of intelligence officers. When these officers were confronted by the Special Rapporteur, 
they ran away. 
</p>
<p>4. Subsequent to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings with witnesses, police, military and 
Government officials went to the homes and workplaces of human rights defenders, in an 
attempt to obtain lists of those who had testified before the Special Rapporteur. Individuals were 
told that they would be arrested if they did not hand over the list of names. This led to a number 
of human rights defenders being forced to flee the area. They were delivered further messages by 
telephone to &#8220;keep away&#8221; and &#8220;not come back&#8221;. Following the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s press 
statement, demonstrations were held in Mt Elgon against NGOs. Individuals were told that they 
would be denied their food assistance if they did not participate. 
</p>
<p>5. When the Special Rapporteur was in Kenya, he sought written assurances from the 
Government that this conduct would cease. In return, he received an official letter which stated 
that none of the human rights advocates had been threatened. The letter also referred to 
allegations about the conduct of the HRDs, and indicated that they would be investigated. At the 
time, this gave rise to even graver concerns about reprisals than he had initially. These concerns 
were borne out in the following weeks after he left Kenya, as increased numbers of HRDs 
continued to be intimidated, and were forced to flee or go into hiding. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.6 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>6. Subsequent to his visit, the intimidation meted out to HRDs in Mt Elgon was extended 
across Kenya. Advocates in nearly all of the civil society organizations who provided the Special 
Rapporteur information during his mission received threats. Their work has been severely 
impeded, many have been required to take extra personal security measures, and others have 
been forced to go into hiding or exile. Two weeks after his visit, two HRDs - Mr Oscar Kamau 
Kingara and Mr John Paul Oulu - who worked for the Oscar Foundation, a human rights 
organisation providing free legal aid services to the poor, were assassinated in their vehicle. The 
Special Rapporteur met with both men during his fact-finding mission to discuss the issue of 
killings by police. No one has yet been charged in connection with these murders.
