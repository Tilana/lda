<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth 
session from 21 May to 4 June 2012.  The review of Finland was held at the 6th meeting on 
23 May 2012. The delegation of Finland was headed by the Minister for International 
Development, Heidi Hautala. At its 10th meeting held on 25 May 2012, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Finland. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Finland: Djibouti, Jordan and Peru. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1<b> </b>and 
paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the 
review of Finland: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/13/FIN/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/FIN/2), A/HRC/WG.6/13/FIN/2/Corr.1 and A/HRC/WG.6/13/FIN/2/Corr.2; 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/FIN/3) and A/HRC/WG.6/13/FIN/3/Corr.1. 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
was transmitted to Finland through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet 
of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In its introductory statement, the delegation mentioned that it was a privilege and at 
the same time it was a challenge to be among the first countries being reviewed in the 
second round of the universal periodic review (UPR).  It reiterated the importance of UPR 
with its universal character to address human rights challenges at the international and 
national level. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation highlighted some key lessons that it documented during preparation 
of its second review. First, the Government maintained a transparent approach in the 
preparation of the national report. Authorities and civil society organizations had the 
possibility to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the human rights situation and to 
submit their views on a draft version of the report. Individual citizens had a possibility to 
present views on the Finnish human rights situation via an Internet forum. Secondly, the 
UPR work, before and after the review, should be founded on a real dialogue between the 
Government and the civil society. The third lesson is that the UPR is a continuous process 
and the implementation of recommendations is the most important phase. A voluntary mid-
term review helps in keeping the implementation process on track. 
</p>
<p>7. The focus of the national report was on the implementation of recommendations 
made during the first review and also depicted the development of human rights since 2008. 
It also referred to the implementation of two voluntary commitments made by Finland </p>


<p>during its first review. Finland also presented two new voluntary commitments: firstly, the 
commitment to the development-assistance objective was renewed and human rights were 
put at the centre of its development policy. Secondly, the newly established network for 
fundamental and human rights, with representatives from all the ministries would serve to 
undertake more effective monitoring of the implementation of Finland&#8217;s human rights 
obligations and commitments. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation continued its introductory statement by responding to advance 
written questions. On non-discrimination, the delegation highlighted that the equality 
legislation has been under reform to strengthen it in respect to the various grounds of 
discrimination, such as sexual orientation and disability. The renewed legislation should 
enter into force before the next Parliamentary elections in 2015.  A new Disability Policy 
Programme for the years 2010&#8211;2015 contains 122 concrete measures. Furthermore, the 
Government was finalizing a cross-sectoral action plan for gender equality. 
</p>
<p>9. The National Policy on the Roma, adopted in 2010, is a human rights-based policy 
and contains six key policy areas, 10 guidelines and 147 concrete proposals.  The National 
Policy is implemented by a steering and monitoring group which coordinates and monitors 
the policy implementation, provides expert support for the implementation, develops 
indicators, collects data and draws up the first progress report in 2013. Half of the members 
of the group have a Roma background. According to the Government&#8217;s new survey, the 
standard of housing for the Roma is almost the same as that for the main population. Roma 
people are, however, more frequently dependent on rented flats offered by municipalities. 
</p>
<p>10. In respect to domestic violence, the delegation stated that the Action Plan to reduce 
violence against women for the period of 2010-2015 promoted the prevention of violence, 
victim protection and support, as well as bringing offenders to justice.  The delegation 
stated that unfortunately the number of fatal attacks involving families had increased 
sharply in the past year. A panel has been set up to study inter alia how such incidents could 
be averted in the future. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 
the delegation highlighted the fact that Finland&#8217;s family policy fosters a safe living 
environment for children while also supporting parenthood. The Government implements 
the Programme for Children and Youth Policy 2012-2015. The Office of the Ombudsman 
for Children monitors the rights and well-being of children. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government planned to adopt a resolution on dismantling institutional care for 
persons with intellectual disabilities till 2020. A national goal was set to reduce the number 
of persons with intellectual disabilities living in institutions. A service and transfer plan was 
drawn up for all persons with disabilities who move away from residential care or their 
childhood home. Persons with intellectual disabilities will live in ordinary apartments either 
on their own or in small groups. To ensure that there is enough affordable housing for the 
intellectually disabled moving from institutional care, the Government is financing the 
construction of housing for disabled persons and offering them individual services and 
support. 
</p>
<p>13. The Government has been stepping up its work to combat racism, intolerance and 
xenophobia. The new amendment to the Criminal Code provided additional power to 
address racism and hate speech. Public display or dissemination of opinions or other 
messages that threaten, slander or insult any group is punishable. The police have stepped 
up Internet monitoring and have also been working in the social media, with virtual local 
police officers serving under their own names online and thereby facilitating contact by the 
public with the police. 
</p>
<p>14. Exemption from military service on grounds of conscience is provided for in 
legislation. Application for non-military service can be submitted before the military </p>


<p>service, during or after it. A claim of conscientious objection is valid without inquiry. Non-
military service is organized in such a way that the service duties do not conflict with the 
conviction of the person. Service is as long as the longest period of military service. A 
person who refuses to perform any type of service will be sentenced to imprisonment - the 
duration of which is half of the remaining service period and at the most six months. On the 
basis of the new Monitoring Sentences Act, those who have refused all kinds of service 
may be sentenced to house arrest, which will be electronically supervised, instead of 
unconditional imprisonment. Finland has been planning to reduce the duration of both 
military and non-military service by 15 days. 
</p>
<p>15. Several measures have been taken to alleviate the excessive length of judicial 
proceedings, including streamlining procedures and reallocating resources. Finland is also 
examining the possible introduction of plea bargaining. In 2010, a new law entered into 
force to guarantee compensation in cases where delays in judicial proceedings have taken 
place. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation reassured Finland&#8217;s commitment to full and effective implementation 
of the 1951 Geneva Convention related to the status of refugees and to respecting the 
principle of non-refoulement. When assessing the reasons for persecution, the Finnish 
Immigration Service took into account, inter alia, certain factors such as sexual orientation. 
According to the recent decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, asylum cannot be 
denied even if the person could have avoided persecution in his home country by hiding his 
sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation reported that the Government approved the first national Human 
Rights Action Plan, which defines concrete measures for the next two years. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the interactive dialogue, 42 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>19. Malaysia noted that Finland continued to face challenges in combating racism, 
intolerance and xenophobia, which was evident in the increase in racist and xenophobic 
incidents and the growing xenophobic attitudes in Finnish society. Malaysia also raised 
concerns that despite the obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) the media and advertising in Finland were 
becoming increasingly pornographic and reinforced the existing stereotypes of women and 
girls&#8217; low self- esteem.  Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>20. Mexico noted the new integration and anti-discrimination policies for immigrants. It 
also noted the entry into force of provisions to prevent racism, intolerance and xenophobia 
through information technologies. Mexico expressed its belief that the new inter-
institutional programme to reduce violence against women would provide a good basis to 
prevent violence against women, protect and support victims and bring perpetrators to 
justice. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Morocco praised Finland&#8217;s efforts to prevent violence against women and 
encouraged it to continue reducing the high level of homicide. Morocco supported 
Finland&#8217;s efforts to combat racism and xenophobia particularly on the Internet. It inquired 
</p>
<p>about the bill on reviewing the provisions on detention of foreigners. Morocco requested 
information about the progress made in the negotiations with Sweden and Norway on the 
Nordic Convention on the status of the Sami, as indigenous peoples. Morocco made a 
recommendation. </p>


<p>22. Mozambique commended Finland for its policies and actions to promote the rights 
of children, the elderly, minorities, in particular Roma, and disadvantaged people as well as 
to promote gender equality. It welcomed the incorporation into domestic law of 
international instruments. Mozambique encouraged Finland to continue with its 
commitments under the new Act on the promotion of integration and to carry on with its 
decision to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). 
</p>
<p>23. Namibia commended Finland&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights, including through its exemplary education programmes and policies on 
gender equality. It noted Finland&#8217;s ratification of core human rights instruments. It 
</p>
<p>commended Finland for emphasizing the rights of foreigners, immigrants and asylum 
seekers, but noted that they continued to face racism, discrimination, intolerance and 
xenophobia.  Discrimination against the Roma also remained a concern. Namibia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Nepal noted Finland&#8217;s strong foundation in human rights and its role in international 
development policy areas, peacekeeping and mediation. It noted with satisfaction the legal 
and institutional mechanisms to promote and protect human rights. Finland&#8217;s efforts to 
</p>
<p>reduce poverty, inequality and gender disparities were encouraging. Particularly noteworthy 
was the Child and Youth Policy Programme for 2012-2015 in that regard. Nepal made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Netherlands commended the establishment of the Human Rights Centre and its 
associated Human Rights Delegation, which meant to contribute to the development of 
indicators for assessing concrete realization of fundamental human rights. It encouraged the 
steps undertaken by Finland to enhance implementation of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. It hoped that Finland will continue with its on-going efforts to ensure children a 
safe, stable and violence &#8211;free living environment. Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Nicaragua noted that Finland&#8217;s human rights policy was also part of its international 
cooperation and hence human rights represented a pillar of Finland&#8217;s foreign policy. 
However, it expressed concern at the negative effects on human rights, that the 
conditionalities attached to the cooperation might have, especially on the right to 
development. Nicaragua emphasized that cooperation must comply with the guiding 
principles of mutual respect and solidarity. It encouraged Finland to address domestic 
human rights issues, particularly persistent discrimination against ethnic and Sami 
communities.  Nicaragua made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Norway praised Finland&#8217;s efforts in addressing issues of persons with disabilities. 
Noting the National Action Plan to prevent violence against women, Norway referred to the 
high level of domestic violence. Norway expressed concern at the overcrowding in the 
immigration detention facility. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Palestine welcomed Finland&#8217;s efforts to ensure the promotion and protection of 
fundamental freedoms and human rights for all irrespective of gender, age, origin, 
language, religion, beliefs, opinions, health or disability. It welcomed the signing by 
Finland of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against 
women and domestic violence, which was the first European Convention on women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights to establish a comprehensive legal framework. Palestine made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. In responding to the question on combating discrimination and racism, the 
delegation reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to combat racism and referred to a 
</p>
<p>number of measures undertaken by Finland that were cited in the national report, including 
the reform of relevant legislation and the establishment of a national human rights 
institution to conduct studies and monitor the realization of human rights in Finland. A 
number of policy initiatives, including equality planning and equality impact assessment 
have also been undertaken to promote equality in a number of areas of life. The </p>


<p>Government provided funding to civil-society initiatives to combat discrimination and 
racism. The Government promoted the participation of minority groups in decision making 
in a number of policy areas. 
</p>
<p>30. The delegation reported on the intention of Finland to ratify ILO Convention No.  
169 by 2015, with the aim of strengthening the participation of Sami, especially with regard 
to access to land and water. In this respect, Finland has amended the Mining and Water 
Acts to ensure rights of the Sami to participate in decision-making. A national programme 
for revitalizing the Sami language s has been adopted. A Nordic Sami Convention is being 
drafted with the participation of the representatives of the Government and Sami. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government has started the development of a new integration programme for 
the period 2012&#8211;2015, which would include measures to address the issues of employment, 
education, housing, access to social welfare and health, and cultural rights of immigrants. 
One of the focuses of this programme is the reduction of unemployment among 
immigrants. 
</p>
<p>32. To address the issue of child labour in the companies that operate outside of Finland, 
the Government has a special programme to promote corporate social responsibilities of 
such companies.  Corporate social responsibility has also been an important part of the 
Government&#8217;s development policy, with the aim being to actively cooperate with the 
companies to ensure their contribution to the development in the respective countries. 
</p>
<p>33. In respect to questions on Finland&#8217;s policy and approach to development 
cooperation, the delegation mentioned that, with regard to women&#8217;s rights international 
human rights, standards must be applied. Regarding Finland&#8217;s official development 
assistance objective, the delegation reiterated its commitment for increasing its ODA 
towards the 0.7 per cent target. 
</p>
<p>34. Finland started the training of trainers and establishment of focal points in 
municipalities for the formation of the network to combat domestic violence as part of the 
implementation of the National Action Plan on combating domestic violence. Finland has 
been also working to address the issue of the lack of shelters for victims of domestic 
violence and social services. 
</p>
<p>35. The Philippines welcomed the broad participatory process in the preparation for the 
second UPR cycle and the formulation of its First National Action Plan for human rights 
promotion and protection. It commended Finland&#8217;s frank acknowledgement that women are 
</p>
<p>paid 17 per cent less than men for doing the same or equivalent work. Philippines also 
referred to the situation of migrants and their protection under domestic labour and social 
laws. Philippines made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Portugal welcomed Finland&#8217;s determination to combat racism, intolerance and 
discrimination and the recent amendment to the Criminal Code. Portugal was concerned 
about the high incidence of violence against women and in this respect it welcomed the 
adoption of a national action plan in 2010, which was based on a comprehensive approach. 
It welcomed Finland&#8217;s signature of the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the 
</p>
<p>communications procedure. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Romania welcomed specific measures, including legislative measures, adopted by 
Finland in the field of human rights, particularly to reduce violence against women, to 
address homelessness and to improve the rights of immigrants and the Sami community. It 
requested more information on Finland&#8217;s National Action Plan on Fundamental and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. Romania also asked for details about results achieved in the implementation of its 
twin-track gender equality strategy. 
</p>
<p>38. The Russian Federation noted steps taken by Finland to implement the 
recommendations made during the first universal periodic review. The Russian Federation </p>


<p>expressed its concern over the fact that children were taken away from families and placed 
in children&#8217;s institutions based on arbitrary and groundless decisions. It referred to 
information provided by NGOs about insufficient professional training for the staff working 
in those institutions. The Russian Federation also expressed concern over the compulsory 
hospitalization of patients in psychiatric institutions.  The Russian Federation made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. Slovakia noted the broad and open national consultation process in the process of 
preparation of its report. It commended Finland for being among the first group of countries 
to sign the Optional Protocol to CRC on a communication procedure. Slovakia noted with 
appreciation the establishment of an independent human rights centre and associated human 
rights delegation attached to the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, jointly 
constituting Finland&#8217;s National Human Rights Institution. Slovakia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia welcomed the fact that Finland had taken meaningful steps to fulfil its 
commitments from the first cycle of the review, and that a gender perspective was 
integrated into the UPR follow-up process. It welcomed Finland&#8217;s commitment regarding 
human rights at the national and international level. In particular, it welcomed the 
leadership role of Finland in the process leading to adoption of a new Optional Protocol to 
CRC on a communications procedure, signed by Finland in 2012. Slovenia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Spain noted the strong commitment of Finland to the promotion and protection of 
human rights, which perfectly complemented its foreign policy both bilaterally and 
internationally, with particular emphasis on the United Nations system. Internally, Finland 
had rigorous constitutional protection and a number of independent bodies monitoring 
compliance of its human rights obligations and exercising control over public 
administration. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Sweden welcomed the Finnish National Action Plan for Human Rights adopted in 
March 2012 and the establishment of a Finnish National Centre for Human Rights. Sweden 
referred to the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights on the excessively lengthy 
trial proceedings and other violations of article 6 of the European Convention of Human 
Rights. It also mentioned the criticism that the Finnish Immigration Service faced with 
regard to the deportation of asylum seekers to countries where their safety was challenged, 
even with the risk of torture. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Thailand highlighted Finland&#8217;s efforts to prevent discrimination and violence against 
women and children. It commended the establishment of a national human rights institution 
and Human Rights National Action Plan. Thailand welcomed Finland&#8217;s efforts to promote 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination for the Roma population and urged Finland to further promote the rights 
of all minorities. It appreciated Finland&#8217;s victim-centred approach to combating trafficking 
in persons and its efforts to review procedures relating to asylum seekers. Thailand made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Ukraine praised Finland for the truly multi-participant approach in preparing its 
national report, which had enabled all interested national human rights actors, including 
civil society, to provide their views and assessments of the Finnish human rights situation. 
It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>45. Finland confirmed that the CRPD and its Optional Protocol would be ratified once 
two working groups set up to prepare legislation for ratification and to consider the legal 
obstacles to ratification  had completed their work in autumn 2012. A draft bill on the new 
legislation should be ready for the submission to the Parliament at the earliest in autumn 
2013. </p>


<p>46. Regarding the ratification of other international treaties, the delegation said that the 
draft bill on the OP-CRC on the sale of children had been approved by the Parliament and 
ratification should take place in June 2012. As for the ratification of the Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the 
delegation assured that ensuring economic, social and cultural rights was the Government&#8217;s 
priority and that a draft bill had been prepared for submission to Parliament in this respect. 
The ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (CAT) has also 
been in the process and a Government bill was currently being drafted for submission to 
Parliament in autumn 2012, with the Parliamentary Ombudsman proposed as the required 
national mechanism. The Government of Finland had considered several times the 
ratification of the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families (ICRMW) but had concluded that it was not expedient to ratify 
the Convention, as no distinction was made between migrant workers and other immigrants 
in Finnish legislation and they therefore enjoyed the same rights. Moreover, the status of 
migrant workers was not only affected by social security law, but also by social security 
agreements concluded by Finland and European Union social security legislation. 
</p>
<p>47. With regard to combating bullying and discrimination in schools, the delegation said 
that Finland had launched an anti-bullying programme with the participation of over 90 per 
cent of schools. An evaluation of the programme indicated that it had significantly reduced 
bullying and victimization, including verbal, physical and cyber bullying, with 98 per cent 
of victims reporting that their situation had improved. Furthermore, a positive effect on 
academic achievement and motivation levels had been recorded. The programme had won 
the European Crime Prevention Award in 2009. 
</p>
<p>48. Turning to sexual crimes and rape, in 2011 the revised Criminal Code came into 
force with widening the scope rape. 
</p>
<p>49. In response to enquiries about Finland&#8217;s first Human Rights National Action Plan, 
the delegation said that it had been prepared through an open dialogue with civil society, 
the Ombudsman and other stakeholders. The main priority had been to ensure efficient 
follow-up and implementation of its commitments. 
</p>
<p>50. As for questions relating to minority groups, trafficking in persons and the detention 
of foreigners, the delegation said that revised legislation on trafficking in persons was under 
preparation, including provisions for a national assistance system for victims of trafficking, 
identifying victims and exchange of information between the authorities and other actors. 
Furthermore, the Finnish police, border guards and immigration service personnel received 
regular training on how to combat human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>51.  The detention of unaccompanied minor asylum seekers will be prohibited and 
alternatives to detention should take precedence. The interministerial working group had 
recently published its first draft on child detention, which proposed the prohibition of the 
detention of unaccompanied children and that the detention of other children should be 
more closely regulated. Children detained with their families under the Aliens Act would 
only be placed in administrative detention units, for as short a duration as possible and only 
as a last resort. Concerning the question raised on comprehensive statistical data on 
detained foreign nationals, the delegation acknowledged that there was a lack of sufficient 
information, but efforts were being made to remedy the situation. 
</p>
<p>52. With regard to children placed in social institutions, measures to reduce the number 
of children taken into care would be strengthened, with the emphasis shifting to prevention 
and early support services. Recently, for the first time family care had overtaken 
institutional care as the primary form of substitute care. Children with significant problems, 
however, continued to be taken into care. There were plans to intensify the supervision of 
institutions by national and regional authorities. </p>


<p>53. Concerning questions raised on provisions for mental health, the delegation said that 
the new Health Care Act would deal also with mental-health issues and measures had been 
adopted to promote it within preventive primary services and voluntary services. The 
Mental Health Care Act was also due for review; this was scheduled for autumn 2012. One 
amendment planned was a revision of the rights of patients in cases of compulsory 
hospitalization.  
</p>
<p>54. With regard to gender equality in the workplace, the delegation acknowledged that 
there was still a gender pay gap in Finland, which currently stood at 17 per cent. The main 
reason was the gender segregation prevalent in the labour market. Steps were being taken to 
bridge the gap through gender-awareness education, positive recruitment measures and 
steps to promote the equal sharing of parental responsibilities, including equal paternity and 
maternity leave. 
</p>
<p>55. As for the twin-track gender-equality strategy, the delegation said that gender 
mainstreaming was an important principle, and that it works better if there was a key focal 
point in the Finnish Government; this is the Ministry of Social and Health Affairs. An 
interesting innovation had been &#8220;gender budgeting&#8221;, with all ministries responsible for 
identifying gender aspects when allocating budgets. It had proved useful in increasing 
gender awareness and thus contributing to gender equality. 
</p>
<p>56. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Finland to 
ensure effective implementation of the National Action Plan of 2010, especially with regard 
to women&#8217;s rights. It welcomed Finland&#8217;s commitment to ratify the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol and stressed the importance of 
this ratification. It referred to the creation of a national human rights institution.  United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Finland to continue protecting 
the rights of the Roma minority domestically. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. The United States of America congratulated Finland for its record on the human 
rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual (LGBT) individuals. It expressed concern at 
the excessive length of judicial proceedings and the occasional failure to provide detainees 
timely access to legal counsel. While commending Finland on its system for monitoring 
trafficking in persons, it noted that more effort should be made to identify and support 
victims. It was concerned by reports of societal discrimination against ethnic minority in 
Finland.  The United States of America made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Uruguay noted the adoption of the Action Plan on Fundamental and Human Rights. 
Uruguay commended Finland for its commitment to improve the implementation of the 
CRC. However, it raised concerns about the practice of corporal punishment in homes. 
Uruguay welcomed Finland&#8217;s efforts to revise its legislation in compliance with CAT. It 
</p>
<p>expressed concern over the use of administrative detentions for asylum seekers, irregular 
migrants, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable people.  It expressed concern over 
the Finish Government&#8217;s study of ICRMW, which recommended non-adherence to it. 
Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Uzbekistan asked Finland about measures that were envisaged to prohibit forced 
labour in the country, given that requiring destitute persons to work fell under the definition 
of forced labour under ILO Convention No. 29. It also asked what steps were being taken to 
ensure equal work opportunities for men and women, remove wage inequality and prohibit 
the dismissal of women because of pregnancy or childbirth. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Algeria appreciated the commitment of Finland to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of GDP to Official Development Assistance. It 
encouraged Finland to consider reviewing its position regarding the ratification of ICRMW. 
Algeria also stressed the need to take new initiatives to eliminate the gender-based pay gap
