<p><b>  Visit to the United States of America  
(25 to 29 January 2010) 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government of the United States of America, the Working 
Group of experts on people of African descent undertook an official visit to the United 
States of America from 25 to 29 January 2010. In the present report, the Working Group 
summarizes information received during the meetings it held with Government officials 
and civil society organizations regarding the general situation of people of African descent 
in the United States and the situations that expose them to discrimination and outlines the 
action taken at various levels for their well-being. It concludes with recommendations that 
the Working Group believes will, if implemented, make tangible improvements in the 
situation of people of African descent in the United States.   
</p>
<p> The Working Group members appreciated the very informative and frank 
discussions they had with Government and civil society representatives and were impressed 
with the comprehensive way in which attention to the situation of people of African descent 
is contemplated in all of the Government&#8217;s programmes to ensure the fundamental rights of 
its citizens. Although the members identified challenges still facing African Americans, the 
various Government representatives with whom they met accepted that, as is the case in all 
societies, in some areas there are still barriers to the full enjoyment of rights and efforts are 
continuing to correct disparities and discrimination where they are found to exist. 
</p>
<p> During their visit, the members of the Working Group found that the challenges 
faced by people of African descent in this country related mainly to disproportionately high 
levels of unemployment, generally lower income levels than the rest of the population, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>access to education (especially to higher levels of education) and quality of education, 
problematic access to quality health-care services and the high incidence of certain health 
conditions, electoral disenfranchisement and structural issues in the administration of 
justice (in particular incarceration rates). 
</p>
<p> The concrete measures recommended by the Working Group include the adoption of 
an anti-discrimination act, the continuation and enhancement of educational initiatives such 
as magnet and charter schools, the adoption of an appropriate employment quota system in 
the private sector, the extension of the use of statistics in court proceedings to demonstrate 
a prima facie presumption of discrimination, measures to address the disproportionate 
incarceration rates of people of African descent and the discriminatory application of some 
laws, greater consultation with African American communities concerning urban 
development projects that affect them, the establishment of a human rights commission in 
accordance with the Paris Principles with a dependency that deals specifically with people 
of African descent, and efforts to ensure to children of African descent all of the rights 
contained within the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. Bearing in mind its status as a special procedure of the former Commission on 
Human Rights, the Working Group of experts on people of African descent decided at its 
fourth session to undertake country visits as a means of effectively discharging its mandate. 
The Working Group recognized that such visits could contribute to in-depth understanding 
of the situation of people of African descent in various regions of the world 
(E/CN.4/2005/21, para. 98). 
</p>
<p>2. At the invitation of the Government of the United States of America, the Working 
Group undertook a country visit to this country from 25 to 29 January 2010. The 
delegation, headed by Mirjana Najcevska, the Acting Chairperson of the Working Group, 
also included the experts Ralston Nettleford and Monorama Biswas. During their visit, the 
experts visited New York and Washington, D.C. The members of the Working Group 
regret to report that Mr. Ralston Nettleford passed away during the country visit.  
</p>
<p>3. In New York, the Working Group members met with various non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). In Washington, D.C., the Working Group members held meetings 
with representatives of the Department of State, the Department of the Interior, the 
Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the United 
States Census Bureau and the Department of Homeland Security. They also met with 
Congressman Donald Payne of the Congressional Black Caucus and with NGOs. 
</p>
<p>4. The experts wish to thank the Government for its invitation and for its exemplary 
assistance before and during their visit to the country. They would also like to thank the 
NGOs and people of African descent with whom they met during their visit. In the present 
report the experts describe the information received by the members of the Working Group 
during their visit to the United States, identify good practices and make recommendations 
for actions that may assist in remedying challenges that were identified. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context of people of African descent in the United States of 
America 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. Most people of African descent in the United States are the direct descendants of 
Africans who were held captive and survived slavery in the seventeenth century. The 
conception of a race-based slave system developed in the 1700s. By 1775, Africans made 
up 20 per cent of the population in the American colonies, which made them the second 
largest ethnic group after the English. In 1863, during the American Civil War, President 
Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in 
states that had seceded from the Union were free.  
</p>
<p>6. The civil rights movement between 1954 and 1968 endeavoured to abolish racial 
discrimination against African Americans. Since then, direct individual or institutional 
(especially openly violent) discrimination has mainly disappeared from everyday life and 
African Americans have significantly improved their social and economic standing. 
However, structural and indirect discrimination is still visibly present in many fields of 
public life. Due partially to the legacy of slavery, racism and discrimination, African </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>Americans have had economic, social and educational disadvantages, as well as challenges 
to the enjoyment of basic human rights.  
</p>
<p>7. Today, African Americans have advanced greatly in education, but continue to have, 
on average, fewer years of studies than others in the United States. There remain today 
African American colleges and universities which were set up when segregated colleges did 
not admit people of African descent. By 1947, about one third of African Americans over 
65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. The 2004 
American Community Survey reported that about 80 per cent of people of African descent 
aged 25 and older were high school graduates and about 17 per cent had a bachelor&#8217;s 
degree or higher education. The inequality that African Americans have faced is also 
evident in the area of work, where African Americans are still underrepresented in 
employment nationwide. Although African Americans have benefited from the advances 
made over the past centuries, particularly among the educated, lingering effects of historical 
marginalization continue to exist. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Framework for the protection of the human rights of people of  
African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The international legal framework for the protection of the human rights of people of 
African descent 
</b></p>
<p>8. The United States has signed and ratified two international instruments related to the 
fight against racial discrimination: the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. The combined initial to third reports (CERD/C/351/Add.1) of the State to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination were submitted in 2000 and the 
combined fourth to fifth periodic reports (CERD/C/USA/6) were submitted to that body in 
</p><p>2007. The initial report of the United States to the Human Rights Committee 
(CCPR/C/81/Add.4) was submitted in 1994 and the combined second and third periodic 
reports (CCPR/C/USA/3) were submitted to that body in 2005.  </p>
<p><b> 2.  The national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The United States has demonstrated its commitment to combating racism and 
discrimination in its wide-ranging and comprehensive legislative framework, which 
protects and advances the right to non-discrimination on the bases of, inter alia, race and 
ethnicity. The most important elements of the framework are the Constitution and the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. The prohibition upon racial discrimination appears in the Thirteenth, 
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, all adopted after the end of the 
Civil War, and in the Fifth Amendment which, since 1954, has been interpreted as 
prohibiting the federal Government from racially discriminating.1 The Thirteenth 
Amendment abolished slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment ensures that states provide equal 
protection of the laws to all persons within their jurisdiction and the Fifteenth Amendment 
provides that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race, colour or 
previous condition of servitude. However, the abolition of slavery is not absolute and 
unlimited. The Thirteenth amendment allows slavery &#8220;as a punishment for crime whereof 
the party shall have been duly convicted... within the United States, or any place subject to 
their jurisdiction&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>  
 1  See <i>Bolling v. Sharpe</i>, 347 U.S. 497 (1954). </p>


<p>10. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is widely considered one of the most important 
references for the prohibition of discrimination in the United States and contains thematic 
titles that deal with non-discrimination in a range of areas. Title II prohibits discrimination 
on the basis of race, colour, religion or national origin in places of public accommodation, 
including, inter alia, lodgings, restaurants and places of entertainment. Title IV provides for 
the desegregation of public schools and non-discrimination in admissions to public colleges 
and universities. Title VI provides that no person shall be excluded from participating in, or 
denied the benefits of, federally funded or assisted programmes or activities on the grounds 
of race, colour or national origin. Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment on the 
grounds of, inter alia, race, colour and national origin.  
</p>
<p>11. Among other pieces of legislation that contain provisions prohibiting racial 
discrimination, the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871 prohibit racial discrimination in 
certain criminal and civil matters, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides several 
safeguards against the introduction of laws and regulations that have a discriminatory 
purpose or a discriminatory effect upon the voting rights of minorities and authorizes the 
United States Attorney General and individuals to bring lawsuits in federal court to enforce 
the guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment. The Fair Housing Act prohibits 
discrimination on the grounds, inter alia, of race, colour, religion or national origin in the 
sale or rental of housing as well as in other residential real estate-related transactions and 
residential brokerage services. 
</p>
<p>12. Other statutes that protect against racial discrimination include, inter alia, the Civil 
Rights Act of 1968, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994, the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, the Higher Education Act of 1965, the Equal Educational Opportunities 
Act of 1974, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and the Workforce 
Investment Act of 1998. 
</p>
<p>13. Also, the President of the United States, in furtherance of the Constitution and State 
laws, has often issued executive orders prohibiting various types of discrimination, 
including discrimination on the bases of race and national origin. Some Executive Orders 
also require affirmative action, which is defined in implementing regulations. Most states 
have also enacted their own legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in the various areas 
where they have jurisdiction. A racially discriminatory act may contravene both state and 
federal legislation and, in some cases, local law as well, each jurisdiction having its own 
sanction.  
</p>
<p>14. Finally, as the United States uses a common law system, jurisprudence is a 
significant source of guarantees and protections for its citizens, including people of African 
descent. Landmark decisions, especially those of the United States Supreme Court, have 
established legal benchmarks in upholding the right to non-discrimination for racial 
minorities such as people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>15. An important recent development regarding anti-discrimination legislation and 
practice in the United States is the gradual rolling back of affirmative measures introduced 
during the 1960s and 1970s and aimed at overcoming the effects of past societal 
discrimination. This process continues, as racism is often perceived as a thing of the past, 
and wider American society as &#8220;colour blind&#8221;. In several meetings with NGOs it was 
mentioned that there is a need for a specific non-discrimination law containing affirmative 
measures and positive action as well as a shift in the burden of proof in cases of 
discrimination brought before courts.  </p>

<p><b> III. People of African descent in the United States: general 
comments  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation of people of African descent in all political, economic, 
social and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and 
economic development of the country 
</b></p>
<p>16. The members of the Working Group acknowledge the strenuous efforts of the 
Government of the United States to address the challenges that face people of African 
descent in this country. In their meetings with Government agencies, the members found 
that each of the many different departments has programmes that assist people of African 
descent to realize their fundamental rights and improve their daily lives. While there is no 
federal authority charged specifically with monitoring and advancing the situation of people 
of African descent, there is a comprehensive structure in place that ensures that their 
situation is included in the agenda and programmes of the different agencies that have 
thematic responsibility for ensuring the provision of health, education, housing and other 
fundamental services.  
</p>
<p>17. Through its many meetings held with State officials, a member of Congress and civil 
society representatives, the experts found the following to be the most pressing issues in the 
United States as regards the participation of people of African descent in all political, 
economic, social and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and economic 
development of their country. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>18. In their meeting with the Department of Labor, the members were informed that 
there are non-discrimination requirements placed upon those private enterprises that wish to 
contract with the federal Government. These include the requirement that the contractor 
does not discriminate against any member of its entire workforce during the performance of 
a federal contract or subcontract and that it has, or puts in place, self-monitored affirmative 
action measures. While contractors are required to self-monitor, the Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance Programs will review selected contractors&#8217; compliance with both the 
non-discrimination and affirmative action obligations. 
</p>
<p>19. It was explained to the members that the Workforce Investment Act is designed to 
provide workforce investment activities that increase the employment, retention and 
earnings of participants for all Americans. Section 188 of the Act prohibits discrimination 
on various bases, including race and national origin, in those activities. The activities may, 
however, be targeted to various other population groups - for example, persons who are 
income disadvantaged. Section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act is a primary source of 
authority for the Department of Labor&#8217;s Civil Rights Center, which, inter alia, enforces the 
section 188 prohibition of discrimination and requirement of equal opportunity for those 
who participate in a financially assisted programme or activity under Title I of the 
Workforce Investment Act. 
</p>
<p>20. When an employer is alleged to have acted in a discriminatory way, workers may 
file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, the 
Civil Rights Center has jurisdiction over entities that are recipients of certain types of 
federal financial assistance. The laws administered by the Center prohibit those entities 
from discriminating in their provision of services to customers and in the operation of 
programmes and activities for individual beneficiaries, as well as in their capacity as 
employers. The Center conducts investigations of discrimination complaints against these 
entities; it also conducts broader reviews to ensure compliance with legal requirements </p>


<p>related to non-discrimination and equal opportunity. Similarly, the Department of Labor&#8217;s 
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, at its own initiative, reviews companies 
contracting with the federal Government to ensure compliance with requirements, including 
non-discrimination. It administers and enforces three legal authorities that require equal 
employment opportunity: Executive Order 11246, as amended; section 503 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; and the Vietnam Era Veterans&#8217; Readjustment 
Assistance Act of 1974, as amended. These laws ban discrimination and require federal 
contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to ensure that all individuals have 
an equal opportunity for employment, without regard to race, colour, religion, sex, national 
origin, disability or status as a Viet Nam-era or special disabled veteran. The members were 
informed that the two most significant issues related to discrimination in the reviews 
conducted by the Office are race and gender discrimination.  
</p>
<p>21. In a meeting with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the members 
were informed that the main work of the Commission is enforcement of anti-discrimination 
laws in employment, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits 
employment discrimination based on, inter alia, race, colour, and national origin. These 
provisions prohibit both intentional and unintentional discrimination, or &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; 
discrimination. While employers are liable for discrimination suffered by employees, 
compensatory and punitive damages are available only for intentional discrimination, not 
disparate impact. More than 30,000 complaints were received by the Commission last year 
concerning racial discrimination. In cases where the Commission finds that discrimination 
has taken place, the first stage of dealing with the case is mediation or conciliation. Any 
individual can file a charge of discrimination, and 72 per cent of mediated charges are 
settled. About $121.6 million was paid in relief last year in the context of mediation or 
conciliation of cases. Conciliation and other settlement avenues brought an additional 
$170 million. Where mediation or conciliation cases are not settled, the Commission 
investigates the case, makes a finding and, where appropriate, turns to litigation. A total of 
280 lawsuits were brought by the Commission last year and they enjoyed more than a 
90 per cent success rate.  
</p>
<p>22. As well as mediation, conciliation and litigation, the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission also produces policy papers on different issues, such as whether 
the practice of employers taking criminal records into account in screening potential 
employees has a disparate impact. The members were informed that although the 
Commission does not focus on affirmative action, it may be sought as relief in a case.  
</p>
<p>23. In a meeting with the Department of State, the members were informed that its 
Office of Civil Rights enforces laws related to non-discrimination in employment and other 
civil rights laws within the Department. In this Office, as well as a Diversity Officer, there 
is a Diversity Governance Council which discusses and addresses issues that may constitute 
barriers to promotion. It was emphasized that diversity is a key element of the strategic plan 
of the Office. While it was recognized that people of African descent and other ethnic 
minorities have been historically underrepresented in the employees of the Department of 
State and other Government agencies, the Department representatives explained that they 
are working to address this issue and that there are 16 diplomats posted at colleges around 
the country looking for diverse candidates for possible employment. Similarly, the 
Department runs fellowships each year, whereby it pays for the education of a number of 
students in exchange for service with the Department upon graduation. This programme is 
also used to promote diversity within the institution.  
</p>
<p>24. In several of the Working Group&#8217;s meetings with Government departments it was 
reiterated that employment quotas were not used by the Government as they would be 
discriminatory against those who were not of the racial group that the policy was designed </p>


<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>to assist, and therefore unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has said, however, that race 
can be taken into account as a factor to increase diversity, for example in a school.  
</p>
<p>25. In their meetings with NGOs, the members were informed that unemployment is a 
very serious issue for the Afro-descendant community, with levels of unemployment being, 
proportionately, four times higher among this population than in the white community. 
Reference was made to a case where the New York City Fire Department was found to 
have discriminated against people of African descent who had applied for employment as 
firemen. Of the 11,000 firemen employed by the New York City Fire Department, only 
about 300 were of African descent, despite their being about 27 per cent of the population 
of New York. This case of discrimination was run successfully by the Department of 
Justice&#8217;s Civil Rights Office. It was pointed out by NGOs that a lack of affirmative 
measures is a serious obstacle to improving the present situation. 
</p>
<p>26. The members were also informed about the particularly onerous employment 
situation that many women of African descent endure, working two or three jobs in order to 
support their families as single mothers. This has adverse effects upon their children, who 
do not have a parent present for most of the day. Taking into account the educational level 
of women of African descent, the prevailing differences in salaries between men and 
women, the cost of childcare services and transportation problems, employment is 
becoming unrewarding for many African American women. In this context, it may 
sometimes be more attractive to receive social welfare than to work.   
</p>
<p>27. Statistical information received concerning the challenges facing people of African 
descent in the area of employment is included below (paras. 63-70). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to education 
</b></p>
<p>28. In its meeting with the Department of Education, the members learned that the 
Department&#8217;s Office of Postsecondary Education funds a number of programmes to 
promote access and educational opportunity for racial and ethnic minorities. The 
Department also funds many programmes that often benefit racial or ethnic minorities, 
although they do not focus explicitly on such minorities, due to their focus on low-income 
or disadvantaged persons.  
</p>
<p>29. The federal Government does not have a large role in the implementation of 
educational programmes at the state level and there is a lack of general and unified policy. 
Federal programmes are offered to states but they cannot be imposed. In many cases 
intervention by the federal level is possible only when there are problems. Although the 
federal Government promotes and supports long-term programmes, there are very few 
specifically targeted towards people of African descent. The majority of programmes are 
designed to address wider problems of disadvantage in education of racial minorities in 
general. The members learned of various initiatives designed to improve access to quality 
education by racial minorities such as people of African descent. Magnet schools, which are 
public schools with specialized curricula that draw students from across the normal zoning 
boundaries established by education authorities, are one way by which the Government 
addresses the issue of racial segregation in education. Financial assistance may be applied 
for by those magnet schools that intend to implement certain projects, such as a project for 
the reduction, elimination or prevention of minority group isolation. However, the members 
were informed that a majority of white parents are not great supporters of the inclusion 
programmes run by the Government.  
</p>
<p>30. In meetings with NGOs, the members were told that lack of access to quality 
education is a major problem for people of African descent in the United States. They 
emphasized that more than 50 years after <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, many students of 
colour continue to struggle in inadequate schools. They referred to problems connected </p>


<p>with a need for a larger number of, and more qualified, teachers and more funds for schools 
where most students are African American. Some NGOs indicated that African American 
students are often in large classes (more than 40 students), affecting their ability to do well 
at their exams. It was also pointed out that there is a need for, and lack of, programmes to 
prevent male students of African descent from dropping out of schools or to bring them 
back into classes. Furthermore, while the number of students of African descent at 
universities compared to white students was improving, there is still a significant &#8220;class&#8221; 
gap between the two. Charter schools, which are intended to provide parents and 
communities with the flexibility to try innovative educational models, have had some 
success in providing higher quality education to students of African descent who could not 
otherwise afford private education. Such schools operate under a written contract (charter) 
with a state, district or other governmental entity which details how the school will be 
organized and managed, what students will be taught and expected to achieve, and how 
success will be measured. Some NGOs said, however, that they provide an effective 
alternative for only a small number of poorer students and a more comprehensive solution 
to inadequate access to quality education is needed.  
</p>
<p>31. One of the structural reasons for poor access by people of African descent to quality 
education is that the public schools are funded by the local property taxes and so the poorer 
neighbourhoods have less revenue to spend on their schools. As people of African descent 
often live in poorer neighbourhoods, the schools that their children attend often have 
inferior facilities. The members were informed that there is still insufficient information on 
the history of African Americans in school textbooks but this appears to be improving.  
</p>
<p>32. One NGO with which the members met informed them that there is an alarmingly 
high level of illiteracy among people of African descent. This is partly due to there being 
insufficient teachers with remedial skills in the schools in poorer neighbourhoods and class 
sizes that average 35 to 40 children. Many parents of students of African descent do not 
read to their children or encourage their reading at home, either because they are working at 
night or have poor reading skills themselves. Drop-out rates among students of African 
descent, especially boys, are high compared to the rest of the population.  
</p>
<p>33. In several of the meetings that the members had with NGOs, they were told of the 
phenomenon of a &#8220;pipeline from school to the criminal justice system&#8221; existing in the case 
of boys of African descent. According to one NGO, males of African descent who drop out 
of school have a 66 per cent chance of ending up in jail or being processed by the criminal 
justice system. The members were also informed that the presence of the police in schools 
disproportionately affects children of African descent, the police sometimes being called to 
schools when children of African descent misbehave in relatively minor ways. The 
members were told of a case where a five-year-old African American child had been 
handcuffed by police for a temper tantrum at school, and several other similar cases. In all 
of the cases investigated by the NGO, the children in question were of African descent. The 
members were also informed that, according to studies, students of African descent are two 
times more likely to receive corporal punishment than white students. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Access to housing 
</b></p>
<p>34. According to information contained in the 2007 periodic report of the United States 
(CERD/C/USA/6), to which the members were referred by the Department of State, federal 
and state laws guarantee a right to equal opportunities in housing and prohibit 
discriminatory practices in the sale and rental of housing as well as in the mortgage lending 
and insurance markets related to housing. Despite this legislation, systematic discrimination 
persists in those markets. Recent studies by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development suggest that one in five individuals of an ethnic or racial minority experiences 
discrimination during their preliminary search for housing. While the Government does </p>


<p><b> 11 
</b></p>
<p>prosecute violations of fair housing law that are brought to its attention, many more go 
unreported. In order to address these realities, the Government has a number of 
programmes designed to improve housing availability to racial and ethnic minorities as well 
as to actively combat racial segregation.  
</p>
<p>35. In its meetings with Government departments, the members were told that many 
people of African descent are geographically isolated from the mainstream culture, as 
de facto residential segregation is often a stark reality. In an attempt to address this 
problem, the current strategy in urban planning is to build low-rise public housing on 
scattered sites instead of tall, densely populated buildings. Also, rental assistance is being 
used so that those who would have previously lived in public housing now enter the free 
market and choose where they wish to live. In reality, choice is limited because there is no 
federal law that requires landlords to accept rental assistance from the Government. This 
shift in policy has led to the loss of 150,000 units of public housing over the past 15 years. 
</p>
<p>36. The members were informed that in the city of Washington, D.C., there is a dramatic 
wealth disparity between African descendants, who make up 55 per cent of the population, 
and the white population. Given the disadvantaged economic circumstances of a large 
proportion of the population of African descent in that city, they have been adversely 
affected by some urban development plans. When land becomes valuable, real estate is 
developed and the poor are forced to move out as they can no longer afford the cost of 
living in the neighbourhood. In order to address this problem, the Government is 
implementing strategies that ensure urban development makes all communities more 
attractive, inter alia, by including services such as public transport. 
</p>
<p>37. In its meetings with NGOs, the members were informed that access to affordable 
housing is a serious problem for many people of African descent and that as 
neighbourhoods that were traditionally home to large communities of African descent, such 
as Harlem and Brooklyn in New York, are redeveloped, the African descendent population 
is being gradually forced to move out due to the now unaffordable cost of living there. The 
members were also informed that in the city of New York public spending is being 
funnelled towards short-term emergency accommodation shelters rather than public 
housing. As people of African descent are increasingly unable to afford to live in the 
neighbourhoods where they have traditionally built their communities, there is an 
increasing need for, but declining availability of, public housing. Some NGOs stressed that 
changes in the urban environment have had a negative impact on the life of people of 
African descent, such as the closing of small markets and shops and the opening of large 
supermarkets, which makes it difficult for people without cars to satisfy their needs and 
obtain necessary supplies. They also highlighted the lack of participation by people of 
African descent in the decision-making process concerning these changes as well as a lack 
of consideration of their real needs during this process.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to health care 
</b></p>
<p>38. The members found during their meetings that health and access to health care is an 
issue of great importance to the population of African descent in the United States, 
particularly to women of African descent. Although discrimination in access to health-care 
services is prohibited in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination 
based on race, colour or national origin in programmes or activities that receive federal 
funding, including health-care services, health disparities between people of African 
descent and the white population continue to be of concern.  
</p>
<p>39. According to information contained in the 2007 periodic report of the United States 
(CERD/C/USA/6), to which the members were referred by the Department of State, there 
are persistent health disparities between the African American population and the white 
population. For example, the age-adjusted death rate for cancer for African Americans was </p>


<p>approximately 25 per cent higher than for white Americans in 2001. To understand such 
disparities better, in 1999 Congress requested the Institute of Medicine of the National 
Academy of Sciences to report on the issue. According to the 2002 report of the Institute, 
the vast majority of studies indicated that minorities are less likely than whites to receive 
needed care, including clinically necessary procedures, in certain types of treatment areas. 
Disparities were found in treatment for cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, 
and mental illness, and were also seen across a range of procedures, including routine 
treatments for common health problems. 
</p>
<p>40. Based on the findings of the study, the Institute recommended a strategy to eliminate 
disparities that would include cross-cultural education and training; policy and regulatory 
changes to address the fragmentation of health plans along socio-economic lines; health-
system interventions to promote the use of clinical-practice guidelines; language and 
cultural interpretation where needed; and the collection of further data to refine the 
understanding of the problem. The Department of Health and Human Services has acted to 
implement a number of the recommendations emanating from the study and has made the 
elimination of health disparities affecting racial and ethnic minority populations, including 
women&#8217;s health issues, a critical goal of Healthy People 2010, the nation&#8217;s public-health 
agenda for the current decade.  
</p>
<p>41. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Minority 
Health is developing the National Partnership for Action to End Health Disparities, a 
recently drafted plan to address health disparities between minorities and non-minorities in 
the United States that will serve as the road map to tackle this issue. The plan will promote 
strategic actions by the Office of Minority Health and its partners and has four main goals: 
illuminating the compelling issues that impact health outcomes; identifying action steps that 
partners can adopt and adapt for their target audiences; seeking out and highlighting 
promising practices that help eliminate health disparities; and promoting tools, programmes 
and information sources for consumers, caregivers and health providers. 
</p>
<p>42. In a meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services, the members were 
informed that the particular health problems that are of most concern for people of African 
descent are obesity, heart disease, infant mortality (which is 2 to 3 times higher for mothers 
of African descent compared to the white population), diabetes, HIV/AIDS (17 times 
higher for women of African descent than white women and 7 times higher for men of 
African descent than white men) and certain cancers (which are 2 times more prevalent in 
people of African descent than in the white population). One NGO informed the members 
of the Working Group that 71 per cent of children with HIV/AIDS are of African descent. 
The members were also informed that even with access to health services, the health 
outcomes for people of African descent are inferior to those of the white population. Other 
disparities include life expectancy: Americans of African descent have a life expectancy of 
73 years compared to white Americans&#8217; life expectancy of 78 years. 
</p>
<p>43. The members were informed about the Healthy Start programme that provides 
attention for pregnant women. A total of 59 per cent of the beneficiaries of this programme 
were women of African descent. Other Government initiatives that benefit people of 
African descent in this area include the National Center on Minority Health and the Health 
Disparities, which coordinates Government actions concerning racial minority health. The 
members were also told that all medical institutions must have a plan to decrease health 
disparities between racial groups.  
</p>
<p>44. The members learned that the Department of Health works with communities to 
disseminate relevant health information, using faith-based groups and other non-
conventional channels to gain access to ethnic minorities such as people of African descent.  </p>


<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Participation in public life 
</b></p>
<p>45. According to information contained in the 2007 periodic report of the United 
States(CERD/C/USA/6), to which the members were referred by the Department of State, 
in 2001, of the nearly 60,000 judges and judicial officers in state, federal and tribal courts in 
the United States, 1,798 were African American. With respect to federal elected officials, of 
the 535 members of the 109th Congress, 41 were African American (8 per cent). Of the 
state and territorial governors, as of January 2007, two were of African descent 
(Massachusetts and United States Virgin Islands).  
</p>
<p>46. The same report indicates that in 2002, the Joint Center for Political and Economic 
Studies in Washington, D.C., released its report, entitled &#8220;Black elected officials: a 
statistical summary 2000&#8221;. This report encompasses federal, state, municipal and local 
officials, including those in law enforcement and education. The report showed a six-fold 
increase in black elected officials, from approximately 1,500 in 1970 to 9,040 in 2000. It 
also highlights key trends that are shaping the future of black political leadership. First, 
black women accounted for all of the growth in the number of black elected officials for 
two years prior to 2000 and constituted 34.5 per cent of the total figure. Second, younger 
black Americans, who often have different views and experiences from their older 
counterparts, are increasingly being elected. Finally, an increasing number of black mayors 
are being elected in large cities (over 50,000) where the majority of the population is not 
African American. According to the National Conference of Black Mayors, there were 542 
black mayors in the United States in 2005, including 47 black mayors of cities with 
populations greater than 50,000. 
</p>
<p>47. In meetings with NGOs, the members were informed that the disenfranchisement of 
some voters was a structural issue that disproportionately affected people of African 
descent and their ability to participate in public life and influence Government. According 
to those interviewed, at any given time, 5.3 million American citizens are denied the right 
to vote because of criminal convictions. Given the racial differences in incarceration rates, 
Americans of African descent constitute a disproportionately large percentage of this 
electorally disenfranchised population. In many states the right to vote is still denied to 
persons after they have completed their prison sentence. In the United States, nearly 10 per 
cent of adult Americans of African descent are barred from voting based on criminal 
convictions. The members were informed that in some states, the number is more than 20 
per cent and that in one state, Iowa, more than one-third of all African American citizens 
have lost the right to vote in this way. The members were also informed that some states 
have voting rules which require proof that residence in a state is &#8220;permanent&#8221; or &#8220;legal&#8221;, or 
that a voter has a &#8220;permanent established domicile&#8221; or is an &#8220;actual and physically bona 
fide resident&#8221;; in some cases this means a requirement of at least 10 years residence in 
order to vote. This affects the voting rights and rights to political participation of people of 
African descent employed as seasonal workers.   
</p>
<p>48. The members were also informed by one NGO that in many states a felony 
conviction disqualifies a person from being eligible for jury duty. This also impacts 
negatively upon the ability of people of African descent to participate in this aspect of 
public life due to the disproportionately high levels of criminal convictions of this 
population group. It was explained to the members that a vicious circle exists whereby 
people of African descent are disproportionately convicted of crimes under laws passed by 
legislators but their ability to change these legislators and laws is diminished due to the 
disproportionately high electoral disenfranchisement of African Americans because of 
criminal convictions.  
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b> 6. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>49. In a meeting with the Department of Justice, the members were informed that the 
Department&#8217;s Civil Rights Office runs cases on hate crimes and oversees civil rights 
legislation. The Office carries out outreach activities in the community to inform people 
about their civil rights; when it detects an employer that is systematically discriminating 
against a racial group it files a case against it. The Office also receives complaints of 
discrimination from individuals. There are Civil Rights Offices in the different Government 
agencies and they work together and coordinate efforts.  
</p>
<p>50. According to information contained in the 2007 periodic report of the United States 
(CERD/C/USA/6), to which the members were referred by the Department of State, in 
2004, 3.2 per cent of males of African descent, 1.2 per cent of Hispanic males, and 
0.5 per cent of white males in the country were incarcerated in state or federal prisons. 
Distributions were similar among the female population &#8211; the rate for African American 
females was more than two times higher than the rate for Hispanic females and four times 
higher than the rate for white females. Overall, the prison population was estimated to be 41 
per cent African American, 34 per cent white, 19 per cent Hispanic, and 6 per cent other or 
two or more races.  
</p>
<p>51. In meetings with NGOs, the members were informed that the overrepresentation of 
people of African descent in the United States as subjects of the criminal justice system and 
their disproportionately high rate of incarceration compared with the white population is of 
great concern and demonstrates structural discrimination against them. They were informed 
that women of African descent are three times more likely to be imprisoned than white 
women, while men of African descent are six and a half times more likely to be imprisoned 
than white men. The members were informed that at any one time 11 per cent of all men of 
African descent in the United States between the ages of 30 and 34 are behind bars.   
</p>
<p>52. One explanation given of the disproportionately high incarceration rate for people of 
African descent was the discriminatory application of laws. Discrimination was identified 
by NGOs in terms of perpetrators as well as victims. According to them, black perpetrators 
are much more likely to be convicted than white perpetrators, and they tend to be punished 
more severely. Furthermore, it is likely that there will be a difference in convictions and 
punishment depending on the race or colour of the victim, with generally lower sentences in 
cases where the victim is black as compared to cases involving white victims. The 
discriminatory application of laws was illustrated to the members by way of the application 
of the laws against illegal drug use. Whereas the available evidence shows that people of 
African descent use illegal drugs at approximately the same rate as white people, they are 
10 times more likely, on a per capita basis, to go to prison for drug-related offences. An 
NGO informed the members that the application of some laws that seem race neutral tend 
to contribute to disproportionately high rates of incarceration for people of African descent. 
For example, under United States federal law, possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine (a 
drug associated in the public mind with African Americans) triggers a mandatory minimum 
sentence of five years in prison. It takes 100 times as much powder cocaine (500 grams) to 
trigger the same mandatory five-year sentence. Although African Americans constitute 
about 12 per cent of the United States population, more than 80 per cent of those prosecuted 
under the crack cocaine mandatory minimum laws are of African descent.  
</p>
<p>53. This same disparity was indicated in other areas of criminal law. For example, more 
than 2,500 persons are currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole or 
release for crimes committed when they were less than 18 years old. The members were 
informed that the rate of African Americans serving this sentence is more than 10 times 
higher than that of whites. The process of criminalization of children from very early 
childhood and the higher percentage of children of African descent placed in adult facilities 
is negatively influencing the present protection of the rights of children and their future </p>


<p><b> 15 
</b></p>
<p>development. The members were informed that there is not an appropriate education system 
for children in adult prisons and children are forced to work during their imprisonment for 
very low compensation. 
</p>
<p>54. According to NGOs with which the members met, racial profiling against people of 
African descent by the police is an ongoing concern; the darker a person&#8217;s skin, the more 
likely they are to be stopped, questioned and frisked by police. The members were 
informed that the New York City Police Department is working on a training programme to 
eliminate unconscious racial bias in officers that may contribute to racial profiling.  
</p>
<p>55. The members were also informed by an NGO that in cases where the death penalty 
is a possibility, a convicted felon is four times more likely to receive the death penalty if the 
victim was white than if the victim was of African descent. The members also learned of 
the Racial Justice Act, adopted in the state of North Carolina in 2009, whereby a defendant 
can now invoke statistics to establish a presumption that racism affected their case.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>56. In many of the meetings that the members had, particularly with NGOs, poverty was 
identified as being a particular concern for people of African descent in the country, 
impacting as it does upon the enjoyment of a host of rights. NGOs stressed that poverty is 
very much connected with the slavery past and long-lasting discrimination even after 
slavery was prohibited. According to some of them, racism and poverty are intimately 
linked and still part of the system. The criminalization of poverty and reliance upon welfare 
programmes instead of a more comprehensive approach to fighting poverty were seen as 
specific obstacles to breaking the circle of poverty. NGOs also emphasized the connection 
between racism, poverty and segregation, which is becoming much more visible in the 
period of economic crisis.    
</p>
<p>57. According to data provided by the Census Bureau for 2008, about 24 per cent of 
people of African descent were living below the poverty level - considerably higher than 
the poverty rate for the total population, which was about 13 per cent. About 33.5 per cent 
of children of African descent lived in poverty, compared to about 18 per cent of the total 
population. Among those aged 65 and older, people of African descent had a poverty rate of 
about 20.5 per cent while the total population had a rate of about 10 per cent. According to 
the same statistics, in 2008 the median annual income of households of people of African 
descent was about $35,400. This compares to the median annual income of the total 
population, which was $52,000.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Policies for the integration of people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>58. In a meeting with the Department of Homeland Security, the members were 
informed of several outreach initiatives that the Department has undertaken to facilitate the 
better integration of American Arab, Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, Somali and Middle 
Eastern and other ethnic and religious communities. The Engagement Team of the 
Department&#8217;s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties leads or plays a significant role in 
round-table discussions between federal, State and local government and community 
leaders in eight metropolitan areas. Other initiatives include the production, in collaboration 
with leaders from the Somali community, of a guide for newly arrived Somalis in the 
United States. At the time of the meeting, the Department of Homeland Security was also 
looking for funding for Somali Community Centers.  
</p>
<p>59. The Department of Homeland Security produces informative publications and has 
special procedures designed to prevent discriminatory behaviour by civil servants who </p>


<p>make first contact with immigrants of African descent. However, members of the group did 
not have the opportunity to see the practical implementation of these procedures. 
</p>
<p>60. Several NGOs raised the issue of a lack of recognition of the connection between the 
present situation of African Americans and the slavery past. They stressed that 
discrimination is addressed by the State in general terms, not as an issue of particular 
importance for people of African descent. Such an approach, according to them, 
undermines the question of reparations for slavery, is minimizing the effects of past and 
present segregation and leaves little space for discussions on the specific situation of people 
of African descent. One of the results of such an approach is the rejection of affirmative 
action as a tool to combat existing discrimination and the consequences of past 
discrimination. In several meetings it was stressed to the members that there is a lack of 
affirmative measures which take into consideration the specific roots and history of 
discrimination against people of African descent. The members were also informed in 
several meetings that while the Supreme Court has held that the use of quotas would be 
unconstitutional, other affirmative action measures are not prohibited when used to promote 
diversity. One NGO expressed its concern, however, that affirmative action programmes 
have been scaled back in recent years and that where they do exist they focus on access for 
people of African descent but do not provide adequate support once entrance is gained to a 
given institution or organization. 
</p>
<p>61. In several of the meetings that the members held with NGOs, it was emphasized that 
there was not a State institution dedicated to the situation of people of African descent and 
that such an institution could be beneficial to protecting and advancing the rights of this 
population and its integration. Although the different Government departments have 
programmes that attend to the African American population, it was suggested that a 
dedicated institution would assist in relevant policy formulation and enhance coordination 
between the various Government agencies that monitor the situation of, and provide 
services to, the African descendant population. This lacuna has contributed to a very 
passive attitude towards segregation and a lack of interest by the white majority for 
participating in the programmes for inclusion. It was emphasized by several NGOs that the 
dedicated institution should address the perception of people of African descent as criminal, 
combat the social and racial profiling of African Americans and reinvigorate the fight 
against the still very much present racist bias.  
</p>
<p>62. It was also suggested by several NGOs that the existing Commission on Civil Rights 
should be transformed into a Commission on Civil and Human Rights. This would allow 
the mandate of the Commission to include the international obligations of the United States 
and to cover the rights of non-citizens.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Collection of disaggregated data on people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>63. The members were impressed by the comprehensive structure that is in place in the 
United States for collecting and analyzing disaggregating data, including by race. This 
information has proven to be an important tool that the Government has used to identify 
racial disparities in access to employment, education, health and other fundamental rights 
and to design and implement policies to remedy the challenges identified.  
</p>
<p>64. The Department of Health and Human Services informed the members that it 
collects disaggregated data from over sixty sources on the health of different racial groups. 
These data are used to focus on trends and design programmes to address the particular 
health concerns of different communities. 
</p>
<p>65. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission informed the members that they 
maintain data on all ethnic groups employed in companies of more than 100 employees and </p>


<p><b> 17 
</b></p>
<p>that this data is used to formulate Government policy. Data disaggregated by race, age, etc. 
is collected, inter alia, from employers and schools and made available to the public, 
different Government departments, universities and scholars. The data indicates that 
currently 13.9 per cent of employees are of African descent. About 3.3 per cent of African 
descendent employees are in managerial positions, 7.6 per cent are in middle management 
and 7.7 per cent are in professional positions. African descendents are statistically 
overrepresented in labouring and clerical positions.  
</p>
<p>66. In a meeting with the United States Census Bureau, the members were informed that 
the Census Bureau does not develop policy; it just collects data to be used by other 
Government dependencies to formulate policy. The Census Bureau has several areas that 
collect data on people of African descent as well as an advisory committee on people of 
African descent (the African American Committee). The American Community Survey is 
an ongoing survey that provides information on social factors relating to a sample 2.5 per 
cent of the population. The results of the survey are released yearly. The Decennial Census 
is far more basic but covers the country&#8217;s entire population. The surveys allow the person 
providing information to self-identify his or her race or ethnicity and have a wide list of 
categories to select from. Also, multiple race reporting is allowed.  
</p>
<p>67. According to statistical information for 2009 provided in the Working Group&#8217;s 
meeting with the Department of Labor, people of African descent were more likely than 
other groups to experience labour market problems. While they made up 11 per cent of the 
labour force in 2009, they represented 18 per cent of the unemployed and 25 per cent of the 
long-term unemployed (persons unemployed for 27 weeks or longer). They also made up 
25 per cent of the marginally attached (persons who were available for work and had 
searched for work during the prior 12 months but who were not currently looking for 
work). Also, at 62.4 per cent, people of African descent are less likely to participate in the 
labour force (persons 16 years and over who are working or looking for work) than whites 
(65.8 per cent), Asians (66 per cent) or Hispanics (68 per cent). The unemployment rate for 
people of African descent 16 years and over has generally been about twice or more that of 
whites. It was also indicated that people of African descent are unemployed longer than 
whites, Asians or Hispanics, with African Americans comprising 23 per cent of long-term 
unemployed workers in 2009. About 16.5 per cent of teenagers (16 to 19 years old) of 
African descent and 15.3 per cent of Asian teenagers were employed, compared to about 24 
per cent of Hispanics and 32 per cent of white teens. Notably, nearly 40 per cent of 
teenagers of African descent were unemployed in 2009 compared to 30 per cent for 
Hispanics, 21 per cent for whites and 26 per cent for Asian teenagers.  
</p>
<p>68. Regarding occupational categories, the information provided indicated that people of 
African descent and Hispanics were less likely to be employed in management, professional 
and related occupations than their white or Asian counterparts and that they were more 
likely to work in service occupations. Median weekly earnings for wage and salary workers 
who usually work full time were considerably higher for Asians and whites than for people 
of African descent and Hispanics. Mothers of African descent with children under 18 were 
more likely to be in the labour force than white, Asian or Hispanic mothers, a trend that has 
been an historical constant.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>69. During their meetings, the members identified several issues which were of 
particular concern to women of African descent, particularly challenges related to health 
and employment. As mentioned above, in their meeting with the Department of Health and 
Human Services, the members were informed that there are certain health issues that 
particularly affect women of African descent, including infant mortality, HIV/AIDS and </p>


<p>certain types of cancer. The Department has programmes aimed at addressing many of the 
issues of most concern to women of African descent, such as the Healthy Start - 
Eliminating Disparities in Perinatal Health programme, which is designed to improve 
health care for pregnant women and reduce higher than average infant mortality rates in 
targeted communities.   
</p>
<p>70. The information provided to the members by the United States Census Bureau 
indicated that women of African descent have higher unemployment rates than the national 
average for women (in 2009, 12.4 per cent compared to 8.1 per cent), while information 
provided by the Department of Labor indicated that their median usual weekly earnings are 
less than the national average for women (in 2009, $582 compared to $657). When one 
considers these statistics in the light of the fact that, according to information provided by 
the Department of Labor, in 2009 44 per cent of families of African descent were 
maintained by women with no spouse present, the economic vulnerability of many women 
of African descent is brought into stark relief.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The experts greatly appreciate the comprehensive and informative meetings 
that were held with Government agencies. They note with satisfaction the many 
programmes and other initiatives that the Government implements to combat racial 
discrimination affecting people of African descent, including the work of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, the various Civil Rights Offices that exist in 
Government departments as well as the many other institutions that are working on 
the promotion of diversity. </b> 
</p>
<p>72. <b>On the other hand, the experts note that recently anti-discrimination legislation 
and practice in the United States of America has been gradually eroding the 
affirmative measures introduced during the 1960s and 1970s aimed at overcoming the 
effects of past societal discrimination. A perception exists of racism being a thing of 
the past and that American society is now generally &#8220;colour blind&#8221;. Given this process 
as well as the unique history of people of African descent in the United States, the 
experts are concerned by an insufficient recognition in the present day of the influence 
of the baggage of the past, which necessitates specific institutions and programmes 
tailored to the situation of people of African descent.</b> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The experts believe that two challenges from the past still linger: the remnants 
of slavery and electoral disenfranchisement. The abolition of slavery is not absolute as 
the Thirteenth amendment allows slavery &#8220;as a punishment for crime whereof the 
party shall have been duly convicted... within the United States, or any place subject 
to their jurisdiction&#8221;. The second part of the amendment, when considered alongside 
the overrepresentation of people of African descent in the prison population, 
conditionally understood, could make a link between the past and present slavery. The 
second challenge is that at any given time, 5.3 million American citizens are denied the 
right to vote because of criminal convictions and Americans of African descent 
constitute a disproportionately large percentage of this electorally disenfranchised 
population.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group also noted the existence of a circle of poverty, inadequate 
education, limited employment opportunities and challenges in the administration of 
justice affecting the lives of people of African descent on multiple levels which are not </b></p>


<p><b> 19 
</b></p>
<p><b>being sufficiently addressed, in a holistic and coordinated manner, at the federal, state 
and local levels. </b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The experts learned that education is still one of the major areas of 
discrimination and one of the main sources of inequality of opportunity. The experts 
learned of various initiatives designed to improve access to quality education by racial 
minorities such as people of African descent, yet also that the majority of white 
parents are not very supportive of the Government&#8217;s inclusion programmes. </b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>Nationwide, African Americans suffer unemployment at disproportionately 
high levels compared to the general population. An imbalance in their participation in 
the labour force not only risks societal division but also indicates probable 
discrimination within the private sector that might escalate.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The experts are quite concerned with aspects of the administration of justice 
that adversely affect the African American population, particularly the 
disproportionate incarceration rates compared to the general population and the 
seemingly discriminatory application of some laws.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The experts learned that while there is no federal authority charged specifically 
with monitoring and advancing the situation of people of African descent, there is a 
comprehensive structure in place that ensures that their situation is included in the 
agenda and programmes of the different agencies that have thematic responsibility for 
ensuring the provision of health, housing and other fundamental services.</b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>Since the March 2002 report of the Institute of Medicine, several health issues 
were detected as problematic from a racial standpoint, concluding that minorities are 
less likely than whites to receive needed care, including clinically necessary 
procedures in certain types of treatment areas. The experts were informed that 
currently the particular health problems that are of most concern for people of 
African descent are obesity, heart disease, infant mortality, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and 
certain cancers.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The experts duly note that the federal and state laws guarantee the right to 
equal opportunities in housing and prohibit discriminatory practices in the sale and 
rental of housing as well as in the mortgage lending and insurance markets related to 
housing, that federal and state authorities prosecute the offenders of such laws, and 
that there are a number of Government programmes designed to improve housing 
availability to racial and ethnic minorities. However, the members of the Working 
Group were informed about a reduction in the construction of social housing and 
reinvestment of money in building shelters for the homeless. The members of the 
group were also informed that in the United States many people of African descent 
are geographically isolated from the mainstream culture, as de facto residential 
segregation is often a stark reality. NGOs also highlight the lack of participation of 
people of African descent in the decision-making process concerning urban 
development that affects them. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Although the Working Group recognizes the great advances that have been 
made in combating direct discrimination against people of African descent, it is 
concerned by the ongoing structural discrimination that cannot be effectively 
addressed with the existing legal mechanisms and legislation. On the other hand, it 
should be also kept in mind that as the country is a federation of states, most states 
have also enacted their own legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in different 
areas where they have jurisdiction. However, in some cases, the lack of unified and 
precise federal legislation (as, for example, the definition of the permanent/bona fide 
residence for the exercise of voting rights) places people of African descent at a 
disadvantage. Finally, although there are not many international treaties on </b></p>


<p><b>combating discrimination, it is to be noted that the United States has not ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child or the Convention concerning Discrimination in 
Respect of Employment and Occupation, 1958 (No. 111) of the International Labour 
Organization. Furthermore, there is no specific anti-discrimination act that would 
serve to guide the drafting and implementation of relevant federal, state and local 
laws. </b> 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Working Group recommends that the particular history and context of 
people of African descent be taken into account in developing relevant legislation and 
when designing specific and holistic programmes and other remedies to address racial 
discrimination directed at this population group. The very procedure of, for instance, 
adopting a separate anti-discrimination law might assist the process of reviewing some 
older legislation, particularly those relating to slavery and electoral rights. 
Furthermore, such an act would be an appropriate instrument to regulate affirmative 
measures and positive actions as well to shift the burden of proof and the general use 
of statistics in cases of discrimination brought before courts. Such new legislation, 
together with the ratification of the mentioned international treaties, would represent 
a powerful tool in combating discrimination of any sort and on any level.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The experts believe that the educational system of the United States has 
developed different projects that could be effectively used to combat racial 
discrimination against people of African descent. Excellent examples are the magnet 
and the charter schools. The experts recommend that the Government continue and 
enhance these initiatives as well as develop positive action policies to achieve parity of 
educational conditions among students of African descent and those of the majority 
population.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>In the area of employment, the experts recommend that the Government of the 
United States consider verifying whether the 13 per cent of Americans of African 
descent employed in the public service are engaged in work that appropriately 
corresponds to their academic level and working capacities.  </b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>The experts consider that a system of employment quotas could be 
appropriately employed by the Government in order to stimulate employment of 
Americans of African descent in the private sector. </b> 
</p>
<p>86.  <b>The experts recommend that the example of North Carolina&#8217;s acceptance of the 
use of statistics in court proceedings to demonstrate a rebuttable presumption of 
discrimination be followed in other states. The Government is also urged to redress 
the grave issue of disproportionate incarceration rates of people of African descent 
and the discriminatory nature and application of some laws, in particular those 
related to drug offences.</b> 
</p>
<p>87.  <b>The experts encourage the Government to ensure the participation of African 
American communities in urban development projects that affect them, including 
appropriate forums to consult these communities regarding their particular needs.</b> 
</p>
<p>88.  <b>The experts encourage the Government to establish a human rights 
commission, as an independent body in accordance with the principles relating to the 
status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the 
Paris Principles), which will monitor and assist the implementation by the 
Government of international standards at the state and federal levels. The 
Government should establish within this body a dependency that deals specifically 
with people of African descent.</b> </p>


<p><b> 21 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Working Group particularly calls upon the Government to ensure to 
children of African descent all of the rights contained within the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, including the right to have the child&#8217;s best interest as a primary 
consideration in all dealings with the State.
