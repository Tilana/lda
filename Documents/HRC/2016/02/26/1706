<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that it is the responsibility of each State to ensure the full enjoyment of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms of its entire population,

rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, as applicable, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its support</i>  for all Sri Lankans to enjoy their rights, regardless of creed, 
faith or ethnicity, in a peaceful and unified land, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming and acknowledging</i> the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka 
in rebuilding infrastructure, demining and resettling the majority of internally displaced 
persons, while noting nonetheless that considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, 
reconciliation, demilitarization and the resumption of livelihoods, and stressing the 
importance of the full participation of local populations, including representatives of civil 
society and minorities, in these efforts, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the successful Provincial Council elections held on 21 September  2013, 
and, in particular, the high turnout and participation in all three provinces, while noting 
with concern reports of election-related violence, as well as of voter and candidate 
intimidation, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>appreciation</i> for the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka in 
facilitating the visit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and 
welcoming the visit of the High Commissioner to Sri Lanka in August 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at reported intimidation and retaliation against civil society 
members, including those who met with the High Commissioner during her visit, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing serious concern</i> at the continuing reports of violations of human rights in 
Sri Lanka, including sexual and gender-based violence, enforced disappearances, 
extrajudicial killings, torture and violations of the rights to freedom of expression, 
association and peaceful assembly, as well as intimidation of and reprisals against human 
rights defenders, members of civil society and journalists, and threats to judicial 
independence and the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> at the rapid rise in violence and discrimination on the basis of religion or 
belief, particularly against members of religious minority groups in Sri Lanka, including 
Hindus, Muslims and Christians, 
</p>
<p><i>Calling upon</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfil its public commitments, 
including on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the 
full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of 
Sri Lanka, its findings and recommendations, and acknowledging its possible contribution 
to the process of meaningful national reconciliation in Sri Lanka, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the constructive recommendations contained in the Commission&#8217;s report, 
including the need to credibly investigate widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings 
and enforced disappearances, demilitarize the north of Sri Lanka, implement impartial land 
dispute resolution mechanisms, re-evaluate detention policies, strengthen formerly 
independent civil institutions, reach a political settlement on the devolution of power to the 
provinces, promote and protect the right of freedom of expression for all persons and enact 
rule of law reforms, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the national plan of action to implement the recommendations of the 
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of the Government of Sri Lanka and its 
commitments as set forth in response to the findings and recommendations of the 
Commission, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> that the national plan of action does not adequately address all of the 
findings and constructive recommendations of the Commission, and encouraging the 
Government of Sri Lanka to broaden the scope of the plan to adequately address all 
elements of the Commission&#8217;s report, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> <i>with concern</i> that the national plan of action and the Commission&#8217;s 
report do not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law, </p>


<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the importance of a comprehensive approach to transitional justice 
incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including, inter alia, 
individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting of public 
employees and officials, or an appropriately conceived combination thereof, in order to, 
inter alia, ensure accountability, serve justice, provide remedies to victims, promote healing 
and reconciliation, establish independent oversight of the security system, restore 
confidence in the institutions of the State and promote the rule of law in accordance with 
international human rights law, with a view to preventing the recurrence of violations and 
abuses, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that truth-seeking processes, such as truth and reconciliation 
commissions, that investigate patterns of past human rights violations and their causes and 
consequences are important tools that can complement judicial processes, and that, when 
established, such mechanisms have to be designed within a specific societal context and be 
founded on broad national consultations with the inclusion of victims and civil society, 
including non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the responsibility of States to comply with their relevant obligations to 
prosecute those responsible for gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law constituting crimes under international law, with a view to 
end impunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the High Commissioner&#8217;s conclusion that national mechanisms have 
consistently failed to establish the truth and to achieve justice, and her recommendation that 
the Human Rights Council establish an international inquiry mechanism to further 
investigate the alleged violations of international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law and monitor any domestic accountability processes, 
</p>

with the Office of the High Commissioner, including with regard to technical assistance,

recommendations and conclusions contained therein, including on the establishment of a 
truth-seeking mechanism and national reparations policy as an integral part of a more 
comprehensive and inclusive approach to transitional justice; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct an independent and 
credible investigation into allegations of violations of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law, as applicable; to hold accountable those responsible for

Lanka; and to implement the recommendations made in the reports of the Office of the 
High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its call</i> <i>upon</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to implement 
effectively the constructive recommendations made in the report of the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission, and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant 
legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure 
justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans;

groups and other members of civil society; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to release the results of its

of the Sri Lanka Army; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to provide the Northern Provincial 
Council and its Chief Minister with the resources and authority necessary to govern, as 
required by the 13th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision of the Government of Sri Lanka to facilitate the visit 
by the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons and to issue 
an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and encourages the 
Government to cooperate with special procedures mandate holders and to respond formally 
to their outstanding requests, including by setting dates and providing access; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes</i> the recommendations and conclusions of the High Commissioner 
on the need for an independent and credible international investigation in the absence of a 
credible national process with tangible results, and requests the Office of the High 
Commissioner to assess progress towards accountability and reconciliation, to monitor 
relevant national processes and to investigate alleged violations and abuses of human rights 
and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka, with input from relevant special procedures 
mandate holders as appropriate, and to present an oral update to the Human Rights Council 
at its twenty-seventh session, and a comprehensive report followed by a discussion on the
