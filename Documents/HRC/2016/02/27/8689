<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Grenada was held at the 11th meeting, on 10 May 2010. The delegation of 
Grenada was headed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, The Honourable Peter David. At 
its 15th meeting, held on 12 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Grenada. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Grenada: Gabon, Italy and Qatar. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Grenada: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GRD/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GRD/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GRD/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Grenada through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter David, introduced the national report of 
Grenada. It was explained that the report had been prepared by a special stakeholder 
Committee comprising representatives of Government, the Trade Union Council (which is 
the umbrella body for all trade unions), non-governmental organizations, the Conference of 
Churches and the local human rights committee set up by the Government of Grenada. The 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Legal Affairs were mandated by the Cabinet as the bodies 
responsible for the coordination of consultations and the production of the final report. It 
was added that consultations had continued with relevant Government ministries, social 
agencies, trade unions and non-governmental organizations throughout Grenada&#8217;s 
preparation for the interactive phase of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>6. A brief introduction of the geographic and historical background of the country was 
made. It was emphasized that the country had attained independence in 1974 and that a 
revolution, with popular support, had taken place in 1979. The revolution had brought 
about some significant achievements in economic and social development, but some major 
violations of personal rights had also taken place. Intervention in 1983 by a major Power 
and regional allies had led to the restoration of democracy and the reintroduction of the 
Constitution. Five general elections had subsequently taken place. In July 2008, The 
Honourable Tillman Thomas had led the National Democratic Congress and won 11 of the 
15 seats in a generally free and fair election, and was consequently appointed as Prime </p>


<p>Minister. The new Administration&#8217;s message was good governance, accountability and the 
rule of law. 
</p>
<p>7. A general overview of the Constitution and the legislation of Grenada was 
presented. The Grenada Constitution, which had entered into force in 1974, was the 
supreme law of Grenada and guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms. The Constitution 
also provided that any person alleging that any of its provisions had been breached could 
apply to the High Court for the enforcement of his or her right. Some of the major laws 
enacted by Parliament that pertained to human rights were referred to, as was multilateral 
legislation, including treaties and conventions ratified by Grenada. Examples given 
included the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Montreal Protocol 
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. 
</p>
<p>8. The structure and the functioning of the various branches of government, including 
the executive and the judiciary, were then explained. It was stated that overall, the general 
direction and control of the Government of Grenada were vested in the executive arm of the 
Government, which was collectively responsible to Parliament. The judiciary in Grenada 
was part of the Eastern Caribbean Legal System. The Grenadian Constitution and laws 
provided for an independent judiciary, and the Government respected judicial independence 
in practice. Final appeal from courts in Grenada lay with the Privy Council of the United 
Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>9. It was emphasized that on 5 September 2009, the Government had released the 
remaining 7 of the original &#8220;Grenada 17&#8221;, who had been imprisoned for the 1983 murders 
of then Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and 10 other citizens. Their release had carried out 
pursuant to a 2007 ruling in a re-sentencing hearing ordered by the Privy Council. 
</p>
<p>10. Regarding the legislation, it was observed that various laws had been enacted to 
regulate and address various aspects of citizens&#8217; lives, thus enhancing and guaranteeing 
individual human rights. Where those laws were inadequate, amendments had also been 
made to correct those inadequacies and bring about change in society. 
</p>
<p>11. Some international treaties, conventions and instruments ratified by the Government 
of Grenada had also been given effect. It was noted, however, that international human 
rights instruments could not generally be invoked directly before local courts; rather, 
domestic legislation must first be enacted by the Parliament of Grenada in order to 
incorporate such instruments into the legal system. 
</p>
<p>12. Action taken regarding social and economic rights, such as the adoption of policies 
and programmes and the provision of services, was then described. Policies described were 
focused on families and children, persons with disabilities, women, education and labour 
rights.   
</p>
<p>13. Services mentioned included the Necessitous Fund, to assist children in school; 
burial of the poor, to assist the disadvantaged in the burial of their loved ones; the Water 
Support Programme, to ensure that each household had access to clean potable water, and 
day-care services, to ensure that children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years were 
cared for while their parents were at work. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding families and children, it was highlighted that in 1998, the Child 
Protection Act had been enacted. The Act was aimed at protecting children from all forms 
of abuse. A recent review of the Act had revealed the need for provisions for the mandatory 
reporting of all forms of abuse and the removal of a statutory limitation for sexual offences. 
</p>
<p>15. Concerning persons with disabilities, it was explained that the Government provided 
support to the Grenada Council for the Disabled, the vanguard organization for persons 
living with disabilities. A monthly subvention was provided to assist in the operations of a 
secretariat. Additionally, financial support, free medical care and housing were provided. </p>


<p>16. Regarding women, the Domestic Violence Act guaranteed the right of women to 
protection from all forms of abuse. A halfway house for battered women had been 
established, in which victims of domestic violence and their children were provided with 
temporary accommodation.   
</p>
<p>17. Education was mandatory for all children between the ages of 5 and 16, and the 
Government was committed and endeavoured to ensure equitable access to quality and 
relevant education for all citizens. 
</p>
<p>18. As for labour rights, Grenada was a member of the International Labour 
Organization and was fully committed to ensuring that international labour standards were 
met, applied and promoted. To that end, core ILO Conventions had been ratified by the 
Government of Grenada, and international labour standards were well recognized and 
properly enforced. 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding good governance, measures taken to combat corruption were described, 
in particular the enactment in 2007 of the country&#8217;s first anti-corruption law and a bill 
establishing an Integrity Commission. The establishment of an Office of the Ombudsman 
and the appointment of an Ombudsman to investigate complaints by members of society 
about the Government&#8217;s actions were also mentioned.  
</p>
<p>20. As for crime prevention, the Government attached significant importance to crime 
prevention and security. The capacity of the police force to carry out its primary functions 
of maintaining law and order and preventing crime were always being strengthened, and 
training in individual human rights and their protection formed a key part of the police 
training agenda. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to health, an efficient health care system had always been the aim of 
every Government in Grenada. Over the years, successive Governments had faced the 
challenge of adequately responding to the health-care needs of the population. With respect 
to housing, the Government agreed that access to proper housing was a basic human right. 
The Government had struggled to overcome the destruction that had taken place in the 
wake of Hurricane Ivan, but had since made much progress.  
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, prison facilities had been improved in order to meet internationally 
acceptable standards. Measures were being taken to address the growing concerns about 
overcrowding and other complaints at prisons. Independent human rights groups were 
permitted to monitor prison conditions and to produce independent reports. 
</p>
<p>23. Grenada continued to fulfil its obligations through its voluntary pledges and 
commitments. Its support for activities to promote and protect the human rights of all 
people, without discrimination of any kind, and to uphold the highest human rights 
standards at home clearly demonstrated the Government&#8217;s philosophy. In supporting the 
fight to protect human rights internationally, Grenada had ratified core United Nations 
human rights instruments. However, there was a need for technical support in key areas in 
order to enhance its ability to continue to do so. 
</p>
<p>24. Advance questions were then responded to.  
</p>
<p>25. As regards corporal punishment, it was stated that the use of such punishment 
existed in the law but was restricted by the 2002 Education Act, which limited its 
application at schools by restricting its use and allowing parents to request exemptions. As 
it was permissible under the law, the Government could not prohibit it. Awareness was 
being raised about concerns over the practice in order to encourage its non-application.  
</p>
<p>26. As for questions regarding sexual activity between consenting adults of the same 
sex, it was confirmed that such activity was an offence under the laws of Grenada. 
However, this could be viewed as discriminatory, as it took away from the freedom of the </p>


<p>individual. With the passage of time, growing tolerance on the part of the people would 
help in addressing this issue. It was a policy issue on which the Cabinet would have to 
deliberate. It was noted that there was no discrimination in the provision of health and other 
services in that regard.  
</p>
<p>27. Regarding questions on human trafficking, it was explained that the Government 
sought to raise awareness about the issue. The Palermo Protocol on Trafficking had been 
ratified, and law enforcement officials were undergoing training in the detection and 
apprehension of human trafficking. In addition, there was an ongoing discussion about the 
criminalization of the specific offence of human trafficking, although related offences had 
already been criminalized. In a recent statement at a meeting of the Organization of 
American States, the Prime Minister pointed to the existence of resource constraints, but 
indicated that technical assistance would be sought to correct the problem.  
</p>
<p>28. As to questions on the ratification of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, it was clarified that it was a 
possibility, as the Government had undertaken a review of all international treaties with the 
intention of updating Grenada&#8217;s positions on a number of issues.  
</p>
<p>29. As regards the question relating to the issuance of a standing invitation, it was stated 
that the Government would consider extending a standing invitation to all the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>30. As to whether a human rights institution in accordance to the Paris Principles would 
be established, it was pointed out that Grenada had an independent human rights institution 
and that attempts were being made to strengthen its capacity with a view to international 
recognition. The group that had been brought together to help draft the report would be 
engaged on this issue.  
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the issue of what progress had been made towards meeting treaty 
reporting obligations, it was explained that Grenada faced severe human and technical 
constraints that had resulted in a backlog in its reporting obligations. However, the report to 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women had recently been 
submitted, and others should follow.  
</p>
<p>32. In response to questions about progress made in amending legislation to provide 
boys and girls with equal protection against sexual abuse and exploitation, it was stated that 
the law provided protection, but the harmonization of legislation in that regard was being 
contemplated. All reported abuses were investigated, and the Child Welfare Authority 
worked together with the police.  
</p>
<p>33. As for what progress had been made in providing juvenile courts and ensuring the 
separation of children from adults in detention, it was clarified that at present, children were 
separated from adults in pre-trial detention. With respect to post-trial detention, the 
Government was working to complete a facility for holding juvenile offenders. The facility 
had been affected by Hurricane Ivan, so there had been some delays in its functioning. 
Additionally, the Government was working towards juvenile courts, but it was constrained 
by limited resources.   
</p>
<p>34. Regarding violence against women, it was noted that the Domestic Violence Act 
2001 and the Domestic Violence Summary Procedure Rules were in place and that their 
strict enforcement should address the issue. It was also recalled that a shelter for battered 
women had been established and that all reports of abuse were investigated.  
</p>
<p>35. Concerning the question about the monitoring of places of detention and whether a 
complaint mechanism existed for victims of ill treatment, it was explained that regular 
visits were carried out by non-governmental organizations, in particular through </p>


<p>participation in a prison visiting committee. Additionally, there was a Prison Review Board 
that visited monthly and could receive complaints.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>36. During the interactive dialogue, 28 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations thanked the Government for the comprehensive national report, prepared 
through a broad consultation process, for its comprehensive presentation and for its 
responses to advance questions. Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in 
section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>37. Algeria congratulated Grenada on having contributed to good governance, 
accountability and the rule of law. It highlighted the ratification of international human 
rights instruments, the adoption of the domestic violence and child protection Acts, and the 
establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman. Algeria appreciated the efforts of the 
Government to ensure security and crime prevention, as well as the human rights training of 
the police. It asked for clarification as to why international human rights instruments 
ratified by Grenada could be invoked directly before local courts. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Brazil inquired about the concrete steps taken by Grenada in guaranteeing the rights 
of children and women and in combating all forms of discrimination, with special attention 
to the sexual exploitation of children, violence against women and non-discrimination on 
the basis of sexual diversity. It also required information about the major steps and 
shortcomings identified regarding economic, social and cultural rights, with special 
attention to the gap between rich and poor, policies for migrant workers and refugees, and 
counter-terrorism measures. It asked about the main urgent needs in the area of human 
rights cooperation. Brazil made recommendations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. Slovakia commended the involvement of various stakeholders in the preparation of 
Grenada&#8217;s national report. It welcomed the provision of compulsory and free primary 
education; the accessibility of pre-school care, as reflected in the high enrolment rate; and 
the textbook programme established for economically disadvantaged families. It made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>40. Norway asked how Grenada intended to include civil society in the process of 
following up on universal periodic review recommendations. It expressed concern about 
reports regarding the persistence of domestic violence and inquired about the steps Grenada 
had taken to respond to the need for more formal integration of gender analysis into 
national policies and plans. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Chile thanked Grenada for the presentation of its national report, referring to the 
measures adopted by the national authorities in various fields to guarantee and improve the 
protection and the promotion of human rights in the country. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. Cuba welcomed the priority placed by Grenada on improving the human rights 
situation of its citizens, including education, health and housing. It congratulated Grenada 
on the fact that education was compulsory until the age of 16 and was free at the primary 
and secondary levels, and that Grenada was committed to ensuring that at least one person 
per household had a university education. It noted the various measures taken to protect the 
rights of people living with disabilities and welcomed the programmes to provide care for 
HIV/AIDS sufferers. The prevention strategy in the area of health and the important 
attention devoted to chronic and communicable diseases were also noted. With respect to 
the challenges faced in the area of housing since the impact of Hurricane Ivan in 2004, 
Cuba called on the international community to scale up the financial assistance and </p>


<p>cooperation it provided to Grenada to contribute to the full realization of the right to 
adequate housing. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. Spain welcomed Grenada&#8217;s commitment to ensuring the right to compulsory and 
free primary education for all. It noted with satisfaction the existence of a de facto 
moratorium on the death penalty. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Canada recognized the need for comprehensive global and regional efforts to combat 
human trafficking and was pleased that a training seminar on this issue had recently been 
hosted by the Department of Public Security of the Anti-trafficking in Persons Unit of the 
Organization of American States. However, it noted that Grenada did not have legislation to 
address that important issue. Canada expressed concern about prison overcrowding and the 
practice of reducing a detainee&#8217;s diet as a punishment for violating prison regulations; the 
delays in the hearing of juvenile cases; the lack of adequate facilities for children in 
detention; and the limited number of trained personnel to work with such children. Canada 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. The Netherlands acknowledged the economic and social difficulties facing Grenada 
and encouraged it to seek technical assistance, if necessary. It welcomed the 2007 anti-
corruption law, a bill establishing an integrity commission and initiatives taken to raise 
awareness with regard to violence against women and children, but noted that domestic 
violence remained a serious problem and that practices of the ill treatment and abuse, 
including sexual abuse, of children persisted. It noted that the Human Rights Committee 
had expressed concern that the Criminal Code penalized same-sex activities between 
consenting adults, which, according to the Committee, violated the right to privacy and 
non-discrimination. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Mexico encouraged Grenada to maintain a broad consultation process for following 
up on the universal periodic review outcome. It emphasized the significant progress made 
in the areas of basic and health services, as well as the high enrolment rates for pre-school 
and primary education. Mexico commended Grenada for its efforts to guarantee the right to 
housing, particularly in the context of the country&#8217;s vulnerability to natural disasters. It 
noted the human rights challenges facing Grenada and hoped that the universal periodic 
review would help to strengthen the national efforts in that area. Mexico made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. The United States of America praised Grenada&#8217;s efforts to promote education and 
develop life skills among Grenada&#8217;s youth. However, it remained concerned about the 
administration of justice and the rule of law and the lack of efficient and effective 
administration of juvenile justice. The United States expressed its deep concern about the 
limited definitions in the Criminal Code, which did not include incest, rape or other sexual 
offences, and about the fact that it did not prohibit the sale and trafficking of children for 
prostitution and labour exploitation. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Uruguay noted the efforts made by Grenada in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, including the Water Support Programme, aimed at guaranteeing access to 
drinking water. It noted that Grenada was a party to several international instruments and 
encouraged it to continue efforts to implement the provisions related to its international 
commitments at the national level. 
</p>
<p>49. Argentina thanked Grenada&#8217;s for its detailed responses to its written questions and 
praised the efforts made in the economic, social and cultural spheres. It referred to the 
provision of primary health care, the high levels of vaccination and school enrolment and 
the low level of malnutrition.  It also welcomed the existing moratorium on the application 
of the death penalty. Argentina made recommendations.   </p>


<p>50. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya referred to Grenada&#8217;s efforts to improve the human 
rights situation in the country and noted that it was a party to more than 20 international 
human rights conventions, which showed the Government&#8217;s firm will to protect human 
rights by respecting its treaty obligations. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Australia commended Grenada for its strong tradition of secular governance and 
freedom of religion. It congratulated Grenada on its continuing reconstruction after the 
hurricanes of 2009, noting in particular the impressive work carried out to rebuild damaged 
education facilities. It welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death penalty but regretted 
the fact that Grenada had not formally abolished it. It noted with concern that Grenada had 
maintained criminal sanctions against sexual activity between consenting adults of the same 
sex. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. France noted the launching of a new youth policy and posed questions in that regard. 
It also noted that Grenada had already applied a de facto moratorium on the death penalty 
and established several institutions to guarantee human rights. It highlighted the finding of 
the Human Rights Committee that Grenada continued to punish homosexuality under 
article 435 of its Criminal Code, which deemed sexual activities against nature a crime. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Germany requested more detailed information about measures taken by the 
Government of Grenada to reduce domestic violence, particularly with regard to adequate 
training of the police and other officials dealing with such situations. Germany made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Slovenia thanked Grenada for its answers to its advance questions regarding the 
independent national human rights institution. In line with the report of the Human Rights 
Committee for 2007, it noted with satisfaction that a de facto moratorium on the death 
penalty was in force, although it remained concerned that there were still at least 10 persons 
on death row. It also stressed that domestic law exceptionally allowed for the detention of 
juveniles together with adults, which allegedly had become a regular practice. Slovenia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding questions raised with respect to trafficking, the explanation given during 
the introduction of the report was recalled.  
</p>
<p>56. As for seeking assistance in the implementation of international obligations, it was 
stated that the Government would certainly consider this, as it would welcome technical 
assistance, in particular regarding the issue of treaty ratification.  
</p>
<p>57. As for questions raised regarding the death penalty, it was recalled that there was a 
de facto moratorium on the death penalty in Grenada. The death penalty was no longer 
mandatory, as stipulated in the 2006 decision of the Privy Council. While it remained in the 
law, it had not been applied for decades.  
</p>
<p>58. With respect to the issue of prison overcrowding, it was stated that the Government 
was considering the possibility of building a new prison, as the present facility was not 
adequate.  
</p>
<p>59. Concerning the issue of raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility, it was 
noted that this was an issue of great concern and that progress was expected shortly. 
</p>
<p>60. Hungary thanked Grenada for its cooperation and participation in the universal 
periodic review process and commended the country for efforts made in the promotion and 
protection of human rights despite its difficult situation and limited resources. It made 
recommendations.  </p>


<p>61. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland acknowledged 
Grenada&#8217;s vulnerability to natural disasters and the devastating effects that these could have 
on infrastructure and livelihoods. It encouraged the Government, in planning for such 
events, to do all that it could to ensure the protection of human rights during such crises. It 
also encouraged the Government to abolish the death penalty under all circumstances. It 
inquired about Grenada&#8217;s plans to ensure effective civil society involvement in the follow-
up to the review. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. China noted that Grenada had enacted a number of laws containing provisions for 
human rights protection and promotion and had taken measures to upgrade the housing for 
vulnerable groups and to increase job opportunities. It noted that Grenada had given top 
priority to human resources, health and the prevention and punishment of crimes. It also 
noted Grenada's efforts to ensure equal enjoyment of the right to education and its efforts in 
the area of economic, social and cultural rights. China recognized the difficulties and 
challenges that Grenada faced as a developing country in promoting and protecting human 
rights, in particular, the difficulties in improving prison facilities and reintegrating AIDS 
patients and disabled persons. China called on the international community to provide the 
necessary assistance and to support Grenada in these areas. It made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>63. Maldives welcomed the establishment of numerous governmental and non-
governmental institutions to promote and protect human rights, including the National 
Organization for Women and the National Coalition on the Rights of the Child. It 
commended Grenada&#8217;s commitment to the education of all its citizens and the 
implementation of measures to ensure that formal education was free and mandatory. 
Maldives referred to shortcomings in the Child Protection Act. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Latvia noted that Grenada had established a free compulsory education system for 
all children between the ages of 5 and 16 and that a national school textbook programme 
ensured that all children were provided with the basic textbooks required to enhance their 
educational opportunities. Latvia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>65. Jamaica noted that it had a great appreciation for the sterling efforts that Grenada 
had made to protect and promote human rights. It noted the social programmes that the 
Government had introduced to improve the living standards of vulnerable groups and 
disadvantaged members of society, so as to enhance their socio-economic rights. Jamaica 
made a recommendation<b> 
</b></p>
<p>66. Trinidad and Tobago noted that Grenada was a small, resource-deficient developing 
country facing challenges in satisfying the full range of the social, economic, environmental 
and other demands of its population. It stressed that there were obvious capacity issues 
hindering the country&#8217;s overall development and the implementation of its international 
human rights obligations. It referred to the hurricane of September 2004 and the magnitude 
of the task required to put Grenada back on its feet. It welcomed Grenada&#8217;s policy aimed at 
a review of the age of criminal responsibility, which was currently 7 years; the expansion of 
legal aid to include persons charged with a serious criminal offence; the adoption of 
legislation to guarantee the legal protection of children born out of wedlock; and the 
integration of children with disabilities into the educational system.   
</p>
<p>67. Ghana commended Grenada for the measures it had put in place to ensure the 
enjoyment of human rights, such as the Domestic Violence Act, programmes to ensure 
equitable access to quality and relevant education for all citizens, and the Necessitous Fund, 
which provided additional support to ensure that students remained in school. It noted the 
number of services aimed at alleviating poverty and improving the living standards of 
disabled, vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society, thus enhancing their socio-
economic rights. It commended the Government for its commitment to the principles 
underlying good governance and supported its request for technical support in key areas to </p>


<p>enable it to fulfil its obligations regarding the signing and ratification of international 
instruments. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>68. Nicaragua noted Grenada&#8217;s actions to promote and protect human rights. It added 
that Grenada had accomplished achievements in the social and economic spheres despite 
the fact that it had a small economy and had to address the current crises. Nicaragua noted 
the social programmes to address the effects of poverty and referred to the public assistance 
and drinking water programmes as good practices. It encouraged Grenada to value the 
universal periodic review so as to strengthen its framework for the promotion and 
protection of human rights. Nicaragua made recommendations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. South Africa inquired about the extent to which civil society had been consulted and 
involved in the process of drafting the national report, as well as about its involvement in 
the follow-up process. As a local human rights committee had been established for the 
preparation of Grenada&#8217;s report, South Africa inquired whether that had been an initial step 
in setting up a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles. It also 
requested further information about what steps were being taken to increase the 
representation of women in the decision-making spheres of government and to implement
