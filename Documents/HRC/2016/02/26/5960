</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child, which stipulates, inter alia, that in all actions concerning children, the best interests 
</p>
<p>of the child shall be a primary consideration, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>and welcoming the international discussion launched in 2004 by the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child on the subject of children deprived of parental care, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>and welcoming the initiative of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>which, in 2005, devoted its annual day of general discussion to the issue of children deprived of 
</p>
<p>parental care, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further </i>and welcoming the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child that the international community should engage in the preparation of guidelines on 
</p>
<p>alternative care, to be considered and adopted by the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the intergovernmental meeting of experts to review the draft United Nations 
</p>
<p>guidelines for the protection of children without parental care, held in Brasilia, in August 2006,  
</p>
<p>based on the initial draft produced by experts and followed by the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child, and recognising the importance of that meeting for the process, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>and welcoming the discussions held by the Council, which included joint 
</p>
<p>statements by the Group of Friends, UNICEF and civil society representatives at its sixth 
</p>
<p>session, resolution 7/29 adopted by consensus at its seventh session, and the high-level panel 
</p>
<p>with broad participation held during the eighth session of the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> resolution 60/251 of the General Assembly, in which the Assembly established 
</p>
<p>the Council as the body responsible for promoting universal respect for the protection of all 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, </p>

<p>page 2 
 
 <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the protection, wellbeing and rights of children who are in 
</p>
<p>need of alternative care or who are at risk of becoming so, as recognized by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly in its resolution 62/141, 
</p>
<p> <i>Also reaffirming</i> paragraph 20 of Council resolution 7/29, where it encourages the 
</p>
<p>advancement of the draft United Nations guidelines for the appropriate use and conditions of 
</p>
<p>alternative care for children; 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes</i> <i>note</i> of the draft United Nations guidelines for the appropriate use and 
</p>
<p>conditions of alternative care for children;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist in 
</p>
<p>raising awareness by circulating, immediately, the draft United Nations guidelines with a view to 
</p>
<p>give full knowledge of it to all members and observers of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Invites</i> States to dedicate all their efforts, in a transparent process, with a view to 
</p>
<p>taking possible action on the draft United Nations guidelines at its tenth session.
