<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 25/11, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>to submit an annual report with a special focus on the importance of social protection floors 
</p>
<p>for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights (para. 16). 
</p>
<p>2. The report outlines the main features of social protection floors and how their 
</p>
<p>adoption, by States, can contribute to the enjoyment of minimum essential levels of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, reducing poverty and inequality. In that context, the 
</p>
<p>Social Protection Floor Initiative, led by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and 
</p>
<p>supported by all United Nations agencies, is pivotal in promoting basic income security and 
</p>
<p>access to health care, and in facilitating the enjoyment of several economic and social rights 
</p>
<p>by the most marginalized groups of the population. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Social protection floors 
</b></p>
<p>3. Events such as the surge in the late 1990s in innovative national programmes for 
</p>
<p>social protection in the global South1 and the 2008 financial and economic crisis2 have 
</p>
<p>gradually increased political support for the idea of Government-funded minimum social 
</p>
<p>protection floors. According to the Social Protection Floors Recommendation (ILO 
</p>
<p>Recommendation No. 202, adopted on 14 June 2012), social protection floors are nationally 
</p>
<p>defined sets of basic social security guarantees that should provide access to essential health 
</p>
<p>care and to basic income security for all those in need over the life cycle. 
</p>
<p>4. The ILO-led Social Protection Floor Initiative is a policy response to the limited 
</p>
<p>social security coverage worldwide. According to the ILO<i> World Social Protection Report 
</i></p>
<p><i>2014/2015</i>,3 73 per cent of the global population are either not covered, or only partially 
</p>
<p>covered, by comprehensive social security systems. The ILO report notes that 75 countries 
</p>
<p>have no child and family benefit programmes mandated by legislation, and the global 
</p>
<p>average spending on such programmes is only 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product 
</p>
<p>(GDP). Worldwide, employment injury, disability and maternity benefits and old-age 
</p>
<p>pension are also only available on a very limited basis.  
</p>
<p>5. In 2009, the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination 
</p>
<p>adopted the One United Nations Social Protection Floor Initiative as one of the nine United 
</p>
<p>Nations joint initiatives to cope with the global economic and financial crises.4 Within the 
</p>
<p>framework of the Social Protection Floor Initiative, the Social Protection Floor Advisory

</p>
<p> 4 The Initiative is co-led by ILO and the World Health Organization and involves 17 collaborating 
</p>
<p>agencies, including United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and international 
</p>
<p>financial institutions, inter alia the World Bank. </p>


<p>Group was created to enhance global advocacy activities and to develop the conceptual 
</p>
<p>policy aspects of the approach. 
</p>
<p>6. In 2011, the Social Protection Floor Advisory Group issued a report entitled <i>Social 
</i></p>
<p><i>Protection Floor for a Fair and Inclusive Globalization</i>,5 which consolidated global 
</p>
<p>advocacy activities around social protection. In 2012, at the 101st session of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Conference, Governments, employers and workers from 185 countries 
</p>
<p>unanimously adopted ILO Recommendation No. 202. In that landmark recommendation, 
</p>
<p>social security as a human right for all persons is reaffirmed and guidance provided for 
</p>
<p>building comprehensive social security systems. Also in 2012, in the outcome document of 
</p>
<p>United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), entitled &#8220;The Future 
</p>
<p>We Want&#8221;, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288, States stressed &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>need to provide social protection to all members of society&#8221;, encouraged &#8220;initiatives aimed 
</p>
<p>at providing social protection floors for all citizens&#8221; and reaffirmed that sustainable 
</p>
<p>development and poverty eradication policies should promote &#8220;respect  for all human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221; (annex, paras. 156, 107 and 58, respectively). 
</p>
<p>7. ILO Recommendation No. 202 provides guidance to member States on how to 
</p>
<p>extend and adapt social protection floors to national circumstances. It states that national 
</p>
<p>social protection floors should include at least four essential guarantees:  
</p>
<p>(a) Access to at least essential health care, including maternity care; 
</p>
<p>(b) Basic income security for children, providing access to nutrition, education, 
</p>
<p>care and any other necessary goods and services; 
</p>
<p>(c) Basic income security for persons of working age who are unable to earn 
</p>
<p>sufficient income, in particular in cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and 
</p>
<p>disability; 
</p>
<p>(d) Basic income security for older persons. 
</p>
<p>8. While the final objective is to put in place comprehensive social protection systems, 
</p>
<p>implementation can be gradual in line with States&#8217; resources. Countries adopting a social 
</p>
<p>protection floor should develop nationally defined strategies, in a participatory manner, 
</p>
<p>respecting the principles of non-discrimination, gender equality and social inclusion. 
</p>
<p>Building on existing social protection mechanisms, those strategies may include a mix of 
</p>
<p>measures: contributory and non-contributory, targeted and universal, and public and private 
</p>
<p>&#8212; depending on the country&#8217;s social, economic and political context. 
</p>
<p>9. The results of ILO research and the experience of several developing countries show 
</p>
<p>that virtually all countries can afford social protection floors and that they would constitute 
</p>
<p>effective tools in the fight against poverty.<footnote name="6">6 General comment No. 19, para. 31. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>10. Social protection floors differ from a &#8220;safety net&#8221; or &#8220;social safety nets&#8221; approaches, 
</p>
<p>which are non-contributory transfers designed to provide regular, predictable and targeted 
</p>
<p>support to poor and vulnerable people. In contrast, the aim of social protection floors is to 
</p>
<p>approach social policy comprehensively through the promotion of integrated strategies for 
</p>
<p>essential social services and income security for all.

<p>11. &#8220;Safety net approaches&#8221; do not offer wider social protection systems, but rather tend 
</p>
<p>to consist of isolated programmes, often fragmented and insufficiently coordinated. That 
</p>
<p>fragmentation makes it more difficult for individual rights-holders to identify who is 
</p>
<p>accountable for a programme&#8217;s implementation and may lead to gaps in coverage, 
</p>
<p>exclusion errors, or create risks of activities in one sector creating negative unforeseen 
</p>
<p>effects in another.7 
</p>
<p>12. The concept of the Social Protection Floor Initiative is based on shared principles of 
</p>
<p>social justice and refers to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights for the realization of the rights to social 
</p>
<p>security, adequate standard of living, health, education, food and housing.8 The Social 
</p>
<p>Protection Floor Initiative and human rights standards are complementary, as the first 
</p>
<p>provides the policy space while the latter provides the normative framework in which States 
</p>
<p>should develop social protection floors. While social protection floors represent States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>policy commitments, human rights norms translate into concrete rights for specific rights-
</p>
<p>holders, and therefore into concrete legal obligations for States. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights norms and principles and social protection 
floors  
</b></p>
<p>13. ILO Recommendation 202 lays down the guiding principles that should be observed 
</p>
<p>in creating national social protection floors. In its preamble, it reaffirms that the right to 
</p>
<p>social security is a human right and an important tool not only to &#8220;prevent and reduce 
</p>
<p>poverty, inequality, social exclusion and social insecurity&#8221; but also &#8220;to promote equal 
</p>
<p>opportunity and gender and racial equality&#8221;<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p>14. The preamble of ILO Recommendation 202 also explicitly mentions the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights (arts. 22 and 25) and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (arts. 9, 11 and 12). The recommendation refers to a 
</p>
<p>number of human rights norms and principles, such as the universality of protection; 
</p>
<p>entitlements prescribed by law; non-discrimination, gender equality, responsiveness to 
</p>
<p>special needs; respect for the rights and dignity of people covered by the social security 
</p>
<p>guarantees; progressive realization; transparency and accountability; remedies; and respect 
</p>
<p>for the rights of collective bargain and freedom of association for all workers.  
</p>
<p>15. Those principles are drawn from States&#8217; human rights obligations. The Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the authoritative interpretative body of rights and 
</p>
<p>obligations of the Covenant, in paragraph 2 of its general comment No. 19 (2007) on the 
</p>
<p>right to social security (art. 9) (hereinafter, general comment No. 19), clarified that the right 
</p>
<p>to social security encompasses the right to access benefits without discrimination in order to 
</p>
<p>secure protection from, inter alia, a lack of a work-related income due to sickness, 
</p>
<p>disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment, old age or death of a family 
</p>
<p>member, unaffordable access to health care or insufficient family support. The Committee 
</p>
<p>further stresses that States must provide social protection to all individuals, guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>universal coverage, reasonable, proportionate and transparent eligibility criteria;

<p>affordability and physical accessibility by beneficiaries; and participation in and 
</p>
<p>information about the provision of benefits (ibid., paras. 23&#8211;26). The right to social security 
</p>
<p>should be enjoyed equally by men and women as outlined in article 2, paragraph 2 (on non-
</p>
<p>discrimination), and article 3 (on the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The obligation of progressive realization  
</b></p>
<p>16. International human rights treaties provide for the progressive realization of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights (art. 2, para. 1, of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). The obligation of progressive realization requires 
</p>
<p>States parties not only to continuously improve conditions, but also prohibits any deliberate 
</p>
<p>retrogressive measure. There is a strong presumption that retrogressive measures are 
</p>
<p>prohibited under the Covenant,9 unless concerned States are able to prove that the measures 
</p>
<p>have been introduced after most careful consideration of all alternatives, and that they are 
</p>
<p>justified by reference to the totality of the rights stipulated in the Covenant.10 Everyone 
</p>
<p>should be covered by social security, in particular individuals belonging to the most 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged and marginalized groups.11 Each State party has to devise its own measures, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with its specific circumstances, including its financial resources, population, 
</p>
<p>geographic distribution of the population and natural resources.  
</p>
<p>17. Social protection floors demonstrate the need for progressive realization. While 
</p>
<p>ensuring that basic income security allows a life in dignity, each country should determine 
</p>
<p>the range of social security guarantees that will be encompassed in its national definition.12 
</p>
<p>National social protection floors should move progressively towards universal and basic 
</p>
<p>social protection for all, with a view to ensuring that no one falls below a certain income 
</p>
<p>level and that everyone has access to essential public services, such as water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p>health and education.13 
</p>
<p>18. Progressive realization in the implementation of national social protection floors 
</p>
<p>should not be interpreted as allowing States to delay implementing national social 
</p>
<p>protection floors. The implementation of higher standards of protection should be 
</p>
<p>envisaged immediately and, as much as possible, within the limits of a country&#8217;s fiscal and 
</p>
<p>administrative capacities. The objective of the social protection floor is to safeguard a 
</p>
<p>dignified existence for all.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Minimum essential levels of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>19. According to the Covenant, State parties have a minimum core obligation to ensure 
</p>
<p>the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of all economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, including the right to social security, as a matter of priority. General 
</p>
<p>comment No. 19 promotes the understanding that all States have a minimum core 
</p>
<p>obligation to provide some form of basic social security. This is an immediate obligation. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9  General comment No. 19, para. 42. See also report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on austerity measures and economic, social and cultural rights, E/2013/82, para. 15. 
</p>

<p>Thus, the fulfilment of minimum essential levels of economic, social and cultural rights is 
</p>
<p>not to be left to progressive realization.14  
</p>
<p>20. For a State party to be able to attribute its failure to meet at least its minimum core 
</p>
<p>obligations to a lack of available resources, it must demonstrate that every effort has been 
</p>
<p>made to use all resources that are at its disposal to fulfil, as a matter of priority, those 
</p>
<p>minimum obligations.15 
</p>
<p>21. Social protection floors could be seen as instrumental to satisfying that &#8220;minimum&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Conversely, they should never be considered a ceiling for social protection. According to 
</p>
<p>ILO, the social protection floor is part of a two-dimensional strategy for the extension of 
</p>
<p>social security, comprising of a basic set of social guarantees for all (horizontal dimension), 
</p>
<p>and the gradual implementation of higher standards (vertical dimension).16 
</p>
<p>22. The minimum core content of the right to social security has been elaborated further. 
</p>
<p>In general comment No. 19, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights notes 
</p>
<p>that the realization of the right to social security implies that States must ensure that 
</p>
<p>benefits are adequate in amount and duration, and provided in a manner that complies with 
</p>
<p>human rights principles such as respect of human dignity and non-discrimination.17 That 
</p>
<p>requires that social protection programmes do not stigmatize beneficiaries, and avoid any 
</p>
<p>demeaning treatment during all phases of a programme.18 Those are also critical principles 
</p>
<p>in the implementation of national social protection floors. In giving effect to ILO 
</p>
<p>Recommendation 202, States should ensure the adequacy of benefits (para. 3 (c)). The 
</p>
<p>benefit levels should be established by law and regularly reviewed (para. 3 (c) and 
</p>
<p>para. 8 (c)). Additionally, the recommendation explicitly notes that in establishing social 
</p>
<p>protection floors States should demonstrate &#8220;respect for the rights and dignity of people 
</p>
<p>covered by the social security guarantees&#8221; (para. 3 (f)). 
</p>
<p>23. The minimum core content of rights, as contained in the Covenant and as further 
</p>
<p>clarified by human rights bodies, can also assist in defining the level of national social 
</p>
<p>protection floors.19 The social protection floor could be instrumental in achieving the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of 
</p>
<p>States parties&#8217; obligations, para. 10. &#8220;The Committee is of the view that a minimum core obligation to 
</p>
<p>ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights is 
</p>
<p>incumbent upon every State party. Thus, for example, a State party in which any significant number 
</p>
<p>of individuals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basic shelter and 
</p>
<p>housing, or of the most basic forms of education is, prima facie, failing to discharge its obligations 
</p>
<p>under the Covenant&#8221;.

<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) imposes on States a set of core obligation 
</p>
<p>including &#8220;(a) to ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-

<p>discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups; (b) to ensure access to the

<p>Rights has recommended that transparency be integral to national social security 
</p>
<p>programmes and plans of action, and that the beneficiaries participate in the administration 
</p>
<p>of social protection programmes.20 Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty 
</p>
<p>and human rights noted that transparency must be a fundamental element of all aspects of 
</p>
<p>social protection programmes, including selection methods, eligibility criteria, benefits 
</p>
<p>level, and complaints and redress mechanisms.21 Further, the Special Rapporteur has noted 
</p>
<p>that civil society should participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of social 
</p>
<p>protection programmes.22 
</p>
<p>25. Under international human rights law, access to information is a right in itself and a 
</p>
<p>prerequisite to ensuring participation in public affairs and accountability.23 Consequently, 
</p>
<p>human rights bodies have noted that social security systems must ensure respect for the 
</p>
<p>right of individuals and organizations to seek, receive and impart information on all social 
</p>
<p>security entitlements in a clear and transparent manner.24  
</p>
<p>26. ILO Recommendation 202 explicitly refers to transparent, accountable and sound 
</p>
<p>financial management and administration (para. 3 (j)) and denotes a number of important 
</p>
<p>elements in that regard. For example, when formulating and implementing national social 
</p>
<p>security strategies, States should raise awareness about the strategies and put in place 
</p>
<p>information programmes (para. 14 (f)). ILO Recommendation 202 also specifies that 
</p>
<p>national social security strategies should be formulated and implemented on the basis of 
</p>
<p>national consultations through effective social dialogue and participation (para. 13). Other 
</p>
<p>ILO instruments also stress the importance of participation.25  
</p>

</p>
<p>minimum essential food which is nutritionally adequate and safe, to ensure freedom from hunger to 
</p>
<p>everyone; (c) to ensure access to basic shelter, housing and sanitation, and an adequate supply of safe 
</p>
<p>and potable water; (d) to provide essential drugs, as from time to time defined under the WHO Action 
</p>
<p>Programme on Essential Drugs; (e) to ensure equitable distribution of all health facilities, goods and 
</p>
<p>services; (f) to adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action, on the basis 
</p>
<p>of epidemiological evidence, addressing the health concerns of the whole population; the strategy and 
</p>
<p>plan of action shall be devised, and periodically reviewed, on the basis of a participatory and 
</p>
<p>transparent process; they shall include methods, such as right to health indicators and benchmarks, 
</p>
<p>by which progress can be closely monitored; the process by which the strategy and plan of action are 
</p>
<p>devised, as well as their content, shall give particular attention to all vulnerable or marginalized 
</p>
<p>groups.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 20 See general comment No.19, paras. 70 and 26. 
</p>
<p> 21 The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has assessed the practical implications 
</p>
<p>of those principles in several reports, which clarify the technical requirements with which social 
</p>
<p>protection systems should comply. See, e.g., A/65/259, paras. 88&#8211;93.  
</p>
<p> 22 See, e.g., reports of the Special Rapporteur on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/11/9, pp. 7&#8211;9; A/64/279, pp. 14&#8211;18; A/HRC/14/31, pp. 11&#8211;19; and A/HRC/17/34, pp. 6&#8211;12. 
</p>
<p> 23 See, for example, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 19; African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, art. 9; American Convention on Human Rights, art. 13; and European 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, art. 10. 
</p>
<p> 24 General comment No. 19, para. 26. See also A/HRC/11/9, pp. 8&#8211;17; and A/HRC/14/31 pp. 11&#8211;19. 
</p>
<p> 25 Articles 71 and 72 of ILO Convention No. 102 (1952) on Minimum Standards of Social Security set 
</p>
<p>out similar requirements. </p>


<p>27. That is consistent with the recommendations of the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights that participation should be an integral part of any policy or programme 
</p>
<p>concerning social security.26 Participation not only contributes to the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation and sustainability of national social protection floors, but also ensures that 
</p>
<p>the rights of beneficiaries are respected. For example, the successful implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Universal Health Coverage Scheme in Thailand has been attributed to, among other 
</p>
<p>reasons, the critical role played by civil society and social movements in its formulation and 
</p>
<p>design.27 
</p>
<p>28. According to ILO Recommendation 202, national social protection floors should 
</p>
<p>also put in place &#8220;impartial, transparent, effective, simple, rapid accessible and inexpensive 
</p>
<p>complaint and appeal procedures&#8221;. The recommendation underlines that such procedures 
</p>
<p>should be free of charge for the applicant (para. 7). This is in line with general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 19 in which the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommends that 
</p>
<p>all victims of violations of the right to social security be entitled to adequate reparation, 
</p>
<p>including restitution, compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition. National 
</p>
<p>ombudspersons, human rights commissions and similar national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>should have a role in addressing violations of the right (paras. 77&#8211;81). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Equality between men and women 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted in its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 19 that States parties should ensure that social protection guarantees do not 
</p>
<p>reinforce traditional gender stereotypes, but rather encourage behaviour that advances 
</p>
<p>equality between men and women (para. 32).28 Social security programmes should address 
</p>
<p>imbalances of power and the multiple forms of discrimination that women experience, and 
</p>
<p>address women&#8217;s specific needs throughout their lives: during adolescence, adulthood and 
</p>
<p>old age.29 
</p>
<p>30. In its preamble, ILO Recommendation 202 recognizes that social security is an 
</p>
<p>important tool to promote gender equality. It emphasizes that, in implementing the 
</p>
<p>recommendation, States should apply the principle of gender equality and be responsive to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s special needs (para. 3 (d)). It also specifies the critical role of gender-
</p>
<p>disaggregated data for the effective monitoring of the floors (paras. 19 and 21). Moreover, 
</p>
<p>several of the basic guarantees that national social protection floors should establish, such 
</p>
<p>as maternal health, child care and maternity benefits (para. 5 (a), (b) and (c)), aim in 
</p>
<p>particular at ensuring gender equality and women&#8217;s enjoyment of rights.  
</p>
<p>31. Many social protection schemes specifically target women within households or 
</p>
<p>female-headed households,30 as it is widely understood that targeting women as recipients 
</p>
<p>of social protection benefits significantly improves the education, health and nutritional

<p>levels of children.31 However, channelling social protection through women alone does not 
</p>
<p>eradicate the causes of gender inequality.32 From discriminatory legal frameworks to 
</p>
<p>persistent discriminatory social norms, there are many underlying causes that prevent 
</p>
<p>women from benefiting from social protection interventions or accessing social services in 
</p>
<p>an equal manner to men. If the differences between men and women are not taken into 
</p>
<p>account throughout the design, implementation and evaluation of a social protection 
</p>
<p>intervention, there is a serious risk that the intervention will have the unintended effect of 
</p>
<p>exacerbating inequalities. 
</p>
<p>32. Demands of unpaid care work often force women into informal jobs with precarious 
</p>
<p>employment status, no access to social insurance benefits such as paid maternity leave, 
</p>
<p>unemployment insurance or pensions, and often unsafe and unhealthy working conditions.33 
</p>
<p>Even when women manage to combine unpaid care work with formal-sector employment, 
</p>
<p>they are likely to have lower social insurance contributions than men, owing to lower wages 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;interrupted&#8221; work histories as a result of child-rearing or other unpaid care work.  
</p>
<p>33. The unequal distribution, intensity and lack of recognition and support of unpaid 
</p>
<p>care work undermines the dignity and autonomy of women caregivers and obstructs their 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of several human rights &#8212; including civil, economic, political, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights &#8212; on an equal basis with men.34 For example, unpaid care work has an 
</p>
<p>impact on women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; rights to education, work, social security and participation, as 
</p>
<p>well as to rest and leisure. Systematically unequal distribution of care work and household 
</p>
<p>tasks between women and men also raises concerns in terms of the right to equality and 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination and the obligations of States in that regard.  
</p>
<p>34. Human rights treaties require States parties to take measures to ensure unpaid care 
</p>
<p>work does not hamper women&#8217;s equal enjoyment of the right to social security.35 Thus, 
</p>
<p>social insurance and social assistance programmes must take into account women&#8217;s unequal 
</p>
<p>burden of unpaid care work.36 For example, States must put in place social insurance 
</p>
<p>schemes that take into account factors, including child-rearing periods, which prevent 
</p>
<p>women from making equal contributions.

</p>

<p>35. Under human rights law, States parties must ensure that women and men have an 
</p>
<p>equal right to family benefits.37 All women, including those working in the informal sector, 
</p>
<p>should be granted paid maternity leave and benefits for an adequate period, and States must 
</p>
<p>take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to ensure that social security 
</p>
<p>systems cover persons working in the informal economy.38 According to ILO, only 28 per 
</p>
<p>cent of women in employment worldwide are covered by maternity benefits.39 ILO 
</p>
<p>Recommendation 202 explicitly includes maternal benefits, which are vital, not only to 
</p>
<p>promote equality in employment and occupation, but also in ensuring income security for 
</p>
<p>pregnant women and mothers of newborn children and their families, and effective access 
</p>
<p>to quality maternal health care. Without maternity protection, women&#8217;s right to health and 
</p>
<p>the health of the newborn are compromised, as women are forced to work until the last days 
</p>
<p>of their pregnancy and resume working soon after childbirth. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Social protection floors and marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>36. While all persons should progressively be covered by social security systems, 
</p>
<p>human rights law prescribes that priority should be accorded to the most disadvantaged and 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups.40 Human rights bodies have repeatedly called for the extension of 
</p>
<p>social security guarantees to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups such as orphans and 
</p>
<p>children with street connections,41 victims of trafficking,42 minorities43 and internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons.44 Accordingly, national social protection floors aim at guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>income security and access to basic services throughout the life cycle, with particular 
</p>
<p>attention to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.45 
</p>
<p><b> A. Children 
</b></p>
<p>37. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States parties must promote and 
</p>
<p>protect all children&#8217;s rights including their economic, social and cultural rights including 
</p>
<p>the right to social security (art. 26) and the right to an adequate standard of living (art. 27). 
</p>
<p>A national social protection floor should fulfil basic income security for children in order to 
</p>
<p>provide access to nutrition, education, care and any other necessary goods and services.46 
</p>
<p>38. To maximize the impact on the enjoyment of rights, social protection policies should 
</p>
<p>be child sensitive: addressing the unique social disadvantages, risks and vulnerabilities that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 37 See e.g., Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 13 (a).

</p>
<p>displaced persons, Walter K&#228;lin, mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina, E/CN.4/2006/71/Add.4. 
</p>

<p>children may be born into or acquire later in childhood owing to external circumstances.47 
</p>
<p>Child-sensitive social protection also means reaching out to especially vulnerable groups of 
</p>
<p>children, including orphaned children, children affected by HIV/AIDS, children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, migrant children, children from marginalized ethnic minorities and indigenous 
</p>
<p>groups and other economically and socially excluded groups.48  
</p>
<p>39. Cash transfers directed at families with small children have often contributed to the 
</p>
<p>realization of children&#8217;s right to health by increasing immunization, regular medical check-
</p>
<p>ups and reducing the risk of child mortality. According to evaluations of the Juntos scheme 
</p>
<p>of Peru, that cash transfer programme conditional on prenatal and postnatal visits led to an 
</p>
<p>increase of approximately 65 per cent in such visits to health clinics, and a reduction in 
</p>
<p>home births in areas where there were high levels of maternal mortality.49 Similarly, food 
</p>
<p>transfers can be a valuable component of a broader approach to ensuring the right to food.50 
</p>
<p>Old-age pensions also appear to have positive impacts on the lives of children.51 Some 
</p>
<p>positive impacts in the enjoyment of the right to education have also been shown. For 
</p>
<p>example, data compiled by the World Bank indicates that conditional cash transfers had 
</p>
<p>positive effects on school enrolment and attendance, and that they occasionally helped to 
</p>
<p>reduce the gender gap in school enrolment.52 Social protection guarantees can also prevent 
</p>
<p>and reduce child labour.53 Evidence from Latin America suggests that greater access to 
</p>
<p>unemployment and disability benefits directly reduces the prevalence of child labour.54  
</p>
<p><b> B. Older persons 
</b></p>
<p>40. Income security in old age was recognized as a fundamental human right by the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 (arts. 22 and 25). In its general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 19, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights explicitly notes that States 
</p>
<p>cannot rely solely on contributory systems for old-age pensions, as many individuals work 
</p>
<p>in the informal sector, as unpaid carers in the household, or are unable to meet the level of 
</p>
<p>contributions required to obtain social security benefits. States must therefore consider the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a non-contributory pension system (para. 15). States parties to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should, within the limits 
</p>
<p>of available resources, provide non-contributory old-age benefits to assist, at the very least, 
</p>
<p>all older persons who, when reaching the retirement age, are not entitled to an old-age 
</p>
<p>insurance-based pension.

<p>41. According to ILO Recommendation 202, national social protection floors should, 
</p>
<p>among its minimum components, at least guarantee basic income security in old age (para. 
</p>
<p>5 (d)). By doing so, national social protection floors have the potential to help reduce older 
</p>
<p>persons&#8217; vulnerabilities, enabling them to enjoy their rights.  
</p>
<p>42. Without income security, older persons, particularly older women, are at increased 
</p>
<p>risk of seeing their rights violated. As the proportion of older women outnumbers that of 
</p>
<p>older men, universal pension systems might be the most gender-sensitive response. Gender 
</p>
<p>discrimination might limit the ability of women to influence decision-making processes 
</p>
<p>and, as a result, exclude them from being beneficiaries of targeted pensions. In universal 
</p>
<p>schemes, men and women receive the same level of benefits irrespective of their years in 
</p>
<p>the formal labour market, thus recognizing the contributions women make in unpaid work 
</p>
<p>such as caregiving. In developing countries, universal pensions may be the only means by 
</p>
<p>which most women can guarantee income in old age.  
</p>
<p>43. Ensuring basic income security in old age is closely linked to programmes on the 
</p>
<p>right to the highest attainable standard of health by older persons.55 Expenses for health care 
</p>
<p>and medicines may account for as much as three quarters of the income of the poorest 
</p>
<p>groups.56 Under those circumstances, the positive impact of social protection guarantees on 
</p>
<p>older persons&#8217; standards of living can be nullified by the burden of health-care-related 
</p>
<p>costs.57 For that reason, there should be coordination between programmes aiming to ensure 
</p>
<p>basic income security and programmes aiming to ensure the right to health. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>44. The principle of non-discrimination in international human rights law obliges States 
</p>
<p>to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy all their rights on an equal basis with others, 
</p>
<p>including their rights to social security and an adequate standard of living. The Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States parties to ensure access of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities to social protection and poverty reduction programmes, and the right of 
</p>
<p>those living in poverty and their families to have access to assistance from the State with 
</p>
<p>disability-related expenses (art. 28).58 
</p>
<p>45. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has specified the content 
</p>
<p>of the right to social security regarding persons with disabilities. It has noted that States 
</p>
<p>should ensure adequate income support to persons with disabilities who, owing to disability 
</p>
<p>or disability-related factors, have lost or seen their income reduced or have been denied 
</p>
<p>employment opportunities.59 It noted that such income support should reflect the special 
</p>
<p>needs for assistance associated with disability and should also cover individuals, often 
</p>
<p>women, who undertake the care of persons with disabilities.<footnote name="60">Ibid., para. 28. </footnote>

<p>and Cultural Rights (art. 18) have specific clauses regarding the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p> 59 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 5 (1994) on persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, para. 28. 
</p>

<p>46. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has noted that 
</p>
<p>States parties must take special measures to ensure that women with disabilities have equal 
</p>
<p>access to health services and social security.61 Human rights bodies have further called on 
</p>
<p>States to undertake studies and research in order to identify the situation and specific 
</p>
<p>requirements in particular of women with disabilities, with a view to elaborating and 
</p>
<p>adopting social protection strategies to promote their autonomy and full participation in 
</p>
<p>society, and to combat violence against women.62 
</p>
<p>47. National social protection floors aiming at the inclusion and participation of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities could play a critical role in enabling States to comply with their obligations 
</p>
<p>regarding the rights of persons with disabilities. In 87 countries, non-contributory benefits 
</p>
<p>for persons with disabilities enable them to have a minimum level of income security.63 
</p>
<p><b> D. Informal workers 
</b></p>
<p>48. People working in the informal sector of the economy often lack social protection 
</p>
<p>and, as noted above, that affects women in particular. Traditionally, States have privileged 
</p>
<p>the establishment of contributory systems with the objective of achieving universal 
</p>
<p>coverage of the formal sector.  
</p>
<p>49. Human rights treaty bodies have called upon States parties to take effective 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure that informal workers are able to exercise their labour rights and their 
</p>
<p>right to social security without discrimination.64 Obligations to extend social security to 
</p>
<p>informal workers are in line with the objective of ILO Recommendation 202. Social 
</p>
<p>security systems and their components should be universal, based on social solidarity, 
</p>
<p>aiming at social inclusion, including persons in the informal economy.65 
</p>
<p><b> E. Non-nationals 
</b></p>
<p>50. Under international human rights law, States should progressively ensure all 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights including the right to social security, for all individuals 
</p>
<p>within their territories, providing specific protection for disadvantaged and vulnerable 
</p>
<p>individuals and groups.66 The International Convention on the Protection and Rights of All 
</p>
<p>Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families regulates the rights of migrant workers 
</p>
<p>and members of their families including the rights to social security (art. 27), health 
</p>
<p>(art. 28) and education (art. 30). Migrant workers also enjoy all the rights contained under 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 61  Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, general recommendation No. 18 
</p>
<p>(1991) on disabled women. 
</p>
<p> 62  See, for example, Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, concluding observations on 
</p>
<p>Tunisia, CRPD/C/TUN/CO/1, and Spain, CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1. 
</p>
<p> 63  ILO, <i>World Social Protection Report</i>, p. xxiii. 
</p>
<p> 64  See, e.g., Committee on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, concluding observations on 
</p>
<p>Paraguay, E/C.12/PRY/CO/3; Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p>concluding observations on Bosnia and Herzegovina, CEDAW/C/BIH/CO/4-5, and on Djibouti, 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/DJI/CO/1-3. The Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights explicitly 
</p>
<p>call on States to &#8220;take specific measures to ensure that persons living in poverty, in particular women 
</p>
<p>and those working in the informal economy, have access to social security benefits, including social 
</p>
<p>pensions, which are sufficient to ensure an adequate standard of living and access to health care for 
</p>
<p>them and their families&#8221; (principle 86 (c)). 
</p>
<p> 65  See ILO, <i>Social Security for All</i>, p. 4. 
</p>

<p>other human rights instruments. Those obligations extend to documented and 
</p>
<p>undocumented migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.67  
</p>
<p>51. Refugees and asylum seekers require protective measures.68 Additionally, States 
</p>
<p>parties to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, with few exceptions, must 
</p>
<p>accord refugees the same treatment as nationals with regard to social security guarantees 
</p>
<p>(art. 24). The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 14 (2000) on the right to health, has noted that States should ensure equal access for all 
</p>
<p>persons, including asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, to preventive, curative and 
</p>
<p>palliative health services (para. 34). 
</p>
<p>52. At the domestic level, there have been landmark decisions extending social security 
</p>
<p>guarantees to non-nationals. For example, the Constitutional Court of South Africa and the 
</p>
<p>Federal Constitutional Court of Germany have emphasized that the principle of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination applies to the enjoyment of the right to social security by migrants and 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers.69 In interpreting the European Social Charter, the European Committee of 
</p>
<p>Social Rights has consistently found national practices that exclude non-nationals &#8212; 
</p>
<p>particularly through residency and qualifying period requirements &#8212; to violate the rights to 
</p>
<p>social security and social assistance.70 
</p>
<p>53. ILO Recommendation 202 affirms that, subject to their existing international 
</p>
<p>obligations, States should provide the basic social security guarantees to at least all 
</p>
<p>residents and children (para. 6). The reference to &#8220;existing international obligations&#8221; is 
</p>
<p>critical as States parties to human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are obliged to extend the social 
</p>
<p>protection floor without distinction of any kind to everyone within the territory or under 
</p>
<p>their jurisdiction. Any differentiation in treatment between legally recognized residents and 
</p>
<p>others must comply with the principle of non-discrimination (e.g. art. 2, para. 2, of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). Hence, if a State seeks to 
</p>
<p>distinguish between legal residents and others in the enjoyment of the right to social 
</p>
<p>security, the differentiation must be reasonable, proportional, objective and with a 
</p>
<p>legitimate aim.71 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Social protection floors have great potential in facilitating the enjoyment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>several economic and social, including the rights to social security, health, food, 
</b></p>

<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). </p>


<p><b>housing, education and water, in accordance with the obligations of States under 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law. As described above, when used as a floor and not a 
</b></p>
<p><b>ceiling for protection, social protection floors can contribute significantly to gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality and the realization of minimum essential levels of the rights to social security, 
</b></p>
<p><b>food, health and education, especially for marginalized groups.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Human rights norms and social protection floors complement each other. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>success of national social protection floors in achieving gender equality, respect for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>minimum core of economic, social and cultural rights and protecting marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, such as children, older persons, persons with disabilities, informal workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>and non-nationals, will depend on whether they are established and implemented 
</b></p>
<p><b>according to human rights standards and principles. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Social Protection Floor Initiative offers relevant policy guidance to put in 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice several human rights obligations, including the realization of comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>social security systems. The Secretary-General therefore encourages States to consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>putting in place comprehensive social protection systems and social protection floors 
</b></p>
<p><b>that will contribute to the enjoyment and realization of human rights at national level.
