The financial information in this Form 6-K concerning TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively,
“TOTAL” or the “Group”) with respect to the second quarter of 2013 and six months ended June 30, 2013, has been
derived from TOTAL’s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2013 and six months
ended June 30, 2013. Following the application of revised accounting standard IAS 19 effective January 1, 2013, the
information for 2012 and 2011 in this exhibit has been restated; however, the impact on such restated results is not
significant (for further information concerning this restatement, see note 1 of the notes to the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements provided elsewhere in this Form 6-K).
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
and the related notes provided elsewhere in this Form 6-K and with the information, including the audited financial
statements and related notes, for the year ended December 31, 2012, in TOTAL’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the
year ended December 31, 2012, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 28, 2013.

***              Including acquisitions.
·                          Second quarter 2013 results
Ø             Sales
In the second quarter 2013, the Brent price averaged $102.4/b, a decrease of 5% compared to the second quarter
2012. The European refining margin indicator (“ERMI”) averaged $24/t, a decrease of 37% compared to the second
quarter 2012. The environment for petrochemicals was stable in Europe and improved slightly in the United States
compared to the same period last year.
The euro-dollar exchange rate averaged $1.31/€ in the second quarter 2013, compared to $1.28/€ in the second
quarter 2012.
In this environment, sales were €46,973 million in the second quarter 2013, a decrease of 4% compared to €49,135
million in the second quarter 2012.
Ø             Net income
Net income (Group share) in the second quarter 2013 increased by 67% to €2,537 million from €1,518 million in the
second quarter 2012, mainly due to the greater inventory valuation effect in the second quarter 2012 and the impact of
special items, as described hereafter. The after-tax inventory valuation effect (as defined below under “Analysis of
business segment results”) had a negative impact on net income (Group share) of €400 million in the second quarter
2013, primarily as a result of the decrease in the price of Brent during the period, and a negative impact of €959
million in the second quarter 2012. The changes in fair value of trading inventories and storage contracts (as defined
below under “Analysis of business segment results”) had a negative impact on net income (Group share) of €24
million in the second quarter 2013, compared to a positive impact of €9 million in the second quarter 2012. Special
items had a positive impact on net income (Group share) of €262 million in the second quarter 2013, comprised
1
essentially of gains relating to the sale of Upstream assets in Italy, compared to a negative impact of €323 million in
the second quarter 2012, comprised essentially of a provision indicated previously in TOTAL’s Annual Reports on
Form 20-F concerning an investigation by the SEC and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”). As further detailed in
TOTAL’s Form 6-K filed with the SEC on May 29, 2013, this investigation has been resolved following a settlement
with the SEC and DOJ.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, based on 2,274 million fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was €1.12 in the
second quarter 2013 compared to €0.67 in the second quarter 2012, an increase of 67%.
Ø             Investments — divestments(1)
Investments, excluding acquisitions and including changes in non-current loans, were €4.9 billion in the second
quarter 2013 compared to €4.4 billion in the second quarter 2012.
Acquisitions were €500 million in the second quarter 2013, comprised essentially of the acquisition of an additional
stake in Novatek, the carry agreement for the liquids-rich Utica gas field in the United States and bonus payments for
exploration permits. Acquisitions were €437 million in the second quarter 2012.
Asset sales in the second quarter 2013 were €1,061 million, including mainly the sale of an interest in the Tempa
Rossa field in Italy. Asset sales were €834 million in the second quarter 2012.
Net investments(2) were €4.4 billion in the second quarter 2013 compared to €4.0 billion in the second quarter 2012.
Ø             Cash flow
Cash flow from operations was €3,706 million in the second quarter 2013 compared to €6,167 million in the second
quarter 2012. This decrease was mainly due to changes in the working capital of the Upstream between the two
periods.
The Group’s net cash flow(3) was negative €672 million in the second quarter 2013 compared to positive €2,183 million
in the second quarter 2012. This decrease was mainly due to changes in the working capital of the Upstream between
the two periods.
·                          First half 2013 results
Ø             Sales
Compared to the first half 2012, the average Brent price decreased by 5% to $107.5/b in the first half 2013. The ERMI
averaged $25.5/t compared to $29.5/t in the first half 2012, a decrease of 14%. During the same period, however, the
petrochemicals environment on balance improved in Europe and the United States.
The euro-dollar exchange rate averaged $1.31/€ compared to $1.30/€ in the first half 2012.
In this environment, sales were €95,103 million in the first half 2013, a decrease of 5% compared to €100,303 million
in the first half 2012.
Ø             Net income
Net income (Group share) in the first half 2013 decreased by 21% to €4,074 million from €5,186 million in the first half
2012, mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices and to the impact of special items described hereafter. The after-tax
inventory valuation effect (as defined below under “Analysis of business segment results”) had a negative impact on
net income (Group share) of €451 million in the first half 2013, primarily as a result of the decrease in the price of
Brent during the period, and a negative impact of €369 million in the first half 2012. The changes in fair value of
trading inventories and storage contracts (as defined below under “Analysis of business segment results”) had a
negative impact on net income (Group share) of €23 million in the first half 2013 and a negative impact of €11 million
in the first half 2012. Special items had a negative impact on net income (Group share) of €1,014 million in the first
half 2013, mainly due to a loss on the sale of the Group’s interest in the Voyageur upgrader project in Canada, which
was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an Upstream asset in Italy. Special items had a negative impact on net
income (Group share) of €305 million in the first half 2012, including, essentially, the second quarter 2012 provision
described above in “Second quarter 2013 results — Net income”.

(2)                  Net investments = investments including acquisitions and changes in non-current loans - asset sales.
(3)                  Net cash flow = cash flow from operations - net investments.
2
Fully-diluted earnings per share, based on 2,272 million fully-diluted weighted-average shares, was €1.79 in the first
half 2013 compared to €2.29 in the first half 2012, a decrease of 22%.
Ø             Investments — divestments(4)
Investments, excluding acquisitions and including changes in non-current loans, were €9.8 billion in the first half 2013
compared to €8.3 billion in the first half 2012.
Acquisitions were €1.4 billion in the first half 2013, comprised mainly of the acquisition of an additional 6% interest in
the Ichthys project in Australia, an additional 0.7% stake in Novatek(5), the carry agreement for the liquids-rich Utica
gas project in the United States and bonus payments for exploration permits. Acquisitions were €2.3 billion in the first
half 2012.
Asset sales were €1.5 billion(6) in the first half 2013, comprised mainly of the sale of an interest in the Tempa Rossa
field in Italy and all of the Group’s 49% interest in the Voyageur upgrader project in Canada. Asset sales in the first
half 2012 were €2.3 billion.
Net investments were €9.7 billion in the first half 2013 compared to €8.2 billion in the first half 2012.
Ø             Cash flow
Cash flow from operations was €7,424 million in the first half 2013, a decrease of 35% compared to the first half 2012,
mainly due to an unfavorable change in working capital.
The Group’s net cash flow was negative €2,322 million in the first half 2013 compared to positive €3,200 million in the
first half 2012, reflecting essentially a reduced level of cash flow from operations (including changes in working
capital) and a higher level of net investments.
The net-debt-to-equity ratio was 27.6% on June 30, 2013, compared to 21.9% on June 30, 2012(7).
·                          Analysis of business segment results
In October 2011, the Group announced a proposed reorganization of its Downstream and Chemicals segments. The
procedure for informing and consulting with employee representatives took place and the reorganization became
effective on January 1, 2012. This led to organizational changes, with the creation of: a Refining & Chemicals
segment, a large industrial center that encompasses refining, petrochemicals, fertilizers and specialty chemicals
operations, as well as oil trading and shipping activities; and a Supply & Marketing segment (renamed the Marketing
& Services segment on November 13, 2012), which is dedicated to worldwide supply and marketing activities in the oil
products field. A further reorganization of the Group’s Upstream and Marketing & Services segments became
effective as of July 1, 2012, with the Upstream segment now consisting of the activities of Gas & Power in addition to
the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, and the Marketing & Services segment now consisting of the
activities of New Energies in addition to the Group’s worldwide businesses of supplying and marketing petroleum
products. Historical numbers contained herein have been restated on this basis.
The financial information for each business segment is reported on the same basis as that used internally by the chief
operating decision maker in assessing segment performance and the allocation of segment resources. Due to their
particular nature or significance, certain transactions qualified as “special items” are excluded from the business
segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent or unusual. However,
in certain instances, certain transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals, which are not considered to
be representative of the normal course of business, may be qualified as special items although they may have
occurred in prior years or are likely to recur in following years.
In accordance with IAS 2, the Group values inventories of petroleum products in the financial statements according to
the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method and other inventories using the weighted-average cost method. Under the FIFO
method, the cost of inventory is based on the historic cost of acquisition or manufacture rather than the current
replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on the reported income.
Accordingly, the adjusted results of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are presented
according to the replacement cost method in order to facilitate the comparability of the Group’s results with those of
its competitors and to help illustrate the operating performance of these segments excluding the impact of oil price
changes on the replacement of inventories. In the replacement cost method, which approximates the Last-In, First-
Out (LIFO) method, the variation of inventory values in the statement of income is, depending on the nature of the
inventory, determined
(4)                  Detail shown on page 12 of this exhibit.
(5)                  As of June 30, 2013, the Group owns 16% of the share capital of Novatek.
(6)                  This amount does not include the sale of an interest in block 14 in Angola, which was reported in the cash
flow statement of the first quarter 2013 as a transaction involving a non-controlling interest.

using either the month-end prices differential between one period and another or the average prices of the period. The
inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results under the FIFO and replacement cost methods.
As from January 1, 2011, the effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects, for trading
inventories and storage contracts, differences between internal measures of performance used by TOTAL’s
management and the accounting for these transactions under IFRS. IFRS requires that trading inventories be
recorded at their fair value using period-end spot prices. In order to best reflect the management of economic
exposure through derivative transactions, internal indicators used to measure performance include valuations of
trading inventories recorded at their fair value based on forward prices. Furthermore, TOTAL, in its trading activities,
enters into storage contracts, the future effects of which are recorded at fair value in the Group’s internal economic
performance. IFRS, by requiring accounting for storage contracts on an accrual basis, precludes recognition of this
fair value effect.
The adjusted business segment results (adjusted operating income and adjusted net operating income) are defined as
replacement cost results, adjusted for special items, excluding (as from January 1, 2011) the effect of changes in fair
value. For further information on the adjustments affecting operating income on a segment-by-segment basis, and for
a reconciliation of segment figures to figures reported in TOTAL’s consolidated interim financial statements, see
pages 23-29 and 31-33 of this exhibit.
The Group measures performance at the segment level on the basis of net operating income and adjusted net
operating income. Net operating income comprises operating income of the relevant segment after deducting the
amortization and the depreciation of intangible assets other than leasehold rights, translation adjustments and gains or
losses on the sale of assets, as well as all other income and expenses related to capital employed (dividends from
non-consolidated companies, income from equity affiliates and capitalized interest expenses) and after income taxes
applicable to the above. The income and expenses not included in net operating income that are included in net
income are interest expenses related to long-term liabilities net of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, after
applicable income taxes (net cost of net debt and non-controlling interests). Adjusted net operating income excludes
the effect of the adjustments (special items and the inventory valuation effect) described above.

Hydrocarbon production was 2,290 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboe/d) in the second quarter 2013, an
increase of 1% compared to the second quarter 2012, essentially as a result of:
·             +2% for growth from new projects;
·             -3% for normal decline and scheduled maintenance;
·             +2% for the restart of production from Elgin/Franklin in the UK North Sea and from Ibewa in Nigeria; and
·             overall, increased production relating to the improvement of security conditions in Yemen was offset by
increased theft and acts of sabotage in Nigeria this quarter.
In the first half 2013, hydrocarbon production was 2,306 kboe/d, stable compared to the first half 2012, essentially as
a result of:
·             +3% for growth from new projects;
·             -2% for normal decline and scheduled maintenance;
·             -1% for incidents in 2012 in the UK North Sea and in Nigeria; and
·             overall, increased production relating to the improvement of security conditions in Yemen was offset by
increased theft and acts of sabotage in Nigeria during the first half of 2013.

*              Detail of adjustment items shown on pages 23-29 and 31-33 of this exhibit.
Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment was €2,325 million in the second quarter 2013 compared
to €2,505 million in the second quarter 2012, a decrease of 7% explained principally by the change in hydrocarbon
prices between the two periods.
Adjusted net operating income for the Upstream segment excludes special items. The exclusion of special items had
a negative impact of €304 million on the Upstream segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter
2013, consisting essentially of capital gains on the sale of an interest in the Tempa Rossa field in Italy, and a
negative impact of €2 million in the second quarter 2012.
The effective tax rate for the Upstream segment was 58.3% in the second quarter 2013, basically identical to that in
the second quarter 2012.
Adjusted net operating income from the Upstream segment in the first half 2013 was €4,791 million compared to
€5,562 million in the first half 2012, a decrease of 14% explained principally by a decrease in average hydrocarbon
prices and an increase in technical costs between the two periods.
The return on average capital employed (ROACE(8)) for the Upstream segment was 16% for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2013, compared to 17% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013, and 18% for the full year 2012.
(8)                  Calculated based on adjusted net operating income and average capital employed, using replacement

**         Based on distillation capacity at the beginning of the year.
In the second quarter 2013, refinery throughput decreased by 6% compared to the second quarter 2012. The decrease
was mainly due to scheduled turnaround at Antwerp and maintenance at Donges this quarter, as well as the closure of
the Rome refinery at the end of the third quarter 2012.
In the first half 2013, refinery throughput decreased by 5% compared to the first half 2012, reflecting essentially
scheduled turnarounds at the Antwerp and Normandy platforms in 2013, increased maintenance at Donges, as well as
the closure of the Rome refinery at the end of the third quarter 2012

The ERMI averaged $24.1/t in the second quarter 2013, a decrease of 37% compared to the average of the second
quarter 2012.  Petrochemical margins were on balance stable in Europe and continued to improve in the United States
compared to the same period last year.
Adjusted net operating income from the Refining & Chemicals segment was €370 million in the second quarter 2013
compared to €378 million in the second quarter 2012. A more favorable petrochemicals environment in the United
States and the initial benefits of the efficiencies and synergies program compensated for lower utilization rates and
less favorable refining margins.
Adjusted net operating income for the Refining & Chemicals segment excludes any after-tax inventory valuation effect
and special items. The exclusion of the inventory valuation effect had a positive impact of €351 million on the
Refining & Chemicals segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2013 and a positive impact of
€877 million in the second quarter 2012. The exclusion of special items had a positive impact of €66 million on the
Refining & Chemicals segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2013 and no impact in the
second quarter 2012.
6
Adjusted net operating income from the Refining & Chemicals segment in the first half 2013 was €753 million, an
increase of 70% compared to the first half 2012, even while refining margins were declining. This increase was mainly
due to an improved petrochemicals environment and the initial benefits of the efficiencies and synergies program.
The ROACE for the Refining & Chemicals segment was 11% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013, compared
to 10% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013, and 9% for the full year 2012.

In the second quarter 2013, sales volumes increased by 6% compared to the second quarter 2012. This increase was
driven by sales outside Europe, particularly sales in the Americas, Africa and Asia.
Sales volumes for the first half 2013 increased by 2% compared to first half 2012, mainly due to growth outside
Europe, particularly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Sales volumes in Europe declined by 5%, notably due to lower
sales volumes in Italy in connection with the closure of the Rome refinery.

The Marketing & Services segment’s sales were €20.6 billion in the second quarter 2013, a decline of 4% compared
to the second quarter 2012.
Adjusted net operating income from the Marketing & Services segment was €330 million in the second quarter 2013,
an increase of 86% compared to the second quarter 2012, mainly due to increased sales volumes of refined products
and an improved contribution from New Energies.
Adjusted net operating income for the Marketing & Services segment excludes any after-tax inventory valuation effect
and special items. The exclusion of the inventory valuation effect had a positive impact of €55 million on the
Marketing & Services segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2013 and a positive impact of
€99 million in the second quarter 2012. The exclusion of special items had no impact on the Marketing & Services
segment’s adjusted net operating income in the second quarter 2013 and a positive impact of €56 million in the
second quarter 2012.
Adjusted net operating income from the Marketing & Services segment was €595 million in the first half 2013, an
increase of 87% compared to the first half 2012. This increase was mainly due to an improved contribution from New
Energies (which was negative in first half 2012) and an overall improvement in the Marketing division, particularly in
emerging markets.

·                          Summary and outlook
As approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2013, TOTAL will pay a first quarter 2013 interim dividend of
€0.59/share on September 27, 2013(9).
The second half of 2013 will be highlighted by TOTAL’s progress on executing its major projects. In the Upstream,
following the recent start-up of Angola LNG, the Group should see first oil from the giant Kashagan project in
Kazakhstan, as well as benefit from gas and liquids production from the extension of OML 58 in Nigeria. In addition,
following the launch of two new deep offshore projects in 2013, Moho Nord in Congo and Egina in Nigeria, the Group is
studying the launch of two additional major projects before year-end: the long-plateau projects of Yamal LNG in
Russia, and the Fort Hills mining project in Canada.
In the Downstream, the commissioning of the Satorp platform in Jubail should be completed by year-end. Together
with its partner Saudi Aramco, TOTAL should have one of the most modern and competitive refining and
petrochemicals platforms in the world.
At the same time, the Group continues to optimize its portfolio through its asset sale program with, notably, the
pending closings of the sale of TIGF in France and the sale of block OML 138 in Nigeria. Based on agreements
signed and in negotiation, the Group is confident in its ability to achieve its target of $15-20 billion in asset sales
during 2012-14.
At the end of September, the Group will present its strategy and outlook at its annual Investors Day, a part of which
will be dedicated to CSR topics.

·                 the quality of future opportunities that may be presented to or pursued by TOTAL;
·                 the ability to generate cash flow or obtain financing to fund growth and the cost of such financing and
liquidity conditions in the capital markets generally;
·                 the ability to obtain governmental or regulatory approvals;
·                 the ability to respond to challenges in international markets, including political or economic conditions,
including international armed conflict, and trade and regulatory matters;
·                 the ability to complete and integrate appropriate acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures;

rights or impose minimum drilling obligations, price controls, nationalization or expropriation, and regulation of refining
and marketing, chemicals and power generating activities;
·                 the possibility that other unpredictable events such as labor disputes or industrial accidents will adversely
affect the business of TOTAL; and
·                 the risk that TOTAL will inadequately hedge the price of crude oil or finished products.

*                        European Refining Margin Indicator (ERMI) is an indicator intended to represent the margin after variable
costs for a hypothetical complex refinery located around Rotterdam in Northern Europe that processes a mix of crude
oil and other inputs commonly supplied to this region to produce and market the main refined products at prevailing
prices in this region. The indicator margin may not be representative of the actual margins achieved by the Group in
any period because of the Group’s particular refinery configurations, product mix effects or other company-specific
operating conditions.
**                    1 $/t = 0.136 $/b.
***                Consolidated subsidiaries, excluding fixed margin contracts.

TOTAL
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2013
(unaudited)
1)             Accounting policies
The interim consolidated financial statements of TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiaries (the Group) as of June 30, 2013 are
presented in Euros and have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”. The accounting policies applied for the consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2013 do
not differ significantly from those applied for the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2012 which
have been prepared on the basis of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted by the European
Union and IFRS as issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standard Board), with the exception of those texts
or amendments that must be applied for periods beginning the January 1st 2013 described in note 1X of the Notes to
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012:
·                 The revised standard IAS 19 “Employee benefits” applicable retrospectively from January 1st, 2013, led in
particular to the full recognition of the net position in respect of employee benefits obligations (liabilities net of assets)
in the balance sheet, to the elimination of the corridor approach previously used by the Group, the elimination of the
depreciation of past services costs, and to the obligation to evaluate the expected return on plan assets on a
normative basis (via the discount rate used to value the debt).
The application of this standard had an impact on January 1st, 2013 and as of June 30, 2012 (the first comparative
period presented) of an increase in employee benefit provisions of €2.8 billion and €2.3 billion respectively, and a
decrease in equity of €2.8 billion and €2.3 billion before tax (€1.7 billion and €1.4 billion after tax). The impact on the
profit for 2012 is not significant. In accordance with the transitional rules of IAS 19 revised, the comparative periods
were restated to take into account the retrospective application of the standard.
·                 Application of standards on consolidation: IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements”, IFRS 11 “Joint
arrangements”, IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities”, IAS 27 revised “Separate financial statements” and
IAS 28 revised “Investments in associates and joint ventures”. The application of these standards did not have a
material effect on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet, income statement and shareholder’s equity as of June 30,
2013.
·                 The application of standards IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” and IAS 1 revised “Presentation of financial
statements” did not have a material effect on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet, statement of income and
shareholder’s equity as of June 30, 2013.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the executive management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date
of preparation of the financial statements and reported income and expenses for the period. The executive
management reviews these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, by reference to past experience and
various other factors considered as reasonable which form the basis for assessing the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, if different assumptions or circumstances
apply. These judgments and estimates relate principally to the application of the successful efforts method for the oil
and gas accounting, the valuation of long-lived assets, the provisions for asset retirement obligations and
environmental remediation, the pensions and post-retirement benefits and the income tax computation. These
estimates and assumptions are described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31,
2012.
Furthermore, when the accounting treatment of a specific transaction is not addressed by any accounting standard or
interpretation, the executive management applies its judgment to define and apply accounting policies that will lead to
relevant and reliable information, so that the financial statements:
·                       give a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows;
·                       reflect the substance of transactions;
·                       are neutral;
·                       are prepared on a prudent basis; and
·                       are complete in all material aspects.
30
Pursuant to the accrual basis of accounting followed by the Group, the financial statements reflect the effects of
transactions and other events when they occur. Assets and liabilities such as property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets are usually measured at cost. Financial assets and liabilities are usually measured at fair value.
2)             Changes in the Group structure, main acquisitions and divestments
Ø         Upstream
·                  TOTAL finalized in February 2013 the acquisition of an additional 6% interest in the Ichthys liquefied natural
gas (LNG) project from its partner INPEX. TOTAL’s overall equity stake in the Ichthys LNG project will increase from
24% to 30%.
·                  TOTAL finalized in February 2013 the sale to INPEX of a 9.99% indirect interest in offshore Angola Block
14.
·                  On March 27, 2013, TOTAL entered into an agreement for the sale to Suncor Energy Inc. of its 49% interest
in the Voyageur upgrader project, which is located in the Canadian province of Alberta and intended to upgrade
bitumen from the Fort Hills and Joslyn mines. The transaction amounted to US$506 million (€385 million). The mining
development projects of Fort Hills and Joslyn continue according to the production evacuation logistics studies jointly
conducted with Suncor. The sale entails a net loss of €1,247 million.
·                  TOTAL finalized in June 2013 the sale of a 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa field in Italy to a subsidiary of
Mitsui.
Ø         Refining & Chemicals
·                  TOTAL finalized in June 2013 the sale of its fertilizing businesses in Europe.
3)             Adjustment items
Financial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows
internal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of TOTAL and which is reviewed
by the main operational decision-making body of the Group, namely the Executive committee.
Performance indicators excluding the adjustment items, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating
income, and adjusted net income are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance and the comparison
of income between periods.
Adjustment items include:
(i) Special items
Due to their unusual nature or particular significance, certain transactions qualified as “special items” are excluded
from the business segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent or
unusual. However, in certain instances, transactions such as restructuring costs or asset disposals, which are not
considered to be representative of the normal course of business, may be qualified as special items although they
may have occurred within prior years or are likely to occur again within the coming years.
(ii) Inventory valuation effect
The adjusted results of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are presented according to the
replacement cost method. This method is used to assess the segments’ performance and facilitate the comparability
of the segments’ performance with those of its competitors.
In the replacement cost method, which approximates the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) method, the variation of inventory
values in the statement of income is, depending on the nature of the inventory, determined using either the month-end
prices differential between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value.
The inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results according to the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and the
replacement cost.
31
(iii) Effect of changes in fair value
The effect of changes in fair value presented as adjustment item reflects for some transactions differences between
internal measure of performance used by TOTAL’s management and the accounting for these transactions under
IFRS.
IFRS requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period-end spot prices. In order to best
reflect the management of economic exposure through derivative transactions, internal indicators used to measure
performance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices.
Furthermore, TOTAL, in its trading activities, enters into storage contracts, which future effects are recorded at fair
value in Group’s internal economic performance. IFRS precludes recognition of this fair value effect.
The adjusted results (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net income) are defined as
replacement cost results, adjusted for special items and the effect of changes in fair value.
The detail of the adjustment items is presented in the table below.

–            Bond 2.500% 2013-2018 (600 million NOK)
The Group reimbursed bonds during the first six months of 2013:
–            Bond 4.125% 2007-2013 (600 million EUR)
–            Bond 5.500% 2007-2013 (350 million GBP)

–            Bond 4.000% 2008-2013 (400 million USD)
In the context of its active cash management, the Group may temporarily increase its current borrowings, particularly
in the form of commercial paper. The changes in current borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and current financial
assets resulting from this cash management in the quarterly financial statements are not necessarily representative of
a longer-term position.
6)             Related parties
The related parties are principally equity affiliates and non-consolidated investments. There were no major changes
concerning transactions with related parties during the first six months of 2013.
35
7)                   Other risks and contingent liabilities
TOTAL is not currently aware of any exceptional event, dispute, risks or contingent liabilities that could have a
material impact on the assets and liabilities, results, financial position or operations of the Group.
Antitrust investigations
The principal antitrust proceedings in which the Group’s companies are involved are described thereafter.
Refining & Chemicals segment
As part of the spin-off of Arkema(1) in 2006, TOTAL S.A. or certain other Group companies agreed to grant Arkema a
guarantee for potential monetary consequences related to antitrust proceedings arising from events prior to the spin-
off.
This guarantee covers, for a period of ten years from the date of the spin-off, 90% of amounts paid by Arkema related
to (i) fines imposed by European authorities or European member-states for competition law violations, (ii) fines
imposed by U.S. courts or antitrust authorities for federal antitrust violations or violations of the competition laws of
U.S. states, (iii) damages awarded in civil proceedings related to the government proceedings mentioned above, and
(iv) certain costs related to these proceedings. The guarantee related to anti-competition violations in Europe applies
to amounts above a €176.5 million threshold. On the other hand, the agreements provide that Arkema will indemnify
TOTAL S.A. or any Group company for 10% of any amount that TOTAL S.A. or any Group company are required to
pay under any of the proceedings covered by this guarantee, in Europe.
If one or more individuals or legal entities, acting alone or together, directly or indirectly holds more than one-third of
the voting rights of Arkema, or if Arkema transfers more than 50% of its assets (as calculated under the enterprise
valuation method, as of the date of the transfer) to a third party or parties acting together, irrespective of the type or
number of transfers, this guarantee will become void.
–            In the United States, civil liability lawsuits, for which TOTAL S.A. has been named as the parent company, are
closed without significant impact on the Group’s financial position.
–            In Europe, since 2006, the European Commission has fined companies of the Group in its configuration prior
to the spin-off following five investigations launched by the European Commission between 2000 and 2004, four of
which are closed, the fifth is on hold pending a decision following the appeal of Arkema and the concerned companies
of the Group.
In financial terms, the fines imposed by the European Commission following the five investigations reach an overall
amount of €385.47 million, entirely settled as of today. As a result, once the threshold provided for by the guarantee is
deducted, the overall amount assumed and paid by the Group since the spin-off in accordance with the guarantee
amounted to €188.07 million(2), to which an amount of €31.31 million of interest has been added. These amounts were
not modified during the first half of 2013 financial year.
–            In addition, civil proceedings against Arkema and other groups of companies were initiated in 2009 and 2011,
respectively, before German and Dutch courts by third parties for alleged damages pursuant to two of the above
mentioned legal proceedings. TOTAL S.A. was summoned to serve notice of the dispute before the German court.
These procedures were settled between the claimants and Arkema in early July 2013.
Arkema began implementing compliance procedures in 2001 that are designed to prevent its employees from violating
antitrust provisions. However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the relevant authorities could commence
additional proceedings involving Arkema regarding events prior to the spin-off, as well as Elf Aquitaine and/or TOTAL
S.A. based on their status as parent company.
Within the framework of all of the legal proceedings described above, a €17 million reserve remains booked in the
Group’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2013.
Marketing & Services segment
–            Pursuant to a statement of objections received by Total Nederland N.V. and TOTAL S.A. (based on its status
as parent company) from the European Commission, Total Nederland N.V. was fined €20.25 million in 2006, for which
TOTAL S.A. was held jointly liable for €13.5 million. TOTAL S.A. lodged an appeal against this decision that was
dismissed at the end of September 2012. The fine and interest were paid during the first quarter of 2013.
(1)  Arkema is used in this section to designate those companies of the Arkema group whose ultimate parent company
is Arkema S.A. Arkema became an independent company after being spun-off from TOTAL S.A. in May 2006.
(2)  This amount does not take into account a case that led to Arkema, prior to Arkema’s spin-off from TOTAL, and Elf
Aquitaine being fined jointly €45 million and Arkema being fined €13.5 million.
36
–            In addition, pursuant to a statement of objections received by Total Raffinage Marketing (formerly Total
France) and TOTAL S.A. from the European Commission regarding a product line of the Marketing & Services
segment, Total Raffinage Marketing was fined €128.2 million in 2008, which has been paid, and for which TOTAL S.A.
was held jointly liable based on its status as parent company. The appeal against this decision lodged by the Group is
still pending before the relevant European court.
–            In addition, the civil proceedings against TOTAL S.A., Total Raffinage Marketing and other companies initiated
before UK and Dutch courts by third parties for alleged damages in connection with the prosecutions brought by the
European Commission are ongoing. At this point, the probability to have a favorable verdict and the financial impacts
of these procedures remain uncertain due to the number of legal difficulties they gave rise to, the lack of documented
claims and evaluations of the alleged damages.
Within the framework of the legal proceedings described above, a €6 million reserve remains booked in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2013.
In early 2013, a civil proceeding was initiated against TOTAL S.A. and its subsidiary Total Aviazione Italia Srl before
the competent Italian civil courts. The plaintiff claims against TOTAL S.A., its subsidiary and other third parties,
damages that it estimates to be nearly €908 million. This procedure initiated by the plaintiff follows practices that had
been sanctioned by the Italian competition authority in 2006. Given the multiple defendants engaged in these
proceedings and the disproportionate nature of the alleged damages in view of the justifications provided, this
proceeding is not expected to have a material effect on the Group’s financial situation, even if it is not possible at this
stage to precisely determine the financial impact of the demand on the Group.
Whatever the evolution of the proceedings described above, the Group believes that their outcome should not have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial situation or consolidated results.
Grande Paroisse
An explosion occurred at the Grande Paroisse industrial site in the city of Toulouse in France on September 21, 2001.
Grande Paroisse, a former subsidiary of Atofina which became a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine Fertilisants on
December 31, 2004, as part of the reorganization of the Chemicals segment, was principally engaged in the
production and sale of agricultural fertilizers. The explosion, which involved a stockpile of ammonium nitrate pellets,
destroyed a portion of the site and caused the death of thirty-one people, including twenty-one workers at the site, and
injured many others. The explosion also caused significant damage to certain property in part of the city of Toulouse.
This plant has been closed and individual assistance packages have been provided for employees. The site has been
rehabilitated.
On December 14, 2006, Grande Paroisse signed, under the supervision of the city of Toulouse, the deed whereby it
donated the former site of the AZF plant to the greater agglomeration of Toulouse (CAGT) and the Caisse des dépôts
et consignations and its subsidiary ICADE. Under this deed, TOTAL S.A. guaranteed the site remediation obligations
of Grande Paroisse and granted a €10 million endowment to the InNaBioSanté research foundation as part of the
setting up of a cancer research center at the site by the city of Toulouse.
After having articulated several hypotheses, the Court-appointed experts did not maintain in their final report filed on
May 11, 2006, that the accident was caused by pouring a large quantity of a chlorine compound over ammonium
nitrate. Instead, the experts have retained a scenario where a container of chlorine compound sweepings was poured
between a layer of wet ammonium nitrate covering the floor and a quantity of dry agricultural nitrate at a location not
far from the principal storage site. This is claimed to have caused an explosion which then spread into the main
storage site. Grande Paroisse was investigated based on this new hypothesis in 2006; Grande Paroisse is contesting
this explanation, which it believes to be based on elements that are not factually accurate.
On July 9, 2007, the investigating magistrate brought charges against Grande Paroisse and the former Plant Manager
before the criminal chamber of the Court of Appeal of Toulouse. In late 2008, TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest
were summoned to appear in Court pursuant to a request by a victims association.
On November 19, 2009, the Toulouse Criminal Court acquitted both the former Plant Manager, and Grande Paroisse
due to the lack of reliable evidence for the explosion. The Court also ruled that the summonses against TOTAL S.A.
and Mr. Thierry Desmarest, Chairman and CEO at the time of the disaster were inadmissible.
Due to the presumption of civil liability that applied to Grande Paroisse, the Court declared Grande Paroisse civilly
liable for the damages caused by the explosion to the victims in its capacity as custodian and operator of the plant.
The Prosecutor’s office, together with certain third parties, has appealed the Toulouse Criminal Court verdict. In order
to preserve its rights, Grande Paroisse lodged a cross-appeal with respect to civil charges.
By its decision of September 24, 2012, the Court of Appeal of Toulouse (Cour d’appel de Toulouse) upheld the lower
court verdict pursuant to which the summonses against TOTAL S.A. and Mr. Thierry Desmarest were determined to
37
be inadmissible. This element of the decision has been appealed by certain third parties before the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation).
The Court of Appeal considered, however, that the explosion was the result of the chemical accident described by the
court-appointed experts. Accordingly, it convicted the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse. This element of the
decision has been appealed by the former Plant Manager and Grande Paroisse before the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has the effect of suspending their criminal sentences.
A compensation mechanism for victims was set up immediately following the explosion. €2.3 billion was paid for the
compensation of claims and related expenses amounts. A €15.6 million reserve remains booked in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2013.
Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee — Russian regions and Interneft
Blue Rapid, a Panamanian company, and the Russian Olympic Committee filed a claim for damages with the Paris
Commercial Court against Elf Aquitaine, alleging a so-called non-completion by a former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine of
a contract related to an exploration and production project in Russia negotiated in the early 1990s. Elf Aquitaine
believed this claim to be unfounded and opposed it. On January 12, 2009, the Commercial Court of Paris rejected
Blue Rapid’s claim against Elf Aquitaine and found that the Russian Olympic Committee did not have standing in the
matter. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee appealed this decision. On June 30, 2011, the Court of
Appeal of Paris dismissed as inadmissible the claim of Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee against
Elf Aquitaine, notably on the grounds of the contract having lapsed. Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic Committee
appealed this decision to the French Supreme Court.
In connection with the same facts, and fifteen years after the termination of the exploration and production contract, a
Russian company, which was held not to be the contracting party to the contract, and two regions of the Russian
Federation that were not even parties to the contract, launched an arbitration procedure against the aforementioned
former subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine that was liquidated in 2005, claiming alleged damages of U.S.$ 22.4 billion. For the
same reasons as those successfully adjudicated by Elf Aquitaine against Blue Rapid and the Russian Olympic
Committee, the Group considers this claim to be unfounded as a matter of law and fact. The Group has lodged a
criminal complaint to denounce the fraudulent claim of which the Group believes it is a victim and, has taken and
reserved its rights to take other actions and measures to defend its interests.
Iran
In 2003, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed by the Department of Justice (DoJ)
issued a formal order directing an investigation in connection with the pursuit of business in Iran by certain oil
companies including, among others, TOTAL.
The inquiry concerned an agreement concluded by the Company with consultants concerning gas fields in Iran and
aimed to verify whether certain payments made under this agreement would have benefited Iranian officials in
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Company’s accounting obligations.
In late May 2013, and after years of discussions, TOTAL reached settlements with the U.S. authorities (a Deferred
Prosecution Agreement with the DoJ and a Cease and Desist Order with the SEC). These settlements, which put an
end to these investigations, were concluded without admission of guilt and in exchange for TOTAL respecting a
number of obligations, including the payment of a fine ($245.2 million) and a civil compensation ($153 million) that
occurred during the second quarter of 2013. The reserve of $398.2 million that was booked in the financial statements
as of June 30, 2012, has been fully released. By virtue of these settlements, TOTAL also accepted to appoint a
French independent compliance monitor to review the Group’s compliance program and to recommend possible
improvements.
With respect to the same facts, TOTAL and its Chief Executive Officer, who was President of the Middle East at the
time of the facts, were placed under formal investigation in France following a judicial inquiry initiated in 2006. In late
May 2013, the Prosecutor’s office recommended that the case be sent to trial. The investigating magistrate has not
yet issued his decision.
At this point, the Company considers that the resolution of these cases is not expected to have a significant impact
on the Group’s financial situation or consequences on its future planned operations.
38
Libya
In June 2011, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued to certain oil companies -
including, among others, TOTAL - a formal request for information related to their operations in Libya. In April 2013,
the SEC notified TOTAL of the closure of the investigation while stating that it does not intend to take further action
as far as TOTAL is concerned.
Oil-for-Food Program
Several countries have launched investigations concerning possible violations related to the United Nations (UN) Oil-
for-Food Program in Iraq.
Pursuant to a French criminal investigation, certain current or former Group Employees were placed under formal
criminal investigation for possible charges as accessories to the misappropriation of Corporate assets and as
accessories to the corruption of foreign public agents. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
formerly President of the Group’s Exploration & Production division, was also placed under formal investigation in
October 2006. In 2007, the criminal investigation was closed and the case was transferred to the Prosecutor’s office.
In 2009, the Prosecutor’s office recommended to the investigating magistrate that the case against the Group’s
current and former employees and TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer not be pursued.
In early 2010, despite the recommendation of the Prosecutor’s office, a new investigating magistrate, having taken
over the case, decided to indict TOTAL S.A. on bribery charges as well as complicity and influence peddling. The
indictment was brought eight years after the beginning of the investigation without any new evidence being introduced.
In October 2010, the Prosecutor’s office recommended to the investigating magistrate that the case against TOTAL
S.A., the Group’s former employees and TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer not be pursued. However, by
ordinance notified in early August 2011, the investigating magistrate on the matter decided to send the case to trial.
On July 8, 2013, TOTAL S.A., the Group’s former employees and TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
were cleared of all charges by the Criminal Court, which found that none of the offenses for which they had been
prosecuted were established. On July 18, 2013, the Prosecutor’s office appealed the parts of the Criminal Court’s
decision acquitting TOTAL S.A. and certain of the Group’s former employees. TOTAL’s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer’s acquittal issued on July 8, 2013 is irrevocable since the Prosecutor’s office did not appeal such
part of the Criminal Court’s decision.
Italy
As part of an investigation led by the Prosecutor of the Republic of the Potenza Court, Total Italia and certain Group
employees were the subject of an investigation related to certain calls for tenders that Total Italia made for the
preparation and development of an oil field. On February 16, 2009, as a preliminary measure before the proceedings
went before the Court, the preliminary investigation judge of Potenza served notice to Total Italia of a decision that
would have suspended the concession for this field for one year. Total Italia appealed the decision by the preliminary
investigation judge before the Court of Appeal of Potenza. In a decision dated April 8, 2009, the Court reversed the
suspension of the concession and appointed for one year, i.e. until February 16, 2010, a judicial administrator to
supervise the operations related to the development of the concession, allowing the Tempa Rossa project to continue.
The criminal investigation was closed in the first half of 2010. In May 2012, the Judge of the preliminary hearing
decided to dismiss the charges for some of the Group’s employees and refer the case for trial on a reduced number of
charges. The trial started on September 26, 2012.
In 2010, Total Italia’s exploration and production operations were transferred to Total E&P Italia and refining and
marketing operations were merged with those of Erg Petroli.
Rivunion
On July 9, 2012, the Swiss Tribunal Fédéral (Switzerland’s Supreme Court) rendered its decision against Rivunion, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, confirming a tax reassessment in the amount of CHF 171 million (excluding
interest for late payment, yet to be calculated by the competent authorities). According to the Tribunal, Rivunion was
held liable as tax collector of withholding taxes owed by the beneficiaries of taxable services. Rivunion, in liquidation
since March 13, 2002 and unable to recover the amounts corresponding to the withholding taxes in restitution from
said beneficiaries in order to meet its fiscal obligations, has been subject to insolvency proceedings since
November 1, 2012.

Nigeria
In the second quarter 2013, TOTAL’s equity production in Nigeria was impacted by repeated oil theft and sabotage on
oil and gas pipelines used to transport amongst others the Group’s production. Despite the completion of multiple
repairs, production remained impacted at the end of June 2013, mainly from the onshore acreage of the joint venture
in which TOTAL holds a 10% interest that is operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).
The Group estimates the impact on its Nigerian equity production to be about 35 kboe/d during second quarter 2013.
