<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
</p>
<p>accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-
</p>
<p>second session from 4 to 15 May 2015. The review of Malawi was held at the 3rd meeting, 
</p>
<p>on 5 May 2015. The delegation of Malawi was headed by Honourable S. B. Tembenu. At 
</p>
<p>its 10th meeting, held on 8 May 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Malawi. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Malawi: Albania, Kazakhstan and Kenya. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Malawi: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MWI/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/22/MWI/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/22/MWI/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Kenya, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Norway, 
</p>
<p>Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
</p>
<p>transmitted to Malawi through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
</p>
<p>the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that Malawi had undergone two peaceful political transition 
</p>
<p>processes. In April 2012, following the death of the country&#8217;s third President, the Vice-
</p>
<p>President assumed the presidency. In May 2014, the first-ever tripartite elections were held, 
</p>
<p>electing a fifth post-independence President, members of Parliament and local government 
</p>
<p>councillors.  
</p>
<p>6. The general framework for human rights was guided by the Constitution, which also 
</p>
<p>provided the institutional and enforcement framework, as well as limitations and 
</p>
<p>restrictions and instances where derogation from rights was permissible. The Constitution 
</p>
<p>also provided for principles of national policy and contained a bill of rights, which  
</p>
<p>harmonized the domestic obligations of Malawi with the international human rights 
</p>
<p>framework.  
</p>
<p>7. Several institutions, such as the Ministry of Justice, the Human Rights Commission, 
</p>
<p>the Law Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Prison Inspectorate, played 
</p>
<p>significant roles in protecting human rights. The Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission led the process of drafting a national human rights action plan, with support 
</p>
<p>from the United Nations Development Programme. There were 105 human rights civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations that complement government efforts on issues of human rights and 
</p>
<p>democratic governance.  </p>


<p>8. Malawi had endeavoured to clear the backlog of State party reports. In 2012, it 
</p>
<p>submitted its initial report to the Human Rights Committee. In 2013, it submitted the initial 
</p>
<p>report to the African Commission on the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights 
</p>
<p>and its Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa. In 2014, it submitted the report on the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. In 2015, it 
</p>
<p>submitted its combined third, fourth and fifth periodic reports on the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, its initial report on the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and 
</p>
<p>the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, 
</p>
<p>child prostitution and child pornography, as well as its initial report to the African Union on 
</p>
<p>the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Preparation of reports was 
</p>
<p>ongoing in respect of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>9. Recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food following 
</p>
<p>his visit in July 2013, were being considered by the Government for implementation.  
</p>
<p>10. In 2012, the Disability Act was passed, providing for equal opportunities for persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities and the establishment of a disability trust fund. However, the fund had not 
</p>
<p>yet been established. Following a situational analysis of children with disabilities in 2011, a 
</p>
<p>national workplan on programmes for children with disabilities had been drawn up to 
</p>
<p>strengthen coordination in developing and implementing programmes that promoted the 
</p>
<p>rights of all children with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>11. Several steps had been taken to ensure that persons in detention were kept in 
</p>
<p>humane and decent living conditions. Electric cooking pots had been procured for all 
</p>
<p>prisons to ensure that inmates had access to their daily portions of cooked food. Human 
</p>
<p>rights had been mainstreamed in the Malawi Prisons Service as a necessary measure to 
</p>
<p>prohibit torture. Also, human rights education had been included in the basic training 
</p>
<p>curriculum for prison staff. Social welfare officers had been appointed in all prisons. 
</p>
<p>Human rights open days had been held in prisons during which awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>programmes have been held for prisoners. Parole regulations had been formulated as a 
</p>
<p>measure to reduce prison overcrowding. A register of prisoners had been developed to track 
</p>
<p>prisoners&#8217; overstay.  
</p>
<p>12. Police officers had been trained to refrain from perpetrating torture and to ensure 
</p>
<p>that the rights of suspects were respected. A professional standards unit had investigated all 
</p>
<p>cases of torture, while efforts to establish the Police Complaints Commission were 
</p>
<p>underway. Diversion guidelines, victim support unit guidelines and a child protection 
</p>
<p>policy had been developed and the police training manual had been reviewed. The 
</p>
<p>establishment of the &#8220;lay visitor&#8217;s scheme&#8221; had also contributed to a reduction in human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. The scheme consisted of local leaders, paralegals and women, all of 
</p>
<p>whom were empowered to make unannounced visits to police cells and attend to complaints 
</p>
<p>by detained suspects.  
</p>
<p>13. A building for the commercial division of the high court was under construction in 
</p>
<p>Blantyre. Buildings for the magistrate courts had either been constructed or renovated in six 
</p>
<p>districts. The intention was to have the judiciary staffed with 40 high court judges in the 
</p>
<p>near future. There were currently 11 justices of appeal and 22 judges of the high court. Two 
</p>
<p>justices of appeal and 10 judges of the high court had been appointed in the period between 
</p>
<p>2012 and 2014. In 2014, 57 third-grade magistrates had been appointed and deployed to 
</p>
<p>rural areas.  </p>


<p>14. The judiciary, in conjunction with the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, was 
</p>
<p>installing a case-management system to increase efficiency in the handling of criminal-case 
</p>
<p>files, thereby reducing the backlog of cases.  
</p>
<p>15. To ease the implementation of the Child Care, Protection and Justice Act of 2010, 
</p>
<p>subsidiary legislation was being developed, as well as a cost implementation plan to 
</p>
<p>facilitate resource mobilization and the actual implementation of the Act. The Act had been 
</p>
<p>translated into local languages. A strategic plan had been developed for rehabilitating 
</p>
<p>children living and working on the streets and reintegrating them into their communities 
</p>
<p>and families.  
</p>
<p>16. A study on violence against children and young women conducted in 2014 had 
</p>
<p>revealed that boys and girls were abused in homes and in schools. A national response plan 
</p>
<p>had been launched.  
</p>
<p>17. In 2010, a case-management approach was launched. This approach had improved 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s access to multiple services through better referrals and follow-up. Various 
</p>
<p>programmes and policies for children had led to developments such as the essential package 
</p>
<p>for early childhood development, the guidelines for caregivers in identifying and supporting 
</p>
<p>children with special needs, the comprehensive training manual for early childhood 
</p>
<p>development, which included issues of child and women&#8217;s rights, and minimum standards 
</p>
<p>for quality improvement in the delivery of services to orphans and other vulnerable 
</p>
<p>children. The Government was developing guidelines for caregivers for the operation of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;children corners&#8221; and one-stop centres in central and district hospitals, providing holistic 
</p>
<p>services for victims of abuse. 
</p>
<p>18. The Government had undertaken initiatives to prevent child labour, which included 
</p>
<p>ensuring family income security, identification of children below the minimum age and in 
</p>
<p>hazardous work, rehabilitation of children to prevent them from going back to work, 
</p>
<p>protection through risk management, awareness-raising campaigns, child labour inspections 
</p>
<p>to identify the working children, advocacy for change of attitude on child labour, 
</p>
<p>prosecutions of those responsible for child labour, commemoration of child labour open 
</p>
<p>days, and setting up community child labour committees. The curriculum for primary 
</p>
<p>education had a life-skills component that empowered children to protect themselves 
</p>
<p>against violations of their rights.  
</p>
<p>19. To promote the rights of women and girls, the Deceased Estates (Wills, Inheritance 
</p>
<p>and Protection) Act 2011, Gender Equality Act 2013, the Marriage, Divorce and Family 
</p>
<p>Relations Act 2015 and the Trafficking in Persons Act 2015 had been enacted, and had 
</p>
<p>been simplified and translated into two local languages.  
</p>
<p>20. The delegation provided detailed information on the second Malawi growth and 
</p>
<p>development strategy, a medium-term plan for 2011&#8211;2016, with the objective of creating 
</p>
<p>wealth and reducing poverty through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure 
</p>
<p>development.  
</p>
<p>21. In December 2011, the national HIV and AIDS strategic plan, 2011&#8211;2016, was 
</p>
<p>adopted. The Plan aimed at reducing new infections by 20 per cent, child infections by 30 
</p>
<p>per cent, child AIDS-related deaths by 50 per cent, adult infections by 15 per cent and adult 
</p>
<p>AIDS-related deaths by 8 per cent.  
</p>
<p>22. The Government was committed to offering comprehensive sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health and rights services in tandem with international, regional and national policies. The 
</p>
<p>delegation stated that there had been a decline of more than 50 per cent in child mortality. </p>


<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>23. Seventy-four delegations made statements, the summaries of which appear below. 
</p>
<p>Recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present 
</p>
<p>report. 
</p>
<p>24. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted the efforts made in the area of ratification of international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, in 2010, and noted several 
</p>
<p>policies for the protection of vulnerable persons, including a national plan of action for 
</p>
<p>children, 2014&#8211;2018. 
</p>
<p>25. Cuba noted the important socioeconomic challenges faced by Malawi. It also noted 
</p>
<p>efforts to improve human rights protection, highlighting the work of the Ombudsman, the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission and the Law Commission. It praised the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>26. The Democratic Republic of the Congo stated that additional efforts were still 
</p>
<p>required to overcome certain traditional practices, to effectively contain the spread of 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS, to achieve gender equality, to improve the protection of children and to ensure 
</p>
<p>food security for the population. 
</p>
<p>27. Denmark welcomed the acceptance of recommendations to ratify the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment and noted that the Optional Protocol established a set of practical 
</p>
<p>tools on how to prevent torture and ill-treatment. It highlighted that the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture Initiative stood ready to assist Malawi on this issue. 
</p>
<p>28. Egypt commended Malawi on the constructive role played by various institutions in 
</p>
<p>protecting human rights in Malawi. Egypt also encouraged Malawi to pursue its policies 
</p>
<p>aimed at enhancing the empowerment of women in various socioeconomic fields, as well as 
</p>
<p>combating the negative phenomenon of street children. 
</p>
<p>29. Ethiopia noted with satisfaction that Malawi was on track to achieve the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and reducing 
</p>
<p>child mortality, as well as on tracking poverty. Ethiopia also commended Malawi on the 
</p>
<p>launching of the 2012 agricultural-sector guidelines and the HIV/AIDS strategy for the 
</p>
<p>period up to 2017. 
</p>
<p>30. Gabon encouraged Malawi to complete measures taken for women&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p>particularly ensuring the adoption by Parliament of the Marriage, Divorce and Family 
</p>
<p>Relations Bill and better representation of women in Parliament and on governmental 
</p>
<p>bodies. 
</p>
<p>31. Germany expressed its disappointment over the continued discrimination on the 
</p>
<p>basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and the fact that there had been no reform of 
</p>
<p>the legislation on refugees. Germany was also concerned about the situation in prisons and 
</p>
<p>detention centres. 
</p>
<p>32. Ghana noted with satisfaction the passing of the Gender Equality Act; however, it 
</p>
<p>shared the concerns raised by the United Nations country team regarding the rather slow 
</p>
<p>review processes of certain policies and legislative instruments, particularly the witchcraft 
</p>
<p>act.  
</p>
<p>33. The Holy See congratulated Malawi on the two peaceful political transition 
</p>
<p>processes since the universal periodic review in 2010, especially on the first-ever tripartite 
</p>
<p>elections in May 2014. It also commended Malawi on the adoption of the 2012 Disability 
</p>
<p>Act.  </p>


<p>34. Honduras encouraged Malawi to continue its institutional and democratic progress. 
</p>
<p>It also encouraged Malawi to continue adopting the necessary measures to eliminate gender 
</p>
<p>disparities in areas such as education, health and agriculture, and to implement as soon as 
</p>
<p>possible the law on disabilities.  
</p>
<p>35. Iceland welcomed the adoption of the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Bill 
</p>
<p>and commended Malawi on the adoption of the Gender Equality Act. It urged Malawi to 
</p>
<p>repeal the provisions of the Criminal Code that criminalized consensual, adult same-sex 
</p>
<p>conduct and to repeal other laws that discriminated against lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</p>
<p>transsexual and intersex persons. 
</p>
<p>36. Indonesia commended Malawi on advancing the rights of people through 
</p>
<p>cooperation among institutions and undertaking legal reforms to harmonize international 
</p>
<p>conventions into national legislations. Indonesia was also pleased to note the drafting of the 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons bill. 
</p>
<p>37. Italy welcomed the engagement of Malawi in combating harmful practices such as 
</p>
<p>early and forced child marriage and female genital mutilation and encouraged Malawi to 
</p>
<p>further engage with those issues.  
</p>
<p>38. Kenya encouraged Malawi to complete the drafting of a national human rights 
</p>
<p>action plan and to continue to clear the backlog in the submission of overdue State party 
</p>
<p>reports under the various human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>39. Kuwait noted the implementation of projects in various fields and commitment to 
</p>
<p>strengthening the economy through the second growth and development strategy. Kuwait 
</p>
<p>also acknowledged the commitment to generating welfare, ensuring sustainable growth and 
</p>
<p>strengthening infrastructure as a means of reducing poverty.  
</p>
<p>40. Libya noted the efforts made by Malawi to promote and protect the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child through the national action plan to eliminate child labour and child marriage. Libya 
</p>
<p>also appreciated the efforts to promote economic and social development, including the 
</p>
<p>second growth and development strategy.   
</p>
<p>41. Luxembourg congratulated Malawi on the socioeconomic progress achieved and 
</p>
<p>commended the country on the adoption of the second growth and development strategy. It 
</p>
<p>noted, however, that inequality of gender still remained despite measures taken to promote 
</p>
<p>the rights of women and to combat violence against them. 
</p>
<p>42. Madagascar was pleased with the adoption of the Disability Act, the Gender 
</p>
<p>Equality Act and several laws relating to the promotion and protection of the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child. Madagascar encouraged Malawi to continue these efforts in order to ensure the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>43. Mauritania noted the ratification of human rights instruments, as well as reforms to 
</p>
<p>the legal framework to ensure that it was compatible with human rights norms. It  stated 
</p>
<p>that those actions were a testimony to the international and ethical commitment of Malawi 
</p>
<p>to human rights. 
</p>
<p>44. Mauritius recalled that it had previously recommended that consideration be given to 
</p>
<p>promoting and strengthening vocational education and training to reduce the high number 
</p>
<p>of school dropouts. It thanked Malawi for accepting its recommendation and urged it to 
</p>
<p>continue with such initiatives. 
</p>
<p>45. Mexico welcomed legislative efforts by Malawi, noting the enactment of legislation 
</p>
<p>on children, gender equality and education, but also observed shortcomings in areas such as 
</p>
<p>access to information and prisons. It also noted the country&#8217;s efforts to present reports to 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies. </p>


<p>46. Montenegro welcomed the adoption of the Gender Equality Act, which defined the 
</p>
<p>term &#8220;discrimination against women&#8221; and prohibited &#8220;harmful practices&#8221;. It asked Malawi 
</p>
<p>to elaborate on the activities undertaken to enforce existing legislation prohibiting female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>47. Morocco commended the creation of the Office of the Ombudsman, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission and the Law Commission. It also supported the national human rights 
</p>
<p>action plan and a series of reforms for the establishment of a legislative and political 
</p>
<p>environment appropriate for the development and enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>48. Namibia was pleased to note the initiatives regarding the road map on accelerated 
</p>
<p>reduction of maternal and neonatal deaths and the national sexual reproductive health and 
</p>
<p>rights strategy, the passing of the Gender Equality Act of 2013 and the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Disability Act in 2012.  
</p>
<p>49. Nepal commended Malawi on its adoption of the Disability Act in 2012 and the 
</p>
<p>Gender Equality Act in 2013, seeing the Gender Equality Act as an important step towards 
</p>
<p>protecting women from harmful traditional practices and other discrimination.  
</p>
<p>50. The Netherlands welcomed the passing of the Marriage, Divorce and Family 
</p>
<p>Relations Act, while noting, however, that this law also contained several discriminatory 
</p>
<p>provisions that stigmatized lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people and hampered the 
</p>
<p>fight against HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>51. The delegation of Malawi stated that the Marriage, Divorce and 
</p>
<p>Family Relations Act had been passed in 2015 and was expected to be operational soon. 
</p>
<p>Regarding the apparent inconsistency in the age of marriage between the Act and the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, the delegation pointed out that the Act provided for marriageable age to be 18 
</p>
<p>years. Section 22 (6) of the Constitution provided that persons between the ages of 15 and 
</p>
<p>18 years could marry only with the consent of their parents. The Constitution also provided 
</p>
<p>that anyone above the age of 18 would not be prevented from entering into a marriage. The 
</p>
<p>Constitutional provisions allowing for persons between the ages of 15 to 18 years to marry 
</p>
<p>could only be amended through a referendum.  
</p>
<p>52. The Trafficking in Persons Act, the Gender Equality Act and the Disability Act were 
</p>
<p>operational. On the issues of press freedom, the access to information bill was in the 
</p>
<p>process of being finalized. The bill would soon to be submitted to the Cabinet and 
</p>
<p>thereafter to Parliament.  
</p>
<p>53. The delegation emphasized that discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
</p>
<p>transsexual persons was a problem that existed not only in Malawi. However, society in 
</p>
<p>Malawi needed to evolve and an informed society would be able to take a decision on this 
</p>
<p>matter. There was a need for discussion and debate on the issue. However, there had not 
</p>
<p>been any attempt by civil society to engage with the Government. 
</p>
<p>54. The Prisons Act was being reviewed and should be completed later in 2015. Malawi 
</p>
<p>had the death penalty in its laws, but no one had been executed since 1994. Society needed 
</p>
<p>to be encouraged to discuss the issue. For those sentenced to death after 1994, some of 
</p>
<p>those sentences were being reviewed. The delegation explained that it was not mandatory 
</p>
<p>for a court to impose the death sentence for murder. The court had the discretion to impose 
</p>
<p>another sentence.  
</p>
<p>55. Nicaragua acknowledged efforts to protect child rights and the adoption of measures 
</p>
<p>to promote the universal right of children to education. It highlighted the adoption of a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive law on disabilities. 
</p>
<p>56. The Niger noted several institutions that functioned harmoniously and brought about 
</p>
<p>better protection of human rights, such as the Office of the Ombudsman and the Human </p>


<p>Rights Commission. The Niger also noted that Malawi was party to most of the 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>57. Nigeria appreciated efforts on the issue of disability and the plan to create wealth 
</p>
<p>through sustainable economic growth. It urged Malawi to continue strengthening its human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions and called on the Government to consider extending a standing invitation 
</p>
<p>to special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>58. Norway commended Malawi on the adoption of legislation strengthening the legal 
</p>
<p>framework for human rights protection. It noted open discussions on minority rights, action 
</p>
<p>towards decriminalizing same-sex relations, and improvements in freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>and the media. 
</p>
<p>59. The Philippines welcomed progress in harmonizing domestic legislation with 
</p>
<p>international human rights conventions, noting the enactment of the Gender Equality Act 
</p>
<p>and the Child Protection and Justice Act. It lauded awareness-raising programmes among 
</p>
<p>government agencies and key sectors of society. 
</p>
<p>60. Portugal welcomed ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Gender Equality Act and recognition of the disparities between men and women in the

</p>
<p>(UNAIDS), which strives to cut the number of new HIV infections.

</p>

</p>
<p>recommendations that had been made and had taken note of all of them. On the issue of 
</p>
<p>early marriage, the delegation stated that the enactment of the Marriage, Divorce and 
</p>
<p>Family Relations Act was a clear statement by the Government to discourage early 
</p>
<p>marriages. By pegging the marriage age to 18 years, the Government had shown its specific 
</p>
<p>intention to address this matter. The Act would encourage girls to go to school before they 
</p>
<p>thought of getting married. In the report that had been submitted, Malawi had provided 
</p>
<p>information on the initiatives that had been taken.  
</p>
<p>103. With regard to the attacks on people living with albinism, the delegation emphasized 
</p>
<p>that this was a recent issue in Malawi. However, the Government was aware of what was </p>


<p>happening and had taken measures to address the issue in order to protect people living 
</p>
<p>with albinism. Those initiatives were supported by the police and traditional leaders.  
</p>
<p>104. On the issue of loss of citizenship due to marriage, the delegation stated that the 
</p>
<p>Citizenship Act was under review. However, under section 48 of the Marriage, Divorce and 
</p>
<p>Family Relations Act, persons would not lose their citizenship because of marriage.  
</p>
<p>105. There were no reports in the country of people being persecuted, simply because 
</p>
<p>they were human rights defenders. The delegation welcomed and encouraged mandate 
</p>
<p>holders to visit the country and to find out whether allegations of this nature were credible. 
</p>
<p>106. The Human Rights Commission was established by the Constitution. The 
</p>
<p>Commission has an A-status accreditation with the International Coordinating Committee 
</p>
<p>of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The 
</p>
<p>Commission has always been encouraged to act and carry out its duties independently from 
</p>
<p>the Government. The Government has never made any attempt to interfere with the work of 
</p>
<p>the Commission.  
</p>
<p>107. Violence against children was a criminal offence. However, in the light of the 
</p>
<p>comments and observations that had been made, the Government would review the relevant 
</p>
<p>law to see what else could be done.  
</p>
<p>108. On the issue of education, the delegation stated that primary education was both free 
</p>
<p>and compulsory. However, enforcement mechanisms were lacking. Steps had been taken to 
</p>
<p>ensure that children went to school. 
</p>
<p>109. On the issue of prevention of violence against women, the delegation stated that the 
</p>
<p>relevant legislation was currently under review by the Law Commission. By the end of that 
</p>
<p>review, the concerns raised during the interactive dialogue should be addressed.
