JUDGMENT

[1]     
Luke Dikevi Tukana, you are charged as follows:

Statement of Offence
MURDER: Contrary to section 199 and 200 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17.

Particulars of Offence
LUKE DIKEVI TUKANA, on the 26th day of February 2009, at Votua Housing, Korolevu, Sigatoka, in the Western Division murdered NAELESONI VUNIVI NADUMU.

[2]     
Two out of three assessors have found you guilty of the offence of murder and the third guilty of manslaughter. In directing myself on my own Summing Up, I agree with the majority opinion of the assessors and find you guilty and convict you accordingly.

[3]     
The attack that you launched on the deceased was relentless, unprovoked and unnecessary given that he was at some stages unconscious. There is every reason to believe that you intended to cause him very serious harm.
