</p>
<p><b>Note by the secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 9/19, the mandate of the independent 
expert on the situation of human rights in Burundi was extended until an independent national 
human rights commission is established.  
</p>
<p>2. By the same resolution the independent expert was also invited to report on his activities 
to the Council at the session following the establishment of the commission.  
</p>
<p>3. The report of the independent expert will be submitted to the Council at a future session, 
as a national human rights commission has yet to be established in Burundi.
