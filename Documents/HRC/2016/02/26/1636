and 68/178 of 18 December 2013, and welcoming the efforts of all relevant stakeholders to 
implement those resolutions, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon States</i> to ensure that any measure taken to counter terrorism 
complies with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses</i> serious concern at the violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as of refugee and international humanitarian law, in the context of 
countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reaffirms</i> its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods, practices and 
financing of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever 
committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renews its 
commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and, in 
that regard, calls upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, to continue to 
</p>

<p>implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars, 
which reaffirm, inter alia, respect for human rights for all and the rule of law to be the 
fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Deeply deplores</i> the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their 
families, and expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of 
providing them with proper support and assistance; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Recalling </i>the panel discussion, held by the Human Rights Council, pursuant 
to Council decision 16/116 of 24 March 2011, on 1 June 2011, which raised awareness of 
the importance of addressing the human rights of victims of terrorism in the determined 
effort by the international community to deal with the scourge of terrorism and as part of a 
comprehensive counter-terrorism policy that respects human rights and fundamental 
freedoms; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Urges </i>States, while countering terrorism, to respect and protect all human 
rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, bearing in mind that certain counter-
terrorism measures may have an impact on the enjoyment of those rights; </p>
<p>7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group; </p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that measures taken to counter terrorism are not 
discriminatory, and not to resort to profiling based on stereotypes funded on ethnic, racial, 
religious or any other ground of discrimination prohibited by international law; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Recognizes</i> the work carried out by the special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Acknowledges</i> that the active participation of civil society can reinforce 
ongoing governmental efforts to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon States</i>, while countering terrorism, to ensure that any person who 
alleges that his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms have been violated has access 
to an effective remedy and that victims of human rights violations will receive adequate, 
effective and prompt reparations, which should include, as appropriate, restitution, 
compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-recurrence; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to safeguard the right to 
privacy in accordance with international law, and urges them to take measures to ensure 
that interferences with the right to privacy are regulated by law,  specifying the purposes  in 
which interference is permitted, and that such interference is not arbitrary or unlawful, nor 
implemented in a discriminatory manner, and is subject to effective oversight and 
appropriate redress, including through judicial review or other means; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that any measure taken or means employed to 
counter terrorism, including the use of remotely piloted aircraft, comply with their 
obligations under international law, including international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Urges</i> States to undertake prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding 
inquiries whenever there are plausible indications of breaches of their obligations under 
international human rights law as a result of any measures taken or means employed to 
counter terrorism and to ensure accountability for those responsible for violations that 
amount to crimes under national or international law; </p>


<p>15. <i>Notes with concern</i> measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of 
law, such as the detention of persons suspected of acts of terrorism in the absence of a legal 
basis for detention and due process guarantees, the unlawful deprivation of the right to life, 
and other fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of assembly and association, the 
deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the 
law, the trial of suspects without fundamental judicial guarantees, the illegal deprivation of 
liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, and the return of suspects 
to countries without individual assessment of the risk of there being substantial grounds for 
believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture, and limitations to effective 
scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Stresses</i> that all measures used in the fight against terrorism, including the 
profiling of individuals and the use of diplomatic assurances, memorandums of 
understanding and other transfer agreements or arrangements, must be in compliance with 
the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights, 
refugee and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to respect the rights to be equal 
before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, as provided for by international law, 
including international human rights law, such as article 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee 
law; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Reiterates</i> the concerns expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 
64/168 with regard to measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, and 
urges all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that persons deprived of their liberty, 
regardless of the place of arrest or detention, enjoy the guarantees to which they are entitled 
under international law, including the review of their detention and other fundamental 
judicial guarantees; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism;1 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, in accordance with his mandate, to continue 
to gather, request, receive and exchange information on alleged violations of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and to report regularly to the Human 
Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Requests</i> all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the 
performance of the tasks and duties mandated, including by reacting promptly to the urgent 
appeals and providing the information requested, and to give serious consideration to 
responding favourably to requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Encourages</i> United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes 
involved in supporting counter-terrorism efforts to continue to facilitate the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as due process and the rule 
of law, while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur to contribute 
further, appropriately, to the ongoing discussion regarding the efforts of States Members of 
the United Nations to assure adequate human rights guarantees to ensure fair and clear 
procedures, in particular with regard to placing on and removing individuals and entities 
from terrorism-related sanctions lists; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>24. <i>Recalls</i> that the General Assembly, in its resolution 66/171, recognized the 
need to continue ensuring that fair and clear procedures under the United Nations terrorism-
related sanctions regime are strengthened in order to enhance their efficiency and 
transparency, and welcomed and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Security Council in 
support of these objectives, including by supporting the enhanced role of the office of the 
ombudsperson and continuing to review all the names of individuals and entities in the 
regime, while emphasizing the importance of these sanctions in countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Stresses</i> the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and 
international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are 
participating in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, which provide technical 
assistance relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism to consenting States, 
include, as appropriate and where consistent with their mandates, the respect of 
international human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and 
refugee law, as well as the rule of law, as an important element of technical assistance that 
they offer to States related to counter-terrorism, including by drawing on the advice of, and 
otherwise ensuring the ongoing dialogue with, the special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council within their mandates and the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur to present their 
reports, bearing in mind the content of the present resolution, to the Human Rights Council 
under agenda item 3, in conformity with its annual programme of work.
