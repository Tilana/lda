</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations and as elaborated 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human 
Rights and other applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human 
Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly, reaffirming, inter alia, the 
illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>that Israel is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de 
jure to Palestinian and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East 
Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference 
of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 
December 2001,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council.

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-12417 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, were established in breach of international 
law,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and other 
relevant United Nations resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in East Jerusalem, constitute very serious violations of international humanitarian 
law and of the human rights of the Palestinian people therein and undermine international 
efforts, including the Annapolis Peace Conference of 27 November 2007 and the Paris 
International Donors&#8217; Conference for the Palestinian State of 17 December 2007, aimed at 
invigorating the peace process and establishing a viable, contiguous, sovereign and 
independent Palestinian State by the end of 2008,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its attachment to the implementation by both parties of their obligations 
under the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict (S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all settlement 
activity, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its grave concern </i>about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, 
of settlement building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in 
East Jerusalem, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations 
resolutions, including plans to expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East 
Jerusalem, thus threatening the creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the 
realization of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern </i>about the continuing construction, contrary to 
international law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
in and around East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the 
wall in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future 
negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement and 
which is causing the Palestinian people further humanitarian hardship, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include 
the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully 
with the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the Council of the European Union conclusions on the Middle East 
peace process of 8 December 2009, in which the European Union Council of Ministers 
reiterated that settlements, the separation barrier where built on occupied land, demolition 
of homes and evictions are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace 
and threaten to make a two-State solution impossible, and particularly its urgent call upon 
the Government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities, in East Jerusalem and 
the rest of the West Bank and including natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts 
erected since March 2001; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes with appreciation </i>the statements made by the majority of the 
States Members of the United Nations on the illegality of settlement activities in the 
occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, and reaffirming the urgent calls </p>


<p>GE.10-12417 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>by the international community upon the Government of Israel to immediately stop all 
settlement activities, including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Deplores </i>the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new 
housing units for Israeli settlers in and around occupied East Jerusalem, as they undermine 
the peace process and the creation of a contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian 
State, and are in violation of international law and Israeli pledges at the Annapolis Peace 
Conference of 27 November 2007; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Condemns </i>the new Israeli announcement on the construction of 120 new 
housing units in the Bitar Elite settlement, and 1,600 new housing units for new settlers in 
the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Ramat Shlomo, and calls upon the Government of 
Israel to immediately reverse its decision which would further undermine and jeopardize 
the ongoing efforts by the international community to reach a final settlement compliant 
with international legitimacy, including the relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (a)  The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 
49 of that Convention, and recalls that settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment 
of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign 
and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Israeli planned settlement construction in the vicinity of the Adam 
settlements in the occupied West Bank, which constitutes a new settlement block;  
</p>
<p> (c) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008 and 2009, 
amounting to several thousand, including a large number of permanent buildings and 
structures, which undermine the efforts of the international community to advance the 
Middle East peace process;  
</p>
<p> (d) The so-called E-1 plan aimed at expanding the Israeli settlement of Maale 
Adumim and building the wall around it, thereby further disconnecting occupied East 
Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and isolating its 
Palestinian population; 
</p>
<p> (e)  The implications for the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (f)  The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would in that case be tantamount 
to de facto annexation; 
</p>
<p> (g)  The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West 
Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev, which is in clear violation of 
international law and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> (h<i>)</i>  The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
the restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated 
closure of the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have created an extremely precarious </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12417 
</p>
<p>humanitarian situation for the civilian population as well as impaired the economic and 
social rights of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> (i) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (j) The latest Israeli plan to demolish hundreds of houses in occupied East 
Jerusalem, including its decision to demolish more than 88 houses in the Al-Bustan 
neighbourhood of Silwan, which would result in the displacement of more than 2,000 
Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, in addition to the Israeli decision to evacuate 
Palestinian families from their houses in the Al-Sheikh Jarrah area of East Jerusalem and to 
replace them by Israeli settlers; 
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (a)  To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and 
related activities including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (b)  To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories, 
including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Urges </i>the full implementation of the Access and Movement Agreement of 15 
November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of Rafah and Karni crossings, which is 
crucial to ensuring the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, as well as the access of 
the United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to implement the recommendations regarding the 
settlements made by the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her 
report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to the 
occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114); 
</p>
<p> 9.  <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to take and implement serious measures, including 
confiscation of arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts 
of violence by Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of 
the Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 10.  <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal 
obligations, as mentioned in the Advisory Opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 11.  <i>Urges </i>the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process in line with 
the Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the 
Palestinian State and to implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security Council in 
resolution 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive 
political settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, including 
resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, and other 
relevant United Nations resolutions, the principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle 
East, held in Madrid on 30 October 1991, the Oslo Accords, the Arab Peace initiative and 
subsequent agreements, which will allow two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace 
and security; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of this question at its sixteenth session.
