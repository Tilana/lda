</p>
<p><b>PRST/ 9/1.  Situation of human rights in Haiti 
 
 
</b></p>
<p> At the 22nd meeting, on 24 September 2008, the President of the Council read out the 
</p>
<p>following statement: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. The Human Rights Council welcomes recent political developments in Haiti, marked 
</p>
<p>by the formation and installation of a new Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council commends the reaffirmation by the Haitian authorities of their 
</p>
<p>commitments and their determination to improve living conditions for Haitians, with a 
</p>
<p>special emphasis on respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>3. The Council notes with satisfaction the cooperation between the Haitian National 
</p>
<p>Police and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in curbing 
</p>
<p>violence, crime and banditry. 
</p>
<p>4. The Council welcomes the adoption of the regulations on the judiciary and the new 
</p>
<p>Act on the High Council of the Judiciary, as well as the reopening of the Judicial Training 
</p>
<p>College. It encourages the authorities to continue their efforts, in particular as regards 
</p>
<p>reinforcing inspection units within the police and justice systems, eliminating prolonged 
</p>
<p>pre-trial detention, introducing a legal aid scheme and strengthening the Office of Citizen 
</p>
<p>Protection.  
</p>
<p>5. The Council thanks the outgoing independent expert for his important contribution to 
</p>
<p>consolidating the rule of law in Haiti through his judicious recommendations, in particular 
</p>
<p>with regard to judicial reform. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council is deeply concerned at the deterioration of Haitians&#8217; standard of living 
</p>
<p>and quality of life in recent months, partly as a result of the serious economic crisis and 
</p>
<p>acute food shortage. It deplores the heavy loss of life and material damage caused by the 
</p>
<p>consecutive passage of hurricanes Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
</p>
<p>difficulties encountered by its leaders in daily governance. It recognizes that full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights - civil and political, economic, social and cultural - is a factor 
</p>
<p>of peace, stability and progress in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>8. The Council strongly encourages the international community as a whole, and in 
</p>
<p>particular international donors, friendly countries and United Nations specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>to step up their cooperation with the constituted authorities of Haiti for the full realization 
</p>
<p>of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Council welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; request to extend the mission of the 
</p>
<p>independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti to September 2010 and 
</p>
<p>decides to support that request. 
</p>
<p>10. The Council also welcomes the appointment of Mr. Michel Forst as independent 
</p>
<p>expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>11. The Council invites the new expert to continue the work undertaken and to carry out 
</p>
<p>his mission by bringing his experience and expertise to bear and contributing to the cause 
</p>
<p>of human rights in Haiti, with a particular emphasis on economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The Council also invites the new expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the near 
</p>
<p>future and report to it each year in accordance with its programme of work. It encourages 
</p>
<p>the Haitian authorities to cooperate with the new independent expert.&#8221;
