</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 64/292 of 28 July 2010, in which the 
Assembly recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human 
right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, 
 <i>Recalling also</i> the holding of the General Assembly plenary meeting of 27 July 2011

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the relevant provisions of declarations and programmes with regard to

meetings, inter alia, the Mar del Plata Action Plan on Water Development and

58/217 of 23 December 2003 proclaiming the International Decade for Action, &#8220;Water for

<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to achieve

Declaration, to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe 
drinking water, and to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>agreed in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of Implementation&#8221;) and the outcome document adopted at the High-
level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium 
Development Goals entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> World Health Assembly resolution 64/24 of May 2011, in which the 
Assembly urged Member States to, inter alia, &#8220;ensure that national health strategies 
contribute to the realization of water- and sanitation-related Millennium Development 
Goals while coming in support to the progressive realization of the human right to water 
and sanitation that entitles everyone, without discrimination, to water and sanitation that is 
sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable for personal and domestic 
uses&#8221;, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that approximately 884 million people lack access to improved 
water sources and that more than 2.6 billion people do not have access to improved 
sanitation as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund in their 2010 Joint Monitoring Programme report, and alarmed that, every year, 
approximately 1.5 million children under five years of age die and 443 million school days 
are lost as a result of water- and sanitation-related diseases, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> the need to focus on local and national perspectives in considering the 
issue, leaving aside questions of international watercourse law and all transboundary water 
issues, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the recognition of the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the affirmation by 
the latter that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the right 
to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human 
dignity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, including the progress in collecting good practices, the 
comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and 
interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and collection of good practices, 
as well as the undertaking of country missions; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation</i> the third annual report of the Special 
Rapporteur,1 and takes note with interest of her recommendations and clarifications with 
regard to national and local planning for the implementation of the right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Welcomes</i> the submission of the compilation of good practices on the right to 
safe drinking water and sanitation,2 in which the Special Rapporteur put particular emphasis 
on practical solutions with regard to the implementation of the human right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
realization of all human rights, and must take steps, nationally and through international 
assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its 
available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to safe drinking

<p>water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of 
legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the important role that national plans of action can play as 
tools for the promotion and protection of human rights, as highlighted in the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights 
on 25 June 1993, including for the promotion and protection of the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon </i>States: 
</p>
<p> (a) To continuously monitor and regularly analyse the status of the realization of 
the right to safe drinking water and sanitation on the basis of the criteria of availability, 
quality, acceptability, accessibility and affordability; 
</p>
<p> (b) To assess existing policies, programmes and activities in the sectors of water 
and sanitation, giving due consideration to waste-water management, including treatment 
and reuse, and to monitor resources allocated to increase adequate access, as well as to 
identify actors and their capacity; 
</p>
<p> (c) To develop comprehensive plans and strategies, including the definition of 
responsibilities for all water and sanitation sector actors, to achieve progressively the full 
realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation for all, or re-examine and revise 
them where necessary to ensure consistency with human rights standards and principles;  
</p>
<p> (d) To assess whether the existing legislative and policy framework is in line 
with the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and to repeal, amend or adapt it in order 
to meet human rights standards and principles; 
</p>
<p> (e) To ensure full transparency of the monitoring and assessment of the 
implementation of plans of action, projects and programmes in the sectors of water and 
sanitation and to ensure, including in the planning process, the free, effective, meaningful 
and non-discriminatory participation of all people and communities concerned, particularly 
people living in disadvantaged, marginalized and vulnerable situations; 
</p>
<p> (f) To set access targets to be reached in short-time periods for universal service 
provision, giving priority to realizing a basic level of service for everyone before improving 
service levels for those already served;  
</p>
<p> (g) To set indicators, including disaggregated data, based on human rights 
criteria,3 to monitor progress and to identify shortcomings to be rectified and challenges to 
be met; 
</p>
<p> (h) To ensure financing to the maximum of available resources in order to 
implement all the necessary measures to ensure that water and sanitation systems are 
sustainable and that services are affordable for everyone, while ensuring that allocated 
resources are not limited to infrastructure but also include resources for regulatory 
activities, operation and maintenance, the institutional and managerial structure and 
structural measures, including increasing capacity; 
</p>
<p> (i) To provide for a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring that all water and 
sanitation service providers respect and protect human rights and do not cause human rights 
violations or abuses, and to ensure that national minimum standards, based on human rights 
criteria, are in place when water and sanitation services are decentralized, in order to ensure 
coherence and countrywide compliance with human rights;

<p> (j) To provide for a framework of accountability that provides for adequate 
monitoring mechanisms and legal remedies, including measures to overcome obstacles in 
access to justice and other accountability mechanisms, and lack of awareness of the law, 
human rights and opportunities to claim these rights; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to continue to promote, at all levels, including at the highest 
level, the full realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in 
forthcoming national, regional and international initiatives, inter alia, the Global Forum on 
Sanitation and Hygiene of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council in 
October 2011, in Mumbai, India, and the sixth World Water Forum in March 2012, in 
Marseille, France; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses</i> the important role of the international cooperation and technical 
assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system, 
international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the 
timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development 
partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing 
development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> all Governments to continue to respond favourably to requests 
by the Special Rapporteur for visits and information, to follow up effectively on 
recommendations of the mandate holder and to make available information on measures 
taken in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to report, on an annual basis, to 
the Human Rights Council and to submit an annual report to the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to facilitate, including through 
engagement with relevant stakeholders, the provision of technical assistance in the area of 
the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the resources and assistance

states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing

international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking</i> <i>into</i> <i>account</i> the fact that article 2 of the International Covenant on

to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by

<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that the widening gap between economically developed and 
developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in

</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its</i> <i>concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the 
process of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, 
communities and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of 
several developing countries, particularly least developed and African countries, as well as 
the small and vulnerable economies,

and agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a 
massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental 
consequences for developing countries, in particular the most vulnerable countries 
throughout the world,

<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official

</p>

State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer or benefit least deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Affirms</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international assistance 
and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept and 
principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens;

<p> 3. <i>Expresses</i> its determination to contribute to the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the

respect, in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United

priorities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Affirms</i> that much more is needed owing to the magnitude of global and local 
challenges, the alarming increase in natural and man-made disasters and the continuing 
rises in poverty and inequality; ideally, solidarity should be preventive rather than simply 
reactive to massive irreversible damage already caused, and must address both natural and 
man-made disasters;

States, individually and collectively, civil society, global social movements and countless 
people of goodwill reaching out to others;

<p>209. At the 11th meeting, on 11 September 2011, and at the 29th meeting, on 27 
September, the Human Rights Council held two closed meetings of the complaint 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>210. At the 30th meeting, on 27 September 2011, the President made a statement on the 
outcome of the meetings, stating: 
</p>
<p> The Human Rights Council has, in closed meetings, examined the human 
rights situations in Tajikistan and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under 
the complaint procedure established pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1, and has decided to discontinue its consideration of the human rights situation in 
Tajikistan and to keep under review the human rights situation in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, and to recommend that the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights provide the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo with technical cooperation, capacity-building, assistance or advisory services 
as needed in both situations examined under the complaint procedure. 
</p>

<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>220. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and President&#8217;s statements 8/1 and 9/2 on the modalities and practices for the universal 
periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews held during the 
eleventh session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Consideration of universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>221. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement 8/1, the section below 
contains a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, 
Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council, as well as general comments 
made by other relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the Council in 
plenary session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Belgium 
</b></p>
<p>222. The review of Belgium was held on 2 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Belgium in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/BEL/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/BEL/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/BEL/3). 
</p><p>223. At its 18th meeting, on 21 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Belgium (see section C below). 
224. The outcome of the review of Belgium comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/3), the views of Belgium concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>225. Ambassador Roux of Belgium expressed his gratitude to the delegates of the troika 
and the secretariat of the universal periodic review for their commitment, support and 
cooperation during the review of Belgium. He referred to the presence of the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs of Belgium during the session of the Working Group, which showed 
Belgium&#8217;s commitment to human rights and the importance it attached to the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>226. Ambassador Roux referred to the commitments made by Belgium during its election 
to the Human Rights Council to engage to promote and protect human rights, convinced 
that civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are universal, indivisible, 
interdependent and intrinsically linked. 
</p>
<p>227. Belgium&#8217;s aim during the universal periodic review was to accept as many 
recommendations as possible and, as reflected in the report of the Working Group, Belgium </p>


<p><b>112</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>had immediately accepted the vast majority (85 of 121). Moreover, 26 of the accepted 
recommendations had already been implemented or were being implemented. 
</p>
<p>228. These recommendations concerned, inter alia, the ratification of international 
instruments, the fight against racism, asylum and migration policies, the penitentiary 
system, violence against women, the fight against sexual exploitation of children, LGBT 
rights and disability rights. 
</p>
<p>229. Belgium had accepted to establish a national human rights institution in accordance 
with the Paris Principles, to strengthen its asylum and migration policies, to revise its 
penitentiary conditions and to ratify four international instruments, in particular the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Third Protocol to 
the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949. 
</p>
<p>230. Since May 2011, the Belgian authorities had turned their attention to the follow-up 
on the above recommendations. 
</p>
<p>231. On 2 June 2011, Belgium had ratified the Convention on Enforced Disappearances. 
The process of the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture was ongoing, and a working group had been created for the establishment of a 
national human rights institution under the direction of the federal justice service. 
Meanwhile, other federal and federated institutions had taken the lead on the 
implementation of the other recommendations. 
</p>
<p>232. With regard to pending recommendations, Belgium was currently not in a position 
to accept recommendations 102.1, 2 and 3 regarding the lifting of its reservations on the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A more thorough analysis of its 
reservations to the Covenant and other human rights conventions was under way. At the 
same time, Belgium agreed to reconsider the interpretative declaration made under article 4 
of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>233. It was also not possible for Belgium to withdraw the declaration made under article 
2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (recommendation 102.7) on non-
discrimination. It considered this declaration to be in conformity with the interpretation of 
article 2 given by its Constitutional Court, the European Court for Human Rights and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>234. Belgium had not accepted to elaborate a national plan of action for human rights 
(recommendations 102.5 and 6) as it had developed a sectorial approach to the promotion 
and protection of human rights and drawn up several plans of action for priority areas. The 
establishment of a national human rights institution, as accepted during the session of the 
Working Group, would not be done by means of a national plan. The institution would be 
established bearing in mind the division of competencies and the institutional reality of the 
federal structure. 
</p>
<p>235. Belgium had rejected recommendation 102.9 to modify its Criminal Code, because 
sexual violence was already defined as a crime under title VII of the Criminal Code and had 
no incidence on the priority given to the prosecution and investigation of that crime. The 
requested modification would therefore have only a symbolic effect and be difficult to 
implement in the legislative process. Belgium had, however, accepted to extend its national 
plan of action against domestic violence and all forms of violence against women and girls 
(recommendations 102.10 and 12). Certain forms of violence, committed in other contexts, 
were already addressed in the national plan of action against human trafficking. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>113 
</b></p>
<p>236. Belgium had also accepted to circulate and implement the Bangkok rules in the 
framework of its reform of the judicial system (recommendation 102.13). 
</p><p>237. With regard to the renewal of its plan of action against the sexual exploitation of 
children for commercial purposes (recommendation 102.8), Belgium reiterated that this 
issue was linked to trafficking of human beings as well as sexual tourism. A plan of action 
against trafficking of human beings focusing on minor victims had been adopted in 2008. A 
working group on minors travelling alone had also been established in the Asylum and 
Migration Department. The Belgian authorities therefore considered that the adoption of a 
specific plan of action on that subject could present a risk of overlapping with the latter 
mechanisms, and therefore did not support this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>238. With regard to issues relating to minorities (recommendations 102.4 and 11), 
Belgium had made a reservation to the concept of &#8220;national minority&#8221; upon signing the 
framework convention for the protection of minorities. Meanwhile, a working group had 
been convened but until today no agreement had been reached on a definition. 
</p>
<p>239. Belgium had voluntarily pledged to submit a midterm report to the Human Rights 
Council in 2013, to provide an overview of progress made. 
</p>
<p>240. The delegate also referred to the closing remarks made by the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, on 2 June 2011, regarding the continuous efforts made by the authorities to work 
closely with civil society on the implementation of universal periodic review 
recommendations, as testified by the meeting held with non-governmental organizations on 
21 June 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>241. Algeria noted with satisfaction that Belgium had accepted many recommendations, 
and had accepted two of its own. Considering that the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families had set up 
the most extensive international framework for the protection of this group, Algeria 
recommended that Belgium should adhere to it. It hoped that Belgium would reconsider its 
rejection of that recommendation, taking into account recommendation 1737 of 17 March 
2006 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>242. Belarus hoped that Belgium would successfully implement all accepted 
recommendations and improve its measures aimed at combating trafficking in persons. It 
regretted that some recommendations had not been accepted, such as those relating to the 
elimination of discrimination against migrant workers, the excessive use of force by the 
police during mass events and the deportation of foreigners. Belarus also regretted the fact 
that Belgium had rejected a recommendation to prevent acts of xenophobia and racial 
intolerance. It called on Belgium to take measures to prevent discrimination against ethnic 
and racial minorities and to introduce a law prohibiting organizations and political parties 
from propagating hatred and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>243. Morocco noted with satisfaction the existence of a mechanism to follow up on 
forced deportation and assistance to asylum seekers, and the actions taken to combat 
racism, in particular by the Centre for Equal Opportunities. Morocco regarded as best 
practices the National Commission on the Rights of the Child and the measures taken to 
promote equal opportunity and to combat domestic violence. Morocco appreciated the 
measures taken by Belgium to protect migrants and freedom of religion. It praised the 
efforts made by Belgium to improve human rights education. Morocco hoped that Belgium 
would consider implementing the recommendations it had made on human rights education 
and training for public officials. </p>


<p><b>114</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>244. The Islamic Republic of Iran regretted the fact that most of the recommendations it 
had made had been rejected, although they aimed at protecting the human rights of ethnic, 
linguistic and religious minorities. It referred to the 2011 anti-Hijab law, which violated the 
right of women to practise their religion and aggravated the Islamophobic atmosphere 
prevailing in Belgium. It called upon Belgium to abolish that law. It remained concerned at 
the situation of racism and racial discrimination and the rights of migrants and other 
minorities in Belgium. It urged Belgium to reconsider its position and to accept the 
recommendations on these issues. 
</p>
<p>245. Romania welcomed the fact that Belgium had prepared its national report with the 
broad participation of civil society. Belgium had the legal and institutional mechanisms to 
meet its current human rights challenges. Romania had taken note of the institutional and 
legal framework aimed at combating discrimination and human trafficking and protecting 
the rights of the child. It welcomed Belgium&#8217;s acceptance to create a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>246. The Islamic Human Rights Commission expressed concern at the discrimination 
experienced by women wearing face veils or a headscarf. It stated that banning girls from 
wearing a headscarf at schools might lead to increased educational exclusion and social 
deprivation. It added that sanctioning women for wearing a face veil in public spaces by 
fines or imprisonment was in violation of the Constitution of Belgium. While recalling the 
consistent jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on the right to freedom of 
religion, it added that Belgium should comply with human rights standards to which it was 
party. It urged Belgium to give its citizens the right to practise religion without Government 
interference or approval, and to repeal all unreasonable laws against women. 
</p>
<p>247. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation (ILGA-
Europe) encouraged Belgium to eliminate discrimination based on gender identity by 
developing awareness-raising programmes and addressing this issue in school curricula. It 
also recommended that Belgium should explicitly include sexual orientation and gender 
identity as grounds for discrimination in its Constitution. ILGA-Europe also recommended 
that Belgium should abolish the requirement of surgery leading to sterilization for 
transsexual people. It encouraged Belgium to share best practices on the fight against 
discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, and to continue to apply the 
Yogyakarta Principles. 
</p>
<p>248. The International Commission of Jurists welcomed the fact that Belgium had 
accepted many recommendations on the rights of asylum seekers. Their implementation 
warranted urgent attention. The Commission recalled that the European Court of Human 
Rights had ruled that Belgium had violated the principle of non-refoulement in 
automatically transferring an asylum seeker to Greece. While Belgium had suspended this 
procedure in October 2010, it should take steps to formally abolish mechanisms of 
automatic expulsion that failed to take into consideration the principle of non-refoulement. 
It also urged Belgium to reconsider its position on the ratification of the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. 
</p>
<p>249. Amnesty International welcomed Belgium&#8217;s commitment to involve civil society in 
its follow-up to the universal periodic review. It also welcomed the acceptance of the 
majority of the recommendations and the commitment to present a progress report in 2013. 
Amnesty International applauded Belgium for having accepted the establishment of a 
national human rights institution and welcomed its support for the ratification of the 
Optional Protocols to the Convention against Torture and to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It noted that Belgium had accepted the </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>115 
</b></p>
<p>recommendation to provide shelter and assistance to asylum seekers, while more than 1,400 
of them were homeless in 2011. It expressed concern at the fact that asylum seekers, who 
apply for asylum at the border, were still routinely detained, contrary to what Belgium 
claimed. Amnesty International urged Belgium to use detention as a measure of last resort 
and to reflect such a provision in law. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>250. In his concluding remarks, Ambassador Roux thanked the troika, the secretariat and 
the intervening delegations. He addressed two points discussed during the session and 
contained in the report of the Working Group; first, with regard to the issue of migrant 
workers, he referred to paragraph 36 of the report, which explained Belgium&#8217;s position. 
This was a matter of concern not only to Belgium but to the European Union as a whole. 
Second, in reply to the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic Human 
Rights Commission on the question of the veil, Ambassador Roux referred to paragraph 42 
of the report. He highlighted the openness of Belgian society and the challenges it faced 
owing to its multiculturalism. 
</p>
<p>251. Ambassador Roux stressed the fact that structures and mechanisms existed to ensure 
that civil society exercised its rights and that federal and federated authorities took into 
account its views. Bearing in mind the developing situation in Belgium, he pledged to 
return to the Human Rights Council in 2013 for a midterm review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Denmark 
</b></p>
<p>252. The review of Denmark was held on 2 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Denmark in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/DNK/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/DNK/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/DNK/3). 
</p><p>253. At its 18th meeting, held on 21 September 2011, the Human Rights Council 
considered and adopted the outcome of the review of Denmark (see section C below). 
254. The outcome of the review of Denmark comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/4), the views of Denmark concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/4/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>255. The delegation was honoured to address the plenary meeting devoted to the adoption 
of the outcome of Denmark&#8217;s first universal periodic review. It had been a privilege to be 
given this opportunity to engage in an open and constructive dialogue with members of the 
Human Rights Council and observer States on the situation of human rights in Denmark. 
</p>
<p>256. The delegation emphasized its strong support for the universal periodic review 
mechanism. Having taken part in the process, it now had an even better understanding of </p>


<p><b>116</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>the important role the universal periodic review plays in promoting human rights 
domestically and internationally. 
</p>
<p>257. The universal periodic review was a mechanism with the potential to improve 
human rights on the ground for the benefit of all individuals around the world. It gave each 
State involved a clear target and tools for the development of the domestic human rights 
agenda, and was a unique opportunity for States to have an open and candid debate on 
human rights among peers and with civil society. For those reasons in particular, Denmark 
strongly supported the mechanism. 
</p>
<p>258. The delegation emphasized the fact that the universal periodic review process had 
received considerable attention and had raised general awareness of human rights in 
Denmark. The attention was important and a key element in the continuous improvement in 
the human rights situation in Denmark as well as in other States. 
</p>
<p>259. The delegation took the opportunity to thank all members and observers of the 
Human Rights Council for their active contribution to a meaningful and credible dialogue 
on the human rights situation in Denmark, and the efforts to meet international obligations 
in this respect. The recommendations and constructive input received from other States and 
civil society organizations were the result of hard work and knowledge. In this regard, the 
delegation highlighted the special role played by civil society. From the outset, and in line 
with the guidelines of the Human Rights Council, it had been Denmark&#8217;s ambition to 
submit a national report that was reflective of society as a whole, not merely a product of 
various Government offices. Looking back at the entire process, the inclusion of civil 
society had proven to be one of its strongest features and had added significant value to the 
process. 
</p>
<p>260. Denmark received 133 recommendations, of which 82 had been agreed on, while 51 
had not been accepted. In many cases, the reason for not agreeing to a recommendation did 
not pertain to substance. The recommendations focused on nine thematic issues: 
international obligations, the rights to equality and non-discrimination, the human rights of 
migrants, legal rights and detention, freedom of expression, women&#8217;s rights, children&#8217;s 
rights, development policy, and Greenland and the Faroe Islands. All recommendations had 
been subject to careful scrutiny by all relevant authorities. 
</p><p>261. The delegation drew the attention of the Human Rights Council to the fact that, 
during the previous week, general elections had been held in Denmark and that a new 
Government had not yet taken office. 
</p>
<p>262. The delegation acknowledged that human rights challenges existed in Denmark, as 
they do elsewhere, and that the universal periodic review process continued to be an 
important factor in addressing those challenges. 
</p>
<p>263. The delegation highlighted the role played by civil society, including public hearings 
in the largest cities in Denmark, in Greenland and the Faroe Islands, as this had been a vital 
part of the Government&#8217;s initial scrutiny of the recommendations received. 
</p>
<p>264. The delegation expressed its gratitude to all parties involved for their invaluable 
support during the universal periodic review process, and thanked the troika and the 
secretariat for their constructive and effective cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>265. Algeria noted the acceptance of 82 of 133 recommendations, in different areas of 
human rights protection. Algeria was pleased to see the willingness of the Government to 
make further efforts to fight racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. It 
was pleased with the acceptance of its recommendations concerning appropriate measures </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>117 
</b></p>
<p>to ensure that search and arrest zones were not established on the basis of racial, ethnic or 
religious considerations, which could be assimilated to racial, ethnic or religious profiling. 
Algeria appreciated Denmark&#8217;s decision not to abrogate article 266 (b) of the Criminal 
Code guaranteeing that racial hate and hate speech did not remain unpunished. It took note 
of the decision not to accept the recommendation to adhere to the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. If 
Denmark aligned itself with recommendation No. 1737 of 17 March 2006 of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Algeria would encourage Denmark to 
ensure that migrants can claim their fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>266. The Islamic Republic of Iran thanked Denmark for its report. Fortunately, a number 
of the recommendations provided by different delegations during the session of the 
Working Group, including Iran, hoped that a number of recommendations examined by the 
Government would be implemented by Denmark. The Islamic Republic of Iran remained 
concerned over a number of human rights violations in the country, especially with regard 
to the lack of respect for other religions, the prevalence of hate speech, incitement to hatred 
and the defamation of Islamic religious symbols and personalities, and Islamophobia, the 
forcible return of asylum seekers to third countries, where they may face the danger of 
persecution or serious harm, and the lack of laws protecting women who are victims of 
domestic violence and sexual abuse. It called upon the Government to continue its efforts to 
prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence, in particular in the 
Faroe Islands and Greenland, and to incorporate international human rights instruments to 
which Denmark is a party into the legal system, as well as to ratify the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. 
</p>
<p>267. Romania acknowledged the high level of respect for human rights upheld by 
Denmark, and expressed its appreciation for the open and transparent way in which the 
country approached the universal periodic review. Denmark had prepared for its review in 
close cooperation with civil society and with the involvement of the authorities in 
Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Romania commended the openness of the Danish 
delegation in answering the issues raised during the interactive dialogue, showing the 
readiness of the authorities to tackle outstanding issues and to implement the 
recommendations accepted. Romania was looking forward to seeing progress in the 
implementation of the recommendations relating to, in particular, combating discrimination 
against women and the protection of victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>268. The Danish Institute for Human Rights acknowledged Denmark&#8217;s dedication to the 
universal periodic review process, but regretted that it had accepted only 82 of the 133 
recommendations made, focusing on matters that Denmark considered already addressed. It 
encouraged Denmark to reconsider its position with regard to a systematic approach to the 
promotion and protection of human rights, including a national plan of action; the 
ratification of core conventions, incorporating them into Danish law and accepting 
individual complaint mechanisms under international law; setting up strong and 
independent institutions, including an ombudsperson for children; adequate funding for 
national institutions, including in Greenland and the Faroe Islands; and specifying how 
accepted recommendations would be implemented. The institute would strive to ensure that 
the questions and recommendations from the Human Rights Council would be included in 
further dialogues in Denmark. 
</p>
<p>269. The Islamic Human Rights Commission highlighted the continuous discrimination 
towards Muslim citizens in Denmark. Muslims had been removed from boarding flights 
and held by police for reading books on Islam. The Commission stated that the European </p>


<p><b>118</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>Convention prohibited discrimination in article 14. Muslim women in Denmark faced 
prejudice in employment, because they wear a headscarf, and this was a violation to article 
11 of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It quoted article 
1 of the Declaration on Social Progress and Development on discrimination. It noted 
prejudice against Muslim citizens as common, such as the publication of a controversial 
cartoon of the prophet Muhammad. It urged Denmark to comply with human rights laws to 
which it was party, and to take measures to provide their citizens with a better 
understanding of Islam by promoting acceptance of its Muslim citizens and re-establishing 
tolerance towards them. 
</p>
<p>270. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation commended 
Denmark for its constructive participation in the universal periodic review process and 
appreciated the positive steps taken to ensure the full equality of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people, and took note of stakeholders&#8217; submissions indicating that Denmark 
required hormonal or surgical sex reassignment before legal recognition of gender identity 
was possible. It noted this practice breached the right to privacy and health. The Human 
Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe was of the view that these laws should be 
abolished and recommended that Denmark should take the steps necessary in this regard. It 
encouraged Denmark to include gender identity explicitly in its anti-discrimination 
legislation. It strongly urged Denmark to consider applying the Yogyakarta Principles on 
the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and 
Gender Identity as a guide to assist in policy development. 
</p>
<p>271. Save the Children regretted the fact that Denmark had not accepted the 
recommendations calling for the establishment of an ombudsman for children. It called on 
Denmark to implement the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to 
conduct an evaluation of the current monitoring system and to apply the findings to 
establish an independent body with the mandate, competence and authority to monitor the 
realization of children&#8217;s rights. It reminded Denmark of the Committee&#8217;s deep concerns on 
the issue of the age of criminal responsibility, and referred it to general comment No. 10 
thereon. It urged Denmark to meet rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in 
dealing with children in conflict with the law. It noted that recommendation No. 106.119 
called on the Government to revise the amendments to the Aliens Act with respect to 
unaccompanied and separated children seeking asylum. It deeply regretted the fact that 
Denmark had chosen not to revise the law, and called on the Government to ensure that the 
best interest of the child was enforced as the guiding principle in the Act when finding a 
durable solution for separated children or for children in asylum seeking families. It 
welcomed Denmark&#8217;s acceptance that the detention of refugees, migrants and asylum 
seekers should only be applied as a last resort. 
</p>
<p>272. Amnesty International was disappointed that most recommendations accepted were 
very general in nature and that substantive recommendations had been rejected. It urged the 
new Government to keep those recommendations under review. It appreciated the 
involvement of civil society in the preparation of the national report, although key input 
was absent from the final version of the report, and urged the authorities to ensure that 
future consultations were more substantive. It welcomed Denmark&#8217;s commitment to 
observe the principle of non-refoulement and not to resort to diplomatic assurances to 
circumvent it. It noted in this regard a recent decision by the courts regarding the case of 
the halting of the extradition of a Danish national. It regretted the fact that Denmark had 
rejected recommendations to conduct an evidence-based review of antiterrorism legislation, 
and noted its serious concerns about unfair procedures for terror suspects in deportation 
proceedings and weakened legal safeguards for the protection of privacy. It urged Denmark 
to bring legislation on rape into line with international law, and was disappointed that 
Denmark had rejected the recommendation to create an ombudsman for children&#8217;s rights. </p>

<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>273. The delegation expressed its sincere thanks for the comments made during the 
plenary session by members, observer States and from civil society. The head of the 
delegation made a personal remark with regard to the general elections that had taken place 
the previous week. Negotiations were continuing on the formation of the new Government, 
but the process could be expected to end soon. Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, 
the head of the delegation was sure that he could say also on behalf of the new Government 
that it would take all recommendations seriously and follow up on them according to the 
procedures of the Council and in other relevant forums. The delegation thanked the 
secretariat and the troika once again for their support in the process. 
</p>
<p><b>  Palau 
</b></p>
<p>274. The review of Palau was held on 3 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Palau in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/PLW/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/PLW/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/PLW/3). 
</p><p>275. At its 18th meeting, on 21 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Palau (see section C below). 
276. The outcome of the review of Palau comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/5), the views of Palau concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/5/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>277. The Director of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs of Palau, Jeffrey Antol, thanked the 
President of the Human Rights Council, the many States that had participated 
constructively in the session of the Working Group for Palau&#8217;s universal periodic review, 
the troika (Ecuador, the Republic of Moldova and Senegal), the secretariat and, in 
particular, Palau&#8217;s own civil society for their hard work and many contributions to the 
review. 
</p>
<p>278. Palau had found the universal periodic review to be a useful tool in assessing how it 
could improve in achieving its human rights goals, and had found the process to be a 
uniting agent for Government and civil society. The process had allowed Palau to identify 
human rights priorities and to take the steps necessary to ensure that fundamental human 
rights were not only realized but also promoted and protected in Palau. 
</p>
<p>279. Palau referred to the recently concluded forty-second Pacific Island Forum leaders&#8217; 
meeting, held in New Zealand, which had welcomed the successful participation of all 
Forum members in the first round of the universal periodic review as a major regional 
achievement. According to the leaders, the development of cooperation and the networks </p>


<p><b>120</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>created by this activity were an important source of human rights expertise for the entire 
region. 
</p>
<p>280. The Forum Leaders welcomed the presence of the Secretary-General. They 
expressed deep appreciation for the valuable contribution made by the United Nations to 
the Pacific region and highlighted the importance of its continuing support. In their 
discussions, the leaders also reaffirmed the shared values and principles of the Pacific 
Islands Forum and the United Nations, including important commitments to human rights, 
the rule of law, good governance and democracy. 
</p>
<p>281. On 20 September 2011, at the margins of the sixty-sixth session of the General 
Assembly, the President of Palau, Johnson Toribiong, signed the remaining core United 
Nations human rights treaties to which Palau was not a party, namely, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. This was a monumental accomplishment for Palau, as it was a 
State party only to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>282. Palau acknowledged the assistance of the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat, the 
secretariat of the Pacific Community Regional Rights Resource Team and the Pacific 
Regional Office of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for their 
support in the universal periodic review process for Palau. 
</p>
<p>283. Palau recalled that, during the Working Group session, it received 106 
recommendations and had already responded to 64 of them. Further consultation and 
consideration was required to respond to the other 42 recommendations made. A 
consultation had been held recently with relevant Government agencies and representatives 
of civil society to assess the various recommendations. 
</p>
<p>284. Palau had noted the recommendations made to accede to or ratify human rights 
treaties in general and specific treaties. It was consulting and working towards public 
awareness about these instruments and determining its capacity and resources to fulfil its 
obligations under those treaties. 
</p>
<p>285. With regard to the establishment of a national human rights institution, Palau had 
accepted this recommendation. It continued to work with the Pacific Islands Forum 
secretariat and the Asia Pacific Forum through consultations to develop awareness and 
determine the capacity and resources of Palau to fulfil its relevant obligations. A 
consultation on this matter had been conducted in August 2011 with the assistance of the 
Pacific Islands Forum secretariat, the Asia Pacific Forum and OHCHR. The consultation 
involved key Government officials, including members of the National Congress and 
relevant Government ministries and agencies. The outcome of the consultation would 
determine the move towards the establishment of a national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>286. With regard to the status of children born to foreign parents, Palau had noted this 
recommendation. Palau clarified that its legislative body might address this issue. It 
accepted the recommendation on the minimum age of criminal responsibility. Palau took 
note of the recommendation on the treatment of female prisoners. Its prison system had 
standards protecting women prisoners in line with the Bangkok Rules. The 
recommendations relating to the sexual exploitation of children and child labour had been 
accepted by Palau, which would apply its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. Palau accepted the recommendations to modify or amend its current legislation </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>121 
</b></p>
<p>on the criminalization of sexual relations of consenting adults of the same sex, in 
accordance with international standards. It accepted recommendations on the age of 
marriage and would take appropriate measures to modify or amend legislation in 
accordance with international standards. Lastly, Palau accepted the recommendations 
relating to refugees and asylum seekers, and would take measures to enact appropriate 
legislation in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>287. Palau looked forward to sharing its progress on the promotion and protection of 
human rights in four years&#8217; time. Palau was fully committed to its human rights obligations 
and responsibilities and reiterated its appeal to the international community for assistance, 
both technically and financially, in its efforts to carry out its human rights responsibilities in 
the implementation of human rights treaties and the Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>288. Algeria expressed satisfaction with Palau&#8217;s encouraging human rights record. 
Algeria acknowledged the challenge faced by Palau in implementing all the 
recommendations accepted. It appreciated Palau&#8217;s decision to sign core human rights 
instruments at the session of the General Assembly, thus demonstrating its engagement to 
implement the recommendations received. Algeria appealed to the international community 
to provide Palau with adequate assistance so that it could fulfil its human rights obligations. 
Algeria recommended that Palau should further review the possible ratification of human 
rights instruments to which it was not a party, and should establish a national human rights 
institution. Such action would further consolidate the progress made on the promotion and 
protection of human rights, including food security, the Millennium Development Goals, 
combating human trafficking and discrimination and improving the situation of migrant 
workers. 
</p>
<p>289. Morocco noted Palau&#8217;s exemplary cooperation with the universal periodic review. It 
welcomed Palau&#8217;s acceptance of more than 64 recommendations during the session of the 
Working Group, 3 of which were made by Morocco. Morocco had invited Palau to 
continue consultations for the establishment of a national human rights institution; to 
continue to promote and protect vulnerable persons and activities for the elaboration of a 
national policy for persons with disabilities; and to study the possibility of adopting a law 
addressing domestic violence and creating structures for sheltering and protecting victims 
of violence. Morocco congratulated the State&#8217;s commitment to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals, despite the difficulties faced, notably a lack of human and financial 
resources. Morocco supported Palau in its efforts to improve its human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>290. New Zealand was pleased that Palau had accepted many recommendations and had 
pledged to extend a standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders. It 
commended Palau for having started work on assessing the resources necessary to fulfil its 
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Palau was also 
implementing New Zealand&#8217;s recommendation to enact laws to protect married women 
from rape, to ensure that women were not discriminated against in family inheritance, and 
to protect women from domestic violence. The provision of facilities for temporary shelter 
and protection for women who were victims of domestic violence was noted. Work was 
under way to implement its recommendation to improve enforcement of regulations to 
protect foreign workers and to extend coverage of minimum wage requirements to include 
foreign workers. New Zealand also welcomed Palau&#8217;s commitment and work in progress to 
establish a national human rights institution. </p>


<p><b>122</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>291. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended Palau&#8217;s commitment to 
equality and non-discrimination, particularly its acceptance of the recommendation to 
decriminalize sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex and to amend 
current legislation to bring it into line with international standards. It asked about the 
timetable proposed for this reform. The Network welcomed Palau&#8217;s acceptance of the 
recommendation to combat discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
people through political, legislative and administrative measures, and encouraged Palau to 
work together with civil society on this matter. It called on Palau to provide sensitivity 
training to police, judicial and other authorities in order to promote respect for all persons, 
including on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and to ensure that 
lesbian, gay and transgender citizens are treated equally by State authorities. The Network 
urged Palau to consider applying the Yogyakarta Principles to assist in policy development. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>292. Palau thanked the previous speakers for their interventions, comments and support, 
which had been noted and would be considered. The signing by the President of Palau of all 
the remaining core human rights treaties in New York the previous day was viewed as 
monumental progress for the country. The Human Rights Council and Member States were 
thanked for their support. 
</p>
<p><b>  Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>293. The review of Somalia was held on 3 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Somalia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SOM/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SOM/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SOM/3). 
</p><p>294. At its 20th meeting, on 21 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Somalia (see section C below). 
295. The outcome of the review of Somalia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/6), the views of Somalia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations, conclusions, its 
voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>296. The delegation of Somalia, headed by Ambassador Yusuf M.I. Bari Bari, stated that 
the ongoing famine, caused by the worst drought in 60 years, was aggravating the already 
dire situation of the Somali people, especially in the southern and central regions of 
Somalia. Apart from the failure of the rain season, it was important to mention other factors 
contributing to the famine, including traditional agropastoralists abandoning their fields 
owing to the insecurity or being recruited to fight for Al-Shabaab, severe deforestation for 
charcoal production and harsh living conditions under Al-Shabaab. Access to renewable 
sources of energy, together with a new culture of planting trees and protecting biodiversity, </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>123 
</b></p>
<p>would be critical in addressing this issue. Somalia had repeatedly warned the international 
community about the risk of a potential crisis and humanitarian disaster, but no one paid 
attention to the information provided by Somalia. 
</p>
<p>297. The prolonged internal armed conflicts had for more than two decades weakened 
Somalia&#8217;s legal, political and social infrastructure. However, Somalia had recently made 
important achievements. On 6 September, following consultations with all relevant 
stakeholders, the Transitional Federal Government, the regional administrations of Puntland 
and Galmudug and the Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama&#8217;a movement had adopted a road map for 
ending the transition. The Kampala Accord of 9 June 2011 had permitted a one-year 
extension to the transitional federal institutions, and the road map set out the steps to 
implement the Accord. The road map contained four priority tasks for ending the transition 
before 20 August 2012, namely, security, constitution, reconciliation, and good governance. 
The Transitional Federal Government and other stakeholders also agreed that the road map 
would be implemented in accordance with the principles of Somali ownership, inclusivity 
and participation, and monitoring and compliance with the benchmarks and timelines as 
prescribed by the Kampala Accord. 
</p>
<p>298. The Government of Somalia was committed to continuing this pattern of 
consultation and inclusivity. The second consultative meeting under the road map would be 
held in Puntland in October 2011, and focus on the draft constitution. The Government had 
also invited Al-Shabaab to lay down their arms and join the table for peaceful negotiations 
and dialogue, without preconditions. 
</p>
<p>299. The Government of Somalia praised the civil society bodies working in Somalia for 
their valuable contributions; for example, the newly-constituted National Disaster 
Management Agency was made up entirely of individuals from Somali civil society. The 
Government reiterated its commitment to engaging proactively with civil society, and 
encouraged it to continue to work with the Government to support the national agenda for 
change. 
</p>
<p>300. Despite the constraints and challenges, Somalia had engaged proactively with the 
Human Rights Council for the past three and half years, resulting in the adoption of five 
important resolutions and the outcome of the stand-alone interactive dialogue on technical 
assistance to Somalia. Another key achievement of Somalia in 2011, in terms of its 
engagements with international human rights mechanisms, was the submission and 
presentation of its universal periodic review national report in Geneva on 3 May 2011, the 
first time that Somalia had been able to prepare a national report and engage with a human 
rights mechanism, productively and cooperatively, since 1984. 
</p>
<p>301. The lack of engagement in the past 25 years should not, however, be interpreted as a 
lack of interest or a lack of respect for human rights. Somali culture was imbued with 
humanitarianism and respect for human rights. In times of hostilities, the <i>Biri-Ma-Geydo</i> 
(&#8220;spared from the spear&#8221;), namely, Somalia&#8217;s own &#8220;Geneva Conventions&#8221;, which came into 
existence long before the adoption of the Hague and Geneva Conventions, mitigated and 
regulated the conduct of clan hostilities and the treatment of certain groups. 
</p>
<p>302. Somalia was committed to making human rights the foundation of the transition to a 
new Somalia based on democratic values. Nonetheless, the implementation of human rights 
could not be achieved by Somalia alone, and cooperation with and technical assistance for 
Somalia in the field of human rights was essential to make progress. It was critical that the 
key tasks in the road map be accomplished on time, with the strong political will in Somalia 
and the support of the international community. 
</p>
<p>303. The Government called on States to continue to provide the country with urgent 
assistance to enable the Government to extend the territory under its control and to deliver 
services, and to prevent warlords from re-emerging to fill the vacuum left by the </p>


<p><b>124</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>withdrawal of Al-Shabaab. Sustained bilateral cooperation and the deployment of military 
engineering corps would be crucial to better deliver much-needed basic social services, in 
particular the drilling of water boreholes, the opening of humanitarian corridors, expanding 
and maintaining humanitarian spaces, and training and equipping the new Somali civil and 
environmental protection units at the national and subnational levels. 
</p>
<p>304. The Government appealed to friendly countries for support and assistance, at the 
national and subnational levels, to better coordinate the significant bilateral humanitarian 
aid and assistance currently received in Somalia. Better coordination of aid efforts would 
ensure that the assistance reached the most vulnerable and needy throughout Somalia, and 
also help to protect humanitarian and aid workers. The recent road map provided a unique 
framework and benchmarks for coordinating bilateral cooperation in aid, rehabilitation and 
development, at the national and subnational levels, to assist Somalia in its transition. 
</p>
<p>305. The Government of Somalia paid the utmost attention to and had respect for each 
and every recommendation, and was pleased to accept, or accept in part, all of the 155 
recommendations received. In the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/18/6/Add.1), 
Somalia had also identified and explained the areas where it urgently requested bilateral 
assistance and capacity-building in order to be able to implement these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>306. Somalia took its participation in the universal periodic review exercise as an 
important opportunity to reflect on and take stock of its situation of human rights, and 
anticipated the progress that it hoped it would be able to show in four years&#8217; time. Both the 
national report presented in May and the report of the Working Group were entirely 
Somali-developed and owned. The adoption of Somalia&#8217;s universal periodic review report 
marked the end of one cycle and the beginning of a new one. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>307. Algeria commended Somalia for having accepted all the recommendations it had 
received. In consultation with Somalia, the international community should try to find 
lasting solutions to the humanitarian crisis. The limited assistance to combat famine would 
not be sufficient unless donors helped the country to increase its institutional capacity for 
managing the crisis. 
</p>
<p>308. Cuba referred to a number of challenges that Somalia faced, including internal 
conflict, the lack of food and the recent droughts, and the lack of adequate health 
infrastructures. It noted that all those problems would have a negative impact on the 
implementation of the recommendations made during the universal periodic review. 
International cooperation was therefore necessary to help Somalia to address its challenges 
and to meet its call for international assistance. 
</p>
<p>309. The United States of America welcomed Somalia&#8217;s acceptance of all the 
recommendations made and urged the delegation to provide additional information on the 
recommendations partially accepted. Long-term peace and stability in Somalia lay in the 
establishment of effective governance based on a process of inclusive political dialogue and 
reconciliation. It welcomed the recommendations on violations of human rights in the 
conduct of war and the Government&#8217;s commitment to them. It also underlined the 
recommendations focused on the use of children in armed conflict and looked forward to 
receiving an update from Somalia during the second cycle. 
</p>
<p>310. Saudi Arabia commended Somalia for its pledge to protect and promote human 
rights, which was demonstrated by, inter alia, the cooperation of Somalia with all human 
rights mechanisms. It noted that, despite the existing challenges, Somalia made efforts to 
guarantee fundamental rights, including the right to food. Saudi Arabia appreciated the </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>125 
</b></p>
<p>positive cooperation of Somalia with international and regional institutions to address the 
crisis of recent months. 
</p>
<p>311. Mauritania commended Somalia for the way it prepared for its universal periodic 
review, particularly since the country was enduring extremely difficult circumstances. It 
called on international organizations to intervene urgently and to assist millions of children, 
women and elderly people who were threatened daily with death or forced to leave the 
country because of the economic and social situation. 
</p>
<p>312. Qatar commended Somalia for its efforts to strengthen human rights protection by, 
inter alia, cooperating with United Nations human rights mechanisms. It highlighted the 
need for the international community to grant technical and financial assistance to Somalia 
to address the serious crisis in the country and to strengthen its capacity to implement the 
recommendations made during the session of the Working Group. Qatar also called on all 
parties in Somalia to take responsibility to end the conflict and ensure peace and security. 
</p>
<p>313. Morocco stated that Somalia needed assistance and aid to reconstruct the country 
and its institutions and to complete the process of reconciliation, stability and peace. 
Morocco appealed to countries, international organizations and the private sector to help the 
Somali people to protect the right to life, which was the basis of all other rights. 
</p>
<p>314. Bahrain commended Somalia for its efforts made in a number of areas, including 
access to health, education and water. While noting changes in the situation in the country, 
Bahrain stated that many challenges still remained and that constructive dialogue among all 
parties was necessary to address those challenges. It called on the Government to respect its 
commitments under international human rights law and humanitarian law. Bahrain also 
urged civil society organizations to make serious efforts in cooperation with the 
Government to help those in need. 
</p>
<p>315. Israel appreciated the submission of the national report for the eleventh session of 
the universal periodic review, especially in the light of the difficulties and challenges that 
Somalia was facing. OHCHR should ensure all efforts were made to provide assistance to 
Somalia. In this regard, Israel looked forward to the OHCHR high-level technical mission. 
Israel reiterated its willingness to assist in efforts to restore peace and prosperity in 
Somalia, and urged the international community to provide support for the Transitional 
Federal Government in the areas of technical assistance and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>316. The United Arab Emirates noted the political will and determination demonstrated 
by the Government to strengthen human rights protection. It also appreciated the efforts of 
the Government to involve civil society in the implementation of the recommendations. The 
United Arab Emirates highlighted the need to provide Somalia with assistance to address its 
challenges, and implement its human rights obligations and fulfil the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>317. Italy was heartened by the fact that Somalia had accepted, fully or partly, all 155 
recommendations received. This conveyed a clear political signal about the resolve of the 
Somali authorities to uphold the cause of human rights. Italy encouraged the Transitional 
Federal Government to continue along this path. It remained actively involved in 
international efforts aimed at achieving reconciliation and stabilization in Somalia, as well 
as the social and economic development of its people.

<p><b>126</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>conflict, and that an international conference for the reconstruction of Somalia be held. It 
finally declared that the African Union Mission in Somalia should have more means. 
</p>
<p>319. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies welcomed the acceptance by Somalia 
of the recommendations regarding the establishment of a mechanism to investigate war 
crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on the authorities to ensure that those 
responsible for atrocities were brought to justice in fair trials. It also urged the Somali 
authorities to carry out effective and impartial investigations into killings of and attacks 
against journalists and civil society actors in the areas under their control, and to ensure that 
human rights defenders and journalists could carry out their activities freely. 
</p><p>320. Human Rights Watch continued to document cases of children associated with the 
Government armed forces and Government-aligned militias, and urged the Transitional 
Federal Government to establish urgently effective and systematic age vetting procedures, 
and to develop, with the assistance of the United Nations, a concrete plan to eradicate the 
use of child soldiers. The request made by the Government for the assistance of OHCHR 
and concerned countries to improve accountability mechanisms should be acted upon 
promptly. It called on the Government to impose a moratorium on the death penalty 
immediately. 
</p>
<p>321. Amnesty International, while welcoming the acceptance by Somalia of the 
recommendations to guarantee freedom of expression, referred to two cases of killings of 
and attacks against journalists. Despite the expressed commitment to establish a 
moratorium on the use of death penalty, 2 individuals had been executed and 17 sentenced 
to death by a military court. 
</p>
<p>322. International Educational Development stated that the Government of Somalia 
should be honoured for its commitment to promote and protect human rights in Somalia 
even in the midst of war. Because Somalia was at a breaking point, the international 
community should act outside its purview. It was difficult for Somalia to apply universal 
periodic review recommendations, and the first responsibility of the international 
community was to provide immediate and adequate humanitarian aid and to take all 
possible measures to deliver it to those in need. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>323. In response to the intervention of stakeholders, the delegation of Somalia stated that 
the Government was in the process of ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
which was signed in 2002, and the Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>  Seychelles 
</b></p>
<p>324. The review of Seychelles was held on 4 May 2011, in conformity with all relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Seychelles in accordance with the annex to 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SYC/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SYC/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SYC/3). 
</p><p>325. At its 20th meeting, on 21 September 2011, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Seychelles (see section C below). </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>127 
</b></p>
<p>326. The outcome of the review of Seychelles comprised the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/7), the views of Seychelles 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>327. Reflecting on the way ahead, the President of Seychelles stated that the country had 
to work harder and to be more productive. The President added that a reinvigorated 
economy would bring more benefits and opportunities to the country&#8217;s young people, and 
that measures and strategies divorced from the human element had no real sense. 
</p>
<p>328. In Seychelles, the concept of a great nation was not defined by its budget surplus or 
bank reserves, but by the happiness index of each one of its citizens, which is called 
&#8220;people-centred development&#8221;. It meant a development that took into consideration the 
individuals that made up the workforce and that also took special care of other people. 
</p>
<p>329. Concomitant with the development in tourism, fishing, financial services and others, 
Seychelles had always provided the elements necessary for the development of the most 
valuable resource a country could have: the human resource. 
</p>
<p>330. Seychelles stated that its legislative framework encompassed the mechanisms 
necessary to secure economic growth and the implementation of social programmes, while 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people were safeguarded. 
</p>
<p>331. In this endeavour, Seychelles welcomed the assistance of numerous partners, from 
friendly States to regional and international organizations, such as the African Commission 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the European Union. Seychelles conveyed its special 
gratitude to the Human Rights Council for being one of these partners. The Council had 
given guidance throughout the whole procedure of the universal periodic review, and had 
even assisted with funds for the participation of its delegates in the sessions. 
</p>
<p>332. Seychelles had accepted the recommendations on ratification or accession to 
international human rights treaties. In general, the Government of Seychelles found no 
impediment to acceding to or ratifying these international instruments; it would, however, 
maintain its policy, which entailed that treaties would be submitted for approval in 
accordance with the Seychelles procedure for the execution of treaties; by implementing the 
appropriate provision of the Constitution, all relevant ministries, departments and national 
stakeholders would be consulted, the concerned treaty would be submitted to the scrutiny of 
the executive and the legislative, and the recommendations for approval would be based on 
national socioeconomic conditions, plans and priorities. 
</p>
<p>333. Seychelles had accepted the recommendations on the national human rights 
institution. Its national human rights commission already abided by some of the Paris 
Principles, as contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 48/134. A change in 
the scope of the commission&#8217;s functions, powers and membership would require an 
amendment to the Protection of the Human Rights Act of 2009. It might also entail other 
administrative measures, such as budget allocation or its increase. The Government would 
review the proposal in due time. 
</p>
<p>334. Seychelles had accepted the recommendations on elections. More specific comments 
thereon would be published in the statement to be posted on the extranet of the Human 
Rights Council. With regard to the recommendation that the national human rights 
commission monitor the elections, the delegation stated that it could be invited to do so. 
</p>
<p>335. Seychelles had also accepted the recommendations on media. </p>


<p><b>128</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>336. The delegation stated that the recommendations concerning reporting commitments 
under international human rights treaties had been accepted. Further steps to ameliorate the 
implementation of the strategy to address the preparation and submission of outstanding 
reports to treaty monitoring bodies were being taken by the Government, and the work on 
the preparation of some outstanding reports had been initiated. Work had already started for 
the preparation of national reports to be submitted to the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>337. Seychelles had accepted the recommendation that would allow special procedures 
mandate holders to visit Seychelles to monitor and report on human rights issues in the 
country. The standing invitation to the special procedures would be extended. 
</p>
<p>338. The recommendations on gender had been accepted, and there would be further 
clarifications in a more comprehensive statement to be posted on the extranet of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>339. The recommendations on domestic violence and protection of women and children 
had also been accepted. Statutory laws against domestic violence and for the protection of 
women and children were already in place, as were the mechanisms for review of these 
laws so as to make them more suited to the needs of protecting women and children. 
Moreover, the Government had approved the recommendation of the Department of Social 
Affairs to give full and due support and commitment to ensure the realization of the 
national gender-based violence strategy and of the funded plan of action, which was 
especially linked to the training of stakeholders, such as judiciary and the police, and to 
responding to the holistic needs of victims and perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>340. The delegation stated that Seychelles would not accept the recommendations 
concerning the age of criminal responsibility, although it was open to review them again in 
the future. The delegation added that section 15 of the Penal Code expressly provided that a 
person below the age of 7 was not criminally liable, while those in between the age of 7 and 
12 would be liable if they knew that they should not do the acts giving rise to the offences. 
The delegation also stated that while the principle of limited liability depending on one&#8217;s 
mental capacity was universal, there was no universally accepted age of criminal 
responsibility. Seychelles considered that the relevant provisions in the Penal Code should 
remain as they were. Therefore, for the time being, Seychelles would not raise the 
minimum age of criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>341. Seychelles had accepted the recommendations on youth. The standards set out in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child referred to the United Nations Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules). The Government of 
Seychelles recommended, as an immediate measure, that there be dissemination of these 
rules, in particular to the institutions and agencies directly involved in juvenile justice. In 
due time, the content of the Standard Minimum Rules would be separately submitted to the 
Executive so as to obtain its formal approval and guarantee their introduction and 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>342. The recommendations on the judiciary had been accepted. Further comments would 
be available in a more comprehensive statement to be posted on the extranet of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>343. The recommendations on sexual orientation had been accepted. The delegation 
stated that the Constitution of Seychelles made provision for all persons to be free from 
discrimination on all grounds. Article 27 of the Constitution stated that every person had a 
right to equal protection of the law, without discrimination on any ground, except as is 
necessary in a democratic society. The one provision in the Penal Code for &#8220;sodomy&#8221; did 
not directly discriminate homosexuals as it was intended to penalize the offence of sodomy 
as such. This provision had never been applied to anyone. The Government would decide </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>129 
</b></p>
<p>when and to what extent the legislation could be amended to better guarantee the 
Constitutional precept that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual persons were not to be 
discriminated in Seychelles. 
</p>
<p>344. Seychelles had accepted the recommendations on health. Additional explanations 
would be found in a more comprehensive statement to be posted on the extranet of the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>345. The recommendations on water had been accepted. Provisional statistics from the 
2010 census indicated that most households received treated water from the mains supply 
of the Public Utilities Company. However, during periods of prolonged low rainfall, the 
Company implemented its emergency plans, which entailed restrictions at different 
intervals and areas to ensure a reasonable stock of water. The Company was also expected 
to set up seven desalination plants, which would increase the capacity supply to 17 million 
litres of water per day. One was already being connected, which would yield 1 million litres 
of water, and the rest were expected to be connected and ready to produce water within the 
next two months. At the same time, the Company was also implementing its drought action 
plan, which was aimed at completing projects that would maximize the use of the country&#8217;s 
water resources. 
</p>
<p>346. On other various miscellaneous recommendations, the delegation indicated the 
positions of Seychelles. 
</p>
<p>347. Seychelles had accepted the recommendations to implement the recommendations of 
the constitutional review of 2008. 
</p>
<p>348. In the context of the constitutional review Seychelles had also accepted to bring the 
Public Order Act governing public assemblies into line with the principles of the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>349. Seychelles had accepted the recommendation to continue the adoption and 
implementation of public policies aimed at protecting persons with disabilities and to 
ensure their equal access to dignified housing, employment and health. 
</p>
<p>350. Seychelles had accepted the recommendation to consider the possibility of adopting 
non-custodial sentences where feasible, as well as measures to reintegrate the prison 
population into society. Activities to reintegrate offenders into society had been undertaken 
by specialized staff at the prison. Also, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act of 1996 
afforded an offender the opportunity to start afresh after a period of abstention from crime, 
as it prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of convictions in respect of these offences. 
</p>
<p>351. Seychelles had not accepted the recommendation to put in place an independent 
police complaints commission. The Government was of the view that, at the present time, 
there was no need to establish such a dedicated commission, given that complaints against 
the police were largely filed on the grounds of poor service delivery rather than for abuse of 
power by the police. 
</p>
<p>352. Seychelles had accepted the recommendation that it put in place appropriate 
mechanisms to ensure that individuals and members of the political opposition were able to 
take part freely in public rallies and peaceful demonstrations, and to express their views 
without fear of reprisal, using any form of media. 
</p>
<p>353. Seychelles had accepted the recommendation that it consider devising and 
implementing a national strategy for human rights education, which would cover both the 
formal educational sector and a wider public for enhancing human rights awareness. 
</p>
<p>354. Seychelles had accepted the recommendation that it request the technical assistance 
and cooperation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations accepted during 
its universal periodic review. </p>


<p><b>130</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>355. The first universal periodic review of Seychelles had been a very fruitful and 
enriching experience for various reasons, including the wide national consultation 
undertaken during the preparation of the national report, and the detailed scrutiny of that 
report by the participants in the Working Group, which made 77 recommendations. The 
recommendations, together with an information note on the steps in the process, had been 
presented to the Cabinet of Ministers, including the Vice-President and the President of 
Seychelles. Seychelles had made full use of this important process, and learned more about 
good practices in the implementation and enforcement of human rights. 
</p>
<p>356. The objective of increasing awareness of human rights at all levels had been 
achieved and the Government had been once more convinced of the need to keep in place 
the mechanisms that would allow continuity in awareness-raising. Neither the adoption of 
the outcome of Seychelles in the Council plenary nor the publication of the report on its 
Universal Periodic Review would be the end of the process. Seychelles would be attentive 
to the views and recommendations of its national and international partners. 
</p>
<p>357. The delegation thanked the Human Rights Council, the representatives of 
participating Member States, observer States and United Nations agencies for 
accompanying Seychelles in the construction of the small but great nation that it was. 
Seychelles looked forward to working together in order to make its second universal 
periodic review another rewarding and fruitful experience. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>358. Algeria took note of the responses provided by Seychelles to the recommendations 
made during the session of the Working Group, including the three recommendations made 
by Algeria on the accreditation and strengthening of the national human rights institution, 
the submission of reports to treaty bodies and the strengthening of efforts to fight social ills, 
such as the use of drugs. Algeria reiterated its satisfaction with the progress accomplished 
in the realization of the Millennium Development Goals, which had had a positive effect on 
the enjoyment of human rights. This was of particular importance for an island developing 
nation, also in the light of its vulnerability to climate change. Algeria also expressed its 
solidarity with Seychelles in its fight against piracy. 
</p>
<p>359. Cuba noted that Seychelles was a small country that had suffered from colonialism 
and had been faced with a number of limitations and challenges, including those in 
connection with globalization, climate change and piracy. Nevertheless, by pursuing a 
development approach focused on the human being, it had made considerable progress in 
the area of human rights; for example, Seychelles had achieved most of the Millennium 
Development Goals and reached a 100 per cent enrolment rate in primary education, as well 
as very high rates of literacy and immunization of children. Its social indicators were 
among the highest in the region. Cuba noted that it had made a modest contribution to these 
efforts through long-standing cooperation, and it encouraged the Seychelles to pursue 
further its socioeconomic development plans. 
</p>
<p>360. Morocco stated that the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and the 
level of human development in Seychelles should encourage specialized international 
institutions to provide Seychelles with technical assistance that it deemed necessary to 
accompany its national efforts to meet the challenges leading to the vulnerability of its 
economy. International cooperation was particularly desirable in the fight against piracy 
and with regard to the scourge of climate change, both of which had a negative impact on 
human rights. Morocco highlighted certain initiatives, such as the creation of the media 
commission, the strategic plan of the judiciary and the code of judicial conduct. Morocco 
welcomed the fact that Seychelles had accepted a large number of recommendations, 
including those made by Morocco with respect to gender mainstreaming in public policies, </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>the reintegration of the prison population into society and the right of universal access to 
drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>361. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted with satisfaction 
the progress made by Seychelles towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It 
also welcomed the creation of a gender secretariat and the national commission for child 
protection. It observed, however, that rape and domestic violence remained important 
problems and that the number of people affected by HIV/AIDS was on the rise. 
Improvements could still be made with regard to freedom of expression in the media. 
External factors, such as climate change and acts of piracy, had a negative impact on the 
enjoyment of human rights. Noting that the economy was to a large extent dependent on 
fisheries and tourism, the organization invited the international community to provide 
constructive assistance to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Lastly, it welcomed 
the advances made in health care and the reduction of child and maternal mortality, as well 
as the high level of other social indicators. 
</p>
<p>362. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the confirmation provided by 
Seychelles that article 27 of the Constitution prohibited discrimination on all grounds, 
including sexual orientation. It remained concerned, however, by the fact that section 151 
of the Criminal Code penalized sexual activity between consenting adults. It reiterated its 
recommendation that the relevant provision be repealed in order to bring current legislation 
into line with international standards, and requested Seychelles to indicate a time frame for 
this action. The Network welcomed the provision of the Employment Act that protects 
individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation, and enquired about the other 
steps being taken or being planned to advance non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Lastly, it encouraged Seychelles to consider adopting the 
Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to 
sexual orientation and gender identity. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>363. In reply to the questions asked by the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, the 
delegation of Seychelles stated that section 151 of the Criminal Code could be repealed 
within a short period of time. Seychelles was aware that this provision was obsolete. 
</p>
<p>364. With regard to the steps being taken or planned to advance non-discrimination on 
the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, the delegation stated that the first step 
would be to repeal the referred section in the Penal Code. The Government&#8217;s position on 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons could then be disseminated. 
</p>
<p>365. The fact that the outcome of the universal periodic review, including the 
recommendations from other States and the positions of the Government, would be 
published in a report would be a very important step for the dissemination of efforts that 
Seychelles could make to ensure better guarantees that these people would not be 
discriminated. 
</p>
<p><b>  Solomon Islands 
</b></p>
<p>366. The review of the Solomon Islands was held on 4 May 2011 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Solomon Islands in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLB/1); </p>


<p><b>132</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p> (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLB/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLB/3 and A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLB/3/Corr.1). 
</p><p>367. At its 20th meeting, on 21 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of the Solomon Islands (see section C below). 
368. The outcome of the review of Solomon Islands comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/8), the views of Solomon Islands 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>369. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Solomon Islands 
acknowledged the contribution of all stakeholders to the review, including such Pacific 
regional agencies as the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the 
Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>370. The delegation recalled that it had needed time to consult with relevant stakeholders, 
both from within and outside Government, on some recommendations. A consultation had 
been held with relevant Government agencies and representatives of civil society to assess 
the recommendations, the results of which were to be presented to the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p>371. The Solomon Islands had received, in total, 115 recommendations, 57 of which it 
had accepted and 49 were considered to have been already implemented or in the process of 
implementation. The Government&#8217;s position on 58 recommendations had been postponed. 
</p>
<p>372. Regarding the deferred recommendations that enjoyed the support of the Solomon 
Islands, the delegation stated that the Government was deeply committed to the 
international human rights standards and principles set out in United Nations conventions 
and treaties. Therefore, recommendations 81.1&#8211;81.17 relating to ratification of or accession 
to international treaties and conventions enjoyed the support of the Government. 
</p><p>373. The delegation recognized that, for international human rights standards and 
principles to become a reality for the Solomon Islands, it was necessary to incorporate them 
into domestic laws. It also recognized that the process of treaty reporting provided further 
guidelines for the implementation of human rights. The Solomon Islands supported 
recommendations 81.18, 81.33&#8211;81.35 and 81.38 on reporting under conventions and 
treaties, and the implementation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>374. The Law Reform Commission of the Solomon Islands had terms of references to 
review the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, which would address many of the 
recommendations on the areas of violence against women, sexual offences and sexual 
violence, rape, corporal punishment and criminal responsibility. The Commission also had 
a reference to review the Islander&#8217;s Marriage Act. As such, the Solomon Islands was 
already strengthening its legal framework to promote and protect the rights of women and 
to advance gender equality. Thus, it supported the recommendations on the promotion and 
protection of the rights of women (recommendations 81.19, 81.23&#8211;81.29, 81.47 and 81.52). 
</p><p>375. The Solomon Islands had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and, 
with the support of civil society and international organizations, had progressed to consider </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>133 
</b></p>
<p>the means by which the standards and principles in the Convention could be implemented. 
It therefore supported recommendations 81.39&#8211;81.41, 81.45, 81.48 and 81.56&#8211;81.58. 
</p>
<p>376. The Solomon Islands recognized the rights of persons with disabilities. The 
Government was also, however, conscious of resource constraints that could hinder the 
implementation of certain economic, social and cultural rights. It would nonetheless 
seriously consider the recommendations on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
persons with disabilities (recommendations 81.30&#8211;81.32). 
</p><p>377. As an island State that had experienced some of the negative effects of climate 
change, the Solomon Islands supported recommendations 81.34 and 81.36, which called for 
measures to respond to climate change. 
</p>
<p>378. The Government had pledged to facilitate further the peace process set out in 
recommendations 81.42 and 81.43, and supported the recommendations on considering the 
promotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights 
(recommendations 81.20, 81.22 and 81.37, 81.53&#8211;81.55) and on legislative and judicial 
reform (recommendations 81.44 and 81.46). 
</p><p>379. Concerning recommendations that were only partially accepted, the delegation 
stated that the Solomon Islands was unable to accept fully at this time recommendation 
81.21, which called for changes to property and inheritance legal frameworks. The 
Government would consider amending the legal framework with regard to the custody of 
children, but it was not yet ready to change property and inheritance laws. Most of the 
perceived inconsistencies with internationally accepted standards of property ownership 
and inheritance were due largely to long-defined customary laws, which viewed land 
ownership and inheritance very differently. To seek to change or amend the constitution to 
do away with such customary practices would require thorough, nationwide consultation. 
</p>
<p>380. With regard to the recommendations that were not supported, the delegation stated 
that, while the Government acknowledged and recognized international human rights 
standards, it would be too early, within the context of the Solomon Islands, to discuss the 
decriminalization of sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex. Such an 
issue would require thorough national consultations to address Christian doctrines and 
cultural perspectives on the issue. Consequently, it could not support recommendations 
81.49&#8211;81.51 on sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex. 
</p>
<p>381. In closing, the delegation recognized that the universal periodic review had been a 
unique opportunity to enhance and promote active dialogue between Government and civil 
society. It valued the views from civil society groups and acknowledged their invaluable 
input. The Government would continue to work hard to enhance this relationship. The 
universal periodic review represented an important source of human rights expertise for the 
entire region. 
</p>
<p>382. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also reported that, at the regional level, there was 
already strong support for the universal periodic review, which would help in the 
implementation of the various recommendations. The recent summit of Forum leaders in 
Auckland recognized the review mechanism and supported Governments in this initiative, 
acknowledging the wide partnerships formed in the process. 
</p>
<p>383. Furthermore, Pacific leaders had brought to the forefront the issue of sexual and 
gender-based violence following the recent establishment of a forum reference group to 
address sexual and gender-based violence, based on a commitment made in 2009 to 
eradicate such violence and to ensure all individuals have equal protection under the law 
and equal access to justice. </p>


<p><b>134</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>384. At the national level, the Solomon Islands had already begun discussions with 
regional agencies to consider carrying out a study on the establishment of a human rights 
institution, a first step towards the eventual establishment of such an important institution. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>385. Algeria noted that, during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group, the 
Solomon Islands had received 115 recommendations, 8 of which had been immediately 
accepted and 49 of which were regarded as implemented or in the process of 
implementation. During the dialogue, Algeria had expressed its satisfaction at the country&#8217;s 
efforts in the fields of health and education and at its role in promoting regional human 
rights initiatives. Algeria noted that it had made a recommendation in favour of intensifying 
efforts to ensure economic, social and cultural rights. It thanked the delegation for 
providing a response to the remaining 58 recommendations and noted that, as a small island 
developing State, the country was facing challenges in the context of climate change and 
the world economic crisis. Algeria reiterated its call to the international community to 
support the country in the implementation of the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>386. Cuba noted that during the review at the session of the Working Group, the 
enormous challenges faced by the population of the Solomon Islands because of the global 
economic crisis, serious environmental problems and the unjust economic order had been 
highlighted. The Government had made great efforts to minimize the negative impact of 
such circumstances and allocated resources to developing human capital, with an emphasis 
on basic education. Additionally, it had invested in the improvement of services to the 
population, including in the area of assistance and through the provision of free medical 
services. A Cuban medical brigade was supporting these efforts in the country, and students 
from the Solomon Islands had gone to Cuba to support these aims. Cuba congratulated the 
Solomon Islands on having accepted many of the recommendations made at the session of 
the Working Group, including those it had formulated. 
</p>
<p>387. Morocco congratulated the Solomon Islands on its cooperation during the universal 
periodic review, and observed that it had taken positive note of progress made in the area of 
human rights and measures taken in the area of constitutional reform, the independence of 
the judiciary and reinforcing the role of civil society. By accepting 11 of the 115 
recommendations made, the Government had reaffirmed its commitment to human rights. 
Morocco was aware of the difficulties that the country might face in the implementation of 
recommendations, in particular because of high unemployment, poverty and the effects of 
climate change in the region. The effective realization of the objectives of the universal 
periodic review could be ensured with the provision of technical and/or financial assistance 
for developing countries, as determined by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>388. New Zealand had made a recommendation that the Solomon Islands should adopt 
specific legislation to address violence against women and children. New Zealand was 
encouraged by the Government&#8217;s commitment to put in place legal mechanisms to protect 
women, and welcomed the progress in proposing legislation to address trafficking, 
domestic violence and child abuse. It also welcomed the steps taken to increase women&#8217;s 
participation in Parliament. New Zealand added that the country&#8217;s willingness to consider 
the establishment of a national human rights mechanism was a positive step. It continued to 
encourage the Solomon Islands to become party to the Convention against Torture. It 
recognized the burden for small States not resident in Geneva, and commended the 
Solomon Islands for its positive participation in the process. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>389. Save the Children welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to realizing the rights 
of the child. It called on the Solomon Islands to prioritize commitments of resources, with 
clear responsibilities and deadlines and appropriate budget allocations for 2012. It also 
called on the Government to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and to enact 
legislation to protect boys and girls from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse, and to 
protect children from violence in the home. It expressed its disappointment at the 
Government&#8217;s apparent unwillingness to consider the human rights of people attracted by 
those of the same sex, and stated that it was important to challenge stigmatization and 
discrimination. It urged the Government to consider the decriminalization of sexual acts 
between consenting adults. 
</p>
<p>390. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed its disappointment that the 
Solomon Islands was not ready to accept recommendations to repeal provisions that 
criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex. It noted that the 
Human Rights Committee had confirmed that laws criminalizing same-sex activity violated 
the rights to privacy and to equality before the law without discrimination, and inhibited 
measures to address HIV/AIDS, a position also confirmed by the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS. The Network noted that the recommendation made by Norway 
to repeal laws that criminalize sexual relations between consenting adults in accordance 
with international law had been accepted. It asked how the acceptance of that 
recommendation could be reconciled with the rejection of other similarly-worded 
recommendations. In addition, noting that the delegation had indicated that reform in this 
area would require national consultations, it asked the delegation to outline its plan for 
them. 
</p>
<p>391. Marist International Solidarity and Franciscans International were encouraged by the 
Government&#8217;s open invitation to all mandate holders and its pledge to implement the 
recommendations accepted. They urged the Government to continue to provide free and 
compulsory primary and junior-secondary education, and to make this a priority in its 
national planning. They also called on the Government to ensure that corporal punishment 
in schools and in the home was prohibited and punished. It noted that many teachers were 
currently underqualified, and that many schools lacked basic resources and the Government 
was urged to address these deficiencies. The Government was also encouraged to include 
human rights education in the school curriculum. 
</p>
<p>392. Amnesty International welcomed the focus in the review on violence against 
women, and called on the Government to implement fully its gender equality and women&#8217;s 
development policy and the national policy on eliminating violence against women. 
Amnesty International expressed concern at reports that the police may be reluctant to 
intervene in cases of domestic violence and that some lawyers had refused to represent 
victims unless they showed visible injuries. Reference was made to the dire situation in 
informal settlements in Honiara, where there were few sources of clean water nearby and 
women and girls had to walk long distances to collect water. The Government was urged to 
implement promptly the recommendation it had accepted regarding this issue. It was also 
noted that women and girls in the settlements risked physical and sexual violence when 
collecting water, bathing or using toilets at night. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>393. The delegation was grateful for all statements and either reiterated or elaborated the 
position of the Solomon Islands on the issues raised. </p>


<p><b>136</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p><b>  Latvia 
</b></p>
<p>394. The review of Latvia was held on 5 May 2011, in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Latvia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/LVA/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/LVA/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/LVA/3). 
</p><p>395. At its 21st meeting, on 22 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Latvia (see section C below). 
396. The outcome of the review of Latvia comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/9), the views of Latvia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/9/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>397. The delegation of Latvia stated that the universal periodic review had been an 
excellent occasion for the State to review its human rights record through an open and frank 
dialogue. The preparation process had been followed with relevant Government institutions 
and the Ombudsman&#8217;s office, and with the participation of non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>398. Latvia had received 122 recommendations, of which 71 enjoyed its immediate 
support, 7 were rejected and 44 were left for further examination. Many of the 
recommendations that Latvia had accepted had already been implemented or were in the 
process of implementation. While other countries had welcomed several steps taken by 
Latvia to further the promotion and protection of human rights, Latvia appreciated the fact 
that the peer review had indicated areas where improvement were needed. 
</p>
<p>399. The views on outstanding recommendations and the explanation of position on the 
recommendations already rejected could be found in the addendum to the report of the 
Working Group. Latvia was a committed member of the international community and had 
become a party to the core human rights instruments. The possibility of ratifying the 
Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance would be considered in due course. 
</p>
<p>400. With regard to the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, Latvia referred to its 
domestic legislation, which was based on adherence to and the implementation of the 
requirements of universal human rights instruments, as well as respective European Union 
regulations. Therefore, Latvia did not intend to sign and ratify this convention in the 
foreseeable future. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>401. Latvia had accepted the recommendation on the ratification of the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in order to abolish the 
death penalty in times of war. To that effect, in July, the Government had approved a 
legislative package on the accession to Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms concerning the abolition of the 
death penalty in all circumstances. Following the adoption of the whole package of draft 
laws by the Parliament and their entry into force, Latvia would assess the possibility of 
ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights in due course. 
</p>
<p>402. Numerous questions had been raised by delegations regarding the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
office and several recommendations had been made in this regard. Latvia did not envisage 
enlarging the mandate of the Ombudsman, as the established mandate was already broad 
and fully compliant with the Paris Principles. While describing the mandate of that 
institution, Latvia stated that the Ombudsman&#8217;s strategy for the period 2011&#8211;2013 set 
among the institution&#8217;s priorities the launching of a procedure for its accreditation to the 
international coordination body of national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>403. Latvia would continue measures aimed at eliminating discrimination, including 
discrimination against vulnerable groups. The Constitution guaranteed that human rights 
were to be realized without discrimination of any kind and that all persons in Latvia were 
equal before the law and the courts. The prohibition of discrimination and differential 
treatment had also been included in sectoral laws. National legislation provided for 
administrative and criminal responsibility for violation of the principle of non-
discrimination. Latvia would continue its efforts to protect the rights of women, children 
and persons with disabilities. It recognized, however, that further action was still needed to 
achieve de facto equality. Latvia did not agree with the recommendation on the adoption of 
a comprehensive gender equality law, since anti-discriminatory provisions were 
incorporated into sectoral laws as an integral part of the overall legislative framework. 
</p>
<p>404. Anti-discrimination norms also applied to the elimination of discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Domestic laws guaranteed freedom of 
expression and peaceful assembly to everyone without discrimination, and no violence had 
been reported against LGBT persons as such. 
</p>
<p>405. Regarding the recommendations to amend the criminal law concerning hate crimes, 
Latvia believed that the law and others provided for adequate regulation. They criminalized 
acts of intentionally inciting national, ethnic or racial hatred or disharmony, and the 
criminal law also defined racist motives as an aggravating circumstance. Moreover, racial 
discrimination was also effectively prohibited in other laws, and the victims of such crimes 
were provided with accessible and effective mechanisms for protecting their rights. In 
recent years, Latvia had succeeded in cutting back on the number of instances of national, 
ethnic and racial hatred. 
</p>
<p>406. Latvia was unable to provide a definitive answer to the recommendations with 
regard to sanctions under the criminal law against homophobic and transphobic crime or 
hate speech against LGBT persons. No amendments to legislation were currently planned, 
and discussions thereon had not yet been held. However, law enforcement agencies would, 
within their mandates, continue their efforts to combat discrimination. 
</p>
<p>407. Latvia stated that a number of international organizations had acknowledged the 
important progress that Latvia had made in the area of societal integration. Latvia 
guaranteed cultural autonomy to all its national minorities, and gave significant support for 
the strengthening of their identity. State-financed education was available in eight national 
minority languages. Thorough efforts were being made to prepare a set of new national 
identity and society integration policy guidelines by involving diverse stakeholders. </p>


<p><b>138</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>408. The State Language Law provided for the integration of national minorities into 
Latvian society, securing their rights to use their native or any other languages while 
preserving, protecting and developing the Latvian language. Latvia had always aimed to 
keep this balance. The Constitution referred to the Latvian language as the only official 
language whose use is defined in the Official Language Law. At the same time laws 
provided for exceptions when information had to be given to a person in a language other 
than the official language. 
</p>
<p>409. With regard to the recommendations on granting certain rights to non-citizens, 
Latvia emphasized that non-citizens were already granted economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as a number of political rights. Latvia&#8217;s position remained unchanged as to 
granting non-citizens the right to participate in municipal elections; the right to vote was 
seen as an inalienable attribute of citizenship. This position complied with international law 
and existing State practice. At the same time, non-citizens were ensured practical and 
effective access to the naturalization process, which to date has been followed by more than 
140,000 non-citizens. Latvia emphasized that the status non-citizen was only temporary, 
and thus that obtaining citizenship was the most effective way of expanding the scope of an 
individual&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>410. With regard to the recommendations on the granting of automatic citizenship to non-
citizen children in Latvia, there had been positive developments since May. Government 
regulations on facilitating registration of non-citizen children as citizens of Latvia at the 
time of registration of their birth had been approved on 5 July 2011. 
</p>
<p>411. The Government of Latvia had made significant efforts to facilitate the 
naturalization process by assessing on a regular basis the motivation of remaining non-
citizens. Further measures would be taken to facilitate and optimize the process and to 
achieve social integration. 
</p>
<p>412. Latvia was committed to the prevention and the fight against human trafficking, 
including its various new forms, such as the marriage of convenience. Latvia had accepted 
all recommendations thereon and intended to continue its efforts in this field. The effective 
work of law enforcement institutions and legislative regulation had already led to a 
decrease in the number of cases of human trafficking in recent years. 
</p>
<p>413. Regarding the recommendations on living conditions in places of detention and in 
prisons, Latvia had already made substantial efforts to improve these conditions to comply 
with international standards, and would continue them. In recent years, greater attention had 
been paid to planning the execution of sentences and to the implementation of the policy for 
the resocialization of inmates. Training for the prison staff was also provided. 
</p>
<p>414. Latvia also emphasized the importance of increasing the population&#8217;s knowledge of 
their rights. Therefore, general information on human rights, anti-discrimination and 
tolerance related issues had been included in the school curricula for several years. 
Awareness-raising campaigns on specific human rights or discrimination issues were being 
carried out in cooperation with State institutions, the ombudsman, non-governmental 
organizations and the mass media. Latvia pointed out that the role of non-governmental 
organizations in promoting human rights was essential. 
</p>
<p>415. The delegation concluded that, in the 21 years since the restoration of its 
independence, Latvia had developed modern, comprehensive legislation and an institutional 
system for the protection of human rights. Latvia stood ready to facilitate further 
improvements and would report on progress in the next cycle of the universal periodic 
review. Latvia attached the greatest importance to its human rights commitments, and 
believed that the members of the Human Rights Council must lead by example. Therefore 
Latvia had submitted its candidacy for election to the Human Rights Council in 2014. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>139 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the universal periodic review 
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>416. Algeria praised the frankness of the delegation of Latvia when describing the 
problems and shortcomings that it faced. It appreciated the acceptance of a high number of 
recommendations, including two made by Algeria: to raise the status of the Ombudsman to 
that of a national human rights institution, and to pursue its efforts to combat human 
trafficking, particularly for women and children. Algeria referred to a third 
recommendation that was rejected regarding the ratification of the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
hoping that Latvia would review its position in view of the importance of this legal 
instrument for a vulnerable category of people and in accordance with recommendation 
1737 adopted by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly on 17 March 2006. 
</p>
<p>417. The Russian Federation was surprised that Latvia had rejected the recommendations 
to eliminate the system of non-citizenship and to simplify naturalization procedures for 
children and retired persons. It also referred to the partial rejection to grant immediately the 
right to non-citizens to participate fully in political life. It noted that codifying the 
prohibition of xenophobic and racist propaganda and instituting criminal liabilities for such 
activities, as well as ensuring the right of minorities to obtain information in their native 
language, were not being implemented as stated by Latvia. It called on Latvia to review its 
position on recommendations made by the international community and to take all the 
measures necessary to observe fully the rights of national minorities, and to eliminate the 
system of non-citizenship, structural discrimination, racial hatred and intolerance. 
</p>
<p>418. Estonia thanked Latvia for its open and constructive cooperation during the 
universal periodic review process. Estonia was pleased to note that Latvia had already 
implemented or intended to implement a large number of recommendations, including 
those on the continuation of measures for the protection of the rights of children and 
disabled persons and the promotion of gender equality. It also noted a continued 
improvement in prison conditions, and in the fight against racism, hate crimes and human 
trafficking. Having shared a similar historical experience with Latvia, Estonia wished to 
emphasize that the creation of a modern institutional system for the protection and 
promotion of human rights in only 20 years since its independence was a substantial 
achievement. It commended Latvia for its continuous success in promoting the issuance of 
standing invitations to special procedures. 
</p>
<p>419. The Republic of Moldova applauded the constructive engagement of Latvia with the 
universal periodic review. It welcomed Latvia&#8217;s pledge to issue a standing invitation to 
special procedures mandate holders and to actively promote them. The Republic of 
Moldova appreciated Latvia&#8217;s acceptance of its recommendations and welcomed its 
commitment to ensure the compliance of the Ombudsman institution with the Paris 
Principles. It praised Latvia&#8217;s commitment to earmark sufficient funds for all child 
protection programmes. It also noted with satisfaction Latvia&#8217;s commitment to the taking of 
appropriate measures to prosecute and punish perpetrators of trafficking in human beings 
and to the development of effective systems for the timely prevention of the sexual 
exploitation and trafficking of children. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>420. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation (ILGA-
Europe) commended Latvia for having accepted recommendations to increase efforts to 
combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and to provide 
general information about anti-discrimination measures and to reform the curriculum in 
schools in order to provide information about gender equality, lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender and ethnic minorities, thus engaging in awareness-raising activities. ILGA-</p>


<p><b>140</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>Europe recommended that Latvia should establish a concrete plan of implementation of the 
measures mentioned in close cooperation and consultation with civil society organizations. 
It raised concerns about the rejection of a recommendation to recognize the diversity of 
family types and recommended that Latvia should reconsider its position and ensures that 
equal rights of same-sex and opposite-sex couples in its legislation and policies. It also 
recommended that Latvia should reconsider its position to include sexual orientation and 
gender identity in its hate crime legislation. Lastly, ILGA recommended that the 
Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity should be applied as a guide to assist in 
policymaking. 
</p>
<p>421. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme appreciated Latvia&#8217;s 
cooperation with the special procedures. It raised concerns with regard to discrimination 
against migrants, young Roma women, Russian citizen workers and refugees. It referred to 
the legislation to combat human trafficking adopted in 2000, and requested that it be 
strengthened to combat violence and abuse against women. Over the years, prison 
authorities had investigated 5 cases of violent death of prison inmates. It stressed that the 
lack of access to attorneys for detainees was a problem. Lastly, it invited Latvia to continue 
to create mechanisms for human rights training of police and security forces, and to ratify 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>422. Latvia underlined the enriching experience of the universal periodic review, leading 
to new steps to improve its human rights record. The delegation thanked all delegations and 
non-governmental organizations, and looked forward to the second cycle of the review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sierra Leone 
</b></p>
<p>423. The review of Sierra Leone was held on 5 May 2011, in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Sierra Leone in accordance with the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLE/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLE/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SLE/3). 
</p><p>424. At its 21st meeting, on 22 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Sierra Leone (see section C below). 
425. The outcome of the review of Sierra Leone comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/10), the views of Sierra Leone 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/18/10/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>426. The delegation, on behalf of the President of Sierra Leone, reaffirmed the 
Government&#8217;s pledge to promote and safeguard human rights in Sierra Leone, that it would 
shortly be seeking technical assistance to help it fast-track the enactment of all international </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>141 
</b></p>
<p>human rights and humanitarian instruments to which it is a party, and its commitment to the 
abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>427. Sierra Leone welcomed the opportunity of being reviewed and, in particular, all 
recommendations made by States. A total of 129 recommendations had been made. The 
delegation had addressed 101 of those recommendations adequately and promised to submit 
the outstanding 28 recommendations to the stakeholders and the people of Sierra Leone for 
the proper determination of its response. 
</p>
<p>428. On returning to Sierra Leone, the delegation had presented its report to the President 
in cabinet, together with the recommendation for a nationwide consultation and 
presentation to stakeholders and citizenry. This was readily approved, with also the 
technical assistance of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone 
(which is also the field office of OHCHR). Those consultations had been conducted in 
August 2011. 
</p>
<p>429. The consultations were planned and carried out by the Ministry of Justice and the 
Human Rights secretariat in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. 
Participants were drawn from a variety of groups: tribal heads, trades unions, prison 
officers, police, military, general citizenry, civil society and non-governmental 
organizations. The consultations were held in major cities, starting in the east and 
culminating in Freetown. 
</p>
<p>430. At the consultations, the report of the review was presented, reasons were given for 
the position already taken on recommendations, and an explanation provided on the need to 
hold interactive consultations throughout the country to discuss carefully the 28 outstanding 
recommendations and to determine Sierra Leone&#8217;s position on them. This approach was 
very successful, as the turnout in all the consultations was higher than anticipated and the 
feedback carefully considered so as to share the outcome with the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>431. There were plans to hold a high-level consultation with cabinet ministers and the 
higher echelons of the civil service almost immediately following the delegation&#8217;s return to 
Freetown. 
</p>
<p>432. Sierra Leone provided its position on the recommendations. It had accepted 
recommendation 82.1, with the clarification that Parliament would have to consider the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at the 
earliest. 
</p>
<p>433. Sierra Leone had accepted recommendations 82.2, 82.3, 82.4 and 82.14&#8211;82.25 in 
principle, subject to constitutional review. It reminded participants that the constitutional 
review process had been suspended and that it intended to continue it after the elections. 
</p>
<p>434. Sierra Leone had accepted recommendations 82.5, 82.6, 82.10, 82.27 and 82.28. It 
accepted recommendations 82.11 with a clear call for technical assistance in the 
implementation of the national gender plan and the national plan of action on Security 
Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), as well as in formulating a strategy to 
combat violence against women. It had also accepted recommendations 82.12 and 82.13 
with a call for technical assistance. Recommendation 82.26 was accepted with the 
explanation that an existing board could do with technical assistance and training for 
carrying out its mandate and informing the public. Sierra Leone rejected recommendations 
82.7, 82.8 and 82.9. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>435. Algeria commended the constructive commitment of Sierra Leone in the framework 
of the universal periodic review and its rather spectacular acceptance of 126 </p>


<p><b>142</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>recommendations out of 129. It expressed its confidence that, thanks to the identification of 
Sierra Leone&#8217;s needs in terms of technical assistance and its requests to OHCHR, the 
Government would have the capacity to make up for the delay in the presentation of 
periodical reports to treaty bodies. Algeria underlined the fact that the use of technical 
assistance would also help Sierra Leone to implement its plans for the promotion of human 
rights. Algeria welcomed the acceptance of recommendations relating to the fighting 
violence against women and to improving the conditions of detention. Algeria called on the 
international community to support Sierra Leone in providing it with the technical 
assistance it had requested in order to meet its commitments to human rights. 
</p>
<p>436. Morocco stated that the acceptance of the majority of recommendations, including 
the two made by Morocco on the protection of the rights of children and the promotion of 
women&#8217;s role in the society, was an act of goodwill showing the commitment of Sierra 
Leone to the universal periodic review process. It added that the legal and institutional 
measures, the good governance and the achievements in several areas of human rights 
showed the commitment of the authorities to human rights issues. Moreover, the delegation 
of Morocco highlighted the fact that national will and the efforts of a country with a fragile 
economy emerging from conflict could not reach the results hoped for in terms of 
development and promotion of human rights. Therefore, Morocco called for solidarity for 
Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>437. Mauritania congratulated Sierra Leone on its human rights accomplishments in a 
difficult socioeconomic context. Sierra Leone&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review, reflected its willingness and 
determination to be open to the promotion and protection of human rights. Mauritania 
called on the international community to provide the assistance necessary to enable Sierra 
Leone to implement its recommendations. 
</p>
<p>438. Nigeria commended Sierra Leone for its efforts to promote transparency and the 
reintegration of war victims. It recognized the Government&#8217;s efforts to consolidate peace 
and stability and to harmonize domestic legislation with international human rights 
instruments. Nigeria commended Sierra Leone for its institutional reform, including the 
establishment of a national human rights commission, an anti-corruption commission and 
the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee. Nigeria had noted the steps promised to 
eliminate child labour and forced labour, and to mobilize resources for the successful 
implementation of national programmes that support economic, social and cultural rights. 
Nigeria encouraged the Government to continue and reinforce its programme of 
reconciliation and to improve living standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>439. The Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone, which had just been accredited 
with &#8220;A&#8221; status, held the view that positive steps would now be taken to use the universal 
periodic review process to remedy Sierra Leone&#8217;s poor record of reporting under 
international human rights instruments. The Commission remained committed to providing 
technical support and monitoring the Government&#8217;s implementation of its 
recommendations, particularly on accession to and ratification of the international 
instruments, the signature and ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the passing of the freedom of 
information bill, which were critical for human rights and the advancement of women and 
children. The Commission looked forward to establishing strategic partnerships to ensure 
progress in implementation, to be reported on at the next review, and follow-up visits of 
special procedures. The Commission hoped that the development of a plan of action on 
human rights and the rights of children would include measures to implement the new 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. With regard to the 2012 elections, the </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>143 
</b></p>
<p>Commission called on the Government to prioritize the implementation of the 
recommendations facilitating the conduct of peaceful, free and fair elections. The 
Commission hoped that its new status would be reflected in greater Government support 
and response to its recommendations and activities. 
</p>
<p>440. World Vision Sierra Leone welcomed the Government&#8217;s acceptance of several 
recommendations concerning maternal and child health. World Vision, while recognizing 
the implementation of the free health package, remained concerned that many pregnant 
women and children living in rural and remote areas continued to be denied access to care 
and medicines because of their inability to pay for services and the limited outreach of 
trained community-based health personnel. Health in rural communities was especially 
affected by insufficient water and sanitation facilities, continued lack of access to mosquito 
nets, an insufficient number of health workers and inadequate birth registration facilities. 
World Vision called on the authorities to increase their annual expenditure for health to 15 
per cent of the national budget, as pledged under the Abuja Declaration, and expressed its 
commitment to assist the authorities in the implementation of health-related obligations. 
</p>
<p>441. Save the Children presented its statement on behalf of the Child Rights Coalition &#8211; 
Sierra Leone. The Child Rights Coalition commended the Government for having 
immediately accepted 101 recommendations made by the Working Group, and its open 
attitude towards collaboration with the Human Rights Commission and civil society in the 
implementation of the recommendations. While commending the acceptance of 
recommendation 81.36, it called on the Government to take effective measures to address 
the inadequate implementation of the 2007 Child Rights Act, as key child protection 
structures such as child welfare committees and departments, were yet to be established. It 
urged the Government to pass legislation to establish an independent and resourced national 
commission for children in accordance with its commitments. With regard to 
recommendations 80.18, 80.19 and 80.20, it commended the Government for passing the 
legislation on banning female genital mutilation on children under 18 years, but remained 
concerned that the issue still prevailed, particularly in rural communities. Children as young 
as 5 were still being initiated and circumcised; it therefore urged the Government to 
sensitize the public about the new legislation and to enforce relevant laws. 
</p>
<p>442. Amnesty International highlighted the fact that 13 States had raised the issue of the 
death penalty during the review, calling for a moratorium on executions, the abolition of the 
death penalty and the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It congratulated Sierra Leone on having accepted 
the recommendations, and urged it to take immediately all steps necessary to abolish the 
death penalty in national law and to commute existing death sentences to terms of 
imprisonment. Amnesty International welcomed Sierra Leone&#8217;s commitment to address 
causes of maternal mortality and its review of maternity health-care policies and to 
improving access to confidential family planning and sexual health and reproductive 
services. Amnesty International referred to reports by women and girls that drugs and 
medical supplies were not available at health facilities, or that they were charged for 
medicines and care that were supposed to be free. It called on the Government to strengthen 
transparency and accountability by monitoring and investigating shortcomings in the 
national health system, and to respond robustly to allegations of corruption and systematic 
malpractice. It urged Sierra Leone to make a grievance mechanism available within the 
health system and to inform patients about their right to redress, and to promptly implement 
the many recommendations on the elimination, prohibition and the criminalization of 
female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>443. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme recalled the atrocities 
committed during the war in Sierra Leone, such as the countless amputations, mass rapes 
and forced recruitment of thousands of teenagers and children. It underlined the fact that the </p>


<p><b>144</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>indictment of Charles Taylor by the International Criminal Court gave hope to numerous 
victims of the conflict, and stated that Colonel Khadafi must also be held accountable for 
his support for the Revolutionary United Front. It furthermore highlighted the fact that the 
authorities should make a greater effort to meet the challenges of combating poverty and 
corruption, improving access to justice and promoting national reconciliation, reviewing all 
the questions relating to the preparations for the elections of 2012, and combating genital 
mutilation, as well as discrimination against women and albino children, who were 
allegedly killed in occult practices. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>444. The delegation of Sierra Leone expressed its appreciation to speakers for their 
contributions. All issues raised had been noted. 
</p>
<p>445. Sierra Leone reiterated its commitment to the advancement of human rights in all 
spheres of life in the country. The delegation briefly commented on the question of the 
death penalty. Sierra Leone accepted the principle of the abolition of the death penalty. In 
April 2011, all death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment. Since May 2011, 
there had been two more convictions. While there were moves to commute the sentences to 
life imprisonment, appeals on these cases were pending in the Court of Appeals. 
</p>
<p>446. Responding to questions raised, Sierra Leone considered the provision of free health 
care as a work in progress, appreciated the suggestions thereon and would consider them. 
Recently, a special body had been established specifically to monitor the implementation of 
the free health-care system. It was composed not only of Government functionaries but also 
of representatives of civil society organizations and development partners. Its work 
continued. 
</p>
<p>447. Sierra Leone was taking steps to ensure that children enjoyed their rights, 
particularly by ensuring that no child shared detention facilities with adult prisoners, and by 
establishing and strengthening the juvenile court system. The commission for children was 
being restructured to make it more robust and active. 
</p>
<p>448. Access to justice was receiving active attention in Sierra Leone. It was recognized 
that 70 per cent of persons going through the justice system did so through local courts, 
which were not part of the formal justice system. Sierra Leone had now brought local 
courts into the formal system under the auspices of the Chief Justice, as the recruitment and 
staffing of those courts was to be undertaken through that office. 
</p>
<p>449. The Government was committed and continued to implement the recommendations 
of the truth and reconciliation commission. 
</p>
<p>450. Sierra Leone made reference to recommendation 80.18, on the question of female 
genital mutilation and the Government&#8217;s continued sensitization of persons connected with 
this practice. The Government accepted in principle that the practice ought to be abolished, 
but recalled that some traditions were deeply rooted and pleaded for implementation on a 
progressive basis. 
</p>
<p>451. The delegation totally rejected the idea of child killing for occult purposes and stated 
that this did not happen in Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p><b>  Singapore 
</b></p>
<p>452. The review of Singapore was held on 6 May 2011, in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>145 
</b></p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Singapore in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/3 and A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/3/Corr.1). 
</p><p>453. At its 21st meeting, on 22 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Singapore (see section C below). 
454. The outcome of the review of Singapore comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/11), the views of Singapore concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were 
not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/11/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>455. The delegation of Singapore reaffirmed that the universal periodic review process 
had been a very instructive experience, in which all relevant Government ministries had 
met regularly for more than a year to evaluate the effectiveness of its domestic policies and 
to debate whether more could be done. Civil society had been regularly consulted. It 
emphasized that Singapore had entered the process with an open mind. 
</p>
<p>456. The delegation pointed out that, at the time of its review, Singapore had received 
112 recommendations, of which it had accepted 52, rejected 21 and deferred 39. After 
careful consideration, Singapore had now decided to accept 23 of the pending 
recommendations in part and 9 in full; overall, Singapore supported, either fully or 
partially, 84 out of the 112 (i.e. 75 per cent) of the recommendations made. Most of the 
recommendations that Singapore was not ready to support related to crime and security 
issues, including with regard to the death penalty and corporal punishment, for reasons 
already explained. Another cluster of recommendations that Singapore was unable to 
support related to the establishment of a national human rights institution, as Singapore 
preferred a decentralized but mutually reinforcing system of human rights protection. 
Similarly, it believed that the best way to protect child rights was through an integrated 
system of legislation, policies and services. Concerning the treatment of women prisoners, 
Singapore acknowledged, in principle, the merits of the Bangkok Rules, but did not accept 
the recommendation to implement them as it believed that each country had to determine its 
own best approach, taking into consideration its specific domestic situation and other 
relevant factors. The delegation also underlined the fact that, in the report of the Working 
Group on Singapore, it had explained why Singapore did not see the need to establish an 
independent elections body as recommended. The delegation added that there were also a 
few recommendations that it was not able to support as they were based on incorrect 
assumptions or premises. 
</p>
<p>457. Singapore had also accepted in part many recommendations that it consider 
ratification of various international human rights instruments, in accordance with its policy 
to constantly review and consider accession to those instruments to which it is not yet a 
party. In June 2011, it had ratified the ILO Maritime Labour Convention, thus 
strengthening its commitment to decent work conditions for seafarers working on 
Singapore-flagged ships. In the same month, in accordance with its policy of constantly 
reviewing the declarations and reservations that it had filed upon ratification of human 
rights instruments, and following significant developments in the practice of sharia law in </p>


<p><b>146</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>Singapore, Singapore partially withdrew its 1995 reservation to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Furthermore, Singapore 
intended to accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the end 
of 2012. 
</p>
<p>458. Singapore also assured its commitment to the fight against trafficking in persons and 
to the rights of victims. The Government worked closely with a network of non-
governmental organizations, hospitals and schools to ensure appropriate assistance, and was 
engaging several foreign embassies to strengthen partnership and coordination to counter 
trafficking in persons. Singapore also looked forward to working closely with the anti-
trafficking units of other ASEAN countries. It was in the process of developing a national 
plan of action to step up efforts to fight trafficking. 
</p>
<p>459. With regard to children and women&#8217;s rights, Singapore confirmed that it was 
committed to implementing the recommendations made by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, consistent with its treaty obligations, noting that several recommendations received 
during the universal periodic review affirmed Singapore&#8217;s efforts in this area. In particular, 
Singapore had made further progress in enhancing the legal protection of children by means 
of the recent amendments made to the Children and Young Persons Act relating to the 
licensing of children and young persons&#8217; homes. Similar progress had been made in 
enhancing the legal protection of women in the amendments to the Women Charter, made 
in January 2011, with the aim of mitigating the impact of divorce on women. 
</p>
<p>460. Concerning the recommendations relating to racism and racial discrimination, 
Singapore stated that racial and religious harmony was of paramount importance to 
Singapore and that the Government would continue to support civic and community 
initiatives in this area. It also referred to its response, which had since been circulated as a 
document of the session, to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
following his visit to Singapore in April 2010. Singapore took the well-being of migrant 
workers seriously and was continually reviewing regulations to refine employers&#8217; 
responsibilities. For example, recruitment regulations had been recently tightened to reduce 
migrant worker debt in Singapore. 
</p>
<p>461. Lastly, the delegation acknowledged the role of civil society organizations in 
Singapore&#8217;s follow-up to the universal periodic review, and stated that the Government 
appreciated their tireless efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>462. Viet Nam commended Singapore&#8217;s positive reaction to many of the 
recommendations made, including three of its own, and welcomed Singapore&#8217;s efforts to 
implement them. In particular, it highlighted the efforts to continue to strengthen the 
harmony between different ethnic and religious groups, to take steps to accede to 
international human rights instruments, and to establish a process for the follow-up to 
recommendations. Viet Nam encouraged Singapore to continue to implement the 
recommendations in close cooperation with United Nations mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>463. Brunei Darussalam congratulated Singapore on its constructive engagement with the 
United Nations human rights system and its continued commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. It commended Singapore for the efforts made in this area and 
for sharing its best practices in the fight against trafficking in persons. Brunei Darussalam 
would continue to work closely with Singapore as a regional partner through ASEAN. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>147 
</b></p>
<p>464. Algeria noted Singapore&#8217;s achievements in economic and social development, which 
had had a positive impact on the enjoyment of human rights. It hoped that Singapore would 
continue its efforts to promote harmony between the different components of its diverse 
society. Algeria recalled its recommendations on the promotion of racial and religious 
tolerance and the advancement of women, and thanked Singapore for accepting its 
recommendations to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. At the 
same time, it requested a response concerning its recommendation on the ratification of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>465. Thailand welcomed Singapore&#8217;s acceptance of a number of its recommendations, 
particularly those concerning migrant workers and trafficking. It commended Singapore&#8217;s 
efforts to protect the rights of vulnerable groups, noting in particular the increased 
budgetary allocations for the education of children with special needs. While some of 
Thailand&#8217;s recommendations on national human rights institutions and the Bangkok Rules 
did not enjoy the support of Singapore, Thailand hoped that Singapore would continue to 
strengthen its independent mechanisms and give due consideration to the needs of women 
prisoners. 
</p>
<p>466. Indonesia noted Singapore&#8217;s commitment to human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, which had contributed to prosperity, peace and stability in the region. It 
appreciated the acceptance of the recommendations made by Indonesia concerning the 
ratification of human rights instruments, the preservation of family institutions and 
religious tolerance, and the elimination of discrimination against women and trafficking in 
persons. It highlighted the enactment of laws against trafficking in persons and welcomed 
Singapore&#8217;s commitment to the well-being of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>467. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted that Singapore had accepted a large 
number of recommendations and taken steps to implement them. It noted that Singapore&#8217;s 
multi-ethnic and multicultural society lived together peacefully, and appreciated 
Singapore&#8217;s efforts to further advance the lives and well-being of its people. It noted with 
appreciation the five fundamental principles governing Singapore&#8217;s policy on human rights, 
and commended Singapore&#8217;s cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>468. Myanmar appreciated Singapore&#8217;s constructive engagement with the universal 
periodic review and was pleased that it had accepted many recommendations, including 
Myanmar&#8217;s recommendation that it provide foreign workers with appropriate legal channels 
to work in the country. Myanmar commended Singapore&#8217;s commitment to strengthen 
interaction with human rights mechanisms, including through an invitation extended to the 
special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>469. Malaysia welcomed Singapore&#8217;s intention to accede to the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities and was pleased that Singapore had accepted all its 
recommendations. Malaysia was aware of the need for Singapore to be afforded the time 
and space necessary to continue improvements in the promotion and protection of human 
rights, and thanked Singapore for its constructive participation in the universal periodic 
review process. It wished Singapore well as it embarked on the implementation of accepted 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>470. Cambodia noted Singapore&#8217;s commitment to human rights, its achievements in the 
areas of socioeconomic development, health services, education and housing, as well as in 
the promotion of the rights of women, children, persons with disabilities and the elderly. 
Cambodia welcomed Singapore&#8217;s cooperation with the international community in 
promoting and protecting human rights. It also highlighted Singapore&#8217;s policies aimed at </p>


<p><b>148</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>maintaining political stability and promoting good governance. Cambodia looked forward 
to working with Singapore through the regional framework. 
</p>
<p>471. India thanked Singapore for its detailed responses to the recommendations set out in 
the addendum to the report of the Working Group. It took positive note of the receptive, 
candid, cooperative and constructive manner in which Singapore had participated in the 
universal periodic review process. It was encouraged by Singapore&#8217;s acceptance of a large 
number of recommendations and confident that Singapore would further intensify its efforts 
to implement the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>472. The United States of America welcomed the acceptance by Singapore of many 
recommendations and its intention to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. While applauding the holding 
of presidential elections and the consideration given to the establishment of an independent 
elections body, it remained concerned about the ability of the people to change Government 
and encouraged the reform of electoral laws. It further encouraged efforts to fight human 
trafficking and to assist victims, as well as the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons. It remained concerned about freedom of 
expression and the right of peaceful assembly, urged Singapore to repeal the 2009 public 
assembly law, and expressed its regret that Singapore had rejected a moratorium on 
corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>473. Saudi Arabia stated that Singapore&#8217;s commitment to human rights was demonstrated 
by its cooperation with human rights mechanisms and readiness to engage in a genuine 
dialogue on human rights. Singapore was a party to many international human rights 
instruments and had shown its eagerness to realize the human rights enshrined in them. 
Saudi Arabia commended Singapore for its cooperative spirit and the efforts made in the 
protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>474. Article 19 and MARUAH referred to significant changes in Singapore since its 
review, noting that the outcome of the general election was indicative of the people&#8217;s desire 
for more space and freedom to express themselves, and a greater say in policymaking 
discussions. The Government had not, however, accepted the recommendations concerning 
civil and political freedoms, including with regard to the ratification of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the withdrawal of its reservations to the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the establishment of a national human rights commission, a review of defamation 
laws, the Newspaper Printing and Publishing Act and laws for preventative detention, and 
concerning the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>475. Human Rights Watch regretted Singapore&#8217;s refusal to repeal the Internal Security 
Act and other laws permitting detention without charge when claiming threats to national 
security and public order, and urged it to rescind preventive detention laws. It also urged 
Singapore to reject the use of the death penalty and to endorse a moratorium on it. Human 
Rights Watch demanded that the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful 
assembly be ensured. It noted Singapore&#8217;s plan to ratify the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, but urged it to ratify all core human 
rights treaties and to make a commitment to ending the use of torture. It also urged 
Singapore to ratify ILO Convention No. 189 and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>149 
</b></p>
<p>476. Conscience and Peace Tax International, noting that its submission had not been 
reflected in the summary of stakeholder information in time for the review, stated that the 
issues raised in its submission included the non-recognition of the right of conscientious 
objection to military service and the repeated call-up of conscientious objectors. It 
expressed the hope that these issues would feature in Singapore&#8217;s review during the second 
cycle, and encouraged Singapore to address them in its national report for that cycle. 
</p>
<p>477. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development urged Singapore to engage 
with a broader range of actors from civil society in the follow-up process, and to review its 
position on capital punishment and preventive detention, reiterating the recommendation 
for a moratorium on the death penalty. It called on Singapore to repeal the Internal Security 
Act, which impaired the right to due process and judicial protection. It also asserted that no 
effort had been made to bring Singapore&#8217;s migrant labour regulation into line with 
international standards. In this regard, it highlighted the recommendations to ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and to amend some migrant labour acts. It urged the adoption 
of a rights-based approach in considering minimum wage legislation. 
</p>
<p>478. The International Federation for Human Rights expressed disappointment at 
Singapore&#8217;s rejection of 27 key recommendations, especially those relating to the 
protection of civil and political rights. It recommended the decriminalization of defamation 
and the reformation of laws, such as the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act, the Public 
Order Act and the Undesirable Publications Act, so as to ensure their compliance with 
international standards. It also recommended increased respect for fundamental freedoms in 
practice, and greater tolerance for criticism and opposition. The Federation expressed regret 
that Singapore had rejected recommendations on the abolition of the death penalty and 
corporal punishment. It called on Singapore to repeal all provisions that provided for 
mandatory death sentencing and to implement an immediate moratorium on the use of 
capital punishment. 
</p>
<p>479. Amnesty International regretted Singapore&#8217;s rejection of recommendations to end 
the use of mandatory death sentences, to impose a moratorium on the death penalty, and to 
end judicial caning. It was disappointed that Singapore had not accepted recommendations 
on preventive detention. It urged Singapore to repeal the Internal Security Act and to ensure 
that criminal proceedings met international fair trial standards. Amnesty International 
welcomed Singapore&#8217;s intention to consider ratification of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and urged the ratification of other 
human rights instruments, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. It welcomed Singapore&#8217;s support for recommendations to protect migrant workers&#8217; 
rights. While noting that recent measures provided better protection, Amnesty International 
observed that migrant workers still faced difficulties and that labour laws continued to 
exclude migrant domestic workers from basic protection. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>480. The delegation expressed its appreciation to all participants in the dialogue, which 
had generated valuable inputs that would help Singapore in its domestic efforts to 
constantly review and adjust its policies where necessary. Singapore hoped that, at its next 
universal periodic review in 2016, it would be able to show progress in some of the areas in 
which further improvement was desirable. 
</p>
<p><b>  Suriname 
</b></p>
<p>481. The review of Suriname was held on 6 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: </p>


<p><b>150</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Suriname in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SUR/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SUR/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SUR/3). 
</p><p>482. At its 23rd meeting, on 22 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Suriname (see section C below). 
483. The outcome of the review of Suriname comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/12), the views of Suriname concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/12/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>484. Suriname thanked States Members of the Human Rights Council for the 
recommendations made in response to its national report, which had prompted an additional 
in-depth evaluation by the Government of the national situation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>485. Suriname stated that a significant number of the recommendations had been 
accepted after careful deliberations. It felt that the recommendations provided a sound 
foundation for the implementation of policy aimed at ensuring more effective protection 
and enjoyment of human rights. They furthermore constituted a solid framework for the 
nation&#8217;s human rights agenda. The framework encompassed socioeconomic, political and 
cultural rights, as well as an outline of the necessary conditions for adequate enjoyment of 
the said rights. 
</p>
<p>486. Even though the diversity of the recommendations that had been accepted presented 
an additional challenge to Suriname, they would be dealt with by the State in a most 
positive manner. 
</p>
<p>487. The delegation of Suriname stated that the recommendations accepted by the 
Government had been grouped in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the addendum to the report of the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p>488. The recommendations that could not be accepted related to issues that were 
currently being analysed by the Government in view of their prospective impact on society 
as a whole. Broad national discussion and consensus were needed. 
</p>
<p>489. One such issue was the claim to land rights. Subsequent Governments had, each in 
their own way, tried to deal with the issue of land rights. In doing so, two things had to be 
taken into account. On the one hand, there was the claim made by the Maroon and 
indigenous people to the land on which they had lived, cultivated and utilized for centuries. 
This claim was aimed at the State&#8217;s recognition that they, the Maroon and indigenous 
people, had a right to the land. 
</p>
<p>490. On the other hand, the Government deemed that the entire territory of Suriname 
belonged to the State, with the exception of those instances in which a third party could 
prove otherwise. Furthermore, the State had decreed that each Surinamese citizen, 
including those of Maroon and indigenous descent, was entitled to request land within the 
State&#8217;s domain. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>151 
</b></p>
<p>491. The delegation stated that, in past decades, the issue had developed in such a way 
that it had assumed the nature of a conflict between Maroon and indigenous people, on the 
one hand, and the State, on the other side; thus, a conflict between the Government and a 
group of citizens. 
</p>
<p>492. Owing in part to different definitions of the issue, various interpretations of both the 
historical context as well as the result of the development process after its decolonization 
and the ambitions of the State, this matter could not be dealt with adequately, and no 
solution had yet been found. The need for a satisfactory solution was more pressing than 
ever. 
</p>
<p>493. The delegation stated that the Government would need to identify an instrument 
through which the entire nation would come to realize that the issue of land rights was a 
national one. Against this backdrop, land rights conferences, which had been planned by 
the Government, strove to provide a platform for representatives from all areas of society, 
to arrive at a redefinition of the issue, thus laying a basis for an environment in which the 
rights of all citizens, including those of the Maroon and indigenous people, might be 
respected and realized within the scope of the State&#8217;s ambitions. 
</p>
<p>494. The delegation stated that another highly sensitive issue was that of specific 
recognition of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals. The 
Government felt that the Constitution of the Republic of Suriname provided adequate 
protection from discrimination to all. According to the Constitution, no individual may be 
discriminated against on the basis of birth, sex, race, language, ancestry, education, political 
persuasion, economic status, social circumstance or any other status. 
</p>
<p>495. Notwithstanding the above, any attempt to embed specific rights for LGBT 
individuals in its legislation was doomed to failure without the support of Parliament. Since 
Parliament was but a reflection of the people, any legislative initiative regarding such a 
highly controversial issue had to be preceded by a broad national discussion, during which 
the views of both LGBT individuals and those of other relevant groups in society have to be 
taken into account and respected. 
</p>
<p>496. Lastly, the delegation stated that a number of protocols and conventions could not at 
this time be ratified since such decisions would require a broad national discussion, as 
should be the case for issues relating to ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>497. The recommendations that could not be accepted were grouped in chapter IV of 
Suriname&#8217;s addendum to the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>498. In conclusion, although a number of recommendations had not at this time been 
accepted by Suriname, the Government was very much aware of the fact that they provided 
a challenge to improving the overall human rights situation in the country. These 
recommendations would thus enjoy the continued attention of the Government of 
Suriname. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>499. Algeria congratulated Suriname on its acceptance of the majority of the 
recommendations made during its universal periodic review, noting that more than 71 per 
cent of them had been accepted. It expressed particular satisfaction that Suriname had 
accepted the four recommendations made by Algeria, on strengthening the participation of 
women in the political sphere; the fight against the trafficking and exploitation of children; 
the fight against poverty by paying specific attention to the economic, social and cultural 
rights of the most disadvantaged; and the establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with international standards. Algeria expressed the hope that the </p>


<p><b>152</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>broad process carried out for the preparation of the universal periodic review would be 
maintained in the implementation phase. The international community should show 
understanding of the difficulties faced by the country and provide constructive assistance to 
help Suriname to attain the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>500. Cuba stated that Suriname had made great efforts to minimize the negative impact 
on human rights of the economic crisis and the unjust international economic order. It 
recognized the work of the Government in dealing with the complex issues stemming from 
a multiethnic and multireligious society. It noted the efforts made to combat gender 
inequalities in the home and in society. Regarding health, Cuba highlighted the significant 
progress made in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. It also 
underscored that Suriname was leading the fight against malaria in the American continent 
and that the country was about to attain the second Millennium Development Goal, by 
guaranteeing universal primary education. Cuba congratulated Suriname on having 
accepted many of the recommendations made during the session of the Working Group, 
including those it had formulated in relation to continuing efforts to promote and protect the 
rights of women, children and juveniles and overcome their vulnerability, and to continue 
to implement programmes and measures to enhance the enjoyment of the right to education 
and the right to health. 
</p>
<p>501. The United States of America expressed appreciation for the serious commitment 
with which Suriname had approached its universal periodic review. It also appreciated the 
support given by Suriname to its recommendations to convene a conference on indigenous 
peoples and to continue to work with the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
peoples. The United States was also grateful for information provided on the 
recommendations relating to the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
(LGBT) persons from discrimination. It welcomed a constructive dialogue on this issue and 
noted that, in its addendum, Suriname had placed these recommendations in a distinctive 
category, apart from those it had supported or rejected. It urged the Government to continue 
to consider recommendations that legislation protecting LGBT persons from discrimination 
be adopted. 
</p>
<p>502. Uruguay thanked Suriname for the detailed information provided and noted that it 
had been part of the troika that had facilitated the country&#8217;s review. Uruguay welcomed the 
fact that a considerable number of recommendations had been accepted. It noted, in 
particular, Suriname&#8217;s commitment to concluding the ratification processes of the two 
optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Uruguay also 
welcomed the Government&#8217;s pledge to establish a national human rights institution in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. It urged Suriname to explicitly prohibit corporal 
punishment in schools and in the home and other establishments frequented by children. It 
also urged Suriname to definitively abolish the death penalty and to ratify the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>503. UNICEF welcomed the endorsement by Suriname of the recommendations to 
conclude the ratification process of the two optional protocols to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and to improve the quality and access to education, especially in the 
interior of the country. In accordance with the accepted recommendations, UNICEF called 
on Suriname to focus on the rights of the most vulnerable children living in the interior 
areas and those belonging to indigenous and minority groups. It also called on Suriname to 
prioritize the approval of key draft legislation, such as the Wet Opvanginstellingen, the 
early child development standards and the draft law to create the office of an ombudsperson 
for children, in accordance with the concluding observations of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child. UNICEF urged Suriname to submit its overdue combined third and </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>153 
</b></p>
<p>fourth periodic report to that Committee. UNICEF offered its technical support and looked 
forward to continued collaboration with Suriname. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>504. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the fact that the Government 
would take steps to address concerns with regard to sexual orientation and identity. While 
agreeing that national legislation offered protection to all Surinamese citizens, the Network 
urged Suriname to explicitly include sexual orientation in article 8.2 of the Constitution as a 
ground for non-discrimination and to apply this article by developing specific sanctions for 
violations. It also urged Suriname to establish cooperation with LGBT organizations in the 
country for the development of laws, policies and programmes to combat discrimination, 
and to present a timetable of the steps that the Government would take. While agreeing that 
these issues may be sensitive and require dialogue, the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network 
expressed the view that granting equal rights to LGBT citizens was not a matter of granting 
special rights but rather of applying existing human rights norms and principles to all. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>505. The delegation of Suriname was grateful for the opportunity to respond to 
recommendations made by non-governmental organizations and States. With a view to 
clarifying the issues of LGBT individuals in Suriname, the delegation reiterated that the 
Constitution of Suriname provided equal rights to all citizens. The Government of 
Suriname had never received any report from any organization that LGBT persons were 
discriminated. The delegation stated that, should written reports on specific instances of 
discrimination of LGBT individuals be received by the Government, they would be 
investigated and dealt with. 
</p>
<p>506. The Government of Suriname was planning to update its human rights agenda, 
primarily on the basis of the recommendations accepted. When implementing the agenda, 
the Government would solicit the technical assistance necessary from various non-
governmental organizations and countries. The delegation stated that the Government 
appreciated respect for human rights for all its citizens, and recognized nevertheless that, 
owing to limited resources, it was not always able to enhance human rights in the way it 
would like. The delegation once again thanked all the countries and delegations who had 
commented on its report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Greece 
</b></p>
<p>507. The review of Greece was held on 9 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Greece in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/GRC/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/GRC/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/GRC/3). 
</p><p>508. At its 23rd meeting, on 22 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Greece (see section C below). 
509. The outcome of the review of Greece comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/13), the views of Greece concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented </p>


<p><b>154</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/13/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>510. The drafting of the national report had been coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, in cooperation with all ministries involved in the promotion and protection of 
human rights. The report focused on issues that had been the subject of particular attention 
of human rights mechanisms at the universal and regional levels, as well as of non-
governmental organizations. During the drafting period, a meeting was held with 
representatives of non-governmental organizations, following an open-ended invitation to 
all civil society stakeholders, including the national commission for human rights and 
journalists. The views expressed in the consultation process were duly taken into account in 
the finalization of the national report. 
</p>
<p>511. Greece noted that, of the 124 recommendations made, Greece had accepted 97 
immediately, thus demonstrating the readiness of the government of Greece to improve the 
degree of human rights protection. Greece subsequently provided in writing its responses 
for 18 recommendations left for further consideration: 13 had been accepted, 3 rejected and 
2 partially accepted as they referred to the signing and/or ratification of different human 
rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>512. With regard to the ratification of core human rights instruments, preparatory work 
was under way on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, and the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Moreover, the authorities were actively considering 
the issue of the designation of the national preventive mechanism, which would allow the 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. For the time being, Greece was not ready 
to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. Greece would follow closely the practice developed by the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and review its position at an appropriate stage. 
</p>
<p>513. Greece had not accepted the recommendation on the signing and ratification of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families because some of its provisions were not in harmony with 
existing European Union and national norms and policies. Greece was fully aware of the 
importance that a number of delegations attached to the Convention, and stressed that the 
situation of foreign individuals legally resident in the country was constantly improving in a 
way that promoted their integration in the social, economic and public life of the country. 
</p>
<p>514. Regarding the situation of irregular migrants and asylum seekers, Greece stated that 
this problem had to be tackled at the European Union level. Greece was already 
implementing a national plan of action on migration management, and a flexible and 
decentralized mechanism had been established for a transitional period, with the 
participation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to clear 
the heavy backlog and to ensure a rapid review of asylum requests. Five asylum committees 
were already operative. A law adopted in January 2011 provided for the establishment of an 
asylum agency and of a first reception service for immigrants. In the reception centres to be 
created, a new screening process would allow the identification of, and support and 
guidance for, persons entitled to international protection. Furthermore, Greece implemented 
assisted voluntary return programmes, co-financed by the European Return Fund, in close 
cooperation with the International Organization for Migration. In the framework of the 
completion of the Common European Asylum System by 2012, Greece supported policies </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>155 
</b></p>
<p>and initiatives based on the principle of the fair sharing of responsibilities and solidarity, 
and strove to enhance its cooperation on migration governance. 
</p>
<p>515. Greece noted that the promotion of gender equality and the fight against domestic 
violence were recurrent issues raised during the session of the Working Group. The General 
Secretariat for Gender Equality had launched a national plan of action for the period 2010&#8211;
2013 with the goal of preventing and combating violence against women in their family and 
in private life, in the workplace and more broadly in society. Other best practices included 
the strengthening of supervision and monitoring of gender equality in all State policies, 
support for women&#8217;s organizations and non-governmental organizations in the elaboration 
and implementation of plans of action in favour of gender equality, and the elaboration of a 
manual aiming at the protection of women refugees. 
</p>
<p>516. The fight against trafficking in human beings continued unabated, based in 
particular on the prosecution of traffickers and the protection of victims. With regard to the 
situation of Roma, an integrated plan of action for the social integration of Greek Roma 
(2002&#8211;2008) had yielded positive results, in particular in the field of housing. Education 
programmes were implemented with a twofold goal: to enhance the access of Roma 
children to educational facilities at an early stage, and to improve the education provided to 
Roma children. Another important measure was the establishment of education priority 
zones to ensure integration of students from areas with low educational and socioeconomic 
indicators, including Roma pupils. The legislative framework against hate speech and 
racism would soon be updated and strengthened by means of the inclusion of a relevant 
European Union Council framework decision into the Greek legal system. The procedure 
for the construction of a mosque in Athens would be accelerated thanks to the 
transformation of an existing building on a State-owned plot. 
</p>
<p>517. With regard to the accountability of law enforcement personnel, a new law had been 
adopted in 2011 establishing, within the Ministry for Citizens&#8217; Protection, an office 
responsible for handling alleged instances of abuse by police, coast guard and fire brigade 
officers. 
</p>
<p>518. Lastly, the delegation of Greece stated that the outcome of the universal periodic 
review would be disseminated to Government authorities, relevant stakeholders and the 
general public. Civil society and national human rights institutions would be closely 
associated to the follow-up of activities, to be undertaken, in compliance with the universal 
periodic review recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>519. Algeria noted that during the interactive dialogue of the universal periodic review of 
Greece, it had made recommendations relating to the ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the efforts made in the area of combating racism and 
xenophobia; human trafficking and engagement in the field of international cooperation. 
Algeria thanked Greece for having accepted those recommendations and expressed the 
hope that Greece would reconsider its position on Algeria&#8217;s recommendation on the 
ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, in accordance with recommendation No. 1737 of 
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Algeria reiterated its appreciation for 
the contribution of Greece in its official development assistance despite its financial 
constraints. 
</p>
<p>520. Armenia appreciated Greece&#8217;s efforts to overcome the phenomenon of irregular 
migration through, inter alia, the implementation of the national plan of action on migration 
management. It was pleased to note that its recommendation concerning the ratification of </p>


<p><b>156</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Torture 
enjoyed Greece&#8217;s support. Noting Greece&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations on trafficking 
in persons, Armenia was confident that Greece would continue its efforts to prevent human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>521. The Republic of Moldova commended Greece&#8217;s cooperation with civil society, the 
private sector and United Nations human rights mechanisms. It applauded Greece for 
continuing its fruitful dialogue with civil society and the national human rights institution 
in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. It welcomed Greece&#8217;s commitment to 
gender equality and acknowledged the progress in combating human trafficking. It also 
acknowledged Greece&#8217;s acceptance of a number of recommendations, including the four 
recommendations made by the Republic of Moldova. It noted with satisfaction Greece&#8217;s 
efforts to eliminate patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes regarding the roles of women and 
men. It was pleased that Greece had increased efforts to combat trafficking in women and 
girls, and transnational child trafficking and exploitation. It welcomed the efforts to 
increase women&#8217;s participation in public life, particularly in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>522. Iraq commended Greece&#8217;s efforts to prepare its national report. It appreciated the 
efforts being made to protect and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and 
wished Greece success in its efforts to raise the living standards of all categories of 
inhabitants, its citizens and their general prosperity. It noted that more than 120 
recommendations had been made within the framework of the universal periodic review 
and noted that Greece had accepted 97 of them, deferred 18 and refused the others. It 
highlighted Greece&#8217;s efforts, despite the difficult economic situation it was enduring. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>523. The national human rights institution of Greece, accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status, 
appreciated the Government&#8217;s engagement with the universal periodic review. It recalled 
the context that determined the enjoyment of human rights in Greece, noting that segments 
of the population were affected by the consequences of the financial crisis and the 
Government&#8217;s extremely harsh measures. It noted that Greece had responded positively to 
many recommendations, and highlighted the acceptance of recommendations on the 
national plan of action for the reform of the asylum system and migration management, and 
the pledge to progress on ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and ensure appropriate conditions of detention. It approved Greece&#8217;s support for the 
recommendations regarding the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and its pledge to strengthen the prevention of discrimination and incitement to 
hatred, and to improve police accountability. 
</p>
<p>524. The European Region for the International Lesbian and Gay Federation was pleased 
that Greece had accepted a recommendation to include sexual orientation and gender 
identity as grounds for protection in anti-discrimination measures. It encouraged Greece to 
extend this protection to the fields of education, health care and access to goods and 
services. It underlined the fact that sexual orientation and gender identity were separate 
concepts, and recommended that Greece should include gender identity and expression 
explicitly in its legislation. It urged Greece to consider using the Yogyakarta Principles. It 
commended Greece for considering the recognition of same-sex couples and asked about 
the time frame to implementing this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>525. The International Commission of Jurists highlighted the crisis faced by the Greek 
asylum system, though this could not justify delays, and noted Greece&#8217;s pledge to address 
these violations, including through its national plan of action for asylum reform and 
migration management, and notably with the asylum procedure legislation adopted in 2011. 
It urged Greece to take prompt action to: review detention conditions for asylum seekers, to </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>157 
</b></p>
<p>ensure adherence to the principle of non-refoulement and that deportation is carried out 
only after exhaustion of legal remedies, to ensure that conditions of detention comply with 
international human rights standards, and to strengthen protection for the human rights of 
unaccompanied minor asylum seekers. It urged Greece to respond positively to the 
recommendation to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>526. Human Rights Watch shared the concern expressed during the universal periodic 
review of Greece on its efforts to reform asylum and migration management, and expressed 
concern at detention conditions and the situation of unaccompanied migrant children. It 
welcomed the fact that Greece accepted all related recommendations, and urged it to take 
the steps necessary for their implementation. It noted that Greece continued to argue that 
instances of police misconduct were isolated cases, and expressed concern at the limited 
mandate of the Ministry of Citizen Protection. It urged Greece to comply with the relevant 
recommendations and to create a complaints mechanism in conformity with international 
standards. It noted that Greece&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations to take steps to prevent 
attacks against migrants should lead to concrete measures. It noted that racist and 
xenophobic violence was a serious problem in Greece, highlighting the events witnessed in 
Athens in 2011. 
</p>
<p>527. Amnesty International welcomed Greece&#8217;s commitment to ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and called on the Government to establish a 
mechanism to periodically review places of deprivation of liberty in order to prevent torture 
and ill-treatment. It welcomed Greece&#8217;s support for recommendations to establish an 
asylum system with international and regional standards, and urged Greece to ensure its 
early and effective establishment. It noted a rise in racially motivated crimes against third-
country nationals in Greece, including refugees and asylum seekers, and called on it to act 
on accepted recommendations to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. It 
expressed deep concern at the treatment of unaccompanied minors, and welcomed the focus 
of the universal periodic review on the issue. It highlighted the need to abolish, in 
legislation and practice, the detention of unaccompanied asylum seeking or migrant 
children. It expressed concern at Greece&#8217;s failure to ensure that police respect and protect 
human rights. It encouraged Greece to establish an independent and effective police 
complaints mechanism, and welcomed Greece&#8217;s support for a recommendation on the 
recognition of same-sex couples. 
</p>
<p>528. Conscience and Peace Tax International regretted that Greece&#8217;s report made no 
mention of conscientious objection to military service, despite the submissions of three 
stakeholders thereon. It noted that, in 1997, Greece was the last member of the European 
Community to introduce legislation for conscientious objectors to military service. Several 
provisions still fell short of regional and international norms and highlighted, inter alia, that 
information about applying for recognition as a conscientious objector was not readily 
available and the application procedure was rigid and complicated. It noted that the 
alternative civilian service available was of disproportionate duration, and that some other 
conditions were punitive. It encouraged States, moving on to the second cycle of the 
universal periodic review to ensure covering as full a range as possible of the human rights 
issues identified for a State. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>529. The delegation of Greece took note of all comments and additional 
recommendations. With regard to comments made by ILGA, Greece replied that complaints 
on sexual discrimination could be addressed to the Ombudsman. On comments made by 
Conscience and Peace Tax International, the Government had reduced the duration of the 
civil service for conscientious objectors, and the majority of the members of the special </p>


<p><b>158</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>committee deciding on conscientious objection matters were not in the army. Greece 
reiterated the fact that, despite the severe economic crisis, it would continue to work on the 
improvement of its human rights situation and to cooperate with the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Samoa 
</b></p>
<p>530. The review of Samoa was held on 9 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Samoa in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/WSM/3). 
</p><p>531. At its 23rd meeting, on 22 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Samoa (see section C below). 
532. The outcome of the review of Samoa comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/14), the views of Samoa concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/14/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>533. Pursuant to Samoa&#8217;s request and on its behalf, the President of the Human Rights 
Council stated that, as previously announced, Samoa had been unable to send a delegation 
to Geneva in time for the session of the Council. Samoa had submitted an addendum to the 
report of the Working Group, which was circulated to the Council in accordance with the 
usual procedure. The addendum provided additional information and, where applicable, 
clarification of Samoa&#8217;s position taken on all 43 recommendations requiring further 
consideration after the review. It also conveyed the commitment of the Government of 
Samoa to the promotion of human rights, and reflected its efforts to overcome challenges 
through, inter alia, cooperation with international and regional organizations active in the 
area of human rights. 
</p>
<p>534. In addition, Samoa, in response to a note verbale from the secretariat, had submitted 
a table indicating, for each recommendation, its position. Of the 43 recommendations, the 
Government of Samoa had accepted 34 and noted 9. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>535. Algeria acknowledged the efforts made by Samoa to make progress towards the 
realization of human rights in spite of the objective constraints that it faced, such as its 
fragile ecosystem, the adverse effects of climate change and natural disasters. Algeria was 
encouraged to note that a majority of recommendations had been accepted by Samoa, 
including those made by Algeria. Algeria&#8217;s recommendations were related to accession to 
international human rights instruments, protecting the human rights of persons with 
disabilities, economic, social and cultural rights, fighting all forms of racial discrimination, </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>159 
</b></p>
<p>and fighting social problems, in particular domestic violence and juvenile delinquency. 
Algeria hoped that, with adequate technical and financial assistance, the Government of 
Samoa would soon be in a position to complete the establishment of a national human 
rights institution. The contribution of that institution would certainly reinforce Government 
actions to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>536. Cuba recalled that Samoa&#8217;s review was an opportunity to understand the challenges 
that it faced, including financial constraints, climate change and climate phenomena, such 
as hurricanes. The review also shed light on the programmes undertaken by the 
Government to promote and protect human rights, such as community plans and awareness 
programmes on health, water, sanitation, and sexual and reproductive health. Cuba 
commended the Government of Samoa for having accepted many of the recommendations 
made during the session of the Working Group, including those made by Cuba. These 
included calls for the maintenance of strategies and plans of socioeconomic development, 
and of measures to guarantee universal health and education services. 
</p>
<p>537. Morocco congratulated the Government of Samoa on its spirit of openness 
throughout its universal periodic review. It noted with satisfaction the significant number of 
recommendations accepted by Samoa, which reflected its commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights. Morocco acknowledged that four of its recommendations 
had been accepted by Samoa, relating to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the establishment of a national human rights institution, the guarantee of free 
and mandatory primary education and the signing of the two optional protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Morocco took note with interest of the efforts of the 
Government to improve the human rights situation in Samoa in spite of the difficulties the 
country faced relating to climate change and natural disasters. Morocco therefore called for 
the solidarity and cooperation of the international community with Samoa to enable it to 
implement the recommendations it had accepted. 
</p>
<p>538. New Zealand noted with satisfaction the acceptance of all but five recommendations 
by Samoa. It was also pleased to learn that Samoa had started the process of drafting 
legislation to establish a national human rights institution and initiated the enhancement of 
family safety and support for victims of domestic violence. New Zealand noted the 
implementation of prison reforms, which included the establishment of a prison authority 
separate from the police. It also welcomed the policies to combat the problems of access to 
education and child street vendors, and to ensure that school-age children were fully 
engaged in compulsory education. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders

<p>539. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the support of Samoa for the 
joint statement on ending acts of violence, criminal sanctions and related human rights 
violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, delivered in March 2011 to the 
Human Rights Council. It however regretted that Samoa, in spite of such support, had 
rejected the recommendations to repeal laws that criminalize sexual activity between 
consenting adults. It therefore urged Samoa to reconsider its position to those 
recommendations and to bring its legislation into conformity with its international 
commitments to equality and non-discrimination by repealing the provisions that might be 
applied to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. It also urged Samoa to 
take steps to protect all persons from discrimination on all grounds, including sexual 
orientation and gender identity, and to apply the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application 
of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity as 
a guide to assist in policymaking. 
</p>
<p>540. Nuanua O Le Alofa welcomed the commitment of Samoa to review the policies and 
legislation to ensure their consistency with the rights of persons with disabilities, and the </p>


<p><b>160</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>acceptance by the Government of a number of recommendations to improve the rights of 
the persons with disabilities. It also noted with satisfaction the Government&#8217;s pledge to 
establish a national disability task force committee and to adopt a national disability policy. 
Nuanua O Le Alofa regretted, however, that the Government had rejected a 
recommendation that it combat discrimination against persons with disabilities by 
introducing legal reforms. Additionally, it urged Samoa to complete its inclusive education 
policy and strategy by 2012; to train teachers to work with children with disabilities; and to 
request international assistance, to be targeted to the implementation of the rights of 
persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>541. The President of the Human Rights Council expressed its appreciation for the efforts 
of the Samoan authorities to present their position on recommendations in writing and 
regretted that they were unable to attend the session. 
</p>
<p>542. The summary of all statements delivered would be included in the Human Rights 
Council report and be drawn to the attention of the Samoan authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
</b></p>
<p>543. The review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was held on 10 May 2011 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 
accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/VCT/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/VCT/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/VCT/3). 
</p><p>544. At its 25th meeting, on 23 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (see section C 
below). 
545. The outcome of the review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines comprises the report 
of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/3), the views of Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its 
voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/18/3/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>546. The representative of the State under review stressed that the history of Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines had been shaped by colonialism, slavery and genocide. It had 
done well since achieving independence in 1979. Quoting the Prime Minister, he stressed 
the quest to further ennoble Caribbean civilization in every sphere of human endeavour and 
to build a &#8220;Vincentian component of that civilization&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>547. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, respect for human rights was not seen only 
through the lens of legislators, but also the inclusion of the cumulative components of </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>society, including churches, families, parents, schools, the media, non-governmental 
organizations and other communities. 
</p>
<p>548. Over the years, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had signed and ratified 
conventions safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms. Its Constitution explicitly 
protected the rights to life, to personal liberty and to freedom of conscience, among other 
rights. It provided protection from slavery, forced labour and discrimination on the grounds 
of sex, race, colour or creed. 
</p>
<p>549. The representative referred to the 26 pending recommendations from the Working 
Group session. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines could not accept the recommendations 
that presupposed that discrimination was encountered by children of minorities and 
disabled persons. The Government was not in a position to accept the claim that 
discrimination existed in the criminal provisions of the laws of Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and heterosexual people. 
Moreover, the Government was currently giving active consideration to the remaining 23 
recommendations relating to international conventions and protocols, improvement of 
facilities and policies concerning juvenile offenders, and the ongoing implementation of 
measures focused on children&#8217;s development. 
</p>
<p>550. The representative mentioned the sensitivity of the economic problems of Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines, which was often lost, and the two challenges it faced: one 
man-made, the other by nature, referring to the climate change and its devastating effects. 
The time frame also had a connection with other underlying factors, which included the 
mechanism to monitor obligations to additional treaties and conventions; the role of the 
Parliament in the scrutiny of legislation on any additional human rights obligations; the 
need to have a committee to advise Ministers on whether statements they made were 
compatible with certain human rights treaties and conventions; and the relationship between 
certain human rights and the Constitution. He reiterated the doctrine of the &#8220;margin of 
appreciation&#8221; as applied in decisions relating to the European Convention on Human 
Rights, where member States are given an element of discretion on how they applied 
Convention standards in domestic law. These were some of the underlying factors that 
confronted a small developing State like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines when it 
considered recommendations. 
</p>
<p>551. With regard to the recommendations pending, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had 
submitted a document containing its response (A/HRC/18/15/Add.1). Regarding the 
recommendations in paragraph 78 of the report, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had 
accepted recommendations 78.8, 78.9, 78.15, 78.17 and 78.19. 
</p>
<p>552. The recommendation in paragraph 78.16 had been categorically rejected. The 
recommendations that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines could not accept for the time being 
would receive due consideration. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>553. Algeria welcomed the fact that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had accepted most 
of the recommendations received during the universal periodic review. It welcomed the 
acceptance of its recommendation on the possibilities provided by international cooperation 
to strengthen its capacities, particularly to combat poverty and to continue development 
programmes. Algeria encouraged Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to consider the 
possibility of establishing a national human rights institution. Algeria stated that, on the 
basis of the principle that no State was free from shortcoming in the enjoyment of human 
rights, the international community should go beyond the presentation of recommendations 
to provide technical assistance as required for implementation. This was particularly true </p>


<p><b>162</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>for States with such limited human and financial resources as Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines. 
</p>
<p>554. Cuba welcomed the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and thanked it 
for the additional information provided on the recommendations pending. During the 
review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it was clear that, despite the lack of financial 
and human resources, exacerbated by the consequences of the world crisis, Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines was committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. Cuba 
also highlighted that the &#8220;adult literacy crusade&#8221;, conducted throughout the country had led 
to a substantial reduction in illiteracy. In the health sector, important steps had also been 
taken. Cuba highlighted some actions to combat the scourge of HIV/AIDS, to which the 
Government had attached particular importance, and the building and remodelling of health 
assistance centres. Cuba appreciated the fact that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had 
accepted many of the recommendations made during the session of the Working Group, 
including those made by Cuba on continuing to apply strategies and socioeconomic 
development plans, particularly those for combating poverty, and for continuing 
programmes and measures aimed at guaranteeing universal health and education services 
for their people. 
</p>
<p>555. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) had deeply appreciated the presentation made 
by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It welcomed with satisfaction the replies provided by 
the Government during the review and, in particular, those with regard to the promotion of 
education at all levels, especially in the most disadvantaged sectors, and highlighted the 
adult education programme, which had significantly reduced illiteracy in the country, as 
well as the construction of schools, particularly in rural areas. In conclusion, despite the 
major challenges currently faced by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it had made great 
efforts to fulfil its human rights commitments. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
appreciated the will and effort shown by the Government to achieve this objective as 
reflected during the review. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>556. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the commitment made by Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines to the principles of equality and non-discrimination. It was 
disappointed that the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had not accepted 
numerous recommendations to repeal laws that criminalize sexual activity between 
consenting adults. This ran counter to a specific recommendation of the Human Rights 
Committee, which, in 2008, had expressed its regret that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
maintained laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations, and had urged the 
Government to repeal section 146 of the Criminal Code. While the Network welcomed the 
measures described in the national report to address and reduce rates of HIV/AIDS, 
including the establishment of the Caribbean HIV/AIDS Alliance in Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines, the Human Rights Committee had specifically emphasized that laws 
criminalizing consensual same-sex conduct impeded the fulfilment of HIV education and 
prevention efforts. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network requested Saint Vincent and 
the Grenadines to reconsider its rejection of recommendations 79.3, 79.12, 79.13, 79.14, 
79.15, 79.16, 79.17, 78.18 and 78.26. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>557. In his concluding remarks, the representative of the State under review welcomed 
the comments made by intervening States and thanked them for their support. Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines would consider the recommendations made by stakeholders throughout 
consultation with its society. He referred to the written statement provided by the 
Government on recommendation 78.26, to repeal provisions against lesbians and gays. He </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>163 
</b></p>
<p>stated that there were no discriminatory laws against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
persons in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The Constitution prohibited discrimination in 
all forms relating to the enjoyment of people&#8217;s rights and freedoms. In addition, prosecution 
of public indecency was not limited to homosexual acts, but also related to heterosexual 
acts between consenting adults. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sudan and South Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>558. The review of the Sudan and South Sudan was held on 10 May 2011 in conformity 
with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Sudan and South Sudan in accordance 
with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/SDN/1 and 
A/HRC/WG.6/11/SDN/1/Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SDN/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/SDN/3 and A/HRC/WG.6/11/SDN/3/Corr.1). 
</p><p>559. At its 25th meeting, on 23 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of the Sudan and South Sudan (see section C 
below). 
560. The outcome of the review of the Sudan and South Sudan comprises the report of 
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/16), the views of the 
Sudan and South Sudan concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and their 
voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/18/16/Add.1 and A/HRC/18/16/ 
Add.1/Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the Sudan on the recommendations and/or conclusions, its 
voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>561. The delegation of the Sudan expressed its appreciation to all States that had provided 
constructive recommendations during the interactive dialogue in an objective spirit, 
reflecting their commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>562. The Sudan recalled that, at the time of the review, the Sudan was one State with two 
systems, in the North and South, which had required two reports to be submitted. 
Moreover, there were three types of recommendations, addressed to the Government of 
Sudan, to the Sudan and South Sudan and to the Government of South Sudan. 
</p>
<p>563. The delegation informed the Human Rights Council that, by declaring the results of 
the referendum on self-determination of South Sudan on 9 July 2011, South Sudan had 
become an independent State, and therefore it was incumbent on the Government of the 
Sudan to be liable only to those recommendations addressed to the Sudan, and to express its 
views on the recommendations addressing the Sudan and South Sudan. 
</p>
<p>564. The Sudan had accepted 121 of 160 recommendations, and partially accepted 12 
others, almost 84 per cent of all recommendations. Regarding the 29 recommendations 
made for the Sudan and South Sudan, the Government had accepted 25 of them and 
partially accepted another (almost 93 per cent). The delegation expressed not only its 
commitment for the full implementation of these recommendations, but pointed out that 
many of them were already being implemented or were in the process of implementation. </p>


<p><b>164</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>565. As an example, the delegation mentioned that, in the field of constitutional and legal 
reforms, by law, the human rights conventions to which the Sudan was a party were 
considered an integral part of the Constitution. The Sudan had conducted a comprehensive 
review of a large number of laws to bring them into compliance with the Constitution, 
human rights conventions and international humanitarian law. A full chapter on war crimes 
and crimes against humanity and genocide had been added to the Criminal Act of 1991; the 
detention period had been reduced in the Law of National Intelligence and Security 
Services of 2009; a judicial oversight had been established; and a general prosecutor had 
been appointed to follow up on guarantees of the human rights of detainees. 
</p>
<p>566. The delegation highlighted new laws, such as the Child Act of 2010 raising the age 
of criminal responsibility to 12 years from 7, preventing corporal punishment for child 
offenders and, more strictly, the application of the death penalty to persons under the age of 
</p><p>18. In 2007, the Sudan had also passed a new law for the armed forces, which included a 
number of principles contained in international humanitarian law providing special 
protection for civilians, including women and children, and establishing individual 
responsibility in war crimes and cases of crimes against humanity. Consultations to approve 
a permanent constitution had begun, involving the whole political spectrum, academics and 
jurists representing all segments of society. 
567. The delegation referred to the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur. 
The implementation of that agreement had begun with a ceasefire, the return of the 
signatories to the Sudan and the formation of joint committees for its enforcement. 
According to a statement of the joint special representative of the African Union-United 
Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur in 
the past three years had led to the return of more than 1 million displaced people to their 
towns and villages. Efforts for justice in Darfur did not stop at the negotiations and the 
signing of agreements. An office of the Special Prosecutor for Darfur had been established 
in order to bring to justice those accused of crimes since the outbreak of the conflict. The 
Government of the Sudan was making great efforts to promote tribal reconciliation, which 
had a significant role to play in sustaining peace and stability in the region. 
</p>
<p>568. The Sudan informed the Human Rights Council that it had taken a number of 
national measures to protect women, particularly in conflict zones, and had approved a 
national plan of action to combat violence against women and created a central unit for 
combating violence against women, with subcommittees at the State level, including 
Darfur. 
</p>
<p>569. The Sudan stated that the recommendations that had not been accepted related to 
topics that did not fall under the Sudan&#8217;s human rights treaty obligations. It had accepted 
other recommendations based on inaccurate assumptions following some corrections, but it 
was difficult to follow such an approach in all cases. 
</p>
<p>570. The Sudan had already started to implement a number of recommendations in 
cooperation with national and international partners, and urged the Human Rights Council 
to support the Sudan in this endeavour. 
</p>
<p>571. The delegation concluded by reiterating the willingness of the Government of the 
Sudan to cooperate fully with the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by South Sudan on the recommendations and/or conclusions, its 
voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>572. The delegation of South Sudan welcomed the work of the independent expert, his 
report and the call upon the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to resolve their 
differences over remaining issues through negotiations and dialogue. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>165 
</b></p>
<p>573. The delegation reiterated the commitment of South Sudan as a new country to the 
international system, to promote and protect human rights and its willingness to cooperate 
with the Human Rights Council. Moreover, the administration had embarked on laying the 
foundations of the rule of law by means of strategies to make law enforcement agencies 
more professional and respectful of human rights. 
</p>
<p>574. The delegation therefore called for technical support and capacity-building in human 
rights education and promotion, and in the establishment of mechanisms for the protection 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>575. After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, an autonomous 
Government had been formed in South Sudan. Since then, it had started to build up its 
administration and institutions of governance. Of these, the South Sudan Human Rights 
Commission had been empowered by a constitutional mandate to promote and protect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, to systematically monitor the human rights 
situation across the country, and to identify and investigate human rights violations. The 
Commission was making its presence felt and known to the Government and the general 
public. It had also started to establish its presence across the territory of South Sudan. 
</p>
<p>576. Concerning issues raised in the report on the violation of human rights in South 
Sudan, including inter-communal violence, the fighting between the Sudan People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army (SPLA) and the rebel groups, and the abuses perpetrated by the security 
forces of South Sudan, the delegation made the observations below. 
</p>
<p>577. The Government of South Sudan was not involved in any incident of human rights 
violations related to all the cases mentioned in the report. 
</p>
<p>578. The main causes of inter-communal violence in some parts of the country were 
poverty, cattle rustling and the spread of weapons in the wake of the long civil war. To 
address this problem, the Government had started to disarm communities and to organize 
peace meetings among them. The Government was also encouraging citizens to coexist 
peacefully. 
</p>
<p>579. The security forces, as an institution, did not violate human rights. The national 
army, the SPLA and police services were well known for their respect of human rights, 
because prisoners of war captured during the battles of liberation struggle had been handed 
over after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, something that was rare in 
civil wars. 
</p>
<p>580. The individuals in the security forces who had committed crimes violating human 
rights on their own personal capacity were being investigated and brought promptly to 
justice. 
</p><p>581. To bring an end to the wars being waged by the rebel groups against the SPLA, 
which was fighting in self-defence, the Government had declared a general amnesty in the 
country, and the President had called upon all the rebel leaders to lay down their arms and 
accept dialogue with the Government to find a solution to their differences. Some of the 
rebel groups had accepted the offer, and negotiations were ongoing to integrate them into 
the Government. 
</p>
<p>582. The Government of South Sudan had devised strategies to foster peace and security 
in the country as a means to enhance development and to alleviate the poverty affecting 
South Sudanese people. The Government had also devised ways to foster culture, pluralism 
and tolerance. It had moved towards a more inclusive, democratic, transparent and 
accountable Government that respected and protected the fundamental rights of people. 
</p>
<p>583. Despite not yet having acceded to the key international human rights treaties and 
conventions, South Sudan had articulated in its Constitution provisions of the Convention </p>


<p><b>166</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against 
Torture and the entire bill of rights. These provisions had been part of the commitment of 
the leadership of South Sudan to the promotion, protection and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>584. As South Sudan was only two months old, the justice system and legal protection 
mechanism still needed to be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>585. The Government was striving to enact domestic laws as part of its constitutional 
efforts to give the South Sudanese people access to justice. 
</p><p>586. The delegation concluded by bringing to the attention of the Human Rights Council 
the abuse of human rights committed by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) in South 
Sudan, which had killed, abducted, rearmed, raped and tortured the people of Western 
Equatoria and Western Bahar Elghazel, States in South Sudan. 
</p>
<p>587. There were 200,000 people displaced in these two States, and more than 120,000 
refugees had crossed into South Sudan from neighbouring countries. The Human Rights 
Council and the international community should seriously consider taking up the issues of 
the LRA to bring this situation to an end. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>588. Algeria underlined the constructive dialogue of the Government of the Sudan with 
the international community through its participation in the universal periodic review and 
cooperation with other human rights mechanisms. It expressed its support for converting 
the mandate of the independent expert into a technical cooperation programme under item 
10 of the agenda. It commended the Sudan for having accepted Algeria&#8217;s recommendations 
on children&#8217;s education and school systems, and human rights training and programmes to 
advance the status of women. Algeria welcomed the position of the Sudan concerning the 
referendum for the South. It encouraged the Sudan to continue its efforts in Darfur and to 
extend the rule of law to the entire country. Algeria requested the international community 
to provide the Sudan with assistance. 
</p>
<p>589. Cuba recognized the challenges faced by Sudan, aggravated by the world economic 
crisis, international spoliation and conflicts. Poverty, illiteracy and the limited capacity of 
institutions were problems on which the Government focused. The Sudan had registered 
progress in education for all and had established a national strategy towards 2031. On 
health issues, the Sudan was fighting endemic diseases and improving reproductive health 
and family planning. It welcomed the acceptance of many recommendations, including 
those made by Cuba. 
</p>
<p>590. The United States of America was troubled by ongoing reports of human rights 
abuses and restrictions on humanitarian access and assistance in South Kordofan and the 
Blue Nile, and urged the Sudan to cooperate fully with the independent expert. It 
commended the adoption by the Sudan of the National Child Act in 2010, and requested the 
Government to take greater measures to prevent and prosecute acts of sexual violence and 
the unlawful recruitment of children for use in armed conflict. It also urged the Sudan to 
decriminalize so-called &#8220;indecent and immoral&#8221; acts. It asked South Sudan to hold 
accountable perpetrators of ethnic and communal violence, and to enshrine human rights in 
the country&#8217;s new Constitution. 
</p>
<p>591. Egypt appreciated the information on the steps taken by the Sudan to implement the 
results of its universal periodic review. In the context of the political developments of 
recent years witnessed by the Sudan, particularly the referendum in 2010, Egypt welcomed 
the signing of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur and commended the Sudan&#8217;s </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>keenness to support stability and justice in Darfur. Egypt acknowledged the acceptance of 
the majority of recommendations received by the Sudan, and reiterated its confidence that 
its Government was able to implement them. It recognized the immense difficulties in this 
regard and called for concerted efforts to step up technical assistance and support for both 
the Sudan and South Sudan. 
</p>
<p>592. Mauritania welcomed the delegations of the Sudan and of South Sudan, and 
expressed its appreciation for the professional way in which the national report had been 
prepared. It highlighted the positive engagement of the Sudan with universal periodic 
review mechanism, considering the difficult circumstances that the Sudan had endured. The 
Sudan had been able to overcome difficulties, cooperating with the independent expert to 
put an end to tribal conflicts in certain areas. This reflected the commitment of the Sudan to 
improving its human rights record. Among recent developments, it mentioned the 
referendum for the self-determination of South Sudan and the recognition by the Sudan of 
the independence of the South. It reiterated a call for the Human Rights Council to deal 
with the Sudan&#8217;s human rights situation in an objective and positive manner, since the 
Sudan had always cooperated with the Council and its mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>593. Sri Lanka welcomed the Sudan&#8217;s positive consideration of a number of 
recommendations, particularly in the areas of the education and cultural life. It also 
welcomed the Sudan&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations on social security and adequate 
standards of living. Sri Lanka expressed the hope that the Sudan&#8217;s commitment to the 
universal periodic review process and its positive approach to its recommendations would 
help the country on its way to further development and stability. 
</p>
<p>594. Saudi Arabia highlighted Sudan&#8217;s positive interaction during its universal periodic 
review and the fact that it had accepted most of the recommendations, including that of 
Saudi Arabia. The Sudan cooperated with all United Nations human rights mechanisms, 
respected its commitments and declared its readiness to cooperate with the international 
community. This clearly showed that the Sudan considered human rights important and was 
concerned with implementing them by means of legislative and institutional initiatives. It 
called upon the Government of the Sudan to work further to better ensure security and 
development in all provinces in the country. 
</p>
<p>595. Nigeria acknowledged the willingness of the Sudan to cooperate with the Human 
Rights Council. It urged the Sudan to continue to take measures that would enhance peace, 
security and democracy, particularly in Abyei, South Korodofan, Blue Nile and Darfur. It 
called for the urgent establishment of a national human rights commission, for which 
enabling legislation already existed. Nigeria also acknowledged the commitment of South 
Sudan to the promotion and protection of human rights, and commended the Government 
for having created a human rights commission. It encouraged South Sudan to work out 
agreeable terms for peace and security. 
</p>
<p>596. The United Arab Emirates appreciated the progress made by the Sudan in the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations and voluntary commitments. 
It commended the constructive attitude adopted by the Sudan during the review. It was 
confident that the Sudan was advancing resolutely on the path towards good governance 
and laying the foundations for the rule of law; it therefore deserved every encouragement 
and appreciation in this regard. The United Arab Emirates hoped that the Human Rights 
Council and OHCHR would take into consideration and provide all the assistance necessary 
for the protection of human rights, as well as technical assistance programmes to enable the 
Sudan to implement all the recommendations accepted and commitments made, despite the 
difficulties. 
</p>
<p>597. Qatar noted the spirit of cooperation and openness shown by the Sudan and its 
engagement with the Human Rights Council and its mechanism. On 16 September 2011, </p>


<p><b>168</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>the Sudan had reiterated its commitment to cooperate with the Council and approved the 
majority of the recommendations received during the review, including those made by 
Qatar. The Government had shown great interest in the recommendations, as they had been 
incorporated into a comprehensive national human rights plan. Qatar had a great interest in 
the security and stability of the Sudan; it had therefore sponsored the negotiations of the 
Sudan and the armed movements in Darfur, which led to the signing of the Darfur peace 
agreement, in July 2011. Qatar called on the Council and the international community to 
support the Sudan&#8217;s efforts, building on the steps that had been already taken and in 
accordance with the vision and national priorities of the Sudanese people. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>598. Comit&#233; international pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte africaine des droits 
de l&#8217;homme et des peuples recalled that the Sudan was committed to the promotion of 
peace and reconciliation by, in particular, the Abuja and Doha agreements. The holding of 
free elections in 2010 and of the self-determination referendum confirmed this 
commitment. However, challenges in the area of human rights remained, particularly in 
South Kordofan, Abyei and Darfur. The international community should support the 
various ongoing human rights-related reforms. The independence of South Sudan was a 
major improvement, but should not further jeopardize peace in the Great Lakes region. It 
called upon the international community and the Human Rights Council to provide the 
Sudan and South Sudan with assistance. 
</p>
<p>599. The Eastern Sudan Women Development Organization stated that it worked in all 
parts of the Sudan, and that it would work towards the reunification of the Sudan on the 
basis of justice and equality, despite the referendum that had led to the secession of South 
Sudan. It did not want to see new secessions and valued the Doha agreement, which it 
considered a step towards peace and stability in Darfur. It called upon the international 
community to apply pressure to armed groups to abide by the Doha agreement and to 
provide financial and technical assistance to Darfur, in the interests of peace and stability. 
</p>
<p>600. The Child Development Foundation and the International Peace and Development 
Organization stated that women leaders were present at all political and economic levels, 
such as in Parliament and the judiciary. On the initiative of civil society, legislation had 
been enacted in the Sudan to provide women with all rights included in the international 
instruments ratified by the Sudan. Civil society had participated in the drafting of the 2010 
Child Act. The work of civil society in the fields of children and women rights needed 
technical and financial support. 
</p>
<p>601. The Sudan Council of Voluntary Agencies commended the Sudan for the 
improvements in the freedom of the press, as reflected in the number of political parties and 
independent newspapers. The National Council of the Press had, however, wide powers, 
and the organization called for ordinary trials for journalists. While supporting the Child 
Act and the establishment of child courts and of the National Council for Children, it called 
on the Sudan to raise awareness of children&#8217;s rights and to support non-governmental 
organizations dealing with such rights. It commended the efforts made in the universal 
periodic review process, but underlined the need to enforce the implementation of 
recommendations and to support non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>602. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies stated that the humanitarian crisis in 
the Sudan continued and was escalating. Barely a week after its universal periodic review, 
on 21 May 2011, the Government had led a military campaign on Abyei. The armed forces 
bombed four villages, indiscriminately shooting at civilians and displacing the entire 
population of the town, estimated at 60,000. It noted that, in the Sudan&#8217;s presentation to the 
Human Rights Council, it declared the completion of consultations in South Kordofan and 
Blue Nile, claiming that these provinces now enjoyed security, stability and development. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>169 
</b></p>
<p>According to a report issued by OHCHR and the United Nations Mission in the Sudan 
covering the period from 5 to 30 June 2011, however, the violations committed in South 
Kordofan in June alone could amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes. The 
Government had failed again to respect ceasefire agreements, and there were allegations of 
torture and rape in prisons and detention facilities. Freedom of expression was severely 
restricted. The independence of the judiciary was deeply compromised. The Government 
had largely ignored its universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>603. The Society Studies Centre stated that, while commendable achievements had been 
made in the human rights situation in the Sudan, violations continued from time to time. It 
called for the review of laws, such as the Press and Publications Law, and the passing of a 
new law that would permit access to information. It appealed to the international 
community to assist the Sudan and civil society organizations to improve the human rights 
situation. 
</p>
<p>604. CIVICUS, the Arab NGO Network for Development, the Sudanese National Civic 
Forum, the Human Rights and Legal Aids Network in Sudan, the Sudanese Gender 
Research Centre, the Child&#8217;s Centre in Sudan and the Sudanese Development Initiative 
were pleased that some recommendations had been accepted, and called on the Sudan and 
South Sudan to implement them. The tension between the Sudan and South Sudan had been 
a major factor in the deterioration of political, economic and social conditions, which, even 
after separation, continued to expose major sections of the population to insecurity and the 
violation of their rights. They urged the Sudan and South Sudan to take a number of 
identified measures to realize the economic and social rights of their citizens. 
</p>
<p>605. The International Federation for Human Rights and its partner organization in the 
Sudan, the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies, stated that violations of human 
rights by State actors were a daily reality. Although the separation of the South had 
proceeded peacefully, it had unleashed volatility and violence in the three border areas 
traditionally contested by the North and the South. Fighting had broken out in Abyei, South 
Kordofan and Blue Nile, resulting in massive killings. Agreements on Abyei and South 
Kordofan had been signed, but they had been denounced by President Al Bashir. In 
addition, violence and insecurity persisted in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>606. The Maarij Foundation for Peace and Development stated that in 2007, a scandal 
had given rise to broad condemnation from organizations that realized that a French non-
governmental organization was abducting children from Darfur for adoption by French 
families. The suspects were given a sham trial and sent back to France. The children had 
not been able to recover the rights of which they were deprived. The universal periodic 
review was the last opportunity to remedy the wrongs inflicted on these children. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Concluding remarks by the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>607. The delegations stated that the Sudan would continue to place human rights at the 
centre of all policies and legislation to be adopted. It was aware that the path would be 
arduous, but the Government had the will and determination to do what was best for the 
country. The Sudan would continue to cooperate with the Human Rights Council and the 
international community in order to implement the recommendations it had accepted during 
the first cycle. It would do its best to submit a periodic report on the implementation of the 
recommendations, with achievements and constraints. The delegation hoped that the Sudan 
would receive the assistance that would enable the Government to achieve these goals. </p>


<p><b>170</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Concluding remarks by South Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>608. The delegation of South Sudan stated that it was in agreement with all 
recommendations it received and looked forward to working with the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Hungary 
</b></p>
<p>609. The review of Hungary was held on 11 May 2011 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Hungary in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/HUN/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/HUN/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/HUN/3). 
</p><p>610. At its 25th meeting, on 23 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Hungary (see section C below). 
611. The outcome of the review of Hungary comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/17), the views of Hungary concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/17/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>612. The delegation of Hungary reiterated the Government&#8217;s commitment to the 
promotion and protection of human rights in its domestic and foreign policies and, in 
particular, to the universal periodic review as a mechanism with the potential to make a 
difference on the ground if recommendations were implemented. Furthermore, while 
referring to a number of meetings held with non-governmental organizations on several 
pertinent issues, the delegation acknowledged the contribution of the review process to the 
improvement of the Government&#8217;s cooperation with civil society. 
</p>
<p>613. Hungary had received 148 recommendations during the session of the Working 
Group. As a result of intensive consultations on the 29 pending recommendations left for 
further consideration after the session held in May, Hungary had accepted 122 of the 148 
recommendations. The delegation underlined the fact that several recommendations had not 
received the support of Hungary exclusively because the course of actions suggested in the 
recommendations had already been completed and, thus, there was no need for further 
consideration or action. 
</p>
<p>614. The delegation provided an explanation on its position with regard to 29 
recommendations pending a decision since the session of the Working Group, and referred 
to the addendum to the report of the Working Group for further information. 
</p>
<p>615. The delegation informed the Human Rights Council that the Parliamentary 
Commissioner for Civil Rights (Ombudsman) had been accredited by the International 
Coordination Committee of National Human Rights Institutions in 2011. The ratification of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was under way. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>171 
</b></p>
<p>In addition, the Government was of the view that the definition of torture could be 
harmonized with that contained in the Convention against Torture during the drafting of a 
new Criminal Code, which had already been initiated. 
</p>
<p>616. The delegation stated that the Government was ready to examine accession to the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
As the process would, however, take time, the Government was not able to guarantee that 
the accession process would be completed by the next universal periodic review of 
Hungary. Regarding the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the delegation explained 
that the States members of the European Union, including Hungary, had not joined the 
Convention because its provisions were governed by European Union regulations. 
According to the delegation, the legislative framework applied and practice regarding 
migration and refugees followed in Hungary were fully in line with its international and 
regional obligations. 
</p>
<p>617. Hungary supported the efforts of Hungarians living abroad to preserve their cultural 
identity in accordance with international human rights standards, and acted in compliance 
with the Bolzano recommendations on national minorities when supporting Hungarian 
minorities living under the jurisdiction of another State. With regard to its Slovenian 
minority, Hungary expressed its commitment to implement the recommendations of the 
Slovenian-Hungarian Commission to the maximum extent possible, based on the view that 
full implementation would depend on budgetary allocations. 
</p>
<p>618. Given existing national human rights strategies in a number of areas, the adoption of 
a general human rights plan or programme would have no added value. 
</p>
<p>619. The delegation stated that, in view of the Government, the new media laws were in 
conformity with its international human rights obligations. At the same time, Hungary 
stood ready for dialogue if there were specific questions or observations relating to the 
provisions of those laws, or their implementation. The delegation added that the annual 
public report of the Media Council would contain, inter alia, information on its regulatory 
activities. 
</p>
<p>620. Hungarian law fully covered and prosecuted all acts falling under the scope of 
domestic violence. In addition, spousal rape had been punishable since 1997. Given this 
legal basis, the Government planned to introduce new measures to address further cases of 
domestic violence and marital rape. The delegation also explained that as the Act on Equal 
Treatment and the Promotion of Equal Opportunities provided women with protection 
against discrimination and guarantees for equal treatment, the adoption of a comprehensive 
law on gender equality and of a separate law on combating gender violence was not 
essential. 
</p>
<p>621. The delegation stated that the recommendation on the elevation of the status of the 
national machinery for the advancement of women had already been implemented, because 
the status and the staff of the Equal Treatment Authority had already been strengthened. 
</p>
<p>622. Although the incompatibility of capital punishment with the Hungarian legal system 
was not explicitly enshrined at the constitutional level, several legal norms were in place to 
ensure that that practice was prohibited. 
</p>
<p>623. Statutory regulations ensured freedom of choice with regard to abortion. At the same 
time, the Government was committed to providing women with the opportunity to offer 
newborn children for adoption as an alternative to abortion. 
</p>
<p>624. The Constitution prohibited discrimination based on various grounds, even though 
those listed were not exhaustive, thus, some categories not explicitly listed were also 
covered, including discrimination based on sexual orientation, as stipulated by the </p>


<p><b>172</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court and the Act on Equal Treatment and Promotion of 
Equal Opportunities. 
</p>
<p>625. The delegation added that the Government of Hungary had considered other 
measures (besides financial support) to fight poverty, such as programmes to improve the 
situation of children and families with children, scholarship programmes to support 
students with multiple disadvantages, the development of the child health-care system, or 
reducing unemployment. 
</p>
<p>626. Hungary had made every effort to increase gradually its official development 
assistance contribution, despite the austerity measures taken since 2006. The Government 
of Hungary, in close cooperation with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs, planned to organize the European Humanitarian Partnership Forum in October 
2011 to address the challenges currently facing actors in the humanitarian and development 
fields. 
</p>
<p>627. The delegation also provided updates on recent developments in human rights since 
the Working Group held its session in May 2011. The Budapest Human Rights Forum, 
which was welcomed by many delegations, was to be held in October 2011. The 
Foundation for the International Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities, the 
establishment of which was commended by many delegations, was registered in 2011, and 
had declared that one of its main objectives was to narrow the gap between early warning 
and early action, and to facilitate cooperation among stakeholders committed to the 
prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. The Foundation had decided to give priority to 
the Great Lakes Region in its activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>628. Algeria thanked Hungary for the clear responses provided on the 29 pending 
recommendations. It noted that Hungary had accepted a vast number of recommendations, 
which demonstrated its commitment to further promote human rights. Algeria had been 
encouraged by the acceptance of two recommendations regarding existing mechanisms for 
the promotion and protection of human rights and the establishment of a national human 
rights institution. Algeria expressed its hope that Hungary would reconsider its position 
regarding the recommendation on the ratification of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and 
adhere to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>629. The United States of America appreciated Hungary&#8217;s support for the 
recommendation regarding hate groups, and looked forward to the development and 
implementation of the Roma programme. It welcomed the establishment of the Foundation 
for the International Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities, and hoped that Hungary 
would combat anti-Semitism. The United States commended Hungary&#8217;s establishment of a 
national coordination mechanism to combat trafficking and its cooperation with 
Switzerland, Italy and Romania on that issue. It also commended Hungary&#8217;s commitment to 
strengthen measures for the rehabilitation of victims of trafficking. It remained concerned 
about amendments to Hungary&#8217;s Constitution and the passage of laws on the media and 
religion, and those regarding judicial independence. 
</p><p>630. Slovakia welcomed Hungary&#8217;s expressed commitment to addressing human rights 
issues. It, however, remained concerned about the recent steps taken by Hungary to grant 
citizenship to persons living in neighbouring countries without genuine links between the 
persons concerned; such action was not in line with the principles of international law and 
the Bolzano recommendations on national minorities. It expressed its belief that the Slovak </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>173 
</b></p>
<p>minority in Hungary and the Hungarian minority in Slovakia represented a bridge between 
the two countries. 
</p>
<p>631. The Republic of Moldova commended Hungary for maintaining good cooperation in 
the promotion and protection of human rights with civil society, the private sector and 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, as well as for its commitment to continue 
dialogue with civil society and the national human rights institutions in the follow-up to the 
review. It also commended Hungary for its standing invitation to special procedures, the 
adoption of the national strategy for the promotion of gender equality and the progress 
made in combating trafficking in human beings. The Republic of Moldova acknowledged 
the acceptance of a significant number of recommendations and appreciated the acceptance 
of all its recommendations. It welcomed the measures taken by Hungary to promote gender 
equality and prevent trafficking in women and girls for sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>632. Morocco noted with satisfaction the acceptance by Hungary of most of the 
recommendations made during the session of the Working Group, including its 
recommendations to remedy the low participation of women in political life and to promote 
the rights of minorities and vulnerable groups. It welcomed the efforts of Hungary to fight 
discrimination, xenophobia, racism and intolerance, as well as its initiatives taken by the 
Government to integrate migrants into society, to protect their identity and to allow them to 
maintain links with their country of origin. Morocco reiterated its support for the efforts of 
the Government and wished it the best in the implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>633. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation appreciated 
the acceptance of various recommendations by Hungary relating to the protection of the 
rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, and asked about the time 
frame envisaged for the implementation of those recommendations. Discriminatory laws, 
especially in the field of family law, were still in place, and prejudice; discrimination and 
even violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity were widespread. 
Hungary had no specific programmes on promoting equal opportunities for LGBT persons, 
and there was a lack of dialogue with non-governmental organizations working on LGBT 
issues. It called on Hungary to take specific action to address these issues and to consider 
using the Yogyakarta Principles as a tool in policy development. 
</p>
<p>634. Amnesty International welcomed Hungary&#8217;s support for a number of important 
recommendations. Regarding the issue of hate crimes, Amnesty International emphasized 
that cases documented by non-governmental organizations had illustrated that officials 
often failed to recognize racist, anti-Semitic or homophobic motivations in crimes, and 
failed to apply relevant legislation. It referred to reports that Roma residents in the village 
of Gyongyospata had been racially abused by far-right vigilante groups in military outfits. 
Amnesty International welcomed Hungary&#8217;s support for the recommendations to strengthen 
hate crime legislation and its implementation, and to conduct public awareness campaigns 
involving law enforcement officials. It urged Hungary to ensure that such crimes were fully 
and effectively investigated and that those responsible were prosecuted under laws 
providing for sanctions reflecting the gravity of the human rights violation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>635. In its concluding remarks, the delegation of Hungary stated that the adoption of a 
new Constitution in April 2011 had been preceded by a broad national consultation process 
with civil society and opposition parties. Recently adopted legislation on freedom of 
religion and conscience complied with international human rights law. Religious 
communities that were not registered as a church by the new law were entitled to the right 
to practise their religion, including by conducting religious ceremonies and other services, </p>


<p><b>174</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>and to receive State subsidies for their functioning. After the events of March 2011, the 
Civil Code had been improved to prohibit demonstrations by paramilitary organizations that 
threatened public safety. Participation in elections of Hungarian citizens living abroad was 
in line with international standards and the guidelines of the Venice Commission of the 
Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>636. With regard to the follow-up to the universal periodic review, the delegation 
informed the Human Rights Council that the Government had held a meeting with 
representatives of civil society on the modalities of implementation of the recommendations 
made during the review. It also reported on Hungary&#8217;s intention to submit a midterm report 
to summarize the implementation of the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p><b>  Papua New Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>637. The review of Papua New Guinea was held on 11 May 2011 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based 
on the following documents: 
</p>
<p>(a) The national report submitted by Papua New Guinea in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/3). 
</p><p>638. At its 38th meeting, on 30 September 2011, the Human Rights Council considered 
and adopted the outcome of the review of Papua New Guinea (see section C below). 
639. The outcome of the review of Papua New Guinea comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/18/18 and 
A/HRC/18/18/Corr.1), the views of Papua New Guinea concerning the recommendations 
and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the 
adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently 
addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/18/18/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>640. Pursuant to Papua New Guinea&#8217;s request and on its behalf, the President of the 
Human Rights Council presented Papua New Guinea&#8217;s views on the recommendations, 
given that Papua New Guinea could not be present at the meeting. Papua New Guinea 
submitted its position and views on the recommendations in writing, as contained in the 
addendum to the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>641. The Government of Papua New Guinea was pleased with the preparation of its first 
universal periodic review report and its subsequent presentation to the Human Rights 
Council. Following the presentation of the report, its delegation had been overwhelmed by 
the positive comments and recommendations made by Council Members. 
</p>
<p>642. The Human Rights Council had made 146 recommendations, 75 of which had been 
accepted and 2 rejected by the delegation that was present in Geneva in May. The other 69 
recommendations had been deferred for further consideration by the Government. 
</p>
<p>643. The Government of Papua New Guinea had deliberated on the 69 recommendations, 
and accepted another 39 and rejected 30. Of the 146 recommendations made by the Human 
Rights Council, 114 had been accepted and 32 rejected. </p>


<p>GE.12-17756 <b>175 
</b></p>
<p>644. Papua New Guinea was a young democratic country, founded on the principles of 
democracy, good governance and the rule of law. It recalled that its Constitution accorded 
all persons living in the country their basic rights and the fundamental freedoms that are 
commonly shared by humanity, irrespective of race, creed, religion or nationality. 
</p>
<p>645. Specific laws had been enacted to address the various human rights issues in the 
country. Papua New Guinea had also established institutional and administrative 
mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights. The establishment of the 
National Human Rights Commission, which should come into operation in 2012, was a 
milestone achievement. 
</p>
<p>646. International human rights treaties and conventions, including the Declaration of 
Human Rights, were compatible with the Constitution and relevant human rights laws in 
the country. Papua New Guinea was committed to fulfilling its commitments and 
obligations under the various international legal instruments, such as the international 
conventions pertaining to racial discrimination, the rights of the child and discrimination 
against women, and international covenants on civil and political rights, and economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>647. As a young country, Papua New Guinea faced many complexities that hindered its 
capacity to protect and promote human rights. Issues of capacity and resource constraints, 
as well as difficult geographical conditions, cultural diversity and lack of infrastructure 
seriously undermined the country&#8217;s efforts to implement its human rights commitments and 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>648. Papua New Guinea explained that these factors, as well as issues of capacity and 
resource constraints, were the major considerations that had led it to reject 32 of the 
recommendations received. Some of those recommendations pertained to the country&#8217;s 
laws on the death penalty, which could not be easily repealed by Parliament. Despite the 
existence of this law, it had never been enforced by Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>649. The core work of the State pertained to the rights of women and children. In this 
regard, Papua New Guinea was pleased to inform the Human Rights Council that the 
Government had passed the first vote on a parliamentary bill that would provide for 22 
seats reserved for women candidates in general elections. 
</p>
<p>650. Lastly, Papua New Guinea stated that the successful completion of the above 
process and eventual enactment of the law would pave the way for greater representation of 
women in the highest political decision-making body in the country. It would be a great 
achievement for the country in terms of women&#8217;s rights, gender empowerment and the 
equal participation of women in the development of the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council on the 
review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>651. Algeria welcomed the fact that Papua New Guinea had accepted 114 of 146 
recommendations made, including the recommendation made by Algeria relating to efforts 
to combat HIV/AIDS. It recalled that it had made two other recommendations relating to 
adhesion to a number of international instruments (the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the two optional protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child) and on free and compulsory primary education. 
Algeria welcomed the fact that Papua New Guinea had accepted both. Algeria had not 
referred to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, as was stated in the French and English versions of the report of the 
Working Group, nor to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination as stated in the Arabic version of the same report. </p>


<p><b>176</b> GE.12-17756 
</p>
<p>652. Cuba recalled that Papua New Guinea faced major challenges, such as improving 
education and health services and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Papua 
New Guinea had nonetheless made progress in the protection of human rights, as 
demonstrated in its universal primary education policy, its national health plan and its 
national strategic plan on HIV/AIDS. Cuba welcomed the fact that Papua New Guinea had 
accepted many of the recommendations received, including those made by Cuba on 
socioeconomic development, and on health and education. Cuba reiterated its solidarity 
with the people of Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>653. The United States of America welcomed the acceptance by Papua New Guinea of 
many of the recommendations received, in particular of those on human trafficking and on 
undertaking a national awareness-raising campaign on gender-based violence, as it 
remained concerned about those issues. It also welcomed the acceptance of 
recommendations on the involvement of women and ethnic minorities in matters of the 
State. In this regard, the United States welcomed information on the passing of legislation 
to increase the representation of women in Parliament. While welcoming the acceptance of 
recommendations on the professionalism of the police force, the United States was 
disappointed that Papua New Guinea had not supported its recommendation on impunity or 
that relating to the allocation of adequate manpower and resources to improve prison 
conditions. 
</p>
<p>654. Indonesia shared some of the challenges faced by Papua New Guinea and lent its 
full support to the country with regard to the raising of the population&#8217;s standard of living. 
Indonesia appreciated the fact that Papua New Guinea had accepted its recommendation 
relating to the ratification of international instruments, and looked forward to the 
acceptance of its recommendation on compulsory and free primary education. Indonesia 
welcomed the establishment of a national human rights institution, scheduled for 2012, and 
offered its assistance. It also welcomed Papua New Guinea&#8217;s robust anti-corruption 
strategy. 
</p>
<p>655. Morocco recalled that Papua New Guinea faced many constraints due, notably, to its 
lack of capacity and infrastructure. Morocco noted that this had not prevented Papua New 
Guinea from engaging in development, as demonstrated through, in particular, its efforts to 
enhance women&#8217;s participation in political life, its fight against domestic and sexual 
violence, the protection of children and young people, and rehabilitation. Morocco 
welcomed the fact that Papua New Guinea had accepted a large number of 
recommendations, including the one made by Morocco on the establishment of a national 
human rights institution. Morocco recalled its support for Papua New Guinea&#8217;s efforts to 
enhance the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>656. New Zealand welcomed the fact that Papua New Guinea had accepted 114 
recommendations, including those made by New Zealand relating to the reduction of 
maternal mortality, the creation of safe places for women victims of gender violence, 
greater representation of women in Parliament, and human rights training for senior police 
officers. New Zealand had recommended the ratification of the Convention against Torture 
and the Optional Protocol thereto, and noted that this recommendation had been accepted. It 
urged Papua New Guinea to take prompt action in this regard.

</b></p>
<p>657. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed the 
establishment of a national human rights institution, which would contribute to ending 
police brutality. It called for more efforts to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates, and 
remained alarmed at the increase in cases of murder of elderly women and children accused 
of witchcraft. It encouraged Papua New Guinea to establish effective programmes to train 
and sensitize its security forces in order to stop impunity in this regard. It encouraged </p>

</b></p>
<p>technical and/or financial assistance to help Papua New Guinea to meet its human rights-
related development goals. 
</p>
<p>658. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed Papua New Guinea&#8217;s 
commitment to equality and non-discrimination, and its endorsement for a review by the 
Constitutional and Law Reform Commission of existing laws governing sexual offences. It 
was disappointed that Papua New Guinea had not accepted the recommendations to repeal 
laws criminalizing sexual activity between consenting adults and to ensure protection from 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Network 
recalled the positions of the Human Rights Committee and of the High Commissioner on 
these issues, and welcomed the ongoing national consultations in Papua New Guinea in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>659. Amnesty International shared the concerns raised by 18 States on discrimination and 
violence against women, and welcomed Papua New Guinea&#8217;s support for recommendations 
to eliminate this violence and to extend the legal framework to prevent it. It referred to the 
killing of persons accused of sorcery and a case that occurred in 2009. Amnesty 
International urged Papua New Guinea to review its law on sorcery and to investigate all 
sorcery-related killings. In 2009, Amnesty International had investigated circumstances 
surrounding forced evictions in Porgera, where the police had violated both domestic and 
international human rights. It called on Papua New Guinea to implement the 
recommendation to increase scrutiny of extractive and logging industries and to investigate 
forced evictions in Porgera. Amnesty International also regretted the rejection of the 
recommendation on the total abolition of the death penalty.
