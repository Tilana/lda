<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> all resolutions of the League of Arab States relating to the situation 
in the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular its resolution 7595 of 6 March 2013, in which the 
League reviewed the very serious situation in the Syrian Arab Republic due to the 
escalating violence and killings in most of the Syrian territory, and the continuation of 
grave violations of human rights by the Syrian regime using heavy weapons, warplanes and 
Scud missiles to bomb neighbourhoods and populated areas, which has seriously increased 
the number of victims, caused human displacement inside the Syrian Arab Republic and an 
influx of thousands of Syrians to the neighbouring countries fleeing violence, which targets 
even children and women who have been subjected to frightful massacres, threatening thus 
to lead to the collapse of the Syrian State and endangers the security, peace and stability of 
the region,

Islamic Summit Conference, held in Cairo from 2 to7 February 2013, where the

<p>Syrian Arab Republic for the continued violence and destruction of property, and expressed

claim the lives of thousands of unarmed civilians, and the perpetration of massacres in 
towns and villages by the Syrian authorities,

territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter,

Republic, in particular, the continued, widespread and systematic gross violations of human

authorities against the Syrian population, and the failure of the Government of the Syrian 
Arab Republic to protect its population, 
</p>

those responsible for international crimes deserves to be raised in a more robust manner to

Human Rights before the Human Rights Council and the Security Council, and by the
