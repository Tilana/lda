outperforming
Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) today announced normalised earnings of US$103 million 
for the six months to June 2016 compared with normalised earnings of US$8 million for the six 
months to June 2015.   
 
An interim dividend of 50 SA cents per share (gross) is payable on 12 September 2016.
The Group generated net cash flow of US$60m 
for  H1  2016,  compared  with  US$1m  in  H1 
2015, mainly due to the higher profit reported 
for the period and took into account US$22m 
spent on further drilling at Salares Norte. 
 
We  have  declared  an  interim  dividend  of 
R0.50/share  which  is  12.5  times  higher  than 
the 2015 interim dividend of R0.04/share.  
South 
guidance 
Production at South Deep increased by 87% to 
4,356kg (140koz) from 2,332kg (75koz) in H1 
2015 driven by increased volumes and grade. 
AIC  in  H1  2016  decreased  19%  YoY  to 
R622,453/kg  (US$1,257/oz).  Good  progress 
was made on a number of important activities: 
 
x  Safety continues to be a priority at South 
Deep, with no fatalities reported in H1 2016 
and the TRIFR improving 5% YoY to 2.89 
in H1 2016 from 3.03 in H1 2015.
Statement by Nick Holland,  
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields 
 
It is pleasing to report  our H1 2016 results 
into  a  much  more  buoyant  gold  market 
compared  with 
the  year. 
Following Brexit at the end of June, the gold 
price has increased almost US$100/oz and 
is approximately US$250/oz higher than our 
planning price for 2016. While we welcome 
the  increase  in  the  US$  gold  price,  we 
remain focused on delivering on our strategic 
objectives and have made good progress on 
a number of these during H1 2016.  
Materially  higher  earnings  and 
cash flow in H1 2016 
Gold Fields had an operationally strong H1 
2016,  with  attributable  gold  equivalent 
production  for  the  Group  of  1,044koz  (H1 
2015:  1,036koz),  at  all-in  sustaining  costs 
(AISC) 
2015: 
US$1,083/oz)  and  all-in  costs  (AIC)  of 
US$1,024/oz (H1 2015: US$1,108/oz).  
 
In-line with the trading statement, published 
on  19  July,  headline  earnings  for  H1  2016 
was US$124m or US$0.16/share, compared 
with US$5m or  US$0.01/share  reported for 
H1 2015. Normalised earnings for the period 
was US$103m or US$0.13/share compared 
with US$8m or  US$0.01/share  reported for 
H1 2015.  
 
The  increase  in  earnings  was  primarily 
driven by an increase in the US$ gold price 
(3%  YoY)  and  good  cost  control  which 
resulted in lower net operating costs in local 
currencies  as  well  as 
impact  of 
converting these costs at weaker exchange 
rates.  In  H1  2016,  the  A$  was  5%  weaker 
YoY  and  the  rand  was  29%  weaker  YoY, 
against the US$.
x  Helped by the higher rand gold price and 
favourable working capital movements, the 
net cash outflow for the period was R50m 
compared with an outflow of R728m in H1 
2015.  Within  this  half  year  number,  it  is 
worth  noting  that  the  mine  was  cash 
positive in the June 2016 quarter.
x  Development  increased  by  74%  to  3,078 
metres in H1 2016 from 1,773 metres in H1 
2015.
x  Destress  mining  increased  by  46%  to 
19,845  square  metres  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2016 from 13,619 square 
metres for the six months ended 30 June 
2015.

x  The  conversion  from  low  profile  to  high  profile  destress  mining 
yielded  positive  results.  High  profile  destress  mining  contributed 
53% to total destress mining for the period. Low profile destress 
mining was completed subsequent to quarter-end.
x  Longhole stoping volumes increased by 120% to 301kt in H1 2016
from 137kt in H1 2015.

x  As  part  of  the  fleet  renewal  strategy,  17  category  1  units  were 
commissioned during H1 2016, with an additional 11 units to be 
commissioned  during  the  remainder  of  2016.  In  the  past  18 
months, we have commissioned 51 new category 1 units out of a 
total of 114 category 1 units.
x  Most of the critical skill position identified at the start of 2015 have 
now been filled, with a limited number of specialist skill positions 
outstanding.
Australia  
Gold production in the Australia region for H1 2016 was 2% lower YoY 
at  466koz  due  to  lower  production  at  all  operations  except  Darlot, 
however  all  mines  exceeded  guidance.  AIC  for  the  region  was  only 
marginally higher in A$ terms at A$1,265/oz, but 6% lower YoY in US$ 
terms at US$928/oz due to the weakening of the A$ against the US$. 
AIC includes exploration expenditure (see below). Net cash flow from 
the region for H1 2016 was US$121m.  
 
During  H1  2016,  A$52m  of  the  exploration  budget  was  spent,  with 
347,456 metres drilled during the period. There have been encouraging 
results at all operations including: extensions at Wallaby laterally and 
at  depth;  prospective  results  from  drilling  at  Northern  Fleet  on  Lake 
Carey  at  Granny  Smith  and  Waroonga  North  at  Agnew  as  well  as 
extensions  at  Invincible  and  Invincible  South  and  Retribution  on  the 
Eastern  Causeway  at  St  Ives.  Darlot  continues  to  find  resources  to 
incrementally  extend  its  life,  while  exploration  to  find  the  ‘game 
changer’  continues.  We  anticipate  replacing  ounces  mined  into 
reserves at year-end.  
West Africa 
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region was 7% lower 
YoY in H1 2016 at 311koz, due to lower production at both Tarkwa and 
Damang.  However,  AIC  for  the  region  decreased  9%  YoY  to 
US$1,052/oz mainly as a result of lower net operating costs and lower 
capital  expenditure,  partially  offset  by  lower  gold  sold.  The  region 
generated net cash flow of US$26m for the six months to June 2016.  
 
As  previously  reported,  the  conclusion  of  a  development  agreement 
with the Government of Ghana was a key milestone during H1 2016 
and  provides  the  platform  for  targeting  many  years  of  sustainable 
production by Gold Fields in Ghana. The lower royalties will become 
effective in 2017. 
 
We continue to evaluate a range of options for Damang, with additional 
work required following the conclusion of the Development Agreement. 
We expect to make a decision and provide an update to the market 
before year-end.
South America 
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona decreased by 
15% YoY to 128koz, mainly due to lower gold head grades, as a result 
of  planned  sequencing  at  the  mine,  and  the  lower  copper  price. 
Consequently,  AIC  increased  by  9%  YoY  to  US$728  per  equivalent 
ounce. Despite the lower production, the mine generated net cash flow 
of US$19m.  
Approaching 1x net debt to EBITDA target 
Net debt decreased to US$1,155m during H1 2016, from US$1,380m 
at end December 2015 following the bond buyback and subsequent 
equity raising undertaken in the period. The net debt to EBITDA ratio 
reduced to 1.05x at 30 June 2016, from 1.38x at end-December 2015 
and positions the company well to meet its net debt to EBITDA target 
of 1.0x by year-end.  
 
As previously reported in June, we have successfully refinanced our 
US$1,440m credit facilities due in November 2017. The new facilities 
amount to US$1,290m, with the interest rates being very similar to the 
previous  facilities.  The  refinancing  extends  the  maturity  of  our  debt, 
with  the  first  maturity  now  only  in  June  2019  (previously  November 
2017). 
Improved FY16 production guidance 
As a result of the better than expected performance at South Deep, we 
have increased the FY16 production guidance for the mine to 9,000kg 
(289koz) from 8,000kg (257koz). However, we have also increased the 
AIC  guidance  for  the  year  to  R595,000/kg  (US$1,310/oz)  from 
R575,000/kg  (US$1,265/oz).  The  higher  AIC  relates  to  increased 
capital expenditure of R211m (US$15m) to R1,210m (US$86m) due to 
a change in strategy on housing (decision to build instead of rent) and 
the acquisition of additional new fleet. The remainder of the increase is 
due to higher working costs, which comprise higher bonuses due to 
higher  gold  production  achieved  relative  to  plan  as  well  as  the 
investment  in  additional  resources  in  line  with  the  strategy  to 
sustainably improve all aspects of the operation.  
 
For Tarkwa, we have increased the FY16 AIC guidance to US$980/oz 
from  US$940/oz,  mainly  due  to  a  US$38m  increase  in  capital 
expenditure to US$166m. The mine took advantage of the higher gold 
price and the benefits from the Development Agreement to increase 
capital stripping in order to increase flexibility for 2017 and beyond.  
 
Based on the outperformance of the Australian operations relative to 
plan in H1 2016, we have increased the FY16 production guidance for 
the region to 925koz from 905koz. 
 
Consequently,  FY16  production  guidance  for  the  Group  has  been 
increased  to  2.10  –  2.15koz,  from  2.05  –  2.10koz.  AISC  and  AIC 
guidance for the year remains unchanged at US$1,000 – 1,010/oz and 
US$1,035  –  1,045/oz.  Group  capital  expenditure  has  increased  to 
US$655m, from U$602m. The cost guidance is based on unchanged 
exchange  rate  assumptions:  US$0.73  =  A$1.00  and  R14.14  = 
US$1.00.

cent  from  2,332  kilograms  (75,000  ounces)  to  4,356  kilograms 
(140,000 ounces).  
 
Attributable  gold  production  at 
the  West  African  operations 
decreased by 7 per cent from 335,200 for the six months ended 30 
June  2015  to  310,900  ounces  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June 
2016  due  to  lower  production  at  both  Tarkwa  and  Damang.  
Attributable  equivalent  gold  production  at  Cerro  Corona  in  Peru 
decreased by 15 per cent from 149,400 ounces for the six months

June 2016.  Gold production at the Australian operations decreased 
by 2 per cent from 476,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to 466,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due 
to lower production at all the operations except Darlot. 
 
At the South Africa region, production at South Deep increased by 
87 per cent from 2,332 kilograms (75,000 ounces) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 4,356 kilograms (140,000 ounces) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to increased volumes and grades.   
 
At  the  West  Africa  region,  managed  gold  production  at  Tarkwa 
decreased by 6 per cent from 292,000 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 273,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 
June  2016  mainly  due  to  lower  tonnes  mined  and  lower  plant 
throughput at a lower yield.  At Damang, managed gold production 
decreased by 11 per cent from 80,500 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 71,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and processed as well 
as lower yield. 
 
At  the  South  America  region,  total  managed  gold  equivalent 
production at Cerro Corona decreased by 15 per cent from 150,200 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 127,500 ounces 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  mainly  due  to  the  lower

copper price relative to the gold price (price factor) and lower gold 
head grades, a function of planned changes in the mining sequence 
as the pit floor is lowered across the footprint.   
 
At the Australia region, St Ives’ gold production decreased by 6 per 
cent from 187,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
to 175,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly 
due  to  decreased  tonnes  processed  and  lower  grades.    At 
Agnew/Lawlers,  gold  production  decreased  by  4  per  cent  from 
113,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 109,300 
ounces  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  mainly  due  to 
decreased tonnes mined and processed, partially offset by higher 
grades.  At Darlot, gold production increased by 31 per cent from 
28,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 37,200 
ounces  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  mainly  due  to 
increased tonnes mined and processed as well as higher grades.  At 
Granny  Smith,  gold  production  decreased  by  2  per  cent  from 
146,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 143,700 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower grades 
mined and processed.  
 
The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group increased 
by 3 per cent from US$1,186 per equivalent ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,218 per equivalent ounce for the six 
months  ended  30  June  2016.    The  average  rand  gold  price 
increased by 31 per cent from R460,152 per kilogram to R601,187 
per kilogram.  The average Australian dollar gold price increased by 
8  per  cent  from  A$1,540  per  ounce  to  A$1,657  per  ounce.    The 
average US dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations increased 
by 1 per cent from US$1,207 per ounce for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to US$1,217 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 
2016.  The average equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment 
and  refining  charges,  for  Cerro  Corona  increased  by  16  per  cent 
from US$1,059 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 
June  2015  to  US$1,227  per  equivalent  ounce  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2016.  The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate 
weakened by 29 per cent from R11.89 for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to R15.39 for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The 
average Australian/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 5 per cent 
from A$1.00 = US$0.78 to A$1.00 = US$0.74. 
 
Revenue increased by 3 per cent from US$1,270 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,305 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the higher gold price achieved. 
 
OPERATING COSTS 
Net operating costs decreased by 11 per cent from US$748 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$666 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The US$82 million lower net operating 
costs  were  due  to  lower  mining  costs  of  US$28  million  in  local 
currencies  and  the  exchange  rate  effect  of  US$54  million  on 
translation  into  US  dollars.    The  gold-in-process  credit  to  cost  of 
US$25 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared 
with a charge of US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015. This change in gold-in-process was mainly at St Ives due to 
the processing of low grade stockpiles while the Invincible pit was 
being stripped in the six months to June 2015. Sufficient ore to fill 
the mill and to create stockpiles was mined in the six months ended 
June 2016. 
 
At  the  South  Africa  region,  net  operating  costs  at  South  Deep 
increased by 46 per cent from R1,340 million (US$113 million) for 
the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  R1,959  million  (US$127 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to higher 
production, annual salary increases and an increase in employees 
and contractors in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all 
aspects of the operation. 
 
At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 12 per 
cent from US$262 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$230  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016.    This 
decrease in net operating costs was mainly due to lower production, 
continued business process re-engineering, as well as a build-up of 
inventory of US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016
compared with a drawdown of US$2 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015.   
 
At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona 
decreased  by  11  per  cent  from  US$71  million  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$63 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 mainly due to a build-up of concentrate of US$6 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$nil million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  
 
At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 13 per cent 
from A$387 million (US$303 million) for the six months ended 30 
June  2015  to  A$337  million  (US$247  million)  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to gold-in-process movements. At 
St Ives, the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$16 million (US$12 
million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge 
of A$38 million (US$30 million) for the six months ended June 2015.  
In the six months ended June 2015, St Ives processed low grade 
stockpiles,  whereas  enough  ore  was  mined  to  fill  the  mill  and  to 
create  stockpiles  in  the  six  months  ended  June  2016.  At  Granny 
Smith, the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million (US$1 million) 
for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge of A$6 
million (US$5 million) for the six months ended June 2015. This A$8 
million (US$6 million) change in gold-in-process was mainly due to 
timing of the campaign milling. At Agnew/Lawlers, a gold-in-process 
charge of A$4 million (US$3 million) for the six months ended 30 
June  2016  compared  with  a  credit  to  cost  of  A$1  million  (US$1 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  At Darlot, a gold-
in-process charge of A$1 million (US$nil million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with A$2 million (US$1 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015. 
 
OPERATING PROFIT  
Operating profit for the Group increased by 22 per cent from US$522 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$639 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the increase in revenue 
and the decrease in net operating costs.  
 
AMORTISATION  
Amortisation for the Group increased by 6 per cent from US$283 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$300 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. This increase of US$17 million 
was due to actual amortisation increases of US$34 million due to the 
change  in  estimate  in  the  depreciation  at  Cerro  Corona  and  in 
Australia mainly due to lower reserves at St Ives, partially offset by 
an exchange rate effect of US$17 million.  
 
OTHER 
Net interest expense for the Group decreased by 9 per cent from 
US$34  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  US$31 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Interest expense of 
US$41 million, partially offset by interest income of US$3 million and 
interest capitalised of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2016  compared  with  interest  expense  of  US$46  million,  partially 
offset by interest income of US$3 million and interest capitalised of 
US$9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 
 
The share of equity accounted losses decreased by 50 per cent from 
US$4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$2 million 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  due  to  downscaling  of 
activities  at  Far  Southeast  project  (FSE)  and  mainly  related  to 
ongoing study and evaluation costs.   
 
The gain on financial instruments of US$6 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 was mainly due to the South Deep currency 
hedge of US$70 million at an average price of R16.8273 to the US$.  
This compared with a loss of US$1 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 which related to the mark to market adjustment on the 
diesel  hedges  that  the  Australian  operations  entered  into  on  10 
September 2014 and 26 November 2014.  The diesel hedges came 
to an end on 30 June 2015.
Share-based payments for the Group was similar at US$6 million 
while long-term employee benefits increased from US$3 million to 
US$20 million.  The two schemes combined were at US$26 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$9 million 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  due  to  upward  mark  to 
market adjustments on the long-term employee incentive scheme. 
 
Other costs for the Group increased from US$19 million to US$24 
million,  mainly  due  to  the  write-off  of  bank  facility  fees  of  US$5 
million as a result of refinancing the off-shore credit facility.  
 
EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS 
Exploration and project costs increased from US$33 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$41 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to increased expenditure of US$8 
million at Salares Norte. 
 
NON-RECURRING ITEMS 
Non-recurring income of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 compared with non-recurring expenses of US$11 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015. The non-recurring income 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  included  profit  of  US$18 
million  on  the  buy-back  of  the  bond  which  was  partially  offset  by 
retrenchment costs of US$10 million at Damang.  
 
The non-recurring expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
included  impairment  of  the  Group’s  investment  in  Hummingbird 
(US$7 million) to its fair value and retrenchment costs of A$3 million 
(US$3 million) at St Ives. 
 
ROYALTIES 
Government royalties for the Group decreased from US$40 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$39 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. 
 
TAXATION 
The  taxation  charge  for  the  Group  of  US$68  million  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$87 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015.  Normal taxation increased from 
US$64 million to US$83 million due to higher taxable income.  The 
deferred  tax  credit  of  US$15  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30 
June  2016  compared  with  a  charge  of  US$23  million  for  the  six 
months  ended  30  June  2015.    The  deferred  tax  credit  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2016 arose mainly due to the strengthening 
of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol, as well as the change in the corporate 
tax rate from 35 per cent to 32.5 per cent in Ghana as a result of the 
conclusion  of  the  Development  Agreement  in  the  March  2016 
quarter. 
 
The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol 
(Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the 
US  dollar.    For  accounting  purposes  the  unredeemed  capital 
allowance  balance  in  respect  of the  operation  must  be  converted 
from Soles to dollars at the closing rate at quarter end. Therefore, 
the  US  dollar  equivalent  of  the  unredeemed  capital  allowance 
balance fluctuates due to movements in the exchange rate between 
the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the US dollar. This resulted in a change 
in  the  temporary  taxation  differences  for  non-monetary  assets  on 
translation.  A deferred tax credit of US$5 million arose due to the 
strengthening  of  the  exchange  rate  from  3.38  Nuevo  Sol  to  3.28 
Nuevo Sol in the six months to June 2016, compared with a deferred 
tax charge of US$26 million which arose due to the weakening of 
the exchange rate from 2.84 Nuevo Sol to 3.17 Nuevo Sol in the six 
months ended June 2015.  It has no cash effect.

CASH FLOW  
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$384 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$342 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015.  This increase was mainly due to 
an increase in operating profit of US$117 million and non-recurring 
income  of  US$6  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016 
compared with non-recurring expense of US$11 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015, partially offset by an investment into 
working capital of US$13 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 compared with a release of working capital of US$43 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 as well as higher tax paid 
(US$127 million versus US$119 million).  
 
Dividends paid of US$11 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 compared with US$18 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015.    Dividends  paid  to  owners  of  the  parent  decreased  from 
US$13  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  US$11 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Dividends paid to 
non-controlling interest holders of US$nil million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$5 million 30 June 2015.  
 
Cash  outflow  from  investing  activities  decreased  from  US$340 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$321 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a decrease in capital 
expenditure from US$333 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to US$316 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. This 
decrease of US$17 million related to a decrease of US$24 million 
due to currency changes, partially offset by actual increased capital 
expenditure  of  US$7  million  in  local  currency.  Environmental 
payments decreased from US$9 million for the six months ended 
June 2015 to US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.   
 
Cash inflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and 
environmental payments of US$60 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 compared with US$1 million for the six months ended 
30  June  2015  mainly  due  to  higher  profit  and  lower  capital 
expenditure, partially offset by higher royalties and taxation paid and 
negative working capital adjustments.  The US$60 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 comprised: US$163 million net cash 
generated  by  the  eight  mining  operations  (after  royalties,  taxes, 
capital  expenditure  and  environmental  payments),  less  US$37 
million of net interest paid, US$28 million for exploration mainly at 
Salares  Norte  (this  excludes  any  mine  based  brownfields 
exploration  which  is  included  in  the  US$163  million  above)  and 
US$38 million on non-mine based costs of which US$29 million was 
due  to  working  capital  movements.    The  US$1  million  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2015 comprised: US$70 million generated 
by the eight mining operations less US$39 million of interest paid 
(this  excludes  any  interest  paid  by  the  mines),  US$18  million  for 
exploration (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration 
which is included in the US$70 million above) and US$12 million on 
non-mine based costs.

increased  pre-strip  at  Neptune,
months ended 30 June 2016 due to higher expenditure on fleet, the 
refurbishment  of  the  man  winder  at  Twin  shaft  and  higher 
expenditure on new mine development.  
 
At  the  West  Africa  region,  capital  expenditure  decreased  from 
US$141 million to US$102 million.  At Tarkwa, capital expenditure 
decreased from US$133 million to US$91 million due to higher fleet 
expenditure  for  the  six  months  to  June  2015  related  to  timing  of 
deliveries and orders.  Capital expenditure for the six months to June 
2016 was mainly incurred on pre-stripping.  Capital expenditure at 
Damang increased from US$8 million to US$11 million mainly due 
to waste stripping at Amoanda pit.  
 
In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure 
decreased from US$19 million to US$14 million.  The majority of the 
expenditure was on the construction of further raises to the tailings 
dam.  
 
At the Australia region, capital expenditure increased from A$176 
million (US$138 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
A$214 million (US$157 million) for the six months ended 30 June 
2016.  At St Ives, capital expenditure increased from A$77 million 
(US$60  million)  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  A$94 
million (US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due 
to 
  At 
Agnew/Lawlers,  capital  expenditure  increased  from  A$44  million 
(US$34  million)  to  A$54  million  (US$40  million)  due  to  increased 
decline  development.    At  Darlot,  capital  expenditure  increased 
marginally from A$13 million (US$10 million) to A$14 million (US$10 
million)  and  at  Granny  Smith,  capital  expenditure  increased  from 
A$43 million (US$34 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
to A$51 million (US$38 million) for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 due to increased capital development, the new fresh air intake 
ventilation  raise  and  the  completion  of  the  new  gas  fired  power 
station. 
 
Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$7 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with outflow from financing 
activities of US$18 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  
The  inflow  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  related  to  a 
drawdown of US$422 million and proceeds on the issue of shares 
of  US$152  million,  partially  offset  by  the  repayment  of  US$567 
million on offshore and local loans. The outflow for the six months 
ended June 2015 related to a net repayment of loans. 
 
The net cash inflow for the Group of US$59 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with an outflow of US$34 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015.  After accounting for a positive 
translation  adjustment  of  US$4  million  on  non-US  dollar  cash 
balances, the cash inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
was US$63 million.  The cash balance was US$415 million at 30 
June 2015 compared with US$503 million at 30 June 2016.  
 
ALL-IN SUSTAINING AND TOTAL ALL-IN COST 
The  Group  all-in  sustaining  costs  decreased  by  8  per  cent  from 
US$1,083  per  ounce  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to 
US$992 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly 
due  to  lower  net  operating  costs  and  lower  sustaining  capital 
expenditure, partially offset by lower by-product credits and higher 
cash remuneration (long term employee benefits).  Total all-in cost 
decreased  by  8  per  cent  from  US$1,108  per  ounce  for  the  six 
months  ended  30  June  2015  to  US$1,024  per  ounce  for  the  six 
months  ended  30  June  2016  for  the  same  reasons  as  all-in 
sustaining costs.  
 
In  the  South  Africa  region,  at  South  Deep,  all-in  sustaining  costs 
decreased by 17 per cent from R731,017 per kilogram (US$1,912 
per ounce) to R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per ounce) mainly 
due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher operating costs 
and  higher  sustaining  capital  expenditure.    The  total  all-in  cost 
decreased by 19 per cent from R772,702 per kilogram (US$2,020 
per ounce) to R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) due to
the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs as well as lower non-
sustaining capital expenditure. 
 
At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost 
decreased  by  9  per  cent  from  US$1,156  per  ounce  for  the  six 
months  ended  30  June  2015  to  US$1,052  per  ounce  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower net operating costs 
and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold. 
 
At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in 
cost increased by 16 per cent from US$423 per ounce to US$489 
per  ounce  mainly  due  to  lower  gold  sold  and  lower  by-product 
credits, partially offset by lower net operating costs.  All-in sustaining 
costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by 9 per 
cent from US$666 per equivalent ounce to US$728 per equivalent 
ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above, other than lower 
by-product credits as well as lower equivalent ounces sold. 
 
At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost 
increased marginally from A$1,263 per ounce (US$990 per ounce) 
for the six months ended 31 December 2015 to A$1,265 per ounce 
(US$928 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly 
due to higher capital expenditure and lower gold sold.

Underground tonnes milled increased by 52 per cent from 493,000 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 750,000 tonnes 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016.  Total  tonnes  milled 
increased by 104 per cent from 0.56 million tonnes to 1.14 million 
tonnes. Total tonnes milled for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
included 47,900 tonnes of underground waste mined and 346,300 
tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 8,700 tonnes of 
underground  waste  mined  and  58,300  tonnes  of  surface  tailings 
material for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  Underground reef 
yield increased by 23 per cent from 4.70 grams per tonne to 5.77 
grams per tonne due to greater adherence to spatial mining plans 
along with improved processes in the entire mining value chain. 
 
Development increased by 74 per cent from 1,773 metres for the six 
months  ended  30  June  2015  to  3,078  metres  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2016.  New mine capital development (phase one, 
sub 95 level) increased by 524 per cent from 83 metres for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 518 metres for the six months ended 
30 June 2016.  Development in the current mine areas in 95 level 
and  above  increased  by  51  per  cent  from  1,690  metres  to  2,560 
metres.    Destress  mining  increased  by  46  per  cent  from  13,619 
square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 19,845 
square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The destress 
conversion  from  low  profile  to  high  profile  mining  was  completed 
subsequent  to  quarter-end.    Longhole  stoping  volume  mined 
increased by 120 per cent from 136,858 tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 300,966 tonnes for the six months ended 30 
June 2016.  High profile destress mining started in June 2015 and 
improved  significantly  from  52  square  metres  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 10,599 square metres for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the introduction of 3 new drill rigs, 
improved  productivity  and  the  continued  roll-out  of  the  method 
across the entire mine.  The high profile and low profile methods 
contributed  53  per  cent  and  47  per  cent,  respectively,  to  total 
destress for the six months ended 30 June 2016.   
 
The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 65 per cent of the 
ore tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016, while the new 
mine (below 95 level) contributed 35 per cent.  The long-hole stoping 
method  accounted  for  42  per  cent  of  total  ore  tonnes  mined 
compared with 37 per cent for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

Net operating costs increased by 46 per cent from R1,340 million 
(US$113 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R1,959 
million  (US$127  million)  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016.  
The main contributing factor is the 52 per cent increase in tonnes 
mined, which resulted in higher bonuses paid, higher consumable 
spend  and  higher  utility  consumption.    The  increased  costs  were 
also  due  to  annual  salary  increases  and  additional  resources 
(employees and contractors) in line with the strategy to sustainably 
improve all aspects of the operation. 
 
Operating profit of R668 million (US$43 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with a loss of R267 million (US$22 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  This was mainly 
due to the 87 per cent (2,024 kilograms) increase in gold production 
together  with  a  31  per  cent  improvement  in  the  rand  gold  price, 
partially offset by increased net operating costs. 
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  63  per  cent  from  R419  million 
(US$35  million)  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  R682 
million (US$44 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 as a 
result of higher spending on fleet and the refurbishment of the man 
winder at Twin shaft. 
 
All-in sustaining costs decreased by 17 per cent from R731,017 per 
kilogram (US$1,912 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229  per ounce) for the six 
months  ended  30  June  2016  mainly  due  to  increased  gold  sold, 
partially  offset  by  higher  operating  costs  and  higher  sustaining 
capital expenditure. 
 
Total  all-in  cost  decreased  by  19  per  cent  from  R772,702  per 
kilogram (US$2,020 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257  per ounce) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to the same reasons as for all-in-
sustainable  costs  as  well  as 
lower  non-sustaining  capital 
expenditure. 
 
Sustaining capital expenditure increased from R322 million (US$27 
million)  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  R623  million 
(US$40  million)  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  due  to 
additional fleet and the refurbishment of the twin shaft man winder.  
Non-sustaining  capital  expenditure  decreased  from  R97  million 
(US$8 million) to R59 million (US$4 million).  
 
The independent Geotechnical Review Board (GRB), a committee 
of  local  and  international  experts,  will  continue  to  peer  review 
progress  at  South  Deep  to  ensure  exposure  to  relevant  industry 
leading practices and world class geotechnical support in massive 
underground mining at depth.

Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 52.4 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 51.3 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Ore tonnes mined 
decreased from 7.3 million tonnes to 6.5 million tonnes.  Operational 
waste  tonnes  mined  increased  from  16.0  million  tonnes  to  16.9 
million  tonnes  while  capital  waste  tonnes  mined  decreased  from 
29.1  million  tonnes  to  27.6  million  tonnes.    Head  grade  mined 
increased from 1.43 grams per tonne to 1.44 grams per tonne.  The 
strip ratio increased from 6.1 to 6.8.  
 
The  CIL  plant  throughput  decreased  from  6.81  million  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 6.80 million tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to unplanned downtime (both power and 
operational related).  Realised yield from the CIL plant decreased 
from 1.33 grams per tonne to 1.25 grams per tonne due to lower 
head grades processed as a result of the blend between lower grade 
stockpiles,  higher  grade  ore  tonnes  mined,  related  to  timing 
differences between ore mined and ore feed to the plant.  
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased  by  7  per  cent  from  US$168  million  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$156 million for the six months ended 30 
June  2016  due  to  a  net  increase  in  gold-in-process  and  lower 
operating costs.  The US$9 million build-up of stockpiles for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a drawdown of US$nil 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.  
 
Operating profit decreased from US$184 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$177 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 as a result of the lower gold sales, partially offset by lower 
net operating costs. 
 
Capital expenditure decreased by 32 per cent from US$133 million 
to  US$91  million  mainly  due  to  the  purchase  of  mining  fleet  for 
replacement  in  the  six  months  ended  June  2015.    Mining  fleet 
expenditure for the six months ended June 2015 was US$46 million 
compared with US$nil million for the six months ended June 2016. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent 
from US$1,106 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$993 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 11 per cent from 80,500 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 71,900 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and 
processed and lower yield. 
 
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 10.5 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 9.8 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the late start 
of  mining  at  the  Amoanda  pit  as  a  result  of  delays  in  securing 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit. 
 
Ore tonnes mined decreased from 2.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million 
tonnes.  Operational waste tonnes mined decreased from 8.2 million 
tonnes to 5.0 million tonnes as a result of only mining operational 
waste  tonnes  for  the  six  months  ended  June  2015,  while  both 
operational waste tonnes and capital waste tonnes were mined for 
the six months ended June 2016. Capital waste of 3.4 million tonnes 
was mined at Amoanda pit for the six months ended June 2016. The
six months to June 2015 had no capital waste.  Head grade mined 
increased from 1.25 grams per tonne to 1.42 grams per tonne.  The 
strip ratio increased from 3.5 to 6.0 due to capital stripping at the 
Amoanda pit. 
 
Yield decreased from 1.19 grams per tonne to 1.11 grams per tonne 
due  to  an  increase  in  lower  grade  stockpiles  treated.  For  the  six 
months  ended  June  2015,  1.79  million  tonnes  of  fresh  ore  and 
oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.31 grams per tonne and 
0.33 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 
1.34 grams per tonne.  This compared  with 1.15  million tonnes of 
fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.44 grams per 
tonne  and  0.86  million  tonnes  of  stockpiles  milled  at  an  average 
grade of 0.90 grams per tonne for the six months ended June 2016.  
 
Tonnes processed decreased from 2.11 million tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 2.01 million tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to a tailings line blockage for 10 days. 
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased  by  21  per  cent  from  US$94  million  to  US$74  million 
mainly due to lower mining and consumable costs in line with the 
lower  production  as  well  as  lower  payroll  costs  as  a  result  of 
retrenchments for the six months ended June 2016.    
 
Operating  profit  increased  from  US$4  million  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$13 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 due to lower net operating costs and higher gold prices 
achieved, partially offset by lower gold sold.  
 
Capital expenditure increased by 38 per cent from US$8 million to 
US$11 million with the majority spent on waste stripping at Amoanda 
pit. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 6 per cent 
from US$1,336 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$1,260 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
lower operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 10 per cent from 78,100 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 70,500 ounces for the six 
months  ended  30  June  2016.    Copper  production  increased 
marginally from 14,566 tonnes to 14,693 tonnes.  Equivalent gold
production  decreased  by  15  per  cent  from  150,200  ounces  to 
127,500 ounces.  The decrease in equivalent gold production was 
due to the lower copper price ratio as well as lower gold head grades 
treated.    The  lower  head  grades  were  in  line  with  the  mine 
sequencing and the planned production schedule for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016.  Gold head grade decreased from 1.08 grams 
per  tonne  to  0.96  grams  per  tonne  and  copper  head  grade 
decreased  from  0.53  per  cent  to  0.50  per  cent.    Gold  recoveries 
decreased  from  71.6  per  cent  to  67.4  per  cent  mainly  due  to 
mineralisation characteristics of the ore mined which is expected to 
dissipate by the end of the September quarter 2016 once this section 
of the orebody is mined. Copper recoveries increased from 86.4 per 
cent to 86.7 per cent.  As a result, gold yield decreased from 0.87 
grams  per  tonne  to  0.65  grams  per  tonne  and  copper  yield 
decreased from 0.55 per cent to 0.43 per cent.  The decreases in 
grade is in line with the plan. 
 
For the six months ended 30 June 2016, concentrate with a payable 
content of 66,847 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of 
US$1,220 per ounce and 13,877 tonnes of copper was sold at an 
average price of US$4,021 per tonne, net of treatment and refining 
charges.  This compared with 76,720 ounces of gold that was sold 
at an average price of US$1,192 per ounce and 14,174 tonnes of 
copper that was sold at an average price of US$5,190 per tonne, net 
of treatment and refining charges, for the six months ended 30 June 
2015.  Total equivalent gold sales decreased by 18 per cent from 
147,200 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 120,100 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower 
volumes produced. 
 
Total  tonnes  mined  increased  by  24  per  cent  from  6.12  million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 7.56 million tonnes 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  in  line  with  the  mine 
sequencing.  The higher tonnes mined was due to lower intensity of 
the  rainy  season.    Ore  mined  increased  by  6  per  cent  from  3.36 
million tonnes to 3.56 million tonnes.  Waste tonnes mined increased 
by 45 per cent from 2.76 million tonnes to 4.00 million tonnes. The 
strip ratio increased from 0.82 to 1.13 due to higher waste mined for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. Waste mined was higher for 
the six months ended June 2016 mainly due to the prioritisation of 
ore  mined  for  the  six  months  ended  June  2015  due  to  the  rainy 
season and the mining sequence. 
 
Ore processed increased by 9 per cent from 3.23 million tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 3.53 million tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to record plant throughput 
(835 tonnes per hour vs 791 tonnes per hour) after the completion 
of the plant optimisation project. 
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased  by  11  per  cent  from  US$71  million  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$63 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016.  The lower cost was mainly due to a US$6 million build-
up of concentrate inventory for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared  with  US$nil  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June 
2015.  
 
Operating profit was similar at US$85 million. 
 
Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from US$19 million to 
US$14  million.    The  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  included 
construction of the new fuel station and the new camp. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 16 per cent 
from US$423 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$489 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  This 
was  mainly  due  to  lower  gold  sold  and  lower  by-product  credits, 
partially  offset  by  lower  net  operating  costs  and  lower  capital 
expenditure.    All-in  sustaining  costs  and  total  all-in  costs  per 
equivalent  ounce  increased  by  9  per  cent  from  US$666  per 
equivalent ounce to US$728 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the 
same reasons as above and lower equivalent ounces sold.

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 187,900 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 175,900 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to the closure of the Cave Rocks 
and Athena underground mines and transition to a predominantly 
open pit operation.   
 
Total  tonnes  mined  increased  by  113  per  cent  from  10.5  million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 22.4 million tonnes 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016.    The  additional  tonnes 
mined  are  a  result  of  the  transition  to  a  predominantly  open  pit 
operation. 
 
At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 53 per cent 
from 0.70 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
0.33 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 with the 
closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines.  The 
grade mined increased by 19 per from 4.52 grams per tonne to 5.40 
grams per tonne as a result of the closure of the lower grade Cave 
Rocks mine.   
 
At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 213 
per cent from 0.60 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to 1.88 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
due to the ramp-up of Invincible pit.  Grade mined increased by 11 
per cent from 2.25 grams per tonne to 2.49 grams per tonne as the 
Invincible pit moved into a higher grade portion of the ore body.   
 
Operational  waste  tonnes  mined  increased  by  287  per  cent  from 
1.20 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 4.64 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  Capital waste 
tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 8.0 million tonnes to 
15.5 million tonnes.  The strip ratio decreased from 15.5 to 10.7 as 
the  Invincible  Pit  has  moved  from  a  predominately  stripping  to  a 
production phase, partially offset by the stripping of the Neptune pit 
in the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The increased tonnes reflect 
the  increase  in  activity  at  the  Invincible  mine  which  is  now  in  full 
production and the commencement of Stage 2 of the Neptune open 
pit giving St Ives two significant areas of open pit activity in 2016 and 
beyond.  The strip ratio for Invincible pit decreased from 20.5 to 8.7, 
while  the  strip  ratio  for  Neptune  pit  was  58.2  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2016. There was no mining activity at Neptune during 
the first half of 2015. 
 
Throughput  at  the  Lefroy  mill  decreased  by  5  per  cent  from  2.05 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 1.95 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016  due to low grade 
stockpiles used to supplement production for the six months ended 
June 2015. St Ives adopted a campaign milling strategy towards the 
end of the six months ended 30 June 2015. Yield decreased from 
2.84  grams  per  tonne  to  2.81  grams  per  tonne  in  line  with  less 
underground  production,  offset  by  no  longer  feeding  low  grade 
stockpiled material. Gold production from the Lefroy mill decreased 
from  185,400  ounces  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to
10             Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
173,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  In addition, 
93,000 tonnes of toll treatment produced 2,000 ounces for the six 
months to June 2016.  
 
Residual  leaching  and  irrigation  of  the  existing  heap  leach  pad 
produced a further 400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 
2016.    This  compared  with  2,500  ounces  produced  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2015.  The residual leaching has now ceased 
being economic and the heap leach is being closed.  Since cessation 
of stacking activities, a total of 24,800 ounces was produced.   
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements 
decreased from A$164 million (US$129 million) for the six months 
ended  30  June  2015  to  A$108  million  (US$79  million)  for  the  six 
months ended 30 June 2016.  The significant cost reduction is the 
result of: 
 
x 
the closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines; 
x  efficiencies in the open pits with the cost per tonne of material 
movement  decreasing  by  29  per  cent  on  larger  volumes  and 
productivity improvements; and 
the benefits of enhanced open pit production resulting in a credit 
of A$16 million (US$12 million) due to a build-up of stockpiles 
compared  with  a  cost  of  A$38  million  (US$30  million)  on 
drawdown of stockpiles in the six months ended 30 June 2015.
x
The benefits of the above cost reductions were  partially offset by 
increased mining volumes. 
 
Operating profit increased from A$125 million (US$98 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$182 million (US$134 million) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a higher Australian 
dollar  gold  price  (A$1,651  per  ounce  vs  A$1,542  per  ounce)  and 
significant  net  operating  cost  reductions,  partially  offset  by  lower 
production. 
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  22  per  cent  from  A$77  million 
(US$60  million)  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  A$94 
million (US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 with 
an additional A$13 million (US$10 million) incurred on pre-stripping 
at Neptune and A5 pit.  
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 9 per cent 
from A$1,375 per ounce (US$1,079 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,247 per ounce (US$915 per ounce) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the significant reduction 
in net operating costs, partially offset by lower production and higher 
capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 113,400 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 109,300 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 mainly due to a reduction in ore tonnes 
mined and processed, partially offset by higher grades.  
 
Ore  mined  from  underground  decreased  by  14  per  cent  from 
622,000 tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 532,000 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Ore mined from New 
Holland decreased by 19 per cent from 345,000 tonnes to 278,000 
tonnes,  mainly  due  to  the  Genesis  500  Series  North  nearing
completion and the focus on developing the Cinderella ore body in 
the  six  months  ended  June  2016.  Ore  mined  at  Waroonga 
decreased by 8 per cent from 277,000 tonnes to 254,000 tonnes due 
to more difficult ground conditions encountered in the six months to 
June 2016.  Head grade mined increased by 7 per cent from 6.02 
grams  per  tonne  to  6.44  grams  per  tonne  mainly  due  to  a  larger 
concentration of ore sourced from the higher grade Kim ore body.    
 
Tonnes processed decreased by 10 per cent from 625,700 tonnes 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 566,200 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower tonnes available from the 
mines.  The combined yield increased from 5.64 grams per tonne to 
6.00 grams per tonne mainly due to higher grades mined. 
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
increased by 2 per cent from A$93 million (US$73 million) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to A$95 million (US$70 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a A$4 million (US$3 million) 
drawdown  of  inventory  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016 
compared with a A$1 million (US$1 million) build-up of inventory for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015.  
 
Operating profit increased from A$82 million (US$64 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$84 million (US$61 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June  2016 due to  the  higher Australian 
dollar  gold  price  (A$1,639  per  ounce  vs  A$1,538  per  ounce), 
partially offset by reduced production and higher net operating costs. 
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  23  per  cent  from  A$44  million 
(US$34  million  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2015  to  A$54 
million (US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016.  The 
increase in capital expenditure was due to the decline development 
to  the  Cinderella  ore  body  at  New  Holland,  an  exploration 
development drive towards Waroonga North at Waroonga mine and 
increased exploration expenditure across the lease. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 14 per cent 
from A$1,277 per ounce (US$1,001 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,456 per ounce (US$1,068 per ounce) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to decreased gold sold, 
higher  net  operating  costs  and  higher  capital  expenditure.    All-in-
sustaining costs are expected to decrease in the second half of 2016 
as Cinderella moves into production and with the completion of the 
Waroonga North exploration development drive.

Gold production increased by 31 per cent from 28,500 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 37,200 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to increased tonnes and higher 
grade mined and processed from the Lords South Lower ore body.  
 
Ore mined from underground increased by 5 per cent from 194,200 
tonnes to 204,800 tonnes.  Head grade mined increased by 18 per 
cent from 4.96 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 
2015  to  5.86  grams  per  tonne  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June 
2016.    The  increase  in  tonnes  and  grades  was  due  to  mining  of 
higher  grade  remnant  areas  and  extensions  to  the  Lords  South 
Lower ore body.  A further 25,300 tonnes at 1.35 grams per tonne 
were sourced from a surface oxide trial during the six months ended 
June 2016 contributing approximately 1,000 ounces.
Tonnes processed increased by 7 per cent from 214,300 tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 230,100 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016.  The yield increased from 4.14 grams 
per tonne to 5.02 grams per tonne due to higher grade ore mined, 
partially offset by the lower grade oxide trial.    
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
increased by 14 per cent from A$36 million (US$28 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$41 million (US$30 million) for 
the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016.    The  increase  reflects 
increased volumes mined and processed as well as a A$1 million 
(US$nil  million)  build-up  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016 
compared with A$2 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2015.  
 
Operating profit increased from A$8 million (US$6 million) to A$21 
million (US$15 million) due to the higher Australian dollar gold price 
(A$1,669 per ounce vs A$1,538 per ounce), partially offset by the 
higher net operating costs. 
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  8  per  cent  from  A$13  million 
(US$10 million) to A$14 million (US$10 million). Capital expenditure 
in  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  was  mainly  incurred  on 
exploration and the commencement of development to the Oval ore 
body.  The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected to 
provide the primary ore feed in 2017 and into 2018.  The Oval ore 
body extends the life of mine allowing Darlot to maintain its strategy 
of  self-funding  exploration  expenditure  while  it  continues  an 
aggressive exploration program to secure its future as a Gold Fields 
franchise asset. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 13 per cent 
from A$1,786 per ounce (US$1,400 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,554 per ounce (US$1,139 per ounce) 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016  due  to  higher  gold  sold, 
partially offset by higher net operating costs.

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 146,600 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 143,700 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower grades mined in line with 
the  mining  sequence  and  as  planned,  as  well  as  an  increase  in 
stockpiled ore as a consequence of the campaign milling. 
 
Ore mined from underground increased by 13 per cent from 677,000 
tonnes to 763,000 tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased by 4 per 
cent from 6.77 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 
2015  to  6.52  grams  per  tonne  for  the  six  months  ended  30  June

Tonnes processed increased by 1 per cent from 731,000 tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 741,300 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016.  The yield decreased from 6.23 grams 
per tonne to 6.03 grams per tonne due to lower head grades. The 
mill  is  not  operating  at  capacity  and  the  timing  of  the  milling 
campaign results in variances between tonnes mined and milled in 
any given period which also impacts yield variances between head 
grade and yield.

Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements 
decreased by 2 per cent from A$94 million (US$73 million) to A$92 
million  (US$67 million).    Mining costs  increased  on  the  additional 
volumes, but was more than offset by the net gold in process credit 
associated  with  the  respective  timing  of  the  milling  campaigns, 
referred to above.  The gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million 
(US$1 million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with 
a charge of A$6 million (US$5 million) for the six months ended June 
2015. This A$8 million change in gold-in-process was mainly due to 
timing of the campaign milling. 
 
Operating  profit  increased  by  13  per  cent  from  A$132  million 
(US$103 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$149 
million (US$109 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due 
to the higher Australian gold price (A$1,674 per ounce vs A$1,539 
per ounce). 
 
Capital expenditure increased from A$43 million (US$34 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$51 million (US$38 million) 
for  the  six  months  ended  30  June  2016.    The  majority  of  the 
expenditure  related  to  capital  development,  exploration  and  the 
establishment  of  the  fresh  air  intake  ventilation  raise.    The  mine 
moved from diesel power to gas fired power in May 2016 with the 
completion of construction and the commissioning of the new power 
station.  The new power station is expected to provide savings in 
power  costs,  lower  maintenance  costs  and  the  risk  of  power 
interruptions.  It is also expected to reduce carbon emissions. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 6 per cent 
from  A$1,008  per  ounce  (US$789  per  ounce)  for  the  six  months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,068 per ounce (US$783 per ounce) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower gold sold, 
higher capital expenditure, partially offset by the lower net operating 
costs.

GOLD  FIELDS  APPOINTS  FOUR  NEW  NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD 
 
Gold  Fields  has  announcement  the  appointments  of  four  new 
independent  non-executive  directors  to  its  Board  of  Directors. 
Impala  Platinum  CEO  Terence  Goodlace  joined  the  Board  as  a 
director on 1 July 2016, while Alhassan Andani, the Chief Executive 
and Executive Director of Stanbic Bank Ghana, joined on 1 August 
2016.  Former  KPMG  Africa  Chair,  Yunus  Suleman  and  Peter 
Bacchus, the Global Head of Mining and Metals and Joint Head of 
European Investment Banking at Investment Bank Jefferies, based 
in London, will join the Board on 1 September 2016.   
  
Gold Fields Chairperson Cheryl Carolus said the four new directors 
will ensure continuity of the skills set of the Board as a number of 
the current directors were approaching retirement age over the next 
two  years.  Former  director  David  Murray  stepped  down  from  the 
Board on 1 June 2016. 
 
“The new directors provide the technical, financial, commercial and 
global  mining  experience  necessary  to  help  Gold  Fields  maintain 
and further strengthen its position as a global leader in sustainable 
gold mining,” Ms Carolus said. 
 
CREDIT FACILITIES SUCCESSFULLY REFINANCED 
Gold  Fields  successfully  refinanced  its  US$1,440  million  credit 
facilities  due  in  November  2017.    The  new  facilities  amount  to 
US$1,290 million and comprise three tranches: 
x  US$380 million: 3 year term loan – margin 250 basis points (bps)
over Libor;
x  US$360 million: 3 year revolving credit facility (RCF) (with an 
option to extend to up to 5 years) – margin 220bps over Libor; 
and
x  US$550 million: 5 year RCF – margin 245bps over Libor.
12             Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
The new facilities were concluded with a syndicate of 15 banks. On 
average,  the  interest  rate  on  the  new  facilities  is  similar  to  the 
interest rate on the existing facilities.  A total of US$645 million was 
drawn down from the new facilities on 13 June 2016 to repay the 
group’s  existing  US$  facilities,  with  US$645  million  remaining 
unutilised. The refinancing is a key milestone in Gold Fields’ balance 
sheet management and increases the maturity of its debt, with the 
first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 2017).  
 
CASH DIVIDEND 
In line with the company’s dividend policy to pay out a dividend of 
between 25 and 35 per cent of its earnings, the Board has approved 
and  declared  an  interim  dividend  number  84  of  50  SA  cents  per 
ordinary share (gross) in respect of the six months ended 30 June 
2016.  This translates to 26 per cent of normalised earnings.  The 
interim dividend will be subject to the Dividend Withholding Tax of 
15 per cent.  In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a)(i) and 11.17(c)

Outlook for 2016  
 
As a result of the better than expected performance at South Deep, 
we have increased the  2016 production guidance for  the mine to 
9,000 kilograms (289,000 ounces) from 8,000 kilograms (257,000 
ounces). However, we have also increased the AIC guidance for the 
year  to  R595,000  per  kilogram  (US$1,310  per  ounce)  from 
R575,000  per  kilogram  (US$1,265  per  ounce).  The  higher  AIC 
relates  to  increased  capital  expenditure  of  R211  million  (US$15 
million) to R1,210 million (US$86 million) due to a change in strategy 
on housing (decision to build instead of rent) and the acquisition of 
additional new fleet. The remainder of the increase is due to higher 
working costs, which comprise higher bonuses due to higher gold 
production  achieved  relative  to  plan  as  well  as  the  investment  in 
additional resources in line with the strategy to sustainably improve 
all aspects of the operation.  
 
For Tarkwa, we have increased the 2016 AIC guidance to US$980 
per ounce from US$940 per ounce, mainly due to a US$38 million 
increase  in  capital  expenditure  to  US$166  million.  The  mine  took 
advantage  of  the  higher  gold  price  and  the  benefits  from  the
Development  Agreement  to  increase  capital  stripping  in  order  to 
increase flexibility for 2017 and beyond.  
 
Based on the outperformance of the Australian operations relative 
to  plan  in  the  first  half  of  2016,  we  have  increased  the  2016 
production guidance for the region to 925,000 ounces from 905,000 
ounces. 
 
Consequently,  2016 production  guidance for the Group has been 
increased to 2.10 million ounces to 2.15 million ounces, from 2.05 
million ounces to 2.10 million ounces. AISC and AIC guidance for 
the year remains unchanged at US$1,000 per ounce to US$1,010 
per ounce and US$1,035 per ounce to US$1,045 per ounce. AIC 
includes US$50 million for Salares Norte. Group capital expenditure 
has  increased  to  US$655  million,  from  U$602  million.  The  cost 
guidance  is  based  on  unchanged  exchange  rate  assumptions: 
US$0.73 = A$1.00 and R14.14 = US$1.00.  
 
The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact 
of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on 
page 3.

CERTIFICATION JUDGEMENT
As  previously  indicated,  the  Respondents  in  the  Certification 
Application,  including  Gold  Fields,  all  opposed  the  certification 
application, which was heard by the Gauteng Local Division of the 
High Court from 12 to 23 October 2015. 
 
On 13 May 2016, the High Court ordered, amongst other things: (1) 
the  certification  of  two  classes:  (a)  a  silicosis  class  comprising 
current and former mine workers who have contracted silicosis and 
the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis; and (b) 
a  tuberculosis  class  comprising  current  and  former  mine  workers 
who  have  worked  on  the  mines  for  a  period  of  not  less  than  two 
years  and  who  have  contracted  pulmonary  tuberculosis  and  the 
dependents  of  deceased  mine  workers  who  died  of  pulmonary 
tuberculosis; and (2) that the common law be developed to provide 
that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages and 
subsequently dies before close of pleadings, the claim for general 
damages will transmit to the estate of the deceased claimant.  
 
The progression of the classes certified will be done in two phases: 
(i) a determination of common issues, on an opt out basis, and (ii) 
the hearing and determination of individualized issues, on an opt in 
basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the Claimants. 
The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the 
cases brought by the Claimants. The amount of damages has not 
yet  been  quantified  for  any  of  the  claimants  in  the  Consolidated 
Class Application or for any other members of the classes. 
 
Gold Fields and the other Respondents believe that the judgment 
addressed  a  number  of  highly  complex  and  important  issues, 
including a far reaching amendment of the common law, that have 
not previously been considered by other courts in South Africa. The 
High  Court  itself  found  that  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  the 
proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that the class 
action would address novel and complex issues of fact and law. The
companies  applied  for  leave  to  appeal  against  the  judgement 
because  they  believed  that  the  court’s  ruling  on  some  of  these 
issues is incorrect and that another court may come to a different 
decision. 
 
On  24  June  2016,  the  High  Court  granted  the  mining  companies 
leave to appeal  against the finding amending the common law in 
respect of the transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused 
leave  to  appeal  on  the  certification  of  silicosis  and  tuberculosis 
classes. 
 
On 15 July, the Gold Fields and the other Respondents each filed 
petitions to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against 
the  certification  of  the  two  separate  classes  for  silicosis  and 
tuberculosis. In an attempt to shorten any delay due to an appeal 
process, it is permissible to request that the appeals be dealt with 
on  an  expedited  basis.  The  companies  intend  to  do  this,  should 
leave to appeal be granted by the Supreme Court of Appeal. 
 
GOLD WORKING GROUP
The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group, made up of African 
Rainbow  Minerals,  Anglo  American  SA,  AngloGold  Ashanti,  Gold 
Fields,  Harmony  and  Sibanye  Gold,  remains  of  the  view  that 
achieving a mutually acceptable comprehensive settlement which is 
both fair to past, present and future employees, and sustainable for 
the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation. Notwithstanding that 
the companies deny liability for the claims, the Working Group will 
continue with its efforts – which have been ongoing for more than a 
year  –  to  find  common  ground  with  stakeholders,  including  the 
claimants’ legal representatives.

The Group’s policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price.  However, hedges are sometimes undertaken on a project specific basis as follows:
x 
x 
x
to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure; 
for specific debt servicing requirements; and  
to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.
Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying cash flows.

tailings  material  compared  with  23,000
Gold  production  increased  by  20  per  cent  from  1,978  kilograms 
(63,600  ounces)  in  the  March  quarter  to  2,378  kilograms  (76,500 
ounces) in the June quarter due to higher volumes. 
 
Underground tonnes milled increased by 26 per cent from 332,000 
tonnes in the March quarter to 418,000 tonnes in the June quarter. 
Total tonnes milled increased by 11 per cent from 543,000 tonnes 
to 601,000 tonnes.  Total tonnes milled in the June quarter included 
24,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 158,800 tonnes of 
surface 
tonnes  of 
underground  waste mined and 187,500 tonnes of surface tailings 
material in the March quarter. Underground reef yield decreased by 
4 per cent from 5.91 grams per tonne to 5.66 grams per tonne due 
to higher development tonnes mined in lower grade areas. 
 
Development  increased  by  38  per  cent  from  1,292  metres  in  the 
March quarter to 1,786 metres in the June quarter.  New mine capital 
development (phase one, sub 95 level) increased by 6 per cent from 
252 metres in the March quarter to 266 metres in the June quarter.  
Development  in  the  current  mine  areas  in  95  level  and  above 
increased  by  46  per  cent  from  1,040  metres  to  1,520  metres.  
Destress  mining  decreased  by  5  per  cent  from  10,158  square 
metres  in  the  March  quarter  to  9,687  square  metres  in  the  June 
quarter.  High profile destress mining improved by 35 per cent from 
4,517 square metres to 6,082 square metres.  Low profile destress 
mining decreased by 36 per cent from 5,641 square metres to 3,605 
square  metres  due  to  the  strategic  change  in  the  mining  method 
from  low  to  high  profile  destress  which  commenced  in  the 
September 2015 quarter.   The high profile and low profile methods 
contributed  63  per  cent  and  37  per  cent,  respectively,  to  total 
destress.  All  low  profile  destress  was  completed  subsequent  to 
quarter-end. 
 
The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 66 per cent of the 
ore tonnes in the June quarter, while the new mine (below 95 level) 
contributed 34 per cent.  The long-hole stoping method accounted 
for  39  per  cent  of  total  ore  tonnes  mined  in  the  June  quarter 
compared with 46 per cent in the March quarter.  The decrease is 
due  to  the  temporary  loss  of  two  drill  rigs  after  a  fall  of  ground 
incident.
Operating costs increased by 12 per cent from R924 million (US$59 
million)  to  R1,034  million  (US$69  million)  mainly  due  to  higher 
bonuses  paid  and  consumable  expenditure  directly  related  to  the 
higher production achieved.  The electricity expenditure was higher 
than the previous quarter as a result of the start of the winter month 
tariffs in June 2016 and higher consumption related to the higher 
production achieved.   
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  60  per  cent  from  R262  million 
(US$17 million) to R420 million (US$28 million) as a result of higher 
spending on fleet and the purchase of mining accommodation for 
employees. As part of the fleet renewal strategy, 17 category 1 units 
were commissioned during H1 2016, with an additional 11 units to 
be  commissioned  during  the  remainder  of  2016.  In  the  past  18 
months, we have commissioned 51 new category 1 units out of a 
total of 114 units. 
 
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 71 per cent from R230 
million (US$15 million) in the March quarter to R393 million (US$26 
million) in the June quarter due to additional fleet and the purchase 
of  mining  accommodation  for  employees.    Non-sustaining  capital 
expenditure  decreased  by  16  per  cent  from  R32  million  (US$2 
million) in the March quarter to R27 million (US$2 million) in the June 
quarter. 
 
All-in sustaining costs increased by 3 per cent from R600,563 per 
kilogram (US$1,183 per ounce) in the March quarter to R615,697 
per kilogram (US$1,268 per ounce) in the June quarter mainly due 
to 
increased  operating  costs  and  higher  sustaining  capital 
expenditure, partially offset by increased gold sold. 
 
Total all-in cost increased by 2 per cent from R616,706 per kilogram 
(US$1,215  per  ounce)  in  the  March  quarter  to  R627,233  per 
kilogram (US$1,293 per ounce) in the June quarter due to the same 
reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 139,500 ounces in 
the  March  quarter  to  134,100  ounces  in  the  June  quarter  due  to 
lower throughput as a result of unplanned downtime.   
 
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 3 per 
cent from 25.3 million tonnes in the March quarter to 26.0 million 
tonnes  in  the  June  quarter  mainly  due  to  improved  equipment 
utilisation.    Ore  tonnes  mined  decreased  by  6  per  cent  from  3.4 
million  tonnes  to  3.2  million  tonnes.    Operational  waste  tonnes 
mined was similar at 8.6 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes 
mined  increased  by  7  per  cent  from  13.3  million  tonnes  to  14.2

to 1.36 grams per tonne.  The strip ratio increased from 6.6 to 7.0.  
 
The CIL plant throughput decreased by 6 per cent from 3.50 million 
tonnes in the March quarter to 3.30 million tonnes in the June quarter 
due to unplanned downtime mainly due to power outages. Realised 
yield  increased  by  2  per  cent  from  1.24  grams  per  tonne  to  1.26 
grams per tonne due to higher feed grades processed as a result of 
blending. 
 
Net  operating  costs,  including  gold-in-process  movements,  was 
similar at US$78 million. 
 
Capital expenditure decreased by 10 per cent from US$48 million to 
US$43 million mainly due to expenditure on mining fleet in the March 
quarter.    
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased marginally from 
US$994 per ounce in the March quarter to US$991 per ounce in the 
June  quarter  due  to  lower  capital  expenditure,  partially  offset  by 
lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 28 per cent from 41,700 ounces in 
the March quarter to 30,200 ounces in the June quarter mainly due 
to lower tonnes processed and lower grades mined and processed. 
 
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 15 per 
cent  from  4.6  million  tonnes  in  the  March  quarter  to  5.3  million 
tonnes in the June quarter due to capital waste strip at Amoanda pit.  
 
Ore tonnes mined decreased by 25 per cent from 0.8 million tonnes 
to 0.6 million tonnes.  Total waste tonnes mined increased by 24 per 
cent  from  3.8  million  tonnes  in  the  March  quarter  to  4.7  million 
tonnes in the June quarter.  Head grade mined decreased by 6 per 
cent from 1.46 grams per tonne to 1.37 grams per tonne.  The strip 
ratio increased from 4.5 to 8.1 due to capital waste strip at Amoanda 
pit. 
 
Yield decreased by 22 per cent from 1.25 grams per tonne to 0.97 
grams per tonne due to more low grade stockpiles processed.  For 
the March quarter, 0.67 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were 
milled at an average grade of 1.56 grams per tonne and 0.37 million 
tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 0.99 grams 
per tonne. This compared with 0.48 million tonnes of fresh ore and 
oxides milled at an average grade of 1.28 grams per tonne and 0.49 
million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average grade of 0.79 grams 
per tonne for the June quarter. 
 
Tonnes processed decreased by 7 per cent from 1.04 million tonnes 
in the March quarter to 0.97 million tonnes in the June quarter mainly 
due to a tails line blockage which impacted production for 10 days 
caused by coarse grind and the fast settling nature of the ore.

Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased by 32 per cent from US$44 million to US$30 million, in 
line with lower ore tonnes mined. 
 
Capital expenditure increased by 900 per cent from US$1 million to 
US$10  million  with  the  majority  spent  on  capital  stripping  at 
Amoanda pit. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 25 per cent 
from  US$1,139  per  ounce  in  the  March  quarter  to  US$1,427  per 
ounce in the June quarter mainly due to higher capital expenditure 
and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating costs.

Gold production increased by 3 per cent from 34,800 ounces in the 
March  quarter  to  35,700  ounces  in  the  June  quarter.    Copper 
production  increased  by  8  per  cent  from  7,051  tonnes  to  7,642 
tonnes.  Equivalent gold production increased by 3 per cent from 
62,900 ounces to 64,600 ounces.  The increase in gold and copper 
production was due to higher head grades treated, in line with the 
mining sequence and the planned production schedule for the June 
quarter.  Gold head grade increased from 0.94 grams per tonne to 
0.98 grams per tonne and copper head grade increased from 0.49 
per cent to 0.51 per cent.  Gold recoveries decreased from 68.5 per 
cent to 66.3 per cent and copper recoveries increased from 85.4 per 
cent to 88.0 per cent.  As a result, gold yield increased from 0.64 
grams per tonne to 0.65 grams per tonne and copper yield increased 
from 0.42 per cent to 0.45 per cent.  
 
In the June quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 32,900 
ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,252 per ounce 
and  6,895  tonnes  of  copper  was  sold  at  an  average  price  of 
US$4,028 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges.  This 
compared with 33,939 ounces of gold sold at an average price of 
US$1,133 per ounce and 6,982 tonnes of copper sold at an average 
price of US$3,847 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges, 
in the March quarter.   
 
Total tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 3.91 million tonnes 
in the March quarter to 3.65 million tonnes in the June quarter.  The
lower tonnes mined in the June quarter were as a result of the lower 
waste mined in line with the mine sequence.  Ore mined increased 
by  2  per  cent  from  1.76  million  tonnes  to  1.80  million  tonnes.  
Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 2.15 
million tonnes to 1.85 million tonnes.  The strip ratio decreased from 
1.23 to 1.03 due to lower waste mined in the June quarter. 
 
Ore processed increased by 2 per cent from 1.75 million tonnes in 
the March quarter to 1.78 million tonnes in the June quarter. 
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased by 9 per cent from US$33 million to US$30 million mainly 
due to US$7 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the June quarter 
compared with a US$1 million charge to cost in the March quarter. 
 
Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from US$5 million to 
US$8 million due to more construction activities at the tailings dam 
as a result of the dry season.   
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 55 per cent 
from US$386 per ounce in the March quarter to US$599 per ounce 
in the June quarter mainly due to lower copper by-product credits 
and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating 
costs.  All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent 
ounce increased by 6 per cent from US$709 per equivalent ounce 
to US$750 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as 
above.

Gold production increased by 2 per cent from 87,000 ounces in the 
March quarter to 88,800 ounces in the June quarter.   
 
Total tonnes mined decreased by 1 per cent from 11.2 million tonnes 
in the March quarter to 11.1 million tonnes in the June quarter.  
 
At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 15 per cent 
from 178,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 151,000 tonnes in the 
June  quarter  due  to  the  Athena  mine  closure  in  February.    The 
reduced tonnes were partially offset by a 4 per cent increase in head 
grade from 5.29 grams per tonne to 5.52 grams per tonne.   
 
At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 23 
per  cent  from  844,000  tonnes  in  the  March  quarter  to  1,035,000 
tonnes in the June quarter.  Grade mined decreased by 16 per cent 
from 2.72 grams per tonne to 2.29 grams per tonne.  The increased 
tonnes and lower grade were primarily due to increased ore from A5 
open pit which is now complete.  Mining at A5 was undertaken to
supplement  production  while  the  higher  grade  Neptune  pit  was 
being stripped. 
 
Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 1.6 
million tonnes in the March quarter to 3.1 million tonnes in the June 
quarter.  Capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 19 per cent from 
8.6 million tonnes to 7.0 million tonnes.  The strip ratio decreased 
from  12.1  to  9.6.    Total  material  movements  at  the  open  pits 
remained consistent at 11.1 million tonnes with a move from capital 
stripping  to  ore  and  waste  movement  as  the  A5  pit  moved  to 
completion and the Neptune pit advanced into the early stages of 
ore production.   
 
Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 5 per cent from 997,000 
tonnes in the March quarter to 950,000 ounces in the June quarter 
with  the  mill  closed  for  the  last  week  of  the  June  quarter  for  the 
installation of a new electrical control block for the Sag mill.  Yield 
increased from 2.70 grams per tonne to 2.91 grams per tonne due 
to a drawdown of gold-in-circuit in the June quarter as opposed to a 
build-up of gold-in-circuit in the March quarter.  Gold production from 
the Lefroy mill increased from 86,600 ounces to 88,800 ounces.  
 
Residual leaching and irrigation of the heap leach pad contributed 
400 ounces to production in the March quarter. Residual leaching 
has now ceased being economic and the heap leach is being closed. 
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
increased by 20 per cent from A$49 million (US$35 million) to A$59 
million  (US$44  million)  mainly  due  to  the  transition  from  primarily 
pre-strip mining to operating waste and ore mining in the open pits.  
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  9  per  cent  from  A$45  million 
(US$33  million)  to  A$49  million  (US$37  million)  mainly  due  to 
acceleration  of 
the  exploration  programme  with  expenditure 
increasing from A$9 million (US$6 million) in the March quarter to 
A$13 million (US$10 million) in the June quarter.  
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 11 per cent 
from A$1,182 per ounce (US$852 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$1,311 per ounce (US$976 per ounce) in the June quarter due 
to higher net operating costs and capital expenditure, partially offset 
by increased gold sold.

Gold production increased by 10 per cent from 52,100 ounces in the 
March quarter to 57,200 ounces in the June quarter. 
 
Ore mined from underground increased by 11 per cent from 252,000 
tonnes in the March quarter to 279,000 tonnes in the June quarter 
due to higher tonnes mined from New Holland.  Head grade mined 
decreased marginally from 6.45 grams per tonne to 6.42 grams per 
tonne.

Tonnes processed decreased by 1 per cent from 284,000 tonnes in 
the March quarter to 282,000 tonnes in the June quarter.  The March 
quarter processing included net 32,000 tonnes of ore carried over 
from the December quarter but processed in the March quarter.  The 
combined yield increased by 11 per cent from 5.70 grams per tonne 
to  6.30  grams  per  tonne  due  to  lower  grade  ore  mined  in  the 
December  quarter,  but  processed  in  the  March  quarter  (as 
described  in  the  preceding  sentence)  and  a  drawdown  of  2,600 
ounces produced in the March quarter during the June quarter.  
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased by 2 per cent from A$48 million (US$35 million) to A$47 
million (US$35 million) mainly due the cost improvement initiatives 
implemented across the site. 
 
Capital expenditure was similar at A$27 million (US$20 million).  The 
capital expenditure was primarily on capital development associated 
with opening up of the Fitzroy Bengal Hastings (FBH), Waroonga 
North exploration drive and Cinderella ore body and on exploration 
across the site.    
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent 
from A$1,536 per ounce (US$1,106 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$1,383 per ounce (US$1,034 per ounce) in the June quarter due 
to increased gold sold and lower net operating costs.

Gold  production  decreased  marginally  from  18,700  ounces  in  the 
March quarter to 18,500 ounces in the June quarter due to lower 
grade mined.  
 
Ore mined from underground increased by 4 per cent from 100,300 
tonnes to 104,500 tonnes.  Head grade mined decreased from 5.94 
grams per tonne in the March quarter to 5.78 grams per tonne in the 
June quarter.  A further 20,000 tonnes at 0.87 grams per tonne were 
sourced  from  a  surface  oxide  trial  during  the  June  quarter 
contributing approximately 500 ounces to production.  In the March 
quarter 5,600 tonnes of oxide material at 3.05 grams per tonne were 
processed adding approximately 500 ounces to production. 
 
Tonnes processed increased by 30 per cent from 100,000 tonnes in 
the March quarter to 130,000 tonnes in the June quarter.  The yield 
decreased by 24 per cent from 5.84 grams per tonne to 4.42 grams 
per tonne due to lower grade ore mined and a significantly larger but 
lower grade trial treatment of surface oxide ore in the June quarter.   
 
Net  operating  costs, 
including  gold-in-process  movements, 
decreased by 5 per cent from A$21 million (US$16 million) to A$20 
million (US$15 million) mainly due to a decrease in mining costs. 
 
Capital expenditure increased by 33 per cent from A$6 million (US$4 
million) to A$8 million (US$6 million).  Capital was mainly incurred 
on exploration and the commencement of development to the Oval
28             Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
ore body.  The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected 
to provide the primary ore feed in 2017 and into 2018.  The Oval ore 
body extends the life of mine allowing Darlot to maintain its strategy 
of  at  least  breaking  even  while  it  continues  an  aggressive 
exploration program to secure its future as a Gold Fields franchise 
asset. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent 
from A$1,534 per ounce (US$1,105 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to A$1,574 per ounce (US$1,167 per ounce) in the June quarter due 
to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating 
costs.

Gold production increased by 13 per cent from 67,500 ounces in the 
March quarter to 76,200 ounces in the June quarter. 
 
Ore mined from underground increased by 2 per cent from 378,000 
tonnes to 385,000 tonnes.  Head grade mined increased from 5.99 
grams per tonne in the March quarter to 7.04 grams per tonne in the 
June  quarter.    The  increased  grade  was  due  to  stoping  activity 
returning  to  better  grade  areas  of  the  mine  with  operating 
development also advancing through higher grade zones than in the 
March quarter.   
 
Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 378,000 tonnes in 
the  March  quarter  to  363,000  tonnes  in  the  June  quarter.    A  net 
21,000  tonnes  of  ore  mined  in  the  June  quarter  is  planned  to  be 
processed  in  the  September  quarter  due  to  the  campaign  milling 
schedule.  The yield increased by 17 per cent from 5.56 grams per 
tonne to 6.51 grams per tonne due to higher grades mined.  
 
Net  operating  costs,  including  gold-in-process  movements,  were 
similar at A$46 million (US$34 million). 
 
Capital  expenditure  increased  by  55  per  cent  from  A$20  million 
(US$15 million) in the March quarter to A$31 million (US$23 million) 
in the June quarter.  The higher expenditure related to mine capital 
development, exploration and the sinking of the VR7 fresh air intake 
raise  which  will provide ventilation  down to 100 level, the newest 
mining  front.  These  projects  accelerated  during  the  June  quarter 
after a slow start to the year. 
 
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent 
from A$1,054 per ounce (US$759 per ounce) in the March quarter 
to  A$1,081  per  ounce  (US$805  per  ounce)  in  the  June  quarter 
mainly due to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by increased 
gold sold.
