31 July 2016
Highlights of the activities for the Quarter ending 30 June 2016 included:
Quinchia Gold Portfolio
·            A JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate was released to the market on 7 July 2016.  At a
1.2g/t Au cut-off, the Miraflores Project has a Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource of 9.19 million
tonnes at 2.81g/t Au and 2.76g/t Ag containing 832,000 oz Au and 817,000 oz Ag.
·            The Quinchia Gold Portfolio complements Metminco's (or the "Company") strategy and
capabilities providing the Company with a near term cash flow opportunity via the Miraflores Project
where a mineable quantity of 4.03 million tonnes at 3.51g/t Au and 2.84g/t Ag has been scheduled
containing 455,000 oz of Au and 368,000 oz Ag.  The mineable quantity comprises the following:
> 1.2g/t Au cut-off:         3,825,501 tonnes at 3.66g/t Au and 2.91g/t Ag
> 0.6g/t and <1.2g/t Au: 203,000 tonnes at 0.85g/t Au and 1.5g/t Ag
·            The mining schedule developed has identified a 9-year mine life producing approximately
50,000 oz per annum at steady state.  The Company is currently working with consultants to update the
capital and operating costs based on the new mining schedule.
·            Significant upside potential exists at targets such as Tesorito, where a large gold porphyry
system has been identified with drill hole TS-DH-02 returning an intercept of 384 metres @ 1.01 g/t
gold, 0.9 g/t silver and 0.08% copper from surface.

MIRAFLORES GOLD PROJECT - COLOMBIA
Introduction
The Miraflores Gold Project is part of the Quinchia Gold Portfolio and is located in Colombia's Middle
Cauca Belt, which hosts several multimillion ounce gold discoveries (Annexure 1).  The Middle Cauca
Belt is a north-south geological trend that takes its name from the Cauca River that runs through it, and
represents the area of focus where explorers are looking to make new porphyry gold and gold-copper
discoveries.
The district extends roughly from Ibague in Tolima at the southern extremity to Medellin at its northern
extremity, and it has resulted in a number of significant greenfield and brownfield discoveries.  These
discoveries have made the belt the most prolific in Colombia in terms of discovered ounces to date and
remains highly prospective for additional discoveries.
Geology
The Miraflores deposit comprises a magmatic-hydrothermal breccia pipe located within a fertile
hypabyssal porphyry cluster breccia-pipe.  The breccia pipe is sub-vertical and cylindrical with surface
dimensions of 250m x 280m with a known vertical extent of 500m to 600m, but open at depth, with clear
contacts with the adjacent basalts of the Barroso Formation.  A NNW - SSE fracturing system appears
to control the formation of the breccia.
Four types of breccia have been distinguished, namely a Red Breccia, a Green Breccia, a Grey Breccia
and a White Breccia.  The contacts between the different types of breccias are gradational or
transitional.  The White Breccia occurs in irregular, elongated vertical zones or pockets, surrounded by
Green or Grey breccia's, and is interpreted to have formed later than the other breccias.  Furthermore,
hydrothermal fluid appears to have washed out the rock flour matrix within the White Breccia, or
replaced it, with deposition of gangue and sulfide minerals.  Of the four breccia types, the Red Breccia
contains the highest gold grades with grades of up to 429g/t gold in the vicinity of fault / vein zones.
Steeply-dipping, high-grade veins are present, which represent the youngest mineralizing event at
Miraflores.  Three groups of veins have been identified based on strike direction, namely Group 100
comprising 3 veins with an average strike/dip of 293°/-87°; Group 200 comprising 5 veins with an
average strike/dip of 308°/-82°; and Group 800 comprising 13 veins with an average strike/dip of
340°/-82°.  Of these veins, Group 100 is the oldest, and the Group 800 is the youngest.
The main mineralization trends of the high-grade veins vary in strike from 325° to 10° and 280° to 60°,
and vary in dip from being vertical to dipping 70°E.  The veins are defined by a narrow mineralized
core (10cm to 60cm) and a wider mineralized halo (1m to 5m).  The narrow core consists of increased
amounts of sphalerite, galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and fine clay.  The wider mineralized halo is defined
by weak to moderate mineralization along the margins of breccia fragments.  The intensity and width of
the mineralized halo is controlled by the porosity and permeability of the wall rock.  Assay values as
high as 429g/t Au have been reported for the veins, with numerous sample values ranging from 10g/t
Au to grades exceeding 100g/t Au.
The younger sub-vertical, northeast dipping veins, that cross-cut the breccia are characterized by the
development of argillized material that contains large quantities of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and
galena, with occasional visible gold.  The sulfides are present as coarse particles ranging from 100 to
200µm (occasionally greater than 200µm).  The lateral continuity of the NNW-SSE structures is
important, and is clearly recognized in prior exploitation workings, where high gold grade mineralization
can be followed over a strike length in excess of 150 metres (and more than 80 metres in height), with
limited displacement by younger structures.  Intersection points of cross-cutting structures (veins) form
high gold grade 'shoots' of variable dimensions, which can be observed in the underground workings.
Mineral Resource Estimate
General
Three diamond drilling programs have been carried out at Miraflores over the period 2006 to 2013
consisting of 73 drill holes totalling 25,884m.
·           Kedahda (4 drill holes totalling 1,415m)
·           B2Gold (6 drill holes totalling 2,210m)
·           Minera Seafield (63 drill holes totalling 22,259m)
The modelling of the Miraflores deposit has been undertaken using Vulcan™ and Leapfrog™
Software.  All of the exploration sampling has been used in the geological modelling process.  The drill
hole database was de-surveyed, transformed and validated in the Vulcan™ software, which was then
used for the modelling of the mineral resource.
The statistics have been completed using a combination of Vulcan™, Microsoft Excel™ and Sage™
2001.  Geostatistics have been completed in Vulcan™ and Sage™ 2001 and grade interpolation has
been undertaken in Vulcan™.  Compilation of the final model was undertaken in Vulcan™.  Vulcan™
software is similar to other mining software systems and relies on a block modelling approach to
represent deposit as a series of 3-D blocks to which grade attributes, and virtually any other attributes
can be assigned.  The software provides numerous means by which attributes can be assigned, and
optimization routines are provided that allow block splitting, such that complex deposit outline details
are not lost or smoothed out by regular size blocks.
Drill hole assays for Miraflores were composited using 2m down the hole composite lengths.  A total of
13,194 two-metre composites were constructed, starting at the collar of the drill hole.  Composite
intervals less than 0.75m in length were merged with 2m composites however; some composites less
than 2m do exist, as the composites were constrained by geological boundaries.
Basic statistics were compiled for both gold and silver grades in each mineralized lithology and all 21
veins developed within the Miraflores deposit.  Capping statistics were determined using histogram and
log probability plots of all gold composites in the breccia.  A capping value of 45g/t was determined for
the breccia, whereas it varied from 0 to 17g/t for the veins.  Silver grades were not capped as the silver
grades at Miraflores are very low.
Block Model
The resource model for Miraflores was constructed with Vulcan™ software using a block model.  All of
the required information about the deposit is stored in each individual block.  This includes estimated
characteristics of gold and silver and statistical characteristics such as number of samples used in an
estimate, distances to the nearest sample and the number of drill holes used.  Geological triangulations
were also used to identify the rock type of each block, and these structures also controlled the sub-
blocking in Vulcan™ along their boundaries.  Geological codes stored in the block model were also
used to assign the density within specific geological boundaries.
Grade Estimation
The Inverse Distanced cubed (ID3) grade estimation methodology was used to estimate gold and silver
grades.  For the breccia, basalt and saprolite, the variography was modelled to determine appropriate
search ellipsoid orientation and search distances, whereas for the 21 veins, the search orientation
varied depending on the orientation of the vein.
Density
A total of 2,100 specific gravity measurements were used to define the density of each lithological block
in the model.
Mineral Resource Estimate
As of 02 April, 2013, Metal Mining Consultants (based in Denver, USA) ("MMC") estimated a Measured
and Indicated Mineral Resource for the Miraflores gold deposit of 72.6Mt at a gold and silver grade of
0.78g/t and 1.52g/t respectively using a cut-off grade of 0.27 g/t gold.  The mineral resource, which was
based on 25,884 m of drilling in 73 diamond drill holes and 236 metres of underground channel
samples, was reported in accordance with NI 43-101.  The mineral resource estimate provided for both
an open pit and an underground mining operation.
On 21 July 2016 the Company announced that it had received an updated mineral resource estimate
for Miraflores that had been prepared by MMC in accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code
(2012 Edition) for an underground only mining operation.  This mineral resource estimate replaces the
previous NI 43-101 statement that was released to the market on 7 March 2016.  The updated mineral
resource estimate is summarized in Tables 1 and 2 below.

Mine design and production schedule
The Company engaged the services of SRK Consulting (U.S.) Inc. (SRK) to complete a Gap Analysis
of the work completed on the Project to-date (in terms of the requirements to complete a Feasibility
Study [Refer Annexure 2]), as well as to develop a revised (indicative) mine plan and schedule for an
underground only mining scenario.
The objective of the revised mine plan was to provide the Company with an underground only mining
scenario, which effectively translates to adding the material, previously planned to be mined as open
pit, into the underground mine plan.  The mine plan furthermore assumes the use of a paste backfill as
opposed to waste backfill.  The basis for the work conducted by SRK is the resource model developed
by MMC in 2013, using only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources.  Where appropriate, the
previous mine design developed in support of a Technical Report completed by SRK for RMB
Resources ("RMB") in 2015 was used (SRK Technical Report, dated February 24, 2015).
Cut-off Grade Calculation
The cut-off grade assumptions remain unchanged from the RMB work, with the cut-off grade calculation
summarized in Table 3.

At the time of the RMB work, the model was evaluated at various cut-off grades.  It was determined that
a mining cut-off of 2.2 g/t was optimal with the addition of 2.0 g/t stope areas which are immediately
adjacent to the 2.2 g/t areas and require limited additional development.  A similar approach was used
to determine economic underground stopes in the areas which were previously planned to be mined as
open pit.
Mine Design
The stope optimization shapes were used as a basis for the mine design.  These optimized stope
shapes were viewed on screen and those that were low grade, geographically isolated, or otherwise
sub-economic when considering development costs, were eliminated from the design.  Typically, a
crown pillar of 25 m or greater is used; however, there is one instance where an up-stope is mined to
within 5 m of the surface.
Main development ramps are in the same locations as the prior RMB work.  The opportunity exists to
change the layout and modify the portal locations since the open pit no longer limits portal locations
and since it is likely that surface infrastructure locations (e.g. stockpiles) may also change.
The updated mine design is shown in Figure 1 below, with blue shapes being the same as the RMB
design and pink showing the new (additional) mining areas.  With the additional tonnage on upper
levels, the ventilation layout/concept needs to be re-evaluated.
Figure 1:  Mine Design.
In addition to the completed mine design, dilution and recovery as shown below in Table 4 have been
included.

*Stopes already include 0.25 m of dilution on each side of the stope wall (0.5 m total/stope) included in
the stope optimization shape (~10% planned dilution).  This planned dilution is included in the 3-D
shape and received grade information based on the block model.
The underground mine design process resulted in a mineable quantity for the >1.2g/t Au mineralized
tonnes of 3.82 Mt grading 3.66 g/t Au and 2.91 g/t Ag.  Total waste/low grade development tonnage in
the mine plan is 559 kt.  Additional detail summarizing the material in the mine plan in summarized in

Production Schedule
The production schedule is based on the rate assumptions shown in Table 7 below.  These are the
same as used for the RMB work.  The backfilling rate has however not been updated from the previous
waste rock backfill rate.  It is assumed that a paste system would provide similar rates.

*All rates are per face. Multiple areas/faces are mined together to generate the production schedule.
The mining schedule is based on 365 days/year, 7 days/week, with 2 shifts of 12 hrs each day.  A
production rate of approximately 1,300 t/d, or approximately 50,000 oz. of Au per year, was targeted
from the underground.  The yearly production schedule was generated using iGantt software and is
summarized in Annexure 3.
The schedule shows rock backfill and cemented backfill as consistent with what was used in the RMB
work, albeit that the nomenclature presented here is to show the volume that requires a higher strength
paste (cemented fill) versus lower strength paste (rock fill).  The assumed rate of backfill placement for
paste needs to be developed and checked in future work.  Backfill is sequenced in the schedule;
however, multiple backfill activities occur at once if required by the schedule.  Backfill is an integral part
of the mining cycle and any delays would affect the schedule.  Currently, the scheduled backfill
requirements in Year 2 are quite large.  Some of this could likely be moved into Year 3; however, it
would take more detailed scheduling.  Overall there are multiple faces/stopes available and typically
only a single stope is mined at once.
The production schedule is shown graphically in Figure 2 below, colored by mining period.

Conclusions
Following the completion of the mine planning work, SRK concluded the following:
·           All mine planning work is based on the 2013 MMC resource model.  Additional geology review
was completed by SRK (Miraflores Resource Report, dated July 19, 2016), however, this information
was not used.
·           Including the material previously planned to be mined as open pit material in the underground
mine plan adds approximately 370 kt at a grade of 3.84 g/t Au and 4.29 g/t Ag.
·           To produce approximately 50,000 oz Au per year the plant would need to have a capacity of
approximately 1,300 t/d.
·           To achieve 1,300 t/d from the underground mine, considerably more development needs to be
completed upfront.  The productivities used and development required show approximately three
development crews in the first few years of production.  This is currently not optimized in the production
schedule and should be re-evaluated with potential changes to the development design at the next
level of study.
·           The schedule reporting shows rock backfill and cemented backfill as that is what was assumed
previously.  The updated concept is to utilize a paste backfill system.  The assumed rate of backfill
placement for paste needs to be developed and checked.  The strength characteristics and cure time
will be critical elements of future work.  Backfill is sequenced in the schedule; however, multiple backfill
activities occur at once if required by the schedule.  Backfill is an integral part of the mining cycle and
any delays would affect the schedule.  Currently the scheduled backfill requirements in Year 2 are quite
large.  Some of this could likely be moved into Year 3; however, it would take more detailed
scheduling.  Overall there are multiple faces/stopes available and typically only a single stope is mined
at once.
·           The plan generates low grade stockpiles of material that has to be mined and removed in the
development activity in the current plan.  This material would likely be fed through the mill at the end of
the underground mine life.
·           The development drifting should be re-sequenced and optimized in future studies.  With the
addition of more tonnage on the upper levels of the deposit the ventilation plan should be re-evaluated.
·           Productivities used for the rescheduling are identical to those used in the RMB work and should
be revisited in future optimizations.
·           No updated costing or revision of the productivities has been conducted as this scope of work
but should be completed if future planning occurs.
SRK notes that at this time it has not conducted work on tailings, milling, backfill, environmental or
updated the costing of any of the past or existing models.  The SRK scope of work reported herein only
includes an updated mine plan and associated production schedule.
Way Forward
The Company is working with SRK to update the operating and capital costs of the 2015 Technical
Study with a view to understanding the potential capital cost savings identified by the Company in
relation to the underground only mining option.
LOS CALATOS PROJECT - PERU
During the June 2016 Quarter, the Company has focussed solely on the completion of the agreement
with CD Capital with respect to their equity funding of the Los Calatos feasibility study.
MOLLACAS PROJECT - CHILE
The Company holds title to 21 Exploitation Concessions covering the Mollacas deposit and
surrounding area, and owns 179 ha of land adjacent to the proposed open pit operation.
In addition, Metminco also owns water rights to approximately 175 litres/sec from two canals, albeit that
the estimated water usage for the mining operation will only be 40 litres/sec.

("SPP Offer") to shareholders with a registered address in Australia, United Kingdom or New Zealand
to purchase up to a maximum of $15,000 (or £7,875) of Shares in the Company at an issue price of
A$0.004 (£0.0021) per Share.  The SPP Offer closed 29 April 2016 raising approximately A$0.6 million
before costs by the issue of 151,785,724 fully paid ordinary shares in the Company ("New Shares"). 
Under the shortfall provisions of the SPP Offer an additional 82,750,000 New Shares were placed
raising a further approximately A$0.3 million before costs.
Acquisition of Miraflores Compania Minera SAS (formerly Minera Seafield SAS)
The Company completed the acquisition of Miraflores Minera from RMB late June 2016 by the issue of
350 million Shares (at a deemed price of A$0.5 cents per Share) and reimbursement of approximately
A$165,000 in Miraflores Minera's operating costs from date of signing the binding term sheet to 30 April
2016.  A further payment of approximately A$250,000 is payable for the period from 1 May 2016 to 20
June 2016 (date of settlement) once the reconciliation of Miraflores Minera's expenditure is completed. 
RMB was issued 50 million shares in March 2016 in respect of an exclusivity fee.  Miraflores Minera is
the owner of the Quinchia Gold Portfolio more fully described above.
As a result of the issue of the 350,000,000 Shares, RMB became a substantial shareholder of
Metminco, holding 400,000,000 Shares, equivalent to 10.3% of the Company.
Under the purchase agreement, Metminco will make cash payments to RMB as follows:
(i)       Initial payment of A$1.0 million on 20 June 2017;
(ii)      Second payment of A$1.0 million on 20 June 2018;
(iii)     Third payment of A$3.0 million on the earlier of (a) a decision to mine at the Quinchia Gold
Portfolio; and (b) on 20 June 2019;
(iv)      Fourth payment of A$2.0 million on the earlier of (a) a decision to mine at the Quinchia Gold
Portfolio; and (b) 20 June 2020; and
(v)      A maximum of A$7million in royalty payments to RMB from operating cashflows.
The timing of consideration for the acquisition, which is in total approximately A$16.5 million with
minimal payable upfront, is structured to allow Metminco to focus on the development of Miraflores and
the drilling of Tesorito.
Shares Issued in lieu of fees
A total of 7,662,759 Shares were issued to LinQ Corporate Pty Ltd in settlement of corporate consulting
fees.
Los Calatos Funded
In June 2016 the Company entered into a binding term sheet with CD Capital whereby CD Capital
committed an equity investment of up to US$45 million in relation to the Los Calatos Project.  The
equity contribution will be applied in 3 tranches over the next 3 - 4 years to complete the planned Pre-
feasibility and Feasibility Studies on the Los Calatos Project.
CD Capital will subscribe for US$16 million worth of new shares in Los Calatos Holding Ltd equivalent
to 51% of the company ("Tranche 1").  Under the subscription agreement CD Capital will have the
option to subscribe for additional shares in the company over two additional Tranches of US$ 14.5
million each, which subject to being exercised in full would increase CD Capital ownership of Los
Calatos Limited to 65% after Tranche 2 and 70% after Tranche 3.
It is anticipated that Los Calatos Limited will receive Tranche 1 equity funds in August 2016 following
execution of the Equity Investment Agreement and completion of the conditions precedent.  Once the
conditions precedent to the investment have been completed (which include reorganisation of the
Metminco interests in the Los Calatos Project into Los Calatos Holding Ltd, and other steps generally
undertaken to complete an investment of this nature).  The Equity Investment Agreement is close to
finalisation and full details of the agreement are expected to be announced shortly.
The Company's Strategy
The focus of the Company is now two-fold, firstly, in Colombia to optimise the economics of the prior
(incomplete) Feasibility Study on the Miraflores Project, which forms part of the Quinchia Gold Portfolio
and the recently completed acquisition of Miraflores Minera.  The Miraflores Project represents a near
term gold development opportunity for Metminco, whereas the wider Quinchia Gold Portfolio provides
for substantial upside potential that includes the significant gold porphyry system target of Tesorito.
Secondly, in Peru the Company and CD Capital will work together to progress of the Los Calatos
Project through completion of Pre-feasibility and Feasibility studies.
Cash Position and Funding
As at 30 June 2016 Metminco had cash reserves of A$0.6 million.
Expenditure for the quarter was focussed on preparatory work for the planned Miraflores Feasibility
Study including an updated JORC 2012 mineral resource, analysis of development options, a gap
analysis on the requirements to complete a Feasibility Study and the preparation of a preliminary mine
plan and schedule..
The Company also incurred care and maintenance costs fees on its other projects (Los Calatos,
Mollacas, Vallecillo and Loica) including annual licence; legal costs in relation to the acquisition of
Miraflores Minera and the equity investment by CD Capital in the Los Calatos Project; reimbursement of
costs to RMB on settlement as set out above; and costs associated with corporate governance,
compliance, and maintenance of ASX and AIM listings.
Now that funding for the Los Calatos Project is secured the Company is currently evaluating funding
alternatives to progress the Miraflores Project through to completion of the Feasibility Study.

PFS requires a comprehensive overview and listing of required
permits, as well as the initiation of the EIS, but not necessarily
submission of the EIS to the regulatory authorities.
PFS requires the collection and review of available
environmental data from existing databases for environmental
studies, assessments or audits; regulatory inspections, waste
handling practices; management plans.
Unless that there are significant changes in the beneficiation
process, or the cut-off grade has changed, then the geochemical
evaluations conducted to date should be at a Feasibility Study
level.
Hydrogeology baseline is very close to Feasibility Study level,
but would need some additional analysis given the new location
of the tailings impoundment.
PFS requires preparation of environmental plans and
monitoring programs; preliminary sediment and erosion control
plan; conceptual reclamation plan; evaluation of acid rock
drainage; geotechnical stability review of waste dumps and
tailings dam; preliminary impact mitigation plan; preliminary spill
and emergency response plan.
PFS generally requires the initiation of social baseline data
gathering, some community engagement and training, and
health /safety programs identified.
