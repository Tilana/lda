<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Libya was held at the 16th meeting, on 13 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Libya was headed by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International 
</p>
<p>Cooperation, Hassan A. M. Alsghayr. At its 18th meeting, held on 15 May 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on Libya. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Libya: El Salvador, Maldives and South 
</p>
<p>Africa. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Libya: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/LBY/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/LBY/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/LBY/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Kenya, 
</p>
<p>Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Libya through the troika. These 
</p>
<p>questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation stated that, 
</p>
<p>after the first universal periodic review, Libya had gone through a radical political 
</p>
<p>transformation. The 17 February 2011 revolution had broken out, followed by the fall of the 
</p>
<p>former regime and the declaration of liberation in October 2011. The transition had been 
</p>
<p>accompanied by security and institutional challenges. The security risks and political crisis 
</p>
<p>had doubled the challenges in the field of human rights, as Libya faced acts of terrorism and 
</p>
<p>the proliferation of weapons. Those negatively affected the humanitarian situation, causing 
</p>
<p>the displacement of people and the disruption of services for citizens, including health care 
</p>
<p>and education in many cities and regions.  
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy Minister thanked all the countries that had provided support to Libya in 
</p>
<p>international forums and in all fields, especially the United Nations Support Mission in 
</p>
<p>Libya (UNSMIL) and the Head of Mission, Bernardino Le&#243;n, for his efforts in making the 
</p>
<p>dialogue a success.   
</p>
<p>7. He emphasized that, during the initial review in November 2010, 66 of the 
</p>
<p>120 recommendations had enjoyed support, 24 had been noted and 30 had been placed 
</p>
<p>under consideration. After the February revolution, the recommendations under 
</p>
<p>consideration had been reviewed. All had been accepted, except for one that had been only 
</p>
<p>partially accepted. All but four of the noted recommendations had been accepted. A total of 
</p>
<p>115 recommendations had been fully accepted and one partially accepted. However, owing 
</p>
<p>to the events in Libya, it had not been possible to implement some of the recommendations. </p>


<p>8. The negative legacy of the policies and practices of the dictatorship, which had 
</p>
<p>lasted for more than four decades, had prevented the Libyan people from enjoying their 
</p>
<p>assets and economic resources or building solid State institutions in a range of areas, 
</p>
<p>including education, health and housing. That situation had affected wide sections of the 
</p>
<p>Libyan people in the enjoyment of their economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>9. At the level of civil and political rights, the former regime had used repressive 
</p>
<p>methods, eliminated political dissidents, suppressed freedom of opinion, stifled political 
</p>
<p>pluralism and replaced the concept of citizenship with that of allegiance to the regime. In 
</p>
<p>the so-called Abu Salim Prison massacre of 1996, over 1,270 prisoners had been killed. The 
</p>
<p>memory of the massacre had played a significant part in precipitating the 17 February 2011 
</p>
<p>revolution. An association of families of victims of the massacre had organized a peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstration in Benghazi. The forces of the regime had reacted brutally, committing war 
</p>
<p>crimes, crimes against humanity and grave human rights violations. The international 
</p>
<p>community had reacted by adopting Security Council resolution 1970 (2011), which had 
</p>
<p>referred the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court and Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 1973 (2011), which had established a no-fly zone and provided for the protection 
</p>
<p>of civilians in the light of the crimes and repression of the Qadhafi regime forces. The 
</p>
<p>confrontation between regime forces and the revolutionaries, backed by international 
</p>
<p>coalition forces, had continued until liberation had been declared on 23 October 2011. 
</p>
<p>10. In March 2012, Libya extended a standing invitation to the special procedures. It 
</p>
<p>agreed to allow the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearances to visit the country; however, visits had not yet taken place. Libya 
</p>
<p>had also invited the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the country.  
</p>
<p>11. As for the most prominent developments in the field of human rights, the Deputy 
</p>
<p>Minister stated that chapter I, article 2 of the Constitutional Declaration of 3 August 2011 
</p>
<p>provided that the State shall work to establish a civilian, democratic political system based 
</p>
<p>on political pluralism, with several political parties, in order to ensure the peaceful transfer 
</p>
<p>of power.  
</p>
<p>12. Chapter II addressed the question of civil rights and liberties. Article 1 guaranteed 
</p>
<p>the linguistic and cultural rights of all components of Libyan society, including the 
</p>
<p>Amazigh, Toubou and Touareg. Under article 7, the State was obliged to safeguard human 
</p>
<p>rights and basic freedoms and to work to adopt new legislation guaranteeing such rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms. Article 5 guaranteed the protection of mothers, children and older persons and 
</p>
<p>the care of children, younger persons and persons with special needs. 
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution Drafting Assembly had begun its work on 21 April 2014 and in 
</p>
<p>December 24 presented some proposals for discussions by specialists, stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society, whose views would be taken into consideration at the re-
</p>
<p>drafting stage.  
</p>
<p>14. The National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights had been established 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Law No. 5 (2011) on the basis of the Paris Principles. The aim of the Council 
</p>
<p>was to preserve, strengthen and defend civil rights, and monitor and document violations of 
</p>
<p>those rights, and support and encourage civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>15. The Civil Society Commission had also been established by Decision No. 649 
</p>
<p>(2013). The Commission was responsible for registering civil society organizations and 
</p>
<p>monitoring them to ensure that they carried out their work in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>legislation in force. To date, the Commission had registered more than 3,000 such 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>16. On transitional justice and national reconciliation, the Deputy Minister mentioned 
</p>
<p>the adoption of a number of laws and decisions, including Law No. 29 (2013) on </p>


<p>transitional justice, which abrogated Law No. 17 (2012) and established a fact-finding and 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation body, a fund for victims and an ombudsperson&#8217;s office.  
</p>
<p>17. Other laws adopted included Law No. 29 (2012) on the right to establish and join 
</p>
<p>political parties, Law No. 65 (2012) regulating the rights to peaceful protest, Law No. 10 
</p>
<p>(2013) criminalizing torture, forced disappearance and discrimination, Law No. 11 (2013) 
</p>
<p>amending provisions of the Military Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedures to 
</p>
<p>specify that civilians shall not be tried by military court, and Law No. 50 (2012) on 
</p>
<p>compensation for political prisoners. The Prime Minister had issued Decision No. 39 
</p>
<p>(2012) establishing a permanent committee to monitor human rights in Libya within the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>18. As for economic, social and cultural rights, a law had been adopted to raise the 
</p>
<p>minimum public-sector wage and raise the minimum basic and social insurance allowances. 
</p>
<p>For family development, a marriage support fund had been established in order to help 
</p>
<p>people who are getting married. Law No. 63 (2012) establishing the Anti-Corruption 
</p>
<p>Authority and Law No. 18 (2012) on the rights of cultural and linguistic groups had also 
</p>
<p>been adopted.  
</p>
<p>19. On the right to education, as per Arab League Council resolution No. 391 of 2007, a 
</p>
<p>national plan had been set out for implementation of the Arab plan for human rights 
</p>
<p>education in February 2014. 
</p>
<p>20. The Ministry of Education enrolled displaced students in the schools nearest to 
</p>
<p>where they had been relocated. The State had also established schools in the refugee camps 
</p>
<p>and provided transportation to school. It had also established an office in the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education for displaced persons&#8217; affairs. A special school for children with tumours had 
</p>
<p>also been established at Tripoli Medical Hospital.  
</p>
<p>21. Regarding the rights of cultural groups to education, Law No. 18 (2013) on the 
</p>
<p>rights of cultural and linguistic groups was adopted. The Amazigh language was to be 
</p>
<p>included as a subject in the curriculum of primary-school grades one to four in those areas 
</p>
<p>in which the language is spoken. 
</p>
<p>22. The State provided health care free of charge to citizens. The country had succeeded 
</p>
<p>in eradicating poliomyelitis and no cases of that disease had been reported for more than 25 
</p>
<p>years. That fact had been confirmed by the World Health Organization. However, since the 
</p>
<p>start of the 1990s, there had been a steady decline in the health-care system, owing to the 
</p>
<p>international sanctions imposed on Libya and the departure of a large number of national 
</p>
<p>medical cadres from the country.  
</p>
<p>23. There was no doubt that Libya was facing difficult challenges, which were an 
</p>
<p>obstacle to achieving the promotion of human rights and the rule of law. The challenges  
</p>
<p>required effective and concrete support from the international community. They were most 
</p>
<p>notably the following.  
</p>
<p>24. Security risks associated with the expansion of terrorist organizations&#8217; activities: 
</p>
<p>these organizations were committing grave human rights violations, targeting Libyans and 
</p>
<p>foreigners. Responding to a question from Kenya, the Deputy Minister emphasized that the 
</p>
<p>situation called for urgent action to support the security institutions to confront that 
</p>
<p>phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>25. On the protection of human rights defenders, the Deputy Minister stressed that a 
</p>
<p>national plan to rebuild State institutions must be developed urgently. It was particularly 
</p>
<p>important to implement an effective programme to disarm and demobilize individuals and 
</p>
<p>properly integrate them into State institutions within a development plan, which would 
</p>
<p>contribute to restoring security and stability, activating the judiciary and preventing 
</p>
<p>impunity.  </p>


<p>26. The recent armed violence had caused the displacement of thousands of people. The 
</p>
<p>Government must also deal with persons displaced to neighbouring countries and had taken 
</p>
<p>some action to provide them with cash, in-kind assistance and rental subsidies.  
</p>
<p>27. Libya suffered as a result of illegal migration and was striving to confront that 
</p>
<p>challenge, in cooperation with neighbouring States and the European Union. Libya was not 
</p>
<p>a source country of migration but, rather, a transit country. That phenomenon had placed a 
</p>
<p>heavy burden on the country&#8217;s economy and also affected security. The responsibility for 
</p>
<p>addressing illegal migration therefore rested not only with Libya but required concerted 
</p>
<p>efforts at the regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p>28. In order to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people with regard to 
</p>
<p>institution-building in such a way as to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and 
</p>
<p>safeguard human dignity, and in order to extricate the country from the crisis, the national 
</p>
<p>dialogue must be brought to a successful conclusion.  
</p>
<p>29. The Deputy Minister reiterated his appreciation to the Working Group on the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review and the sincere commitment of Libya to the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review process.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>30. During the interactive dialogue, 85 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>31. Turkey expressed concern about the dysfunctional justice system and the impunity 
</p>
<p>with which forces loyal to the Government operated. Turkey reported the death of one of its 
</p>
<p>civilians, whose ship had been targeted by artillery fire from land. 
</p>
<p>32. Uganda welcomed the establishment of the National Council for Civil Liberties and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and noted the lack of a clear immigration framework and the unprecedented 
</p>
<p>loss of life at sea of migrants travelling to Europe. 
</p>
<p>33. The United Arab Emirates appreciated the efforts made by Libya to rebuild its well-
</p>
<p>founded institutions in various fields in order to establish the rule of law and achieve social 
</p>
<p>justice for all citizens. 
</p>
<p>34. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed concern about 
</p>
<p>armed brigades acting with impunity, the displaced, the death penalty, decreasing space for 
</p>
<p>civil society, and restriction of women&#8217;s rights. It urged progress in the United Nations 
</p>
<p>peace talks.  
</p>
<p>35. Brazil noted a primary need for prevention and political solutions and an inclusive 
</p>
<p>dialogue and stated that interventions to protect civilians must be carried out in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the principle of responsibility while protecting. 
</p>
<p>36. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela condemned the use of force to solve 
</p>
<p>conflicts, called for dialogue and rejected the interference in Libyan sovereignty. 
</p>
<p>37. Yemen asked the international community to support and help Libya overcome 
</p>
<p>challenges and difficulties that it was facing in order to move towards stability and the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>38. Algeria appreciated the efforts made by Libya to create conditions for the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights and to provide assistance to vulnerable groups in society. 
</p>
<p>39. Angola supported the initiatives to end hostilities and called for measures to protect 
</p>
<p>civilians. Angola also noted that Libya had ratified the majority of international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, particularly those related to the rights of women. </p>


<p>40. Argentina noted with concern the humanitarian and security situation in Libya as 
</p>
<p>expressed in Security Council resolution 2174 (2014).  
</p>
<p>41. Australia commended the efforts of UNSMIL to achieve a political solution, 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the deteriorating human rights situation against political 
</p>
<p>representative, journalists, human rights activists and civil society representatives. 
</p>
<p>42. Austria noted that women, children, minorities and internally displaced persons were 
</p>
<p>particularly affected by the ongoing violence. It expressed deep concern about threats and 
</p>
<p>attacks against media professionals, judges, prosecutors, lawyers and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. 
</p>
<p>43<b>. </b>Azerbaijan welcomed the establishment of the National Council for Civil Liberties 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights and the issuance of a standing invitation to the special procedures. It 
</p>
<p>noted challenges in addressing the issue of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>44. Bahrain appreciated the acceptance by Libya of the majority of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first review cycle and commended Libya on its efforts to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect women&#8217;s rights and equality and to provide free health services to 
</p>
<p>citizens. 
</p>
<p>45. Bangladesh highlighted the need for State institution rebuilding, the need for 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation, and the impact of the indiscriminate use of arms. It noted that Libya 
</p>
<p>needed to be reviewed in a historical context, taking into account the root causes of 
</p>
<p>violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>46. Belarus considered that the international community should provide Libya with 
</p>
<p>support to address the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups, including for food 
</p>
<p>and other urgently needed goods. 
</p>
<p>47. Belgium expressed solidarity with the Libyan people and concern for the human 
</p>
<p>rights violations perpetrated by all the parties in conflict, especially against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. It regretted that Libya still had not established a moratorium on the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. 
</p>
<p>48. Benin welcomed the establishment of the National Council for Civil Liberties and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the adoption of Law No. 29 (2013) on transitional justice. Benin called 
</p>
<p>on the international community to support Libya in its efforts to promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>49. Uruguay welcomed the standing invitation extended to the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>50. Brunei Darussalam noted the challenges faced by the Government and its efforts to 
</p>
<p>address the human rights situation by initiating the process to rebuild the related 
</p>
<p>frameworks and institutions in the country. 
</p>
<p>51. Burundi commended Libya on adopting different legislative measures and decisions 
</p>
<p>to improve the human rights situation, such as Law No. 5 (2011) establishing the National 
</p>
<p>Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights and Law No. 18 (2013) on the rights of 
</p>
<p>cultural and linguistic groups. 
</p>
<p>52. Cabo Verde stated that it was crucial to guarantee fundamental rights in conformity 
</p>
<p>with international standards as well as the separation and independence of powers in a new 
</p>
<p>constitution. 
</p>
<p>53. Canada was deeply concerned with the situation in Libya, including the ongoing 
</p>
<p>serious human rights violations, some of which might amount to war crimes. It said that the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of these must be held accountable. </p>


<p>54. Chad noted with satisfaction that Libya had accepted a large number of 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first cycle; however, it added that, owing to the troubling 
</p>
<p>situation in the country, they had not yet been implemented. 
</p>
<p>55. In response to the comments made by Turkey, the Deputy Minister said that the 
</p>
<p>Libyan army had not targeted civilians. As for the ship that had entered Libyan territorial 
</p>
<p>waters, he noted that Libya was a sovereign country and that its sovereignty should be 
</p>
<p>respected.  
</p>
<p>56. The delegation then replied to the questions on freedom of expression, association 
</p>
<p>and assembly, transitional justice and national reconciliation. As for the trial of Seif al-
</p>
<p>Qadhafi, the delegation stated that he was in the custody of the independent judicial 
</p>
<p>authority of Libya. This authority was in conflict of jurisdiction with the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court regarding his case.  
</p>
<p>57. The Constitutional Declaration, in paragraph 14, guaranteed freedom of opinion, 
</p>
<p>expression, the press and the media, while the laws restricting the freedom of the press and 
</p>
<p>media had been abrogated by article 35 of the same document, including Law No. 120 
</p>
<p>(1972), Law No. 76 (1972) and Law No. 75 (1973). Article 15 of the Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Declaration rescinded the ban on the formation of political parties and peaceful association.  
</p>
<p>58. On transitional justice and national reconciliation, the delegation reiterated that 
</p>
<p>Libya had replaced Law No. 17 (2012) with Law No. 29 (2013) on transitional justice to 
</p>
<p>deal with crimes committed by the Qadhafi regime against Libyans and against Libyan 
</p>
<p>women in particular. Victims should be looked after in all aspects and given financial 
</p>
<p>support and access to justice. Decision No. 380 (2012) had established a psychological 
</p>
<p>support centre for the victims of sexual violence and torture. Decisions nos. 119 and 445 
</p>
<p>(2014) had also addressed their situation and established a fund for them. 
</p>
<p>59. On the cooperation with the International Criminal Court, the delegation underlined 
</p>
<p>that, although Libya was not party to the Rome Statute, Libya had been cooperating with 
</p>
<p>regard to the resolutions of the Security Council since 2011. 
</p>
<p>60. As for torture and enforced disappearances, under Law No. 29 (2013) on transitional 
</p>
<p>justice, detainees must either be charged or released within specific time frames. The Public 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor had formed four committees to classify the cases of those prisoners being held 
</p>
<p>in the prison of the Ministry of the Interior. Furthermore, Law No. 10 (2013) criminalizing 
</p>
<p>torture, enforced disappearance and discrimination had established investigative 
</p>
<p>commissions, and many cases were being studied.  
</p>
<p>61. The delegation highlighted that Libya was trying to limit the death sentences to the 
</p>
<p>minimum. The legislature had identified punitive laws that must be brought into line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards. The Ministry of Justice was working with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to develop a plan to review the country&#8217;s criminal 
</p>
<p>legislation.  
</p>
<p>62. Libya was continuing its investigations in relation to the massacre in Abu Salim 
</p>
<p>prison. Death certificates had been presented to some families, but they lacked some 
</p>
<p>information. Therefore, a committee was hearing the testimonies of those representing the 
</p>
<p>victims in order to reissue certificates with the latest information.  
</p>
<p>63. Chile considered that Libya should investigate and punish State and non-State actors 
</p>
<p>who committed acts of violence against women and children.  
</p>
<p>64. China appreciated the establishment of the National Council for Civil Liberties and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the new electoral law guaranteeing seats for women delegates, the law 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights of cultural and linguistic groups, and efforts to improve the judicial 
</p>
<p>system. </p>


<p>65. Colombia appreciated the first-hand information on human rights situation in Libya 
</p>
<p>and noted the establishment of the National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>66. Latvia expressed concern over the fact that, despite the standing invitation, no 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holder had visited Libya to address allegations of torture, and 
</p>
<p>that human rights defenders and journalists had been attacked. 
</p>
<p>67. Cyprus remained concerned over the human rights situation and the humanitarian 
</p>
<p>crisis resulting from the fighting and the rise of extremist and terrorist groups. 
</p>
<p>68. The Czech Republic welcomed the Libyan delegation and thanked it for its 
</p>
<p>presentation. 
</p>
<p>69. The Democratic Republic of the Congo stated that the escalation of violence had 
</p>
<p>impaired the hopes that the Libyan people had after the 17 February 2011 revolution and 
</p>
<p>noted the destruction of hospitals and schools and massive displacement of people. 
</p>

<p>contributing to curbing mixed migration movements towards Europe.

<p>94.<b> </b>Mauritania praised the United Nations-sponsored dialogue between parties and

</p>
<p>and workshops for women, children and other groups that required special attention in 
</p>
<p>order to raise their awareness of their rights and duties. Numerous activities had been 
</p>
<p>conducted in coordination with UNSMIL. Programmes had been put in place to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness in certain important sectors, such as in the Ministry of Defence. Awareness-
</p>
<p>raising programmes had been set up and training courses held for the judicial police and 
</p>
<p>prison sectors.  
</p>
<p>97. Concerning the accepted recommendations on gender equality, the delegation 
</p>
<p>stressed that Libya had ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, as well as the Protocol to the African Charter on Human 
</p>
<p>and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which included a broad array of 
</p>
<p>provisions concerning non-discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>98. Article 6 of the Constitutional Declaration provided for gender equality before the 
</p>
<p>law. The Constitution Drafting Assembly had addressed, in its proposals, all aspects of 
</p>
<p>equality between men and women: divorce, inheritance and passing on nationality to 
</p>
<p>children. Efforts were being made to bring national legislation into conformity with 
</p>
<p>international standards and the rules of the sharia law.  
</p>
<p>99. Article 11 of Law No. 24 (2010) gave Libyan women the right to pass Libyan 
</p>
<p>citizenship on to their children. An implementing regulation was supposed to have been put 
</p>
<p>in place for that article; however, the political and security turmoil had not allowed for the 
</p>
<p>promulgation of that regulation.  
</p>
<p>100. Women represented 60 per cent of the labour force. Law No. 58 (1971) prohibited 
</p>
<p>the employment of women in dangerous jobs. The Social Insurance Act (1980) provided 
</p>
<p>three-month maternity leave for working women.  
</p>
<p>101. The participation in elections made no distinction between men and women, and a 
</p>
<p>system of quotas enabled women to participate fully in political life. The low representation 
</p>
<p>of women was due to the culture of Libyan society and not to legislative restrictions. 
</p>
<p>Regarding the participation of women in the United Nations-sponsored political dialogues, 
</p>
<p>a special meeting for women in Tunisia had been held in April 2015 in order to stress the 
</p>
<p>importance of their role in building State institutions. 
</p>
<p>102. Libya had been trying to find ways to better guarantee the rights of children through 
</p>
<p>various entities such as the High Council for Childhood. The Ministry of Social Affairs was 
</p>
<p>cooperating with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and local councils in this regard.  
</p>
<p>103. Regarding persons with disabilities, the delegation stated that Law No. 5 (1987) 
</p>
<p>remained in effect and provided persons with disabilities with the rights to shelter, 
</p>
<p>subsidized housing services, education, health care, access to facilities for the use of public 
</p>
<p>transport, among others. Libya had also ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities.   
</p>
<p>104. Montenegro expressed concern about violence and armed clashes, highlighting that 
</p>
<p>all the parties responsible for human rights violations should be held to account.  
</p>
<p>105. Morocco appreciated the establishment of the National Council on Civil Liberties 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights and the Civil Society Commission, and the law on transitional justice. It

<p>106. Namibia urged all parties involved to assist the Constitutional Drafting Assembly in 
</p>
<p>delivering a constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights and ensuring the separation of 
</p>
<p>powers. </p>


<p>107. Nepal noted challenges such as building effective State institutions, curbing growing 
</p>
<p>violence and religious extremism, and improving the administration of justice and the rule 
</p>
<p>of law.  
</p>
<p>108. The Netherlands expressed concern about the effect of the ongoing conflict and 
</p>
<p>supported the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to come to an 
</p>
<p>agreement on a ceasefire and a national unity government. 
</p>
<p>109. New Zealand recognized challenges regarding human rights reforms, and the 
</p>
<p>increasing and persistent discrimination faced by migrants and asylum seekers from sub-
</p>
<p>Saharan Africa.  
</p>
<p>110. The Niger welcomed legislation to create the National Council for Civil Liberties 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights, to allow for the formation of political parties, to establish an institution 
</p>
<p>for anti-corruption and to criminalize torture, enforced disappearance and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>111. Norway was concerned about reports of possible war crimes committed and urged 
</p>
<p>all parties of the conflict to respect international law and to engage in the United Nations-
</p>
<p>initiated political process. 
</p>
<p>112. Oman stated that the attendance of Libya at the universal periodic review session 
</p>
<p>reflected its will to protect human rights. Oman emphasized the importance for the 
</p>
<p>international community to exert more efforts to cooperate with Libya and provide it with 
</p>
<p>technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>113. The Philippines encouraged Libya to continue to uphold human rights and provide 
</p>
<p>an enabling environment for human rights to be achieved. 
</p>
<p>114. Poland expressed concern about violence between armed groups, causing hundreds 
</p>
<p>of civilian deaths; inequality between men and women; and discrimination against 
</p>
<p>minorities.  
</p>
<p>115. Portugal thanked Libya for the presentation of the national report. 
</p>
<p>116. Qatar expressed concerns about the growing numbers of asylum seekers, refugees

</p>
<p>special procedures. It expressed concern over human rights violations.

</p>
<p>concerned that education was affected by the conflict.  
</p>
<p>119. Senegal commended the progress in health and education sectors and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the National Council on Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>120. Serbia stated that the situation of migrants, refugees and displaced persons should be 
</p>
<p>addressed. It encouraged Libya to engage in the protection of the rights of women. 
</p>
<p>121. Sierra Leone urged Libya to ensure that the National Council on Civil Liberties and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights was in conformity with the Paris Principles and to address the issue of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>122. Slovenia was deeply concerned by the human rights crisis, by the deteriorating 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders and the intimidation of and attacks on journalists.  
</p>
<p>123. On the issue of internally displaced persons and persons displaced to neighbouring 
</p>
<p>States, the delegation stated that Law No. 29 of 2013 on transitional justice provided 
</p>
<p>accountability and reparations mechanisms for victims of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>committed since 1969. The Law stipulated the establishment of an agency for the affairs of </p>


<p>internally displaced persons. This agency had the authority to inspect their conditions, make 
</p>
<p>it possible for them to exercise their rights and prevent discrimination against them. Libya 
</p>
<p>also provided humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons and persons displaced 
</p>
<p>abroad. On 24 October 2014, the Government had pledged to pay school fees of all Libyan 
</p>
<p>students in Egypt and Tunisia, and in February 2015, the Council of Ministers had held a 
</p>
<p>meeting with the House of Representatives committee on displaced persons&#8217; affairs to 
</p>
<p>discuss their situation in Tawergha and that of Libyan displaced persons in neighbouring 
</p>
<p>countries. The Ministry of Social Affairs had a list of these people in the database. 
</p>
<p>Assistance in kind and rental subsidies were being provided to them.  
</p>
<p>124. As for illegal migration, the delegation underlined that the western part of Libya was 
</p>
<p>being used for crossing the Mediterranean but that the Government was not in control of 
</p>
<p>that part of the country. The first ministerial meeting on border security had been held in 
</p>
<p>Tripoli on 1 March 2012 and the Tripoli Action Plan had been adopted, which aimed at 
</p>
<p>improving border monitoring and security in North Africa, the Sahel and the Sahara. Libya 
</p>
<p>had also signed an agreement with Italy to fight organized crime and illegal immigration. In 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the European Union and the International Organization for Migration 
</p>
<p>(IOM), the Ministry of the Interior was providing training to staff dealing with this issue.  
</p>
<p>125. On human trafficking, the delegation stated that Libya had been considering 
</p>
<p>enacting a law prohibiting human trafficking, and consultations were being held with IOM. 
</p>
<p>As for refugee issues, UNHCR was assisting UNSMIL in this regard. Libya was a party to 
</p>
<p>the African Refugee Convention and was considering the question of acceding to other 
</p>
<p>instruments. 
</p>
<p>126. South Africa encouraged the implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>28/30 with the support of the international community. 
</p>
<p>127. Spain noted with concern that civil society was suffering persecution, aggression, 
</p>
<p>kidnappings and attacks.  
</p>
<p>128. The State of Palestine appreciated the efforts by Libya to build the capacity of the 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution, ensure transitional justice and the rule of law, and provide 
</p>
<p>compulsory and free education. 
</p>
<p>129. The Sudan appreciated the legislative efforts being made by Libya, such as the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the amendments to 
</p>
<p>the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and Law No. 18 (2013) on the rights 
</p>
<p>of cultural and linguistic groups. 
</p>
<p>130. Sweden acknowledged the current difficult situation and stressed the need for a 
</p>
<p>political solution to the crisis. It noted attacks, including killings, abductions, torture and 
</p>
<p>threats against human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>131. Switzerland highlighted the importance for Libya to take all necessary measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure respect, protection and promotion of human rights in its entire territory.  
</p>
<p>132. Thailand appreciated the continued engagement of Libya in the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review but was deeply concerned by the crisis. It noted the immediate need for all sides to 
</p>
<p>cease human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>133. Togo expressed concern about the escalation of violence and stated that perpetrators 
</p>
<p>must be brought to justice. It encouraged Libya to undertake efforts to regain territorial 
</p>
<p>control and to ensure primacy of the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>134. The United States of America acknowledged the difficulties facing Libya, expressed 
</p>
<p>concern for the ongoing violations and abuses committed by all sides. It noted the lack of a 
</p>
<p>political agreement that could restore order. </p>


<p>135. The delegation stated that Libya was party to most of the major international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments. Article 7 of the Constitutional Declaration stipulated that Libya had to 
</p>
<p>accede to all international human rights instruments. This had been witnessed in the 
</p>
<p>accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, insecurity 
</p>
<p>and the political crisis had a negative impact on reporting to treaty bodies. In terms of 
</p>
<p>providing technical assistance towards establishing the rule of law and rebuilding the 
</p>
<p>judiciary, efforts were continuing in cooperating and coordinating with UNSMIL and 
</p>
<p>OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>136. Extending appreciation to all delegations, the Deputy Minister stated that all 
</p>
<p>recommendations would be examined by the relevant authorities in Libya and that Libya 
</p>
<p>would provide its response in due time, which reflected its commitment to the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review and its will to address the current human rights concerns.
