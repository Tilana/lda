<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present note, which complements the report of the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>activities of the Fund submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session 
</p>
<p>(A/69/296), provides information on the activities of the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
</p>
<p>for Victims of Torture and describes in particular the recommendations adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Board of Trustees of the Fund at its fortieth session.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note was prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolution 
</p>
<p>68/156, and complements the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the Fund, 
</p>
<p>which was submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session (A/69/296). It 
</p>
<p>presents updated information on the activities of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
</p>
<p>Victims of Torture, in particular the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of 
</p>
<p>the Fund at its fortieth session, held in Geneva from 29 September to 3 October 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and individuals. In accordance with the mandate of the Fund outlined in 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 36/151, and the practices established by the Board of Trustees 
</p>
<p>since 1982, the Fund provides grants to established channels of assistance, including non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, associations of victims and of family members of victims, 
</p>
<p>private and public hospitals, legal clinics, and public interest law firms and individual 
</p>
<p>lawyers, that submit projects involving medical, psychological, social, financial, legal and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian or other forms of assistance to victims of torture and members of their 
</p>
<p>families. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Administration of the Fund and composition of the Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General administers the Fund through the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with the advice of the Board of 
</p>
<p>Trustees, which is composed of five members who act in their personal capacity and are 
</p>
<p>appointed by the Secretary-General with due regard to the principle of equitable 
</p>
<p>geographical distribution and in consultation with their Governments. The Board is 
</p>
<p>currently composed of Maria Cristina de Mendonca (Portugal), Morad el-Shazly (Egypt), 
</p>
<p>Anastasia Pinto (India) and Adam Bodnar (Poland). On 10 July 2014, the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General appointed Gaby Or&#233; Aguilar (Peru) for a three-year term, renewable once, to 
</p>
<p>replace Mercedes Doretti (Argentina) following the latter&#8217;s resignation. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Management of grants  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Admissibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>4. Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the guidelines of the Fund for Victims of 
</p>
<p>Torture, which were revised at the thirty-ninth session of the Board of Trustees, in 2014. 
</p>
<p>The guidelines require a project to be presented by an established channel of assistance, 
</p>
<p>including non-governmental organizations, associations of victims and of family members 
</p>
<p>of victims, private and public hospitals, legal clinics, public interest law firms and 
</p>
<p>individual lawyers. The beneficiaries must be direct victims of torture or direct family 
</p>
<p>members. Priority is given to projects providing direct assistance to torture victims, which </p>


<p>may consist of medical or psychological assistance, help with social or financial 
</p>
<p>reintegration through vocational training for victims, and various forms of legal assistance 
</p>
<p>for victims or members of their families, including assistance in seeking redress or applying 
</p>
<p>for asylum. As a general rule, projects are supported on a yearly basis for a maximum of 
</p>
<p>two cycles of five consecutive years each, subject to a satisfactory evaluation of the project 
</p>
<p>and availability of funds. Depending on the resources available, the Fund may finance 
</p>
<p>projects to organize training programmes, seminars or conferences to allow health-care 
</p>
<p>professionals or other service providers to exchange best practices. Grant requests for 
</p>
<p>projects involving investigation, research, studies, publications or other similar activities 
</p>
<p>are not admissible.  
</p>
<p>5. The Fund can also provide emergency assistance. Requests of this type are examined 
</p>
<p>according to specific procedures outlined in the guidelines for the Fund. Emergency 
</p>
<p>projects have to contain the same basic components as regular ones (namely, direct 
</p>
<p>assistance to victims of torture and their families, non-governmental channels of 
</p>
<p>assistance).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Monitoring and evaluation of grants 
</b></p>
<p>6. Pre-screening visits to projects are undertaken systematically before a grant is 
</p>
<p>awarded. Regular monitoring visits to ongoing projects are also scheduled to assess the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the projects funded. An internal guide on conducting visits to projects 
</p>
<p>that have been funded or are to be funded was developed in 2013 by the secretariat, in order 
</p>
<p>to enhance verification methodology and coherence. In 2014, a total of 89 projects were 
</p>
<p>visited. In the period under review, 50 visits were undertaken by the secretariat of the Fund, 
</p>
<p>of which six were conducted jointly with members of the Board of Trustees, one was 
</p>
<p>carried out by one member of the Board of Trustees, 31 by OHCHR field presences and one 
</p>
<p>by OHCHR desk officers.  
</p>
<p>7. During the period under review, the joint secretariat (responsible for the 
</p>
<p>administration of this Fund, the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary 
</p>
<p>Forms of Slavery and the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment) has continued to align the working methods of the three funds with a view to 
</p>
<p>heightening cost-effectiveness and sharing best practices. These efforts were noted with 
</p>
<p>satisfaction by the respective Boards of Trustees and by Member States. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial situation of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Fund continues to struggle to achieve a satisfactory level of yearly contributions 
</p>
<p>that would enable it to meet all demands for assistance from all regions of the world, 
</p>
<p>including those made in the context of emergency and humanitarian crises. According to 
</p>
<p>the Board, the Fund would need to receive $12 million on a yearly basis to be able to 
</p>
<p>respond adequately to new and emergency situations, such as those currently unfolding in 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic and its neighbouring 
</p>
<p>countries, and Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>9. The table below shows the contributions and pledges received in 2014 until the time 
</p>
<p>of writing. As at the fortieth session of the Board, at which grants were recommended for 
</p>
<p>2015, the Fund had available a total net of $7,335,400 for grants to be disbursed in 2015. </p>

<p><b> IV. Fortieth session of the Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>10. The fortieth session of the Board was held in Geneva from 29 September to 3 
</p>
<p>October 2014. The Board examined applications for funding and made recommendations 
</p>
<p>on grants to be awarded to beneficiary organizations for the period from 1 January to 31 
</p>
<p>December 2015.  
</p>
<p>11. The amount available for distribution to projects was calculated after deducting 
</p>
<p>programme support costs, the operating cash reserve and the expenditure for non-grant 
</p>
<p>activities from the total amount of contributions received after the thirty-eighth session of 
</p>
<p>the Board, held in October 2013.  
</p>
<p>12.  The Board of Trustees considered a total of 257 admissible project proposals aimed 
</p>
<p>at providing direct assistance to victims of torture and their family members, amounting to 
</p>
<p>a total request of $14,796,502.  
</p>
<p>13. The Board reviewed positively a total of 190 projects in more than 81 countries for a 
</p>
<p>total amount of $6,335,400. Notably, it recommended for a grant 167 ongoing projects 
</p>
<p>aimed at providing direct assistance to victims, for a total of $5,670,000; 20 new projects 
</p>
<p>aimed at providing direct assistance to victims, for a total of $590,000; and three grants for 
</p>
<p>new training and seminars projects, for a total of $75,400.  
</p>
<p>14.  The Board also recommended setting aside an additional $1 million to support 
</p>
<p>capacity-building projects of new rehabilitation centres, in particular in less developed 
</p>
<p>regions, and for emergency grants to be considered in 2015 through its intersessional 
</p>
<p>procedure, thereby adhering more strictly to General Assembly resolution 36/151. 
</p>
<p>15. In doing so, the Board reached all its operational targets to be achieved from 2015 to 
</p>
<p>2017, as described in the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly (A/69/296). All project proposals were reviewed on a competitive basis, taking 
</p>
<p>into account the merit and documented needs, as well as years of continuous support by the 
</p>
<p>Fund to the same project. This resulted in a more manageable project portfolio, a significant 
</p>
<p>increase in the average grant size and a more balanced distribution of projects among the 
</p>
<p>five regions of the world.  
</p>
<p>16. The Board also recommended that special attention should continue to be paid to the 
</p>
<p>needs in Ukraine and the Middle-East, in particular in the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq.  </p>


<p>17. At its fortieth session, the Board held a meeting with Member States during which 
</p>
<p>two representatives of organizations supported by the Fund, Dieynaba Ndoye of Vivre 
</p>
<p>Caprec in Senegal, and Amin Ahmed of Wchan Organization for Victims of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Violations in Iraq, presented their work in support of victims fleeing from Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic and Guinea and with victims from Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic. During the 
</p>
<p>meeting, delegations from all regions praised the concrete impact achieved on the ground 
</p>
<p>by the Fund, and congratulated the Board and secretariat for the increased outreach and 
</p>
<p>transparency demonstrated in 2014.     
</p>
<p>18. In application of the policy recommendations adopted by the Board at its thirty-ninth 
</p>
<p>session, administrative compliance by grant beneficiaries was vigorously enforced during 
</p>
<p>the period under review, particularly in relation to the requirement for the timely 
</p>
<p>submission of financial and audit reports.  
</p>
<p>19. Recalling its desire to make the Fund a platform for knowledge-sharing and 
</p>
<p>expertise, the Board recommended that the secretarait organize a thematic workshop at its 
</p>
<p>forty-first session, at which selected experts and practitioners would be invited to present 
</p>
<p>their research and experience. 
</p>
<p>20. During its fortieth session, the Board also reiterated its will to increase cooperation 
</p>
<p>with other torture-related mechanisms. In this perspective, it met with two members of the 
</p>
<p>Committee against Torture,Jens Modvig and Alessio Bruni, to discuss concrete means of 
</p>
<p>enhancing cooperation between the Committee and the Fund in the light of Committee 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 3 on article 14 of the Convention. Informal discussions were also 
</p>
<p>held with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, Juan Mendez.  
</p>
<p>21. The Board also encouraged the secretariat to continue its outreach and visibility 
</p>
<p>efforts.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Making a contribution 
</b></p>
<p>22. Governments, non-governmental organizations and other private or public entities 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>the members of their families worldwide. 
</b></p>
<p>24.<b> The Fund would need to receive $12 million on a yearly basis in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respond adequately to new and emergency situations, such as those currently 
</b></p>
<p><b>unfolding in the Central African Republic, Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>neighbouring countries. Contributions should be received by September 2015. 
</b></p>
<p>25.<b> Contributing to the Fund is a concrete translation of the commitment of States 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the elimination of torture.
