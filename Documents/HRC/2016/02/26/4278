by Israel since the Israeli military occupation of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,

resolution 65/106 of 10 December 2010, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had 
failed to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel 
withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981

</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
force in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of 
international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 
the Occupied Territories (A/65/237) of 27 August 2010 and, in this connection, deploring 
the Israeli settlement in the occupied Arab territories and expressing regret at the constant 
refusal of Israel to cooperate with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
the Council on its seventeenth session (A/HRC/16/2), chap. I.

law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirming the applicability of the

</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the peace process, which started in Madrid on the 
basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern at the 
halting of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed

(1973) for the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region,

</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, 
in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter 
alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the 
occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal effect, and 
demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to desist from its continuous building of settlements, 
the most recent of which is the settlement campaign being conducted by the so-called 
Golan Regional Council under the slogan &#8220;Come to the Golan&#8221;, and to desist from 
changing the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal 
status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the 
population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be allowed to return to their homes and to 
recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and 
Israeli identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from 
its repressive measures against them and from all other practices that obstruct the 
enjoyment of their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights, some of which are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to 
Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan 
to visit their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra 
checkpoint and under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and 
to rescind its decision to prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth 
Geneva Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in Israeli 
prisons, some of whom have been detained for more than 25 years, and calls on Israel to 
treat them in conformity with international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel, in this connection, to allow delegates of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of conscience and 
detainees in Israeli prisons accompanied by specialized physicians to assess the state of 
their physical and mental health and to protect their lives; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken 
or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, including the Knesset&#8217;s decision of 22 
November 2010 to hold a referendum before any withdrawal from the occupied Syrian </p>

<p>Golan and East Jerusalem, that seek to alter the character and legal status of the occupied 
Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of
