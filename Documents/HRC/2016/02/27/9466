</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. There is no magic in the marketplace.  Markets function efficiently and sustainably only 
when certain institutional parameters are in place.  The preconditions for success are generally 
assumed to include the protection of property rights; the enforceability of contracts; competition; 
and the smooth flow of information.  But a key requisite is often overlooked:  curtailing 
individual and social harms imposed by markets.  History demonstrates that without adequate 
institutional underpinnings, markets will fail to deliver their full benefits and may even become 
socially unsustainable.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. In recent decades, especially the 1990s, global markets expanded significantly as a result 
of trade agreements, bilateral investment treaties, and domestic liberalization and privatization.  
The rights of transnational corporations became more securely anchored in national laws and 
increasingly defended through compulsory arbitration before international tribunals.  
Globalization has contributed to impressive poverty reduction in major emerging market 
countries and overall welfare in the industrialized world.  But it also imposes costs on people and 
communities - including corporate-related human rights abuses, for reasons detailed in the 
interim report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>3. These are challenges posed not only by transnational corporations and private enterprises.  
Evidence suggests that firms operating in only one country and State-owned companies are often 
worse offenders than their highly visible private sector transnational counterparts.  Clearly, a 
more fundamental institutional misalignment is present:  between the scope and impact of 
economic forces and actors, on the one hand, and the capacity of societies to manage their 
adverse consequences, on the other.  This misalignment creates the permissive environment 
within which blameworthy acts by corporations may occur without adequate sanctioning or 
reparation.  For the sake of the victims of abuse, and to sustain globalization as a positive force, 
this must be fixed. 
</p>
<p>4. Realigning the relationships among social institutions is a long-term process.  While 
Governments representing the public interest must play a key role, they need to be joined by 
other social actors and to utilize other social institutions to achieve this goal, including market 
mechanisms themselves.  The Commission on Human Rights recognized the scope and 
complexity of the challenge when it established this multifaceted mandate. 
</p>
<p>5. The mandate requires the Special Representative to &#8220;identify and clarify&#8221;, to &#8220;research&#8221; 
and &#8220;elaborate upon&#8221;, and to &#8220;compile&#8221; materials - in short, to provide a comprehensive 
mapping of current international standards and practices regarding business and human rights.  
Resolution 2005/69 also invites him to submit his &#8220;views and recommendations&#8221; for 
consideration by the Commission.  This mandate was extended pursuant to Human Rights 
Council decision 1/102.  This report is devoted to the first task:  mapping evolving standards, 
practices, gaps and trends.

</p>
<p>6. The report is organized into five clusters of standards and practices governing corporate 
&#8220;responsibility&#8221; (the legal, social, or moral obligations imposed on companies) and 
&#8220;accountability&#8221; (the mechanisms holding them to these obligations).  For ease of presentation, 
the five are laid out along a continuum, starting with the most deeply rooted international legal 
obligations, and ending with voluntary business standards.  A brief discussion of trends and gaps 
concludes the report.  The clusters are: 
</p>
<p> I. State duty to protect 
</p>
<p> II. Corporate responsibility and accountability for international crimes 
</p>
<p> III. Corporate responsibility for other human rights violations under international law 
</p>

<p>7. This report draws on some two dozen research papers produced by or for the Special 
Representative.<b>3  </b>He has also benefited from three regional multi-stakeholder consultations in 
Johannesburg, Bangkok and Bogot&#225;; civil society consultations on five continents; visits to the 
operations of firms in four industry sectors in developing countries; four legal expert workshops; 
two multi-stakeholder consultations on the extractive and financial services industries; and 
discussions with representatives of all relevant multilateral institutions and some government 
officials.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The addenda to this report (A/HRC/4/35/Add.1-4) provide greater detail on some of the 
issues posed in resolution 2005/69.  A companion report (A/HRC/4/74) addresses the important 
subject of human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), as requested in paragraph 1 (d) of 
resolution 2005/69. 
</p>
<p>9. Because the Special Representative has had fewer than 18 months to pursue this mandate, 
the job is not yet completed.  For instance, research to date on &#8220;corporate spheres of influence&#8221; 
(paragraph 1 (c) of resolution 2005/69) suggests only that it lacks legal meaning; further work is 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Those produced by or at the request of the Special Representative are posted on his 
</p>
<p>home page on the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre&#8217;s website at 
http://www.business-humanrights.org/Gettingstarted/UNSpecialRepresentative. 
<b>4
</b>  The Special Representative also received substantive written submissions from a number of 
</p>
<p>organizations, including Allens Arthur Robinson; BankTrack; Business Leaders Initiative on 
Human Rights; EarthRights International; Global Witness; Halifax Initiative; Interfaith Center 
on Corporate Responsibility; International Commission of Jurists; International Council on 
Metals and Mining; International Network for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
International Organisation of Employers; International Chamber of Commerce; Business and 
Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD; Lovells; Rights &amp; Democracy, Canada; 
Tebtebba Foundation and Forest Peoples Programme. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>required to see if it can become a useful policy tool.  More importantly, because factual claims 
about corporate obligations in the prior debate were so entangled with normative preferences and 
institutional interests, the Special Representative has focused on producing a solid and objective 
evidentiary foundation.  However, this has afforded him little opportunity to develop the &#8220;views 
and recommendations&#8221; he was invited to submit and which should rightly form part of the 
conclusion of this mandate.  Therefore, the Special Representative would welcome the 
opportunity of an additional year to build on the extensive work already done and to submit clear 
options and proposals for the Council&#8217;s consideration. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  STATE DUTY TO PROTECT 
</b></p>
<p>10. Many claims about business and human rights are deeply contested.  But international 
law firmly establishes that States have a duty to protect against non-State human rights abuses 
within their jurisdiction, and that this duty extends to protection against abuses by business 
entities.<b>5</b>  The duty to protect exists under the core United Nations human rights treaties as 
elaborated by the treaty bodies, and is also generally agreed to exist under customary 
international law.<b>6  </b>Moreover, the treaty bodies unanimously affirm that this duty requires steps 
by States to regulate and adjudicate abuses by all social actors including businesses.<b>7</b> 
11. The earlier United Nations human rights treaties, such as the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), do not specifically address State duties regarding business.  They 
impose generalized obligations to ensure the enjoyment of rights and prevent non-State abuse.  
Thus, ICERD requires each State party to prohibit racial discrimination by &#8220;any persons, group 
or organization&#8221; (art. 2.1 (d)).  And some of the treaties recognize rights that are particularly 
relevant in business contexts, including rights related to employment, health and indigenous 
communities. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  Beyond the national territory, the duty&#8217;s scope will vary depending on the State&#8217;s degree of 
</p>
<p>control.  The United Nations human rights treaty bodies generally view obligations of States 
parties as applying to areas within their &#8220;power or effective control&#8221;. 
<b>6
</b>  States also have duties to respect, promote and fulfil rights, but the most business-relevant 
</p>
<p>is the duty to protect because it focuses on third party abuse.  See A/HRC/4/35/Add.1.  
Where corporations perform public functions or are State-controlled, the secondary 
rules of State attribution may also hold the State responsible for the abuse.  See the 
International Law Commission&#8217;s articles on &#8220;Responsibility of States for internationally 
wrongful acts&#8221;, adopted in November 2001.  
http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/477/97/ PDF/N0147797.pdf?OpenElement. 
<b>7
</b>  Drawing on the language of subparagraph (b) of the mandate (as set out in resolution 2005/69 
</p>
<p>of the Commission on Human Rights), this section uses regulation to refer to treaty body 
language recommending legislative or other measures designed to prevent or monitor abuse by 
business enterprises, and adjudication to refer to judicial or other measures to punish or 
remediate abuse. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. Beginning with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979, and including the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC) and the recently adopted Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
business is addressed more directly.  CEDAW, for example, requires States to take all 
appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any &#8220;enterprise&#8221; (art. 2 (e)), 
and in the context of &#8220;bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit&#8221; (art. 13 (b)).  
The treaties generally give States discretion regarding the modalities for regulating and 
adjudicating non-State abuses, but emphasize legislation and judicial remedies. 
13. The treaty bodies elaborate upon the duty to protect.  General comment No. 31 of the 
Human Rights Committee (HRC) is one recent example.  It confirms that under the ICCPR &#8220;the 
positive obligations on States parties to ensure Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if 
individuals are protected by the State, not just against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, 
but also against acts committed by private persons or entities&#8221;.<b>8</b>  It further explains that States 
could breach Covenant obligations where they permit or fail &#8220;to take appropriate measures or to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by 
private persons or entities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. The human rights treaty bodies express concern about State failure to protect against 
business abuse most frequently in relation to the right to non-discrimination, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights, and labour and health-related rights.  But the duty to protect applies to all substantive 
rights.  The Committees tend not to specify the precise content of required State action, but 
generally recommend regulation through legislation and adjudication through judicial remedies, 
including compensation where appropriate. 
</p>
<p>15. Current guidance from the Committees suggests that the treaties do not require States to 
exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over business abuse.  But nor are they prohibited from doing 
so.<b>9</b> <b> </b>International law permits a State to exercise such jurisdiction provided there is a recognized 
basis:  where the actor or victim is a national, where the acts have substantial adverse effects on 
the State, or where specific international crimes are involved.<b>10</b>  Extraterritorial jurisdiction must

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  HRC, general comment No. 31, para. 8. 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  Some treaty bodies seem to be encouraging States to pay greater attention to preventing 
</p>
<p>corporate violations abroad.  For example, CESCR has suggested that States should take steps to 
&#8220;prevent their own citizens and companies&#8221; from violating rights in other countries.  CESCR, 
general comment No. 15, para. 33. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  Under the principle of &#8220;universal jurisdiction&#8221; States may be obliged to exercise jurisdiction 
over individuals within their territory who allegedly committed certain international crimes.  It is 
unclear whether and how such obligations extend jurisdiction over juridical persons, including 
corporations.  See A/HRC/4/35/Add.2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>also meet an overall &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; test, which includes non-intervention in the internal affairs 
of other States.<b>11  </b>Debate continues over precisely when the protection of human rights justifies 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
16. The regional human rights systems also affirm the State duty to protect against non-State 
abuse, and establish similar correlative State requirements to regulate and adjudicate corporate 
acts.<b>12</b>  Indeed, the increasing focus on protection against corporate abuse by the United Nations 
treaty bodies and regional mechanisms indicates growing concern that States either do not fully 
understand or are not always able or willing to fulfil this duty. 
</p>
<p>17. The responses to the questionnaire survey addressed to States by the Special 
Representative, asking them to identify policies and practices by which they regulate, adjudicate, 
and otherwise influence corporate actions in relation to human rights, reinforce those concerns.<b>13</b>  
No robust conclusions can be drawn because of the low response rate.  But of those States 
responding, very few report having policies, programmes or tools designed specifically to deal 
with corporate human rights challenges.  A larger number say they rely on the framework of 
corporate responsibility initiatives, including such soft law instruments as the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, or 
voluntary initiatives like the United Nations Global Compact.  Very few explicitly consider 
human rights criteria in their export credit and investment promotion policies or in bilateral trade 
and investment treaties, points at which government policies and global business operations most 
closely intersect.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>18. In sum, the State duty to protect against non-State abuses is part of the very foundation 
of the international human rights regime.  The duty requires States to play a key role in 
regulating and adjudicating abuse by business enterprises or risk breaching their international 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
  </b>Of course, the entire human rights regime may be seen to challenge the classical view 
</p>
<p>of non-intervention.  The debate here hinges on what is considered coercive.  See 
A/HRC/4/35/Add.2 for details.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
FOR INTERNATIONAL CRIMES 
</b></p>
<p>19. However, States are not the only duty bearers under international law.<b>15  </b>Individuals have 
long been subject to direct responsibility for the international crimes of piracy and slavery, 
although in the absence of international accountability mechanisms they could be held liable 
only by national legal systems.  The International Military Tribunals established after the Second 
World War confirmed that individuals bear responsibility for crimes against peace, war crimes, 
and crimes against humanity, and also imposed accountability on those within their jurisdiction, 
including corporate officers.  With the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002, a permanent forum now exists in which individuals can be held 
directly accountable for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes if States parties fail 
to act.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>20. Long-standing doctrinal arguments over whether corporations could be &#8220;subjects&#8221; of 
international law, which impeded conceptual thinking on this issue and the attribution of direct 
legal responsibility to corporations, are yielding to new realities.  Corporations are increasingly 
recognized as &#8220;participants&#8221; at the international level, with the capacity to bear some rights and 
duties under international law.<b>17</b>  As noted, they have certain rights under bilateral investment 
treaties; they are also subject to duties under several civil liability conventions dealing with 
environmental pollution.  Although this has no direct bearing on corporate responsibility for 
international crimes, it makes it more difficult to maintain that corporations should be entirely 
exempt from responsibility in other areas of international law. 
</p>
<p>21. The ICC preparatory committee and the Rome conference on the establishment of the 
ICC debated a proposal that would have given the ICC jurisdiction over legal persons (other than 
States), but differences in national approaches prevented its adoption.  Nevertheless, just as the 
absence of an international accountability mechanism did not preclude individual responsibility 
for international crimes in the past, it does not preclude the emergence of corporate responsibility 
today. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  This section provides partial responses to paragraphs 1 (a) and (c) of resolution 2005/69. 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  International legal responsibility attaches to individuals for a wider range of acts than those 
</p>
<p>covered by the ICC Statute. 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  Rosalyn Higgins, current President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and 
Theodor Meron, former President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia  (ICTY), have both used the term &#8220;participants&#8221;.  In 1949, the ICJ stated:  &#8220;The 
subjects of law in any legal system are not necessarily identical in their nature or in the extent of 
their rights, and their nature depends on the needs of the community.&#8221;  <i>Advisory Opinion on 
Reparations for Injuries suffered in the service of the United Nations</i>, ICJ Rep 174 at 179 (1949). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. Indeed, corporate responsibility is being shaped through the interplay of two 
developments:  one is the expansion and refinement of individual responsibility by the 
international ad hoc criminal tribunals and the ICC Statute; the other is the extension of 
responsibility for international crimes to corporations under domestic law.  The complex 
interaction between the two is creating an expanding web of potential corporate liability for 
international crimes, imposed through national courts. 
</p>
<p>23. Individual responsibility under international law may arise by directly committing or 
instigating a crime, or for crimes committed by subordinates that a superior had reason to know 
would be committed, but failed to prevent.  The international tribunals have also imposed 
liability for &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; a crime, or for engaging in a &#8220;common purpose&#8221; or &#8220;joint 
criminal enterprise&#8221;.<b>18</b>  No one-to-one mapping can be assumed between standards for natural 
and legal persons.  But national courts interpreting corporate liability for international crimes 
have drawn on principles of individual responsibility, as the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit did in its <i>Unocal</i> ruling.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>24. At the same time, the number of jurisdictions in which charges for international crimes 
can be brought against corporations is increasing, as countries ratify the ICC Statute and 
incorporate its definitions into domestic law.  Where national legal systems already provide for 
criminal punishment of companies the international standards for individuals may be extended, 
thereby, to corporate entities.<b>20</b>  Even some ICC non-parties have incorporated one or more 
of the Statute&#8217;s crimes into their domestic laws, with potential legal implications for 
corporations.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Domestic incorporation may also have an extraterritorial dimension.  Several countries 
provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction with respect to international crimes committed by or 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  &#8220;Common purpose&#8221; applies where an individual participates in a common design involving 
</p>
<p>the perpetration of a crime, and shares an intention to commit the crime.  The ICTY has also 
developed the doctrine of &#8220;joint criminal enterprise&#8221; which applies where a crime other than the 
intended one occurs, and where the individual foresaw the risk but continued to participate. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  <i>Doe v. Unocal</i>, 395 F.3d 932 (9th Cir, 2002).  The case settled and the decision was vacated. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  For a detailed survey of 16 countries from a cross-section of regions and legal systems, see 
Anita Ramasastry and Robert C. Thompson, <i>Commerce, Crime and Conflict:  Legal Remedies 
for Private Sector Liability for Grave Breaches of International Law - Executive Summary</i> 
(2006) available at www.fafo.no/liabilities.  Of the 16, 11 were States parties to the ICC and 9 
had fully incorporated the three crimes of the Rome Statute; of these, 6 already provided for 
corporate criminal liability.  Research has not been completed on all 104 countries that had 
ratified the Rome Statute as of November 2006. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  The Fafo survey cites the examples of Japan, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Ukraine.  
The first three generally apply criminal laws to corporations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>against their nationals; and a few rely on &#8220;universal jurisdiction&#8221; to extend their laws, regardless 
of nationality links.<b>22</b>  Again, if they also permit criminal punishment of firms, those 
extraterritorial provisions could be extended to corporations. 
</p>
<p>26. Apart from national incorporation of international standards, a number of legal 
systems are evolving independently towards greater recognition of corporate criminal 
liability for violations of domestic law.  Most common law countries have such provisions, at 
least for economic and some violent crimes.  Many European civil law countries have moved 
beyond purely administrative regulation to adopt some form of criminal responsibility for 
corporations. 
</p>
<p>27. In this fluid setting, simple laws of probability alone suggest that corporations will be 
subject to increased liability for international crimes in the future.  They may face either criminal 
or civil liability depending on whether international standards are incorporated into a State&#8217;s 
criminal code or as a civil cause of action (as under the United States Alien Torts Claims Act, or 
ATCA).  Furthermore, companies cannot be certain where claims will be brought against them 
or what precise standards they may be held to, because no two national jurisdictions have 
identical evidentiary and other procedural rules.  Finally, civil proceedings may be brought for 
related wrongs under domestic law, such as assault or false imprisonment.<b>23</b>  In short, the 
risk environment for companies is expanding slowly but steadily, as are remedial options for 
victims. 
</p>
<p>28. Adding to the uncertainty for corporations, significant national variations remain in 
modes of attributing corporate liability.  Given the difficulty of establishing a corporate &#8220;mind 
and will&#8221; in criminal cases, a number of jurisdictions have adopted a &#8220;corporate culture&#8221; 
approach.  In Australia, where a firm&#8217;s culture has been deemed expressly or tacitly to permit the 
commission of an offence by an employee, the firm may be held liable.<b>24  </b>In the United States, 
federal sentencing guidelines take corporate culture into account in assessing monetary 
penalties.<b>25</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. There are also national differences in attributing liability within transnational corporate 
structures.  The doctrine of separate corporate personality treats each member of a corporate 
group as a legally distinct entity.  No uniform formula exists for &#8220;piercing the corporate veil&#8221; 
that separates a subsidiary from its parent company in order to hold the parent responsible for the 
subsidiary&#8217;s acts.  One alternative that has attracted attention is for the home State to impose 
civil liability on the parent company for its acts and omissions regarding activities by its 
subsidiaries abroad.<b>26</b>  The rules governing extraterritorial jurisdiction suggest that such 
provisions are permissible. 
</p>
<p>30. Few legitimate firms may ever directly commit acts that amount to international crimes.  
But there is greater risk of their facing allegations of &#8220;complicity&#8221; in such crimes.  For example, 
of the more than 40 ATCA cases brought against companies in the United States (now the largest 
body of domestic jurisprudence regarding corporate responsibility for international crimes), most 
have concerned alleged complicity where the actual perpetrators were public or private security 
forces, other government agents, or armed factions in civil conflicts.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Corporate complicity is an umbrella term for a range of ways in which companies may be 
liable for their participation in criminal or civil wrongs.  With nuanced differences, most national 
legal systems appear to recognize complicity as a concept.  The international tribunals have 
developed a fairly clear standard for individual criminal aiding and abetting liability:  knowingly 
providing practical assistance, encouragement or moral support that has a substantial effect on 
the commission of the crime.<b>28</b>  Where national courts adopt this standard it is likely that its 
application to corporations would closely track its application to individuals, although the 
element of &#8220;moral support&#8221; may pose specific challenges.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>32. &#8220;Moral support&#8221; can establish individual liability under international law, and the 
tribunals have extended it to include silent presence coupled with authority.  But a company 
trying in good faith to avoid involvement in human rights abuses might have difficulty knowing 
what counts as moral support for legal purposes.  Mere presence in a country and paying taxes

</b></p>
<p>  The Supreme Court&#8217;s only decision under ATCA, <i>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</i> 542 US 692

judicial opinion appears to support it, although there is disagreement among lower courts over its 
content and, in some cases, its existence.

<p>are unlikely to create liability.  But deriving indirect economic benefit from the wrongful 
conduct of others may do so, depending on such facts as the closeness of the company&#8217;s 
association with those actors.  Greater clarity currently does not exist.  However, it is established 
that even where a corporation does not intend for the crime to occur, and regrets its commission, 
it will not be absolved of liability if it knew, or should have known, that it was providing 
assistance, and that the assistance would contribute to the commission of a crime. 
</p>
<p><b>III. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW 
</b></p>
<p>33. The emerging corporate responsibility for international crimes is grounded in growing 
national acceptance of international standards for individual responsibility.  Although it 
continues to evolve, there is observable evidence of its existence.  In contrast, what if any legal 
responsibilities corporations may have for other human rights violations under international law 
is subject to far greater existential debate.<b>30</b> 
34. At national levels, there is enormous diversity in the scope and content of corporate legal 
responsibilities regarding human rights.<b>31</b>  A systematic mapping would require a comprehensive 
country-by-country study not only of the direct applicability of international law, but also of a 
range of relevant national measures:  constitutional protections of human rights, legislative 
provisions, administrative mechanisms, and case law.  However, preliminary research has not 
identified the emergence of uniform and consistent State practice establishing corporate 
responsibilities under customary international law.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>35. The traditional view of international human rights instruments is that they impose only 
indirect responsibilities on corporations, i.e. responsibilities provided under domestic law in 
accordance with States&#8217; international obligations.  In contrast, some observers hold that these 
instruments already impose direct legal responsibilities on corporations but merely lack direct 
accountability mechanisms.  For example, the United Nations Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, explaining that its proposed norms reflect and 
restate existing international law, attributed the entire spectrum of State duties under the 
treaties - to respect, protect, promote, and fulfil rights - to corporations within their spheres of 
influence. 
</p>
<p>36. This section looks for evidence of direct corporate legal responsibilities under the 
international sources featured in this debate:  the International Bill of Human Rights - the

<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants (ICESCR and ICCPR) - the other 
core United Nations human rights treaties and the International Labour Organization (ILO) core 
conventions.  It also notes major trends within the regional human rights systems.  Nothing 
prevents States from imposing international responsibilities directly on companies; the question 
is whether they have already done so. 
</p>
<p>37. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights occupies a unique place in the international 
normative order.  Its preamble proclaims that &#8220;every individual and every organ of society &#8230; 
shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by 
progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective 
recognition and observance&#8221;.<b>33</b>  In Louis Henkin&#8217;s famous words:  &#8220;Every individual includes 
juridical persons.  Every individual and every organ of society excludes no one, no company, no 
market, no cyberspace.  The Universal Declaration applies to them all.&#8221;<b>34</b>  Henkin is surely 
correct in stating that the aspirations and moral claims of the Declaration were addressed, and 
apply, to all humanity and, as we shall see in section V on self-regulation, companies themselves 
invoke it in formulating their own human rights policies.  But that does not equate to legally 
binding effect. 
</p>
<p>38. Many provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have entered customary 
international law.  While there is some debate, it is generally agreed that they currently apply 
only to States (and sometimes individuals) and do not include its preamble.  Most of its 
provisions have also been incorporated in the Covenants and other United Nations human rights 
treaties.  Do these instruments establish direct legal responsibilities for corporations?  Several of 
them include preambular, and therefore non-binding, recognition that individuals have duties to 
others.  But the operational paragraphs do not address the issue explicitly.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The treaties do say that States have a duty to &#8220;ensure respect&#8221; for and &#8220;ensure the 
enjoyment&#8221; of rights.  Some have argued that this implies a direct legal obligation for all social 
actors, including corporations, to respect those rights in the first place.  How can this claim be 
tested?  One means is by examining the commentaries of the treaty bodies, as they are charged 
with providing authoritative interpretations.  Although their mandate is to define state 
responsibilities, several have exhibited growing interest in the role of business itself with regard 
to human rights.

</b></p>
<p>  Common article 5 (1) of the ICCPR and ICESCR provides that the Covenants should not be 
interpreted as implying &#8220;for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or 
perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights &#8230; recognized herein&#8221;.  But it was 
not intended to establish substantive legal obligations on individuals or groups, nor have the 
treaty bodies interpreted it as such.  Manfred Nowak, <i>United Nations Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights:  CCPR Commentary</i> (2nd rev. ed, 2005), pp. 111-119. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>40. Where the treaty bodies discuss corporate responsibilities, it is unclear whether they 
regard them as legal in nature.  The most recent general comment of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) on the right to work, for example, recognizes 
that various private actors &#8220;have responsibilities regarding the realization of the right to work&#8221;, 
that private enterprises - national and multinational - &#8220;have a particular role to play in job 
creation, hiring policies and non-discriminatory access to work&#8221;.<b>36</b>  But then, in the same 
comment, the Committee appears to reiterate the traditional view that such enterprises are &#8220;not 
bound&#8221; by the Covenant.  Similarly, the most recent general comment of the Human Rights 
Committee (HRC) concludes that the treaty obligations &#8220;do not &#8230; have direct horizontal effect 
as a matter of international law&#8221; <b>-</b> that is, they take effect as between non-State actors only under 
domestic law.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p>41. In short, the treaties do not address direct corporate legal responsibilities explicitly, while 
the commentaries of the treaty bodies on the subject are ambiguous.  However, the increased 
attention the Committees are devoting to the need to prevent corporate abuse acknowledges that 
businesses are capable of both breaching human rights and contributing to their protection.<b>38 </b> 
</p>
<p>42. On purely logical grounds, a stronger argument could be made for direct corporate 
responsibilities under the ILO core conventions:  their subject matter addresses all types of 
employers, including corporations; corporations generally acknowledge greater responsibility for 
their employees than for other stakeholders; and the ILO&#8217;s supervisory mechanism and 
complaints procedure specify roles for employer organizations and trade unions.  But logic alone 
does not make law, and the legal responsibilities of corporations under the ILO conventions 
remain indirect. 
</p>
<p>43. At the regional level there is greater diversity.  The African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights is unusual because it imposes direct duties on individuals, but opinions vary on 
their effect and whether they apply to groups, including corporations.  Expert commentary 
suggests that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights may have moved away from the 
traditional view when it recognized that non-discrimination &#8220;gives rise to effects with regard to 
third parties&#8221;, including in private employment relationships, &#8220;under which the employer must 
respect the human rights of his workers&#8221;.<b>39</b>  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights

<p>has limited itself to condemning non-State actor abuses.  The European Court of Human Rights 
has generally adopted the traditional view, imposing far-reaching obligations to protect on States 
but leaving to them the choice of means.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>44. In conclusion, it does not seem that the international human rights instruments discussed 
here currently impose direct legal responsibilities on corporations.  Even so, corporations are 
under growing scrutiny by the international human rights mechanisms.  And while States have 
been unwilling to adopt binding international human rights standards for corporations, together 
with business and civil society they have drawn on some of these instruments in establishing soft 
law standards and initiatives.  It seems likely, therefore, that these instruments will play a key 
role in any future development of defining corporate responsibility for human rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  SOFT LAW MECHANISMS 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> </b>Soft law is &#8220;soft&#8221; in the sense that it does not by itself create legally binding obligations.  
It derives its normative force through recognition of social expectations by States and other key 
actors.<b>41  </b>States may turn to soft law for several reasons:  to chart possible future directions for, 
and fill gaps in, the international legal order when they are not yet able or willing to take firmer 
measures; where they conclude that legally binding mechanisms are not the best tool to address a 
particular issue; or in some instances to avoid having more binding measures gain political 
momentum.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>46. This section maps three current types of soft law arrangements that address corporate 
responsibility and accountability for human rights:  the traditional standard-setting role 
performed by intergovernmental organizations; the enhanced accountability mechanisms 
recently added by some intergovernmental initiatives; and an emerging multi-stakeholder form 
that involves corporations directly, along with States and civil society organizations, in 
redressing sources of corporate-related human rights abuses.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>47. A prominent example of the normative role of soft law is the ILO Tripartite Declaration 
of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, endorsed not only by 
States but also by global employers&#8217; and workers&#8217; organizations.  It proclaims that all parties, 
including multinational enterprises, &#8220;should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the corresponding international Covenants&#8221;.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>40
</b>  See Clapham, note 12 above.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>41
</b>  Some soft law instruments may contain elements that already impose, or may come to 
</p>
<p>impose, obligations on States under customary international law, which would give them binding 
effect independent of the soft law instrument itself. 
<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  This section responds to subparagraphs (a) and (e) of resolution 2005/69. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  ILO Tripartite Declaration, para. 8.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>48. The OECD Guidelines perform a similar role.  They acknowledge that the capacity and 
willingness of States to implement their international human rights obligations vary.  
Accordingly, they recommend that firms &#8220;respect the human rights of those affected by their 
activities consistent with the host Government&#8217;s obligations and commitments&#8221;<b>44</b> - the 
commentary expressly indicating that these include the host State&#8217;s international  
commitments.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Both instruments are widely referenced by Governments and businesses and may, in due 
course, crystallize into harder forms.  Thus, soft law&#8217;s normative role remains essential to 
elaborating and further developing standards of corporate responsibility.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>50. Several intergovernmental initiatives have recently focused not only on promulgating 
standards for companies, but also on ways to enhance accountability for compliance.  For 
example, due to civil society demands, anyone can now bring a complaint against a multinational 
firm, operating within the sphere of the OECD Guidelines, to the attention of a National Contact 
Point (NCP) - a non-judicial review procedure.  Some NCPs have also become more transparent 
about the details of complaints and conclusions, permitting greater social tracking of corporate 
conduct, although the overall performance of NCPs remains highly uneven.  And the OECD 
Investment Committee has expanded its oversight of NCPs, providing another opportunity to 
review their treatment of complaints. 
</p>
<p>51. For its part, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) now has performance standards 
that companies are required to meet in return for IFC investment funds.  They include several

<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  Because many of the most serious corporate-related human rights violations take place in 
what the OECD describes as weak governance zones, the Special Representative asked the 
world&#8217;s largest representative business organizations to consult their membership and produce 
recommendations that could help close this governance gap. The International Organization of 
Employers and the International Chamber of Commerce collaborated with the Business and 
Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD on a set of proposals, including the following advice 
to companies that moves beyond the  current requirements of the Guidelines:  &#8220;All companies 
have the same responsibility in weak governance zones as they do elsewhere. They are expected 
to obey the law, even if it is not enforced, and to respect the principles of relevant international 
instruments where national law is absent.&#8221;  IOE, ICC, BIAC, &#8220;Business and Human Rights:  The 
Role of Business in Weak Governance Zones&#8221;, December 2006, para. 15, available at

</b></p>
<p>  One area where greater clarity is needed concerns the rights of indigenous people.  The 
current lack of consensus on the practical implications of &#8220;consent&#8221; - in the formula of &#8220;free, 
prior and informed consent&#8221; to large-scale projects - is a major challenge for indigenous 
communities, business and Governments alike.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>human rights elements.<b>47  </b>Depending on the project, IFC may require impact assessments that 
include human rights elements and community consultation.  Client compliance is subject to 
review by an ombudsman, who may hear complaints from anyone adversely affected by the 
social or environmental consequences of an IFC-funded project.<b>48</b>  The IFC standards also have 
accountability spillover effects, as they are tracked by banks adhering to the Equator Principles, 
which account for some two thirds of global commercial project lending.<b>49</b> 
52. Beyond the intergovernmental system, a new multi-stakeholder form of soft law 
initiatives is emerging.  Most prominent among them are the Voluntary Principles on Security 
and Human Rights (Voluntary Principles), promoting corporate human rights risk assessments 
and training of security providers in the extractive sector; the Kimberley Process Certification 
Scheme (Kimberley) to stem the flow of conflict diamonds; and the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI), establishing a degree of revenue transparency in the taxes, 
royalties and fees companies pay to host Governments. 
</p>
<p>53. Driven by social pressure, these initiatives seek to close regulatory gaps that contribute to 
human rights abuses.  But they do so in specific operational contexts, not in any overarching 
manner.  Moreover, recognizing that some business and human rights challenges require 
multi-stakeholder responses, they allocate shared responsibilities and establish mutual 
accountability mechanisms within complex collaborative networks.  These can include any 
combination of host and home States, corporations, civil society actors, industry associations, 
international institutions and investors groups. 
</p>
<p>54. These hybrids seek to enhance the responsibility and accountability of States and 
corporations alike by means of operational standards and procedures for firms.  These often go 
together with regulatory action by Governments, both supported by transparency mechanisms.  
Kimberley, for instance, involves a global certification scheme implemented through domestic 
law.  States ensure that the diamonds they trade are from Kimberley-compliant countries by 
requiring detailed packaging protocols and certification, coupled with chain-of-custody 
warranties by companies. 
</p>
<p>55. In these collaborative ventures, there is no external legislative body that sets standards 
and no separate adjudicative body to assess compliance.  Both functions are internalized within 
the operational entity itself.  But without such mechanisms, how can they be judged? 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>47
</b>  Fundamental labour rights, the health and safety of surrounding communities, avoidance of 
</p>
<p>involuntary resettlement, the rights of indigenous peoples, and protection of cultural heritage. <b> </b> 
<b>48
</b></p>
<p>  Although the IFC standards have been criticized for &#8220;not going far enough&#8221;, they exceed the 
human rights requirements of the so-called Common Approaches among the export credit 
agencies of OECD member States.  
<b>49
</b></p>
<p>  Critics charge that Equator banks themselves lack transparency in how they implement the 
principles.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. These initiatives may be seen as still largely experimental expressions of an emerging 
practice of voluntary global administrative rulemaking and implementation, which exist in a 
number of areas where the intergovernmental system has not kept pace with rapid changes in 
social expectations.  Because they are relatively new and few in number, no definitive standards 
exist yet by which to assess them.  But among the key criteria suggested by those who study 
them professionally are the perceived credibility of their governance structures, and their 
effectiveness.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>57. The credibility of their governance structures, in turn, is said to hinge on three factors:  
participation, transparency, and ongoing status reviews.  Thus, regarding participation, civil 
society and industry members collaborated with States to develop the standards for, and now 
participate in, the governance of the Voluntary Principles, EITI and Kimberley.  Concerning 
transparency, EITI and Kimberley have established detailed public reporting requirements for 
participants, as well as multi-stakeholder monitoring.  And in terms of participant compliance, 
Kimberley carries out peer reviews of member States, often spurred by civil society reports of 
government-related performance shortfalls; EITI recently established a validation process by 
which non-compliant members may have their status publicly reduced; and Kimberley actually 
removed one Government, effectively shutting it out of the international diamond trade - a 
measure permitted under World Trade Organization rules. 
</p>
<p>58. None of the initiatives examined here embodies all of these standards fully.  But each 
exhibits some, and participants appear to realize, albeit sometimes reluctantly, that the  
credibility of these initiatives rests on them.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>59. The effectiveness of these initiatives can be measured in two ways.  One is their 
operational impact on the ground.  It is generally acknowledged that Kimberley has reduced the 
flow of conflict diamonds from 3 or 4 per cent to 1 per cent of the total market, the Nigeria 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative reports that it gained taxpayers the equivalent of 
US$ 1 billion in 2004 and 2005;<b>52</b> and the Voluntary Principles have been implemented most 
extensively at the country level in Colombia, which is not yet even a formal participant in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  For case studies and discussions of advantages and risks of these novel approaches to

<p>international regulation, see the symposium on &#8220;Global Governance and Global Administrative 
Law in the International Legal Order&#8221;, <i>European Journal of International Law,</i> vol. 17, 
No. 1 (February, 2006). 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  The Voluntary Principles plenary is going through a difficult period of persuading all 
companies that the credibility of the initiative depends on explicit participation criteria.  Even the 
strictly voluntary Global Compact adopted such criteria; as a result several hundred companies 
have been &#8220;delisted&#8221;.<b>

</p>
<p>the process, but where several thousand armed forces members have gone through 
company-supported human rights training.<b>53</b>  Thus, even though their participants admit 
that substantial improvements are required, these initiatives have a significant operational 
impact. 
</p>
<p>60. A second measure of effectiveness is whether they serve as examples for others.  Indeed, 
the relative ease with which they can be established, in contrast with treaty-based instruments, 
together with their perceived potential, have directly inspired parallel efforts in related fields, 
including rules regarding private security forces and also for businesses beyond the extractive 
sector.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>61. One final feature of recent innovations in soft law arrangements - both the 
intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder variety - should be noted.  As they strengthen their 
accountability mechanisms, they also begin to blur the lines between the strictly voluntary and 
mandatory spheres for participants.  Once in, exiting can be costly.  No company has to accept 
IFC financing or loans from Equator banks but if they do, certain performance criteria are 
required for continued funding.  Countries are free to join the EITI or not, but if they do then 
extractive companies are required to issue public reports of their payments to Governments.  
Suspension or expulsion from Kimberley has a direct economic impact on countries and 
companies.  Voluntary Principles language - and in some cases the actual text - has been 
incorporated into legal agreements between Governments and companies.  And once the 
Voluntary Principles adopt participation criteria, non-compliance similarly could lead to 
expulsion. 
</p>
<p>62. In sum, the standard-setting role of soft law remains as important as ever to crystallize 
emerging norms in the international community.  The increased focus on accountability in some 
intergovernmental arrangements, coupled with the innovations in soft law mechanisms that 
involve corporations directly in regulatory rulemaking and implementation, suggests increased 
State and corporate acknowledgment of evolving social expectations and a recognition of the 
need to exercise shared responsibility.

</b>  Indications are that Colombia will become the first host country to join the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Principles. The Government has established a National Committee for the Voluntary Principles, 
including companies. The Government and companies have incorporated Voluntary Principles 
language into their agreements for public security forces protecting company operations.  Both 
parties have established reporting systems for alleged abuses. And some companies use 
Voluntary Principles-related criteria in annual performance reviews of managers. 
<b>54
</b></p>
<p>  Drawing on the Voluntary Principles precedent, the Swiss Government and the International 
Committee of the Red Cross are leading an effort to elaborate recommendations and best 
practices for States with regard to private military and security forces. The pilot phase of the 
Colombia guidelines<i>, </i>based on the Voluntary Principles text, has just been launched, aiming to 
extend the model to such non-extractive sectors as food and beverages. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  SELF-REGULATION 
</b></p>
<p>63. In addition to legal standards, hard or soft, the mandate of the Special Representative 
includes evolving social expectations regarding responsible corporate citizenship, including 
human rights.  One key indicator consists of the policies and practices that business itself adopts 
voluntarily, triggered by its assessment of human rights-related risks and opportunities, often 
under pressure from civil society and local communities.  This section maps such standards of 
self-regulation.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>64. However, mapping the entire universe of business enterprises is impossible.  
More than 77,000 transnational corporations currently span the globe, with roughly 
770,000 subsidiaries and millions of suppliers.<b>56</b>  Those numbers are dwarfed by local firms, 
and an even bigger informal sector in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>65. Therefore, the Special Representative conducted studies of a subset of business entities to 
determine how they perceive corporate responsibility and accountability regarding human rights.  
One was a questionnaire survey of the <i>Fortune </i>Global 500 firms (FG500), which are under social 
scrutiny as the world&#8217;s largest companies.  The second (&#8220;business recognition study&#8221;) consisted 
of three parts:  actual policies, rather than questionnaire responses, of a broader cross-section of 
firms from all regions (including developing countries) screened as likely to have policies that 
include human rights; eight collective initiatives that include human rights standards, like the 
Fair Labor Association (FLA) or the International Council on Metals and Mining (ICMM); 
and the human rights criteria employed by five socially responsible investment funds 
(SRI funds).<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Such a mapping could barely have been done five years ago because few corporate 
human rights policies existed.  Uptake has been especially rapid among large global firms, a 
group still predominantly domiciled in Europe, North America and Japan.  Newer entrants from 
other regions lag behind, although it is unclear whether this lag reflects a fundamental difference 
or merely timing.  Numerous firms in the business recognition study only recently joined 
initiatives like the Global Compact and are only beginning to develop human rights policies.  
And the FG500 survey demonstrates that there is substantial policy diffusion in this domain:  
fewer than half of the respondents indicated having experienced &#8220;a significant human rights 
issue&#8221; themselves, yet almost all reported having policies or management practices in place 
relating to human rights.

<p><b>56
</b>  UNCTAD, <i>World Investment Report, 2006</i>, at:  www.unctad.org/wir.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>57
</b>  The FG500 survey is summarized in A/HRC/4/35/Add.3; the other three studies are reported 
</p>
<p>in HRC/4/35/Add.4.  Sampling and other methodological issues are also discussed there. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>67. All FG500 respondents, irrespective of region or sector, included non-discrimination as a 
core corporate responsibility, at minimum meaning recruitment and promotion based on merit.  
Workplace health and safety standards were cited almost as frequently.  More than three quarters 
recognized freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the prohibition against 
child and forced labour, and the right to privacy.  European firms were more likely than their 
United States counterparts to recognize the rights to life, liberty, and security of person; health; 
and an adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p>68. The survey asked the FG500 firms to rank the stakeholders their human rights policies or 
practices encompassed - in effect, to indicate their conception of their sphere of influence.  
Employees were ranked highest (99 per cent); suppliers and others in their value chain next 
(92.5 per cent); then the communities in which companies operated (71 per cent); followed by 
countries of operation (63 per cent).  The only significant variations were that the extractive 
sector ranked communities ahead of suppliers, while United States and Japanese firms placed 
communities and countries of operations far lower than European companies. 
</p>
<p>69. Companies referenced international instruments in formulating their policies.  Among the 
FG500, ILO declarations and conventions topped the list, followed by the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights.  United Nations human rights treaties were mentioned infrequently.  The 
Global Compact was cited by just over 50 per cent, the OECD Guidelines by just under 
50 per cent.  More than 80 per cent also said they worked with external stakeholders on their 
human rights policies.  NGOs topped that list, followed by industry associations.  
Intergovernmental organizations were a distant third - except for United States firms, which 
ranked them fifth, behind labour unions and Governments. 
</p>
<p>70. The broader cross-section of companies paralleled the FG500 in recognizing labour 
standards.  But their recognition of other rights was consistently lower:  the highest, at 
16 per cent, was the right to security of the person, encompassing both the right to life and the 
freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.<b>58</b>  For areas covered by social, economic, and 
cultural rights these companies tended to emphasize their philanthropic contributions. 
</p>
<p>71. Firms in both samples participated in one of the eight collective initiatives.<b>59</b>  The 
recognition of rights by these initiatives closely reflected industry sectors:  for example, those in 
manufacturing focused more on labour rights, whereas the extractive initiatives emphasized 
community relations and indigenous rights.  Moreover, they drew on international standards:  the 
FLA and Social Accountability 8000 meet or exceed most core ILO rights, while Equator banks 
track the IFC&#8217;s performance standards.  The SRI indices mirrored the overall high recognition of 
labour rights, and several exhibited a particular concern for rights related to indigenous peoples, 
as well as the right to a family life. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>58
</b>  Numeric differences in responses between the two samples are partially explained by the 
</p>
<p>FG500 study relying on questionnaire responses, whereas the business recognition study 
examined actual company policies, but this does not account for order of magnitude differences. 
<b>59
</b></p>
<p>  See HRC/4/35/Add.4 for details. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>72. How do these companies and other business entities respond to social expectations 
regarding accountability?  Most FG500 firms said they had internal reporting systems to monitor 
their human rights performance.  Three quarters indicated that they also reported externally, but 
of those fewer than half utilized a third-party medium like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).  
Some form of supply chain monitoring was relatively common.  But only one third said they 
routinely included human rights criteria within their social/environmental impact assessments.  
The business recognition study generally matched this pattern. 
</p>
<p>73. Similarly, each of the collective initiatives required some form of reporting; the ICMM 
utilizes the GRI.  Most had remediation requirements for non-compliant participants, and four 
prescribed grievance mechanisms for employees or community members.  Five extended human 
rights requirements to supply chain practices, with accountability mechanisms ranging from 
periodic audits to certifying individual factories or global brands. 
</p>
<p>74. In short, leading business players recognize human rights and adopt means to ensure 
basic accountability.  Yet even among the leaders, certain weaknesses of voluntarism are 
evident.  Companies do not necessarily recognize those rights on which they may have the 
greatest impact.  And while the rights they do recognize typically draw on international 
instruments, the language is rarely identical.  Some interpretations are so elastic that the 
standards lose meaning, making it difficult for the company itself, let alone the public, to assess 
performance against commitments. 
</p>
<p>75. There are also variations in the rights companies emphasize that seem unrelated to 
expected sectoral differences, but which appear instead to reflect the political culture of company 
home countries.  For example, European-based firms are most likely to adopt a comprehensive 
rights agenda, including social and economic rights, with American firms tending to recognize a 
narrower spectrum of rights and rights holders. 
</p>
<p>76. Where self-regulation remains most challenged, however, is in its accountability 
provisions.  The number, diversity, and uptake of instruments have grown significantly.  But 
they also pose serious issues about the meaning of accountability and how it is established.  Only 
three can be touched on here:  human rights impact assessments (HRIAs); materiality; and 
assurance. 
</p>
<p>77. For businesses with large physical or societal footprints, accountability should begin with 
assessments of what their human rights impact will be.  This would permit companies and 
affected communities to find ways of avoiding negative impacts from the start.  Several SRI 
funds strongly promote HRIAs, coupled with community engagement and dialogue.  However, 
relatively few firms conduct these assessments routinely and only a handful seem ever to have 
done a fully-fledged HRIA, in contrast to including selected human rights criteria in broader 
social/environmental assessments.<b>60</b>  And apparently only one company, BP, has ever made 
public even a summary of an HRIA.  No single measure would yield more immediate results in 
the human rights performance of firms than conducting such assessments where appropriate. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>60
</b>  The difference and its significance are described in a companion report, A/HRC/4/74. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>78. The concept of materiality refers to the content of company reporting - whether it 
conveys information that really matters.  The number of firms reporting their social, 
environmental and human rights profiles, called &#8220;sustainability reporting&#8221;, has risen 
exponentially.<b>61</b>  But quality has not matched quantity.  Far fewer companies report 
systematically on how their core business strategies and operations impact on these sustainability 
issues.  Instead, anecdotal descriptions of isolated projects and philanthropic activity often 
prevail.  Moreover, only a handful of companies combine social and financial reporting, despite 
the fact that the former has sustainability implications for the latter.<b>62</b>  The GRI provides 
standardized protocols to improve the quality and comparability of company reporting, but fewer 
than 200 firms report in accordance with GRI guidelines, another 700 partially do so, while 
others claim to use them informally.<b>63</b> 
</p>
<p>79. Assurance helps people to know whether companies actually do what they say.  A 
growing proportion of sustainability reports (circa 40 per cent) include some form of audit 
statement, typically provided by large accounting firms or smaller consultancies.<b>64</b>  Two global 
assurance standards have emerged, one giving companies more control over what is assured 
(called ISAE3000), and the second empowering the assurance provider to consider stakeholder 
concerns in determining what is material and therefore should be included in public reports 
(AA1000AS).<b>65</b>  Both<b> </b>standards<b> </b>help the public determine whether the information reported is 
reasonably likely to be accurate, based on such factors as the quality of the management, 
monitoring, data collection, and other systems in place to generate it, as well as its materiality.  
A growing but still small fraction of the largest companies use these standards.

<p>80. Supply chain assurance faces the greatest credibility challenges.  Global brands and 
retailers, among others, have developed supplier codes to compensate for weak or unenforced 
standards in some countries, because global social expectations require them to demonstrate 
adherence to minimum standards.  However, without independent external assurance of some 
sort these systems lack credibility, especially for companies with questionable performance 
records.  Standards for supply chain auditing are highly variable.  Among the most trusted are 
the brand certification and SA8000 factory certification systems of the Fair Labor Association 
(FLA), both of which involve multi-stakeholder governance structures.  Similar to the hybrid 
initiatives discussed in the previous section, the credibility of voluntary accountability 
mechanisms is enhanced by processes involving participation, transparency, and review, which 
these two systems embody.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p>81. For several reasons, the initiatives described in this section have not reached all types of 
companies.  First, because many of the tools were developed for large national and 
transnational firms, they are not directly suitable for small- and medium-sized enterprises.  
Existing tools need to be adapted or new ones developed.  Second, as noted, large developing 
country firms are just beginning to be drawn into this arena.  Third, a more serious omission 
may be major state-owned enterprises based in some emerging economies:  with few exceptions, 
they have not yet voluntarily associated themselves with such initiatives, nor is it well 
understood when the rules of State attribution apply to their human rights performance.<b>67</b>  
Finally, as is true of all voluntary - and many statutory initiatives - determined laggards find 
ways to avoid scrutiny.  This problem is not unique to human rights, nor is it unprecedented in 
history.  But once a tipping point is reached, societies somehow manage to mitigate if not 
eliminate the problem.  The trick is getting to the tipping point - a goal to which this mandate is 
dedicated. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>66
</b>  A test of this proposition is currently under way. The Business Social Compliance Initiative, a 
</p>
<p>European network of retailers, industry and importing companies, has formed a strategic alliance 
with SA8000 and become an &#8220;organizational stakeholder&#8221; in GRI. That ought to generate 
credibility benefits.  At the same time, the world&#8217;s four largest supermarket chains, Wal-Mart, 
Tesco, Carrefour, and Metro are launching their own initiative with no external stakeholder 
involvement and, to date, no transparency.  The proposition would predict difficulties ahead. 
During a recent US court case against Wal-Mart for alleged labour violations in the factories of 
overseas suppliers, a company attorney stated that its supplier code of conduct &#8220;creates certain 
rights for Wal-Mart. It does not create certain rights and obligations on behalf of Wal-Mart&#8221;.  
While the claim may be legally correct, it leaves unanswered the question of just what promises 
to workers and consumers the company&#8217;s code is intended to convey, and how the public can be 
assured that the promise is being kept. (Josh Gerstein, &#8220;Novel Legal Challenge to Wal-Mart 
Appears to be Faltering on Coast&#8221;, http://www.nysun.com/article/45009).

<p><b>VI. CONCLUSION </b></p>
<p>82. <b>The permissive conditions for business-related human rights abuses today are 
created by a misalignment between economic forces and governance capacity.  Only a 
realignment can fix the problem.  In principle, public authorities set the rules within which 
business operates.  But at the national level some Governments may simply be unable to 
take effective action, whether or not the will to do so is present.  And in the international 
arena States themselves compete for access to markets and investments, thus collective 
action problems may restrict or impede their serving as the international community&#8217;s 
&#8220;public authority&#8221;.  The most vulnerable people and communities pay the heaviest price 
for these governance gaps. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> There are lessons to be drawn from earlier periods.  The Victorian era of 
globalization collapsed because Governments and business failed to manage its adverse 
impact on the core values of social community.  Similarly, the attempt to restore a 
laissez-faire international economy after the First World War barely made it off the 
ground before degenerating into the destructive political &#8220;isms&#8221; that ascended from the left 
and right, and for which history will remember the first half of the twentieth century - all 
championed in the name of social protection against economic forces controlled by 
&#8220;others&#8221;.  There are few indications that such extreme reactions are taking root today, but 
this is the dystopia that States and businesses need to consider, and avoid, as they assess the 
current situation and where it might lead.  Human rights and the sustainability of 
globalization are inextricably linked. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> This report has identified areas of fluidity in the business and human rights 
constellation, which in some respects may be seen as hopeful signs.  By far the most 
consequential legal development is the gradual extension of liability to companies for 
international crimes, under domestic jurisdiction but reflecting international standards.  
But this trend is largely an unanticipated by-product of States strengthening the legal 
regime for individuals, and its actual operation will reflect variations in national practice, 
which is not an ideal solution for anyone.  No comparably consistent hard law 
developments were found in any other areas of human rights, which leaves large protection 
gaps for victims, as well as predictability gaps for companies who may still get tried in 
&#8220;courts of public opinion&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Considerable innovation was found in soft law initiatives, both intergovernmental 
and, even more so, the multi-stakeholder hybrids.  In the latter, individual States most 
directly concerned with a pressing problem collaborate directly with business and civil 
society to establish voluntary regulatory systems in specific operational contexts.  In 
addition, self-regulation by business through company codes and collective initiatives, often 
undertaken in collaboration with civil society, also exhibits innovation and policy diffusion.  
All of these approaches show some potential, despite obvious weaknesses.  The biggest 
challenge is bringing such efforts to a scale where they become truly systemic interventions.  
For that to occur, States need to more proactively structure business incentives and 
disincentives, while accountability practices must be more deeply embedded within market 
mechanisms themselves. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>Judging from the treaty body commentaries, and reinforced by the Special 
Representative&#8217;s questionnaire survey of States, not all State structures as a whole appear 
to have internalized the full meaning of the State duty to protect, nor its implications with 
regard to preventing and punishing abuses by non-State actors, including business.  Nor do 
States seem to be taking full advantage of the many legal and policy tools at their disposal 
to meet their treaty obligations.  Insofar as the duty to protect lies at the very foundation of 
the international human rights regime, this uncertainty gives rise to concern</b>. 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Lack of clarity regarding the implications of the duty to protect also affects how 
corporate &#8220;sphere of influence&#8221; is understood.  This concept has no legal pedigree beyond 
fairly direct agency relationships.  But in exploring its potential utility as a practical policy 
tool the Special Representative has discovered that it cannot easily be separated 
operationally from the State duty to protect.  Where Governments lack capacity or 
abdicate their duties, the corporate sphere of influence looms large by default, not due to 
any principled underpinning.  Indeed, disputes between Governments and businesses over 
just where the boundaries of their respective responsibilities lie are ending up in courts.  
The soft law hybrids have made a singular contribution by acknowledging that for some 
purposes the most sensible solution is to base initiatives on the notion of &#8220;shared 
responsibility&#8221;.  This is a conclusion some moral philosophers have also reached with 
regard to global structural inequities that cannot be solved by individual liability regimes 
alone.68  This critical nexus requires greater clarification</b>. 
</p>
<p>88.<b> The extensive research and consultations conducted for this mandate demonstrate 
that no single silver bullet can resolve the business and human rights challenge.  A broad 
array of measures is required, by all relevant actors.  Mapping existing and emerging 
standards and practices was an essential first step.  What flows logically from the current 
report is the need for a strategic assessment of the major legal and policy measures that 
States and other social actors could take, together with views and recommendations about 
which options or combinations might work best to create effective remedies on the ground.  
But because the mandate effectively made only 18 months available to the</b> <b>Special</b> 
<b>Representative, it has not been possible for him to build on his work and submit to the 
Council the &#8220;views and recommendations&#8221; resolution 2005/69 invited.  Therefore, he would 
welcome a one-year extension to complete the assignment.  As has been his custom 
throughout, he would continue to hold transparent consultations with all stakeholders 
during this process and in advance of submitting his views and recommendations in his 
next (and final) report to the Council.
