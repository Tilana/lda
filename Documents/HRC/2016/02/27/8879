</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> previous resolutions on the human rights of migrants and on the rights of 
the child adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Council and the General

</p>
<p> <i>Noting with appreciation </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of

the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, including migrants,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the increasing participation of children in international migration 
movements and stressing the need to ensure the protection of children from all forms of 
abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned </i>about the large and growing number of migrants, especially 
children, attempting to cross international borders without the required travel documents, 
and recognizing the obligation of States to respect the human rights of all migrants,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including 
those that refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic 
approaches that take into account the causes and consequences and challenges and 
opportunities of the phenomenon and full respect for the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of migrants, with due regard for the specific needs of children in vulnerable 
situations, such as unaccompanied children, girls, children with disabilities and those who 
may be in need of international refugee protection,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>States to promote and protect effectively the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of children, regardless of their 
status, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international 
instruments to which they are party, and therefore: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Underlines that the international legal framework for the protection of the 
child applies irrespective of his/her migration status and that of his/her parents or family 
members, and calls upon States to respect and ensure the protection of the human rights of 
every child within their jurisdiction, without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Calls upon States to establish or strengthen policies and programmes aimed 
at addressing the situation of children in the context of migration that have a human rights-
based approach and are<b> </b>based on general principles, such as the best interests of the child, 
non-discrimination, participation and survival and development;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Also calls upon States that have not signed and ratified or acceded to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto, and the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families to consider doing so as a matter of priority;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also</i> <i>calls</i> <i>upon</i> States of origin to take appropriate measures to promote and 
protect effectively the rights of children who are left behind in their country of origin by 
migrating family members, including by: </p>


<p> (<i>a</i>) Development of data on the situation of children left behind in countries of 
origin in order to better understand the impact of migration processes on their well-being 
and enjoyment of their human rights;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Undertaking, in cooperation with relevant organizations, information 
campaigns with a child perspective aimed at clarifying prospects, limitations, potential risks 
and rights in the event of migration, in order to enable everyone, in particular children and 
their family members, to make informed decisions and to prevent them from becoming 
victims of trafficking or falling prey to transnational organized networks of smugglers or 
organized criminal groups; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Strengthening relevant national institutions to address the particular needs of 
children left behind in their country of origin;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon </i>States to protect the human rights of children in the 
context of migration, and therefore: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Calls upon States parties to the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the supplementing protocols thereto, namely, the 
Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, to 
implement them fully, and calls upon States that have not yet ratified or acceded to them to 
consider doing so as a matter of priority;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Encourages States to establish institutionalized services and implement 
programmes to provide age- and gender-sensitive support and protection to migrant 
children, with due regard for the specific needs of children in vulnerable situations, such as 
unaccompanied children, girls, children with disabilities and those who may be in need of 
international refugee protection;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Requests all States to take concrete measures to prevent the violation of the 
human rights of migrant children while in transit, and to train public officials to detect and 
treat them respectfully, in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner and in accordance with 
their international obligations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Calls upon States to ensure that migrant children, especially those who are 
unaccompanied and those who are victims of violence, exploitation, persecution and 
conflict, receive special protection and assistance, in accordance with their international 
obligations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Encourages all States to apply a gender perspective when developing 
migration policies and programmes in order to take the necessary measures to better protect 
girls against dangers and abuse during migration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Urges States to ensure that repatriation mechanisms allow for the 
identification and special protection of children, and that repatriation processes fully respect 
the rights of the child<b> </b>and take into account, in conformity with their international 
obligations and commitments, the principles of the best interests of the child and non-
refoulement, and family reunification; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the arrest, imprisonment or detention of a child should be in 
conformity with the law and the international obligations of the State, and recalls in this 
context article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides that such 
measures should be taken only as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of 
time, and urges States to protect effectively the rights of children affected by the detention 
of their parents, guardians or family members because of their migratory status and, in this 
regard: </p>


<p> (<i>a</i>) Encourages States to consider positively alternatives to detention for children 
and the family group, when children or their parents are detained on the sole basis of their 
migratory status, recalling in this context the conclusions and recommendations of human 
rights mechanisms that the treatment of irregular migration of children as a criminal offence 
can have a negative impact on the enjoyment of their human rights, and taking into account 
the necessary balance between the need to protect family unity and the best interests of the 
child;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Reaffirms emphatically the duty of States parties to ensure full respect for 
and observance of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, in particular with regard 
to the right of all foreign nationals, regardless of their immigration status, to communicate 
with a consular official of the sending State in the event of arrest, imprisonment, custody or 
detention, and the obligation of the receiving State to inform the foreign national without 
delay of his or her rights under the Convention;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>States of destination to protect effectively the human rights of 
children in the context of migration, without discrimination of any kind and, in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure for migrant children, regardless of their legal status, the enjoyment 
of all human rights and, in accordance with their national laws and any relevant 
international obligations, appropriate access to health care and social services; 
</p>
<p> (b) To prevent and eliminate discriminatory policies that deny migrant children 
access to education, regardless of their migratory status; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure that every child preserves his or her identity, including nationality, 
name and family relations as recognized by law, without unlawful interference, including 
by ensuring the registration and issuance of birth certificates for every child, irrespective of 
his or her immigration status and that of his or her parents or family members; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To take all reasonable steps to avoid the difficulties associated with 
statelessness for migrant children, in line with international obligations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To deal with applications to enter or leave a State for the purpose of family 
reunification in a positive, humane and expeditious manner, while ensuring that the 
submission of such requests entail no adverse consequences for the applicants and for the 
members of their family;  
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To consider the possibility of adopting immigration programmes that allow 
migrants to integrate fully into the host countries, facilitate family reunification and 
promote a harmonious and tolerant environment; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote and raise 
awareness of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
and to support, as appropriate, the building of greater synergies between the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, and to strengthen cooperation for the protection 
of migrant children;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to continue to elaborate and disseminate training and awareness-raising material on 
the rights of children in the context of migration, and to continue to contribute to national 
efforts in the development and implementation of policies and programmes that promote 
and protect their rights and, upon the request of States, to continue to provide assistance in 
the training of immigration officials;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a study on 
challenges and best practices in the implementation of the international framework for the </p>


<p>protection of the rights of the child in the context of migration, in consultation with relevant 
stakeholders, including States, regional organizations, civil society organizations and 
national human rights institutions, and requests that the study be available on the website of 
the Office prior to the fifteenth session of the Council, and to disseminate it to all relevant 
international forums.

Human rights and international solidarity

and the Council on the issue of the human rights and international solidarity, including

the reports presented by the independent expert on human rights and international

</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination 
of obstacles to development,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing 
countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective 
international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development,

<p><i> Taking into account</i> the fact that article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant 
undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, 
especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view 
to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by 
all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, 
friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political 
systems,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the fact that the widening gap between the economically developed and 
developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in 
the international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, 
according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process 
of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities 
and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several 
countries, particularly least developed and African countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a 
massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental 
consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing 
countries, </p>


<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official 
development assistance, recalling the pledge of industrialized countries to allocate 
0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and 
recognizing the need for new and additional resources to finance the development 
programmes of developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an 
increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of 
partnership and intra-generational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a 
vital component of the efforts made by developing countries to realize the right to 
development of their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future ones, and that a better world is possible for both present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, 
deserve help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the 
past, and to hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their 
development endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full 
realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to promote international solidarity 
and cooperation as an important tool to help to overcome the negative effects of the current 
economic, financial and climate crisis, particularly in developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, 
that it should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual respect, 
in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in 
particular respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated to 
the fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the 
United Nations human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing 
challenges of international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the 
independent expert in his mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him 
and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to his requests to visit their 
country, to enable him to fulfil his mandate effectively;  </p>


<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a 
draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in

and protecting this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its 
realization; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all 
major United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic,

Follow-up to the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council on the negative 
impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the realization of the right to food 
for all 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions and decisions on the right to food adopted in the 
framework of the United Nations, in particular Council resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008 
and 9/6 of 18 September 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first 
Millennium Development Goal of eradicating hunger and extreme poverty by 2015,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the outcome of the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the 
Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008,  </p>


<p><i> Resolved </i>to act to ensure that the human rights perspective is taken into account at 
the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the current world food 
crisis,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the panel discussion on the realization of the right to food in the context 
of the global food crisis, held by the Council on 9 March 2009, which offered an 
opportunity for persons affected by the crisis to participate and provide input to the 
discussions,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the task force established by the Secretary-General, and supporting 
the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the complex character of the current global food crisis, as a 
combination of several major factors, both structural and conjunctural, also negatively 
affected by, inter alia, environmental degradation, drought and desertification, global 
climate change, natural disasters and the lack of the necessary technology, and also that a 
strong commitment from national Governments and the international community as a whole 
is required to confront the major threats to food security,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis are not over and that 
they continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in 
developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and 
financial crisis, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to food (A/HRC/12/31), and takes note of his recommendations;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses </i>grave concern at the fact that the current world food crisis 
seriously undermines the realization of the right to food for all, and especially for one sixth 
of the world population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, suffering from 
hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Encourages </i>States to mainstream the human rights perspective in building 
and reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food for 
all, which could include, inter alia, the mapping of the food insecure, the adoption of 
relevant legislation and policies with a right to food framework, the establishment of 
mechanisms to ensure accountability so that rights-holders are able to claim their right to 
food, and the establishment of mechanisms and processes that ensure the participation of 
rights-holders, particularly the most vulnerable, in the design and monitoring of such 
legislation and policies;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also encourages </i>all States to invest or promote investment in agriculture and 
rural infrastructure in a manner that empowers the most vulnerable and affected by the 
current crisis in order to ensure their realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all 
necessary measures to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses </i>that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to 
meet the vital food needs of their own populations, especially of vulnerable groups and 
households, such as by enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to 
increase local production for this purpose, while the international community should 
provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in<b> 
</b>support for national and regional efforts by providing the necessary assistance for </p>


<p>increasing food production, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the 
transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, with a special focus 
on the gender-sensitive dimension; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages </i>all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to promote the right to food as 
outlined in his mandate and, as part of it, to continue to follow up on the world food crisis 
through a continued dialogue with stakeholders at all levels, including with all relevant 
international organizations and agencies of the United Nations system, in order to 
contribute to identifying means to implement the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, within the framework of his mandate, 
to inform the Council on the crisis, the impact of the crisis on the realization of the right to 
food and progress made and obstacles encountered in relation to the implementation of 
measures to respond to the world food crisis and of evolving best practices in this regard;

<p> <i>Recalling also </i>the report of the Secretary-General on the rule of law and transitional 
justice in conflict and post-conflict societies (S/2004/616), including the relevant

Human Rights as the lead entity within the United Nations system on, inter alia, transitional 
justice, as well as the report of the Secretary-General on enhancing mediation and its 
support activities (S/2009/189),<b> </b></p>


<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human 
rights through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II) and 
taking note with appreciation of the updated version of those principles 
(E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), as well as the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers (E/CN.4/2006/52),<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, 
and reaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts 
and in peacebuilding, and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard to 
conflict prevention and resolution,<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the role of the Peacebuilding Commission in this regard, and recalling 
the necessity for the Commission to intensify its efforts, within its mandate, in cooperation 
with national and transitional Governments and in consultation with the relevant United 
Nations entities, to incorporate human rights, when advising on or proposing country-
specific peacebuilding strategies for post-conflict situations in cases under consideration, 
where applicable,

aims to end impunity, establish the rule of law, promote and encourage respect for human 
rights and achieve sustainable peace, in accordance with international law and the purposes 
and principles of the Charter,

<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the activities of the United Nations, including through its field presences, 
in assisting States to design, establish and implement transitional justice mechanisms and 
promote the rule of law, as well as its conceptual and analytical work on transitional justice 
and human rights,<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> <i>also</i> the increased integration of a human rights perspective, including 
through the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights in cooperation with other relevant parts of the United Nations system, in the United 
Nations activities related to transitional justice, as well as the importance given to the rule 
of law and transitional justice by the High Commissioner and her Office, including its Rule 
of Law and Democracy Unit,<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights 
should be taken into account in any transitional justice context, in order to promote, inter 
alia, the rule of law and accountability, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the analytical study on human rights and 
transitional justice (A/HRC/12/18 and Add.1);<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 2. <i>Underlines</i> the importance and urgency of national and international efforts 
to end human rights violations, restore justice and the rule of law in conflict and post-
conflict situations and, where relevant, in the context of transitional processes;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 3. <i>Also underlines</i> the fact that, when designing a transitional justice strategy, 
the specific context of each situation must be taken into account with a view to preventing 
the recurrence of crises,<b> </b>future violations of human rights and to ensure social cohesion, 
nation-building, ownership and inclusiveness at the national and local levels; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance of a comprehensive approach to transitional 
justice, incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including, among 
others, individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting of 
public employees and officials, or an appropriately conceived combination thereof, in order 
to, inter alia, ensure accountability, serve justice, provide remedies to victims, promote 
healing and reconciliation, establish independent oversight of the security system and </p>


<p>restore confidence in the institutions of the State and promote the rule of law in accordance 
with international human rights law;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 5. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that truth-seeking processes, such as truth and 
reconciliation commissions, that investigate patterns of past human rights violations and 
their causes and consequences are important tools that can complement judicial processes<b> 
</b>and, when established, such mechanisms have to be designed within a specific societal 
context and to be founded on broad national consultations with the inclusion of victims and 
civil society, including non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> the need within a sustainable transitional justice strategy to develop 
national prosecutorial capacities that are based on a clear commitment to combat impunity, 
to take into account the victim&#8217;s perspective and to ensure compliance with human rights 
obligations concerning fair trials; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> the responsibility of States to comply with their relevant 
obligations to prosecute those responsible for gross violations of human rights and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law constituting crimes under international law,

</b></p>
<p> 8. <i>Notes with interest</i> the conclusion of the Secretary-General that peace 
agreements endorsed by the United Nations can never promise amnesties for genocide, 
crimes against humanity, war crimes and gross violations of human rights;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 9. <i>Emphasizes</i> that a human rights approach should be incorporated into vetting 
processes that are part of institutional reform aiming at preventing the recurrence of human 
rights violations; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also</i> <i>emphasizes</i> that justice, peace, democracy and development are 
mutually reinforcing imperatives; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Welcomes</i> the fact that a growing number of peace agreements contain 
provisions for transitional justice processes, such as truth-seeking, prosecution initiatives, 
reparations programmes and institutional reform, and do not provide for blanket amnesties; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of a comprehensive process of national consultation, 
particularly with those affected by human rights violations, in contributing to a holistic 
transitional justice strategy that takes into account the particular circumstances of every 
situation and is in conformity with human rights; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of giving vulnerable groups, including those 
marginalized for political, socio-economic or other reasons, a voice in these processes and 
to ensure that discrimination, the root causes of conflict and violations of all human rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights, are addressed; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role played in the realization of transitional justice 
goals and in the reconstruction of the society, as well as in the promotion of the rule of law 
and accountability, by: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Victims&#8217; associations, human rights defenders and other actors of civil 
society, as well as national human rights institutions created in conformity with the Paris 
Principles; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Women&#8217;s organizations in the design, establishment and implementation of 
transitional justice mechanisms, so as to ensure that women are represented in their 
structures and that a gender perspective is reflected in their mandates and work; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Free and independent media in informing the public about the human rights 
dimension in the area of transitional justice mechanisms locally, nationally and 
internationally; </p>


<p> 15. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to provide gender-sensitive human rights training in the 
context of transitional justice to all relevant national actors, including police, military, 
intelligence and security services, prosecution staff and members of the judiciary, in 
dealing with victims of human rights violations, particularly women and girls, in order to 
ensure gender sensitivity in the restoration of the rule of law and transitional justice 
processes;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 16. <i>Underlines</i> the need for the rights of both victims and accused persons to be 
respected, in accordance with international human rights law, with particular attention paid 
to those most affected by conflicts and the breakdown of the rule of law, among them 
women, children, migrants, refugees, persons with disabilities and persons belonging to 
minorities and indigenous peoples, and to ensure that specific measures are taken for their 
free participation and protection and for the sustainable return of refugees and internally 
displaced persons in safety and dignity;<b>

<p> 17. <i>Calls upon </i>States to assist the United Nations in its ongoing work on the 
relevant recommendations of the report of the Secretary-General on the rule of law and 
transitional justice in conflict and post-conflict societies and the one entitled &#8220;Uniting our

incorporating international human rights law, principles and best practices into the 
development and implementation of transitional justice mechanisms and by cooperating 
fully with United Nations field presences in the area of human rights and transitional justice 
and by facilitating the work of relevant special procedures; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community and regional organizations to assist 
countries, who so consent, in the context of transitional justice, to ensure the promotion and 
protection of human rights and to incorporate best practices into the development and 
implementation of transitional justice mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Recommends</i> that a human rights and transitional justice perspective be taken 
into account in peace negotiations, and that those<b> </b>conducting peace negotiations draw upon 
the relevant human rights and transitional justice expertise available within the United 
Nations system; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to continue to enhance its leading role within the United Nations, including with 
regard to conceptual and analytical work regarding transitional justice, and to assist States, 
with their consent, to design, establish and implement transitional justice mechanisms from 
a human rights perspective, while stressing the importance of close cooperation between the 
Office of the High Commissioner and other relevant parts of the United Nations, as well as 
other international and non-governmental organizations, with regard to incorporating 
human rights and best practices into the development and implementation of transitional 
justice mechanisms and to the ongoing process of strengthening the United Nations system 
in the area of the rule of law and transitional justice;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 21. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to submit to the Council, 
at its eighteenth session, a report containing an update of the activities undertaken by the 
Office in the context of transitional justice, including by the human rights components of

violations of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law, with a 
view to determine the need to develop common standards and promote best practices that 
would serve as guidelines to States in protecting witnesses and others concerned with 
providing cooperation in trials for gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Invites</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to convene, within existing

<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is 
one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, is enabled by a democratic 
environment, which offers, inter alia, guarantees for its protection, is essential to full and 
effective participation in a free and democratic society, and is instrumental to the 
development and strengthening of effective democratic systems, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression is an important indicator of the level of protection of other human rights and 
freedoms, bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 
and interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
continue to occur, including increased attacks directed against, and killings of, journalists 
and media workers, and stressing the need to ensure greater protection for all media 
professionals and for journalistic sources, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need to ensure that the invocation of national security, including 
counter-terrorism, is not used unjustifiably or arbitrarily to restrict the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression,

impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information, 
democratic participation, accountability and combating corruption,

special duties and responsibilities, in accordance with article 19 (3) of the International

intimidation, persecution and harassment, threats and acts of violence and of 
discrimination, including gender-based violence and discrimination, increased abuse of 
legal provisions on defamation and criminal libel as well as on surveillance, search and 
seizure, and censorship against persons who exercise, seek to promote or defend these 
rights, including journalists, writers and other media workers, Internet users and human 
rights defenders;

conflict, have increased and are not adequately punished, in particular in those

women, and reaffirms that full and equal access to education for girls and boys, women and 
men, is crucial for the full enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression;

discrimination and related violence, as well as of negative racial and religious stereotyping

raise awareness of, and disseminate information and education on, prevention and treatment 
of HIV/AIDS and other diseases through effective and equal access to information and all 
appropriate means, including through the media and availability of information and 
communication technologies, and targeted at specific vulnerable groups;

<p>(i) Discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human 
rights, government activities and corruption in government; engaging in

administrative measures and censorship; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Access to or use of information and communication technologies, including 
radio, television and the Internet; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that condemning and addressing, in accordance with their

extend protection to journalists in situations of armed conflict, and to allow, within the 
framework of applicable rules and procedures, media access and coverage, as appropriate, 
in situations of international and non-international armed conflict; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes</i> the moral and social responsibilities of the media and the 
importance that the media&#8217;s elaboration of voluntary codes of professional ethical<b> </b>conduct 
can play in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also recognizes</i> the positive contribution that the exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression, particularly by the media, including through information and 
communication technologies such as the Internet, and full respect for the freedom to seek, 
receive and impart information can make to the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and to preventing human rights abuses, but expresses 
regret at the promotion by certain media of false images and negative stereotypes of 
vulnerable individuals or groups of individuals, and at the use of information and 
communication technologies such as the Internet for purposes contrary to respect for human 
rights, in particular the perpetration of violence against and exploitation and abuse of 
women and children, and disseminating racist and xenophobic discourse or content; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms </i>the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information 
can play in strengthening democracy, combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, in line with relevant provisions of international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that the open public debate of ideas, as well as interfaith and 
intercultural dialogue at the local, national, and international levels, can be among the best 
protections against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and 
can play a positive role in strengthening democracy and combating national, racial or 
religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, within the framework of his mandate, to carry out his 
activities in accordance with its resolution 7/36 and all relevant Council resolutions and

</p>
<p><i> Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International

Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted in June 1993 
by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), the Beijing Declaration and 
Platform for Action, adopted in September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on 
Women (A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, chap. I), and the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, adopted in September 2001 by the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly 
entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first 
century&#8221;, the declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-
ninth session and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/13 of 17 April 2000, 
2001/34 of 23 April 2001 and 2003/22 of 22 April 2003, as well as Council resolution 6/30 
of 14 December 2007 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the 
United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees to </p>


<p>ensure the equality of women and men, girls and boys, in the enjoyment of their civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that women face multiple forms of discrimination,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life is 
essential for the full and complete economic and social development of a country, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, 
policies, customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to participate fully in 
development processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute 
to the feminization of poverty, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Welcomes </i>the commitments made by the international community to 
implement fully the Millennium Development Goals and stressing, in that context, the 
resolve of Heads of State to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as 
effective ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is 
truly sustainable; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the efforts made by States around the world to reform their 
legal systems in order to remove obstacles to women&#8217;s full and effective enjoyment of their 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the fact that, despite the pledge made at the Beijing 
World Conference on Women and the review by the General Assembly at its twenty-third 
special session to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against women and 
girls, many of those laws are still in force and continue to be applied, thereby preventing 
women and girls from enjoying the full realization of their human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States to fulfil their international obligations and commitments to 
revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in 
the administration of justice, taking into account that those laws violate their human right to 
be protected against discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 6<i>. Recognizes</i> that women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of 
equal opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation, 
access to labour and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political 
participation, access to decision-making processes, inheritance, ownership of land, financial 
services, including loans, and nationality and legal capacity, among others, as well as 
increased vulnerability to discrimination and violence, and that all countries face challenges 
in these areas; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Acknowledges </i>the work undertaken by the Commission on the Status of 
Women, the Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
the special rapporteurs of the Council on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and trafficking of persons, including women and children, contemporary 
forms of slavery, and other relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to 
eliminate discrimination in law and practice throughout the world; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Emphasizes</i> the significant role that women play in economic development 
and in the eradication of poverty, stresses the need to promote equal pay for equal work or 
work of equal value and for promoting the recognition of the value of women&#8217;s </p>


<p>unremunerated work, as well as for developing and promoting policies that facilitate the 
reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls on </i>States to ensure full representation and full equal participation of 
women in political, social and economic decision-making as an essential condition for 
gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls as a critical factor in the 
eradication of poverty; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i> particularly the work undertaken by the Committee on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women on women&#8217;s equality before 
the law; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role played by the Council in addressing the issue 
of discrimination against women, in both law and practice; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes</i> the convening of a panel on equality before the law during the 
eleventh session of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Notes</i> that, although human rights treaty bodies and special procedures do, to 
some extent, address discrimination against women within their mandates, their attention to 
such discrimination is not systematic; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Also notes</i> the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a thematic study on 
discrimination against women, in law and practice, and on how the issue is addressed 
throughout the United Nations human rights system, in consultation with States, relevant 
United Nations bodies and mechanisms and agencies, including the Committee on 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the agencies within the United 
Nations composite entity on gender equality and empowerment of women and all other 
relevant stakeholders, taking into account the efforts made in this regard, particularly by the 
Commission on the Status of Women; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Decides</i> to address the above-requested thematic study at its fifteenth session, 
and to hold a half-day discussion on the issue in order to consider taking further possible 
action on discrimination against women at that session.

</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to 
international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter and the norms and principles 
governing peaceful relations among States,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of 
all human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the final document of the fifteenth summit of the Heads of State and 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in July 2009, 
in which the States Members of the Movement decided to oppose unilateralism and 
unilaterally-imposed measures by certain States, which can lead to the erosion and violation 
of the Charter and international law, the use and threat of use of force, and pressure and 
coercive measures, as a means to achieving their national policy objectives, and to support, 
in accordance with international law, the claim of affected States, including targeted States, 
to compensation for damage incurred as a consequence of the implementation of 
extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or laws,  </p>


<p><i> Recalling also </i>that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 
to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter and that created obstacles to trade 
relations among States and impeded the full realization of all human rights, and that also 
severely threatened the freedom of trade,

<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
General Assembly, the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United Nations 
conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of 
international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated, 
implemented and enforced by, inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with all their 
negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social 
development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby 
creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and 
individuals under the jurisdiction of other States,

<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,

Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

subsistence,

<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive 
measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the 
Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations 
among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which 
create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the 
rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human 
rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 
addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member 
States neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective 
administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial 
application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns </i>the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain 
powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, 
particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from 
exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and 
social systems;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates</i> its call upon Member States that have initiated such measures to 
abide by the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 
Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions, and to commit themselves to their 
obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by 
virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own 
economic, social and cultural development;  
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Also reaffirms </i>its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total 
disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible 
with the Charter;  </p>


<p> 7. <i>Recalls </i>that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in 
its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State 
may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms </i>that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be 
used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be 
deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines </i>the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this 
regard, calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive 
measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the 
principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries;  
</p>
<p> 10 <i>Rejects </i>all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with

The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1997/33 of 11 April 1997, 
1999/49 of 27 April 1999, 2001/51 of 24 April 2001, 2003/29 of 22 April 2003, 2003/47 of 
23 April 2003, 2004/26 of 16 April 2004, 2005/23 of 15 April 2005 and 2005/84 of 21 
April 2005, the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly on 
2 June 2006, and the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the Assembly 
at its special session on HIV/AIDS on 27 June 2001, which affirm that the realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is essential to reduce vulnerability to HIV 
and the impact of AIDS, as is the involvement of people living with HIV, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (hereinafter referred 
to as &#8220;the Guidelines&#8221;), referred to in the above-mentioned resolutions and annexed to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/33, which provide guidance to ensuring the 
respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights in the context of HIV, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2003/29, 2004/26 and 
2005/23 and Council decision 2/107 of 27 November 2006, and their acknowledgement that 
prevention and comprehensive care and support, including treatment and access to 
medication without discrimination, for those infected and affected by pandemics such as 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are inseparable elements of an effective response and 
must be integrated into a comprehensive approach to respond to such pandemics, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2002/31 of 22 April 2002, 
2003/28 of 22 April 2003, 2004/27 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/24 of 15 April 2005, in 
which the Commission reaffirmed the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and also recalling Council resolution 6/29 
of 14 December 2007, in which the Council extended the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> <i>with interest</i> of the reports by the United Nations special procedures 
that have devoted specific attention, in the context of their mandates, to the critical 
intersection between the protection of human rights and an effective response to the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with grave concern</i> the fact that, according to estimates by the Joint 
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, at the end of 
2007, 33 million people were living with HIV, including 2.7 million people newly infected </p>


<p>with HIV in 2007, and that a disproportionate number of them are presently in sub-Saharan 
Africa, and also deploring the 25 million lives lost to HIV/AIDS since the epidemic was 
identified, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the urgent need to scale up efforts significantly towards the goal of 
universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 
2010, affirmed by Governments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the 
General Assembly at its High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS on 2 June 2006, and 
emphasizing the concern at the increasing instances of multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination, and reiterating that such discrimination affects the enjoyment of human 
rights and can lead to particular targeting of people living with HIV/AIDS and members of 
key populations affected by the epidemic, as well as increased vulnerability to HIV, and 
also recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen programmes or measures to 
eradicate multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, in particular by adopting or 
improving penal or civil legislation to address these phenomena, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing</i> appreciation for the important role played by the engagement of civil 
society in the response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and 
Intellectual Property, adopted by the World Health Assembly on 24 May 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming also</i> progress in expanding access to HIV treatment, particularly the 
35 per cent increase in the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy from 2007 to 
2008, noting, however, that while nearly 3 million people in low- and middle-income 
countries were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral medicines as of the end of 2007, an 
estimated 9.7 million in need lacked access to such life-saving medicines, an estimated 1 
million end-stage HIV/AIDS patients had no access to treatment for moderate to severe 
pain, and many people in need failed to receive treatment for tuberculosis and other HIV-
related opportunistic infections, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with particular concern</i> that, according to the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, women and girls are 
disproportionately affected by the epidemic in that they comprise an increasing proportion 
of the people infected, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where women account for 57 per 
cent of those infected, and young women aged from 15 to 24 years are three times more 
likely to be infected than young men of the same age, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> resolution 53/2 of 13 March 2009 of the Commission on the Status of 
Women and the recognition of the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS on women 
and girls and the need to increase significantly and coordinate political and financial 
commitment to address gender equality and equity in national HIV and AIDS responses, 
and recognizing the need to link the AIDS response more closely with the overall response 
to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to health, and 
underlining in this regard the interrelated nature of health- and gender-related Millennium 
Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i>, in view of the increasing challenges presented by HIV/AIDS, 
including apparent trends to enact criminal and other laws that are counterproductive to 
HIV prevention, treatment, care and support efforts, and the ongoing application of HIV-
specific restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of HIV-positive people, the need for 
intensified efforts to ensure universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all in order to reduce vulnerability to HIV, prevent HIV/AIDS-
related discrimination and stigma and reduce the impact of AIDS; 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to 
expand significantly and strengthen its work with national Governments and to work with </p>


<p>all groups of civil society to address the gap in access to services for injecting drug users in 
all settings, including prisons, to develop comprehensive models of appropriate service 
delivery for injecting drug users, to tackle the issues of stigmatization and discrimination, 
and to support increased capacity and resources for the provision of a comprehensive 
package of services for injecting drug users, including harm-reduction programmes in 
relation to HIV, as elaborated by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in the 
Technical Guide for countries to set targets for universal access to HIV prevention, 
treatment and care for injecting drug users, in accordance with relevant national 
circumstances, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the attention given to HIV/AIDS-related human rights by all the human 
rights treaty bodies,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also</i> the positive steps taken to implement previous resolutions, 
including the enactment of legislation in some countries to promote human rights in the 
context of HIV/AIDS and to prohibit discrimination against all persons infected or 
presumed to be infected, living with and affected by HIV/AIDS, and members of all 
populations vulnerable to and affected by the epidemic, but noting with concern that one 
third of countries still do not have laws protecting people living with HIV/AIDS from 
discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming further</i> the significant role played by the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS and its co-sponsor agencies in cooperation with relevant bodies 
of the United Nations system, including the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, national and international non-governmental 
organizations, in particular organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS, in promoting 
and protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, including fighting discrimination 
against people living with HIV/AIDS and in the full range of prevention, treatment, care 
and support activities, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are major obstacles to an 
effective HIV response and that discrimination on the basis of HIV or AIDS status, actual 
or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards and that the 
term &#8220;or other status&#8221; in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts 
should be interpreted as covering health status, including HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the report of the Secretary-General on the protection of human rights 
in the context of HIV and AIDS (A/HRC/10/47), in which the Secretary-General provides 
an overview of action taken by a number of Governments, specialized agencies and 
international and non-governmental organizations on the implementation of the Guidelines, 
and which addresses issues of technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the context of HIV, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all States, United Nations programmes and specialized agencies, 
and international and non-governmental organizations to continue to take all necessary 
steps to ensure the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights in the context of 
HIV/AIDS, as referred to in the Guidelines, as an essential part of efforts to achieve the 
goal of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls</i> <i>upon</i> all States to implement in full the Declaration of 
Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the General Assembly at its special session on 
HIV/AIDS, on 27 June 2001, and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the 
Assembly at its High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS on 2 June 2006; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Invites</i> States, United Nations organs, programmes and specialized agencies 
and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries, in </p>


<p>particular least developed countries and those in Africa, in their efforts to prevent the 
spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV/AIDS on 
the human rights of their people; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> all countries to eliminate HIV-specific restrictions on entry, stay 
and residence and ensure that people living with HIV are no longer excluded, detained or 
deported on the basis of their HIV status; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recalls</i> the commitment, as expressed by the General Assembly in its 
Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, to intensifying efforts to ensure that a wide range of 
prevention programmes that take into account local circumstances, ethics and cultural 
values is available in all countries, particularly the most affected countries, including 
information, education and communication, in languages most understood by communities 
and respectful of cultures, aimed at reducing risk-taking behaviours and encouraging 
responsible sexual behaviour, including abstinence and fidelity, expanded access to 
essential commodities, including male and female condoms and sterile injecting equipment, 
harm-reduction efforts related to drug use, expanded access to voluntary and confidential 
counselling and testing, safe blood supplies, and early and effective treatment of sexually 
transmitted infections; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges </i>all States to eliminate gender inequalities, gender-based abuse and 
violence, increase the capacity of women and girls, including those in prison or detention, 
to protect themselves from the risk of HIV transmission, principally through the provision 
of health care, and services, including sexual and reproductive health, and the provision of 
full access to comprehensive information and education, ensure that women can exercise 
their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their 
sexuality in order to increase their ability to protect themselves from HIV transmission, 
including their sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and 
violence, integrate the promotion and protection of reproductive rights, as understood in 
previous international commitments, such as the Programme of Action adopted by the 
International Conference on Population and Development in September 1994 and the 
Beijing Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the Fourth World Conference 
for Women in September 1995, as strong and robust components of their national strategies 
on HIV/AIDS, and take all necessary measures to improve legal access and protection for 
women and girls, and to create an enabling environment for the empowerment of women 
and strengthen their economic independence, and in this context, reiterates the importance 
of the role of men and boys in achieving gender equality; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> States to develop further and, where necessary, to establish 
coordinated, participatory, gender-sensitive, transparent and accountable national policies 
and programmes for the HIV response, and to translate those national policies at the district 
level into local action, in prisons or detentions, involving, in close cooperation with civil 
society and in all phases of development and implementation, non-governmental, faith- and 
community-based organizations, women&#8217;s organizations, advocacy groups and 
representatives of people living with HIV and other key populations affected by the 
epidemic; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to address as a priority the vulnerabilities faced by children 
affected by and living with HIV, including those who find themselves trapped in armed 
conflicts, providing support and rehabilitation to these children and their families, women 
and older persons, particularly in their role as caregivers, promoting child-oriented 
HIV/AIDS policies and programmes, including the issue of paediatric HIV services and 
drugs, and increased protection for children orphaned and affected by HIV/AIDS, and 
intensifying efforts to develop new treatments for children, and building, where needed, and 
supporting the social security systems that protect them; </p>


<p> 9. <i>Recalls </i>the obligations of State parties to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities of 2006 to provide persons with disabilities with the same range, 
quality and standard of free or affordable health care and programmes as provided to other 
people; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights of the World Trade Organization does not and should not prevent members 
from taking measures now and in the future to protect public health and, while reiterating 
the commitment to that Agreement, that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and 
implemented in a manner supportive of the right to protect public health and, in particular, 
to promote access to medicines for all including the production of generic antiretroviral 
drugs and other essential drugs for AIDS-related infections; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls </i>the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation 
and Intellectual Property of the World Health Assembly, and urges States, relevant 
international organizations and other relevant stakeholders to support actively its wide 
implementation, in particular in the context of HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> all States to apply measures and procedures to enforce 
intellectual property rights in a manner that avoids the creation of barriers to legitimate 
trade of medicines, and to provide for safeguards against the abuse of such measures and 
procedures; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges </i>all States to consider taking the steps necessary towards the 
elimination of criminal and other laws that are counterproductive to HIV prevention, 
treatment, care and support efforts, including laws directly mandating disclosure of HIV 
status or that violate the human rights of people living with HIV and members of key 
populations affected by the epidemic, and also urges States to consider the enactment of 
laws protecting these persons from discrimination in HIV prevention, treatment, care and 
support efforts; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Invites</i> the human rights treaty bodies, when considering reports submitted by 
States parties, to give particular attention to the protection of human rights in the context of 
HIV/AIDS, and invites States to include appropriate relevant information in the reports they 
submit to the relevant treaty bodies; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Invites </i>all special procedures, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, within their existing mandates, to contribute to the analysis of the human rights 
dimensions of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which particularly affects developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Encourages</i> all States to consider including appropriate information on 
human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS in the national report to be submitted to the 
Council in the framework of the universal periodic review mechanism; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to prepare an analytical study based on 
comments from Governments, United Nations organs, programmes and specialized 
agencies, particularly the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and its co-
sponsor agencies, in cooperation with relevant bodies of the United Nations system, 
including the Office of the High Commissioner and international and non-governmental 
organizations, on the steps taken to promote and implement programmes to address 
HIV/AIDS-related human rights, as referred to in the Guidelines, the Declaration of 
Commitment on HIV/AIDS of 2001, the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS of 2006 and 
the present resolution, in the context of efforts towards the goal of universal access to HIV 
prevention, treatment, care and support, and to submit, in consultation with interested 
parties, a progress report to the Council for consideration at its sixteenth session. </p>

the order of the review for the seventh, eighth and ninth sessions of the universal periodic

</p>
<p>210. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Council resolution 5/1, the 
Council considered the outcome of the reviews conducted during the fifth session of the

<p><b> A. Consideration of universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>211. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement 8/1, the section below 
contains a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, 
Member and observer States of the Council, as well as general comments made by other 
relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p><b>  Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p>212. The review of the Central African Republic was held on 4 May 2009 in conformity 
with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
national report submitted by the Central African Republic in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/CAF/1); the compilation 
prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/CAF/2); and the summary 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/CAF/3). 
</p>
<p>213. At its 14th meeting, on 23 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the Central African Republic (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>214. The outcome of the review on the Central African Republic comprises the report of 
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/2), the views of the 
Central African Republic concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its 
voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the 
plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive 
dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>215. The delegation of the Central African Republic welcomed the opportunity given to 
provide responses to the recommendations addressed to it. The delegation stressed the 
readiness of the State to ratify all relevant international instruments, provided that the 
political, economic, social and cultural conditions were in place, adding that implementing 
international instruments at the national level came up against the obstacles of mobilizing 
the necessary resources and disruptions in the process of depositing ratification instruments.  
</p>
<p>216. Regarding recommendations 20 to 24 (para. 75) on the abolition of the death 
penalty, the delegation stressed that the matter was still under discussion, indicating that the 
majority was opposed to such an abolition because of the high rate of crime. The delegation 
indicated which crimes were still punishable with the death penalty, and stressed that the 
last executions had taken place in 1981.  
</p>
<p>217. With regard to recommendation 35, the delegation indicated that all press offences 
had been abolished, while noting that journalists may be guilty of common law offences, 
such as defamation and press offences defined by the High Communication Council.  
</p>
<p>218. Regarding recommendation 34, the delegation indicated that judicial authorities had 
made an exhaustive assessment of the massive human rights and humanitarian law violations 
committed in the period 2002&#8211;2003. This had enabled the authorities to seize the 
International Criminal Court. A truth and reconciliation commission and a compensation 
fund had been adopted during the national dialogue of 2008. However, implementation of 
this recommendation was delayed owing to financial difficulties.  
</p>
<p>219. Regarding recommendations 25 and 33, the delegation underlined the fact that, in 
accordance with the Constitution, the judiciary was a branch power whose independence </p>


<p>was guaranteed by a number of management bodies. Despite some problems, such as 
arbitrary arrests, corruption and other irregularities, several projects were being undertaken 
with the financial assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  
</p>
<p>220. Regarding recommendations 1, 2, 4 and 26, the delegation underlined the fact that 
summary and extrajudicial executions and torture had never been institutionalized by the 
State. In that regard, a series of measures proved the willingness of the Government to 
remedy this problem. Additional measures were being envisaged, such as the establishment 
of a human rights day, the decentralization of the services of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, training of human rights stakeholders and the dissemination of texts.  
</p>
<p>221. With regard to recommendations 11, 16 to 19, 27 to 29 and 30, the delegation 
underscored the fact that the Central African Republic had ratified the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Female genital mutilations 
were not practiced on its territory and were prohibited by law. However, cultural beliefs 
and practices and the interests of practitioners made its full implementation challenging. 
The family code was being reviewed to ensure its compliance with international standards 
and with a view to either maintaining or abolishing polygamy. The delegation stressed that, 
owing to cultural concerns, the Central African Republic was not ready to sign a declaration 
on discrimination based on sexual orientation, adding that no law prohibited or authorized 
it. 
</p>
<p>222. On the recommendation to remove reference to the crime of witchcraft in the penal 
code, the delegation indicated that witchcraft was a reality in Central Africa. The 
Government envisaged training prison wardens who committed violence against women 
suspected of witchcraft and developing sensitization programmes to modify behaviours of 
the population and of the justice system. 
</p>
<p>223. With regard to recommendations 31 and 32 on defence and security forces, the 
delegation welcomed the forthcoming adoption of the code of military justice. Other 
positive measures had been taken in the areas of disarmament, demobilization and the 
reintegration of children, the demobilization of women soldiers, the training of former 
child-soldiers, the strengthening of peace and the elimination of supplementary police 
forces.  
</p>
<p>224. Regarding recommendations 6 to 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15, relating to, inter alia, standing 
invitations extended to special rapporteurs and independent experts, the delegation 
indicated that the Central African Republic acknowledged their relevance and took 
measures to facilitate the functioning of procedures and the respect of the United Nations 
calendar.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>225. Algeria stated that the Central African authorities had demonstrated their serious 
approach to the universal periodic review, as illustrated by their acceptance of 66 out of the 
99 recommendations addressed to them. Among them, the recommendation of Algeria 
relating to the implementation, with the assistance of OHCHR, of a training and awareness-
raising programme on international human rights and humanitarian law for members of the 
security forces, law enforcement officials and judicial officials was mentioned. Algeria 
welcomed the concrete measures taken to effectively promote and protect human rights, 
despite difficulties and constraints. Algeria was pleased with the Government&#8217;s readiness to 
implement priorities set out in the poverty reduction strategy paper for 2008&#8211;2010 to 
consolidate peace and stability, prevent conflicts and strengthen the macroeconomic 
framework and ongoing reforms. It called on the international community to provide the 
State with technical and financial assistance.  </p>


<p>226. The Russian Federation congratulated the Central African Republic for having 
accepted approximately two thirds of the recommendations and for having expressed its 
willingness to study others. It noted the voluntary commitments taken by the State, 
including the adoption of the national plan of action for the promotion and protection of 
human rights and a new criminal code. It wished the Central African Republic every 
success in realizing all accepted commitments and future progress in promoting and 
protecting human rights.  
</p>
<p>227. Egypt welcomed the comprehensive presentation by the Central African Republic. It 
stressed the fact that, despite many challenges and constraints, the Government had made 
efforts to promote human rights, which resulted in considerable progress and the attainment 
of stability since the adoption of the Constitution in 2004. It appreciated the responses 
given to recommendations and reiterated its call that the State continue its efforts to 
promote all universally agreed human rights and fundamental freedoms and to resist 
attempts to enforce any values or standards beyond the universally agreed ones. It also 
encouraged the State to implement its penal code in conformity with the universally agreed 
human rights standards, including the application of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>228. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya commended the Government for its efforts, including 
those regarding poverty reduction, economic reforms, ratification of most human rights 
international instruments and reforms aimed at guaranteeing women&#8217;s rights. It stressed that 
support from the international community was important to reach the Millennium 
Development Goals and to promote human rights. It considered that voluntary 
commitments made by the State during the presentation of its national report were highly 
important. 
</p>
<p>229. Morocco took note of the sincere commitment of the Central African Republic, 
which deserved the encouragement and appreciation of the Council. The number of 
recommendations enjoying the support of the Government illustrated its decision to go 
ahead in a transparent and objective manner, despite deadlines and budgetary difficulties. 
Morocco thanked the State for accepting its own recommendation regarding assistance by 
the international community to strengthen its capacity. Morocco highlighted the 
determination of the Government to respect its international human rights commitments and 
called on the international community to help it in identifying appropriate ways and means 
to ensure stability and development. 
</p>
<p>230. The United States of America welcomed the Central African Republic&#8217;s efforts to 
improve human rights. It remained concerned about the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of 
human rights abuses in the security forces, including the presidential guard. It strongly 
supported the recommendations to investigate abuses and hold those responsible of 
violations accountable, and to incorporate human rights training into the military training. It 
appreciated the State&#8217;s efforts in the area of child soldiers and to undertake reforms of the 
justice system, as well as its willingness to work with human rights organizations, and 
encouraged the State to continue allowing special procedures to visit the country. It 
welcomed the national plan of action on gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>231. Cuba thanked the Central African Republic for its responses and stressed that, 
during the review in May 2009, participants were able to acknowledge the efforts made by 
the Government to protect human rights despite major difficulties owing to an unjust 
international economic system and the global economic and financial crisis. Cuba added 
that the State was a developing country that had taken a number of measures to ensure the 
human rights of, in particular, vulnerable groups such as children and women, ethnic 
minorities and disabled people. These efforts were the sign of the Government&#8217;s strong 
commitment. Notwithstanding these efforts, the State still needed the assistance of the 
international community. Cuba urged all of those who truly worked in favour of human 
rights to provide their assistance.  </p>


<p>232. Djibouti commended the Central African Republic for its sincere commitment to 
respect the recommendations made, despite various constraints. Djibouti asked the 
international community to provide technical and financial assistance and to support the 
State in its efforts.  
</p>
<p>233. Cameroon noted a number of obstacles standing in the way of the full enjoyment of 
human rights in the Central African Republic, and the efforts made by the State to 
overcome them. It added that the State still needed the assistance of the international 
community, especially in the fight against poverty and illiteracy. Cameroon stood ready to 
provide the necessary support to the Central African Republic. It expressed the wish that 
the Government implement them as much and as quickly as possible. 
</p>
<p>234. The Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomed the State&#8217;s commitment to pursue 
its policy of national reconciliation and to implement decisions arising from the inclusive 
political dialogue, and its determination to rehabilitate the National Commission of Human 
Rights. It encouraged the State to continue its efforts to improve human rights and 
implement announced reforms. It commended the voluntary commitment to adopt a 
national plan of action for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>235. Gabon expressed its satisfaction on having been a member of the troika for the 
Central African Republic, which had demonstrated its interest in promoting and protecting 
human rights, despite financial difficulties and numerous political jolts. Gabon called on the 
international community to provide the State with the technical and financial support 
required to carry out its ambitious programme for human rights. 
</p>
<p>236. Chad noted with satisfaction that the Central African Republic had established a 
number of institutions aiming at consolidating democracy, such as the National Council of 
Mediation and the High Council of Communication. It also took note of efforts made to 
give visibility to the promotion and protection of human rights throughout its territory, to 
strengthen peace and national cohesion. Having highlighted the limited resources of the 
State, Chad suggested that the international community provide material and financial 
assistance to the State to implement the recommendations made.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>237. The International Federation of Action by Christians for the abolition of torture was 
concerned by a number of human rights violations and a recurrent policy of torture and ill-
treatment in police stations and in prisons, and by the impunity therein. It encouraged the 
State to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment and the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, and to abolish the 
death penalty. It considered that the State should take the opportunity offered by the review 
of its criminal code and code of criminal procedure to bring its legal system into conformity 
with international standards. It encouraged the State to address the issue of overcrowding in 
prisons and to ensure decent living conditions to detainees. 
</p>
<p>238. The International Lesbian and Gay Association and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal 
Network commended the State for supporting the joint statement on human rights, sexual 
orientation and gender identity delivered at the General Assembly. Referring to the 
Government&#8217;s response to recommendation 16 of paragraph 75 of the Working Group 
report, they urged the State to review its legislation to ensure that it did not discriminate on 
the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and to protect the rights of sexual 
minorities in accordance with international instruments. They welcomed the State&#8217;s support 
for recommendation 16 of paragraph 74, and encouraged the Government to include 
education about sexual orientation and gender identity issues in trainings for security forces 
and prison staff. </p>


<p>239. Interfaith International stated that it had reported many cases of torture, crime, rape, 
sexual violence, summary executions, destruction of public property and enforced 
disappearances in Bangui and in several regions following the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 2003. It noted 
that presidential and legislative elections in 2005 had brought peace to the country. It called 
on the authorities to consider recommendations 2, 25, 26, 33 and 34, the implementation of 
which was related to domestic legislative reforms that remained deficient. It called on the 
State to remedy such deficiency and to demonstrate its political will for building a 
democratic State. 
</p>
<p>240. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues welcomed the commitments 
of the Central African Republic. It noted that, since the second half of 2005, confrontation 
between the army and rebel groups had led to summary executions, sexual violence, torture 
and systematic looting, forcing 100,000 people to flee. While the State had undertaken to 
punish perpetrators of violations, a 2008 amnesty law showed that it scorned victims. The 
International Federation of Human Rights Leagues recalled the death of Wanfiyo 
Goungaye, who had received threats since the opening of the Bemba case before the 
International Criminal Court. It called upon the Council to monitor the respect by the 
Government of its commitments.  
</p>
<p>241. Human Rights Watch welcomed the steps taken by the Government to end abuses by 
the security forces. However, it was concerned about continuing attacks against civilians in 
the context of the Government&#8217;s counter-insurgency operations against rebels in the north, 
and about alleged abuses by paramilitary groups that were allied to the Government. It was 
crucial to reform the security sector and to ensure that members of the security forces 
underwent a thorough training and awareness programme in international humanitarian and 
human rights law. It considered that the State should fully implement the recommendations 
that it had accepted and ensure that all violations of human rights or humanitarian law are 
investigated and those responsible are prosecuted and punished. The fact that the incidence 
of attacks by Government security forces against civilians had fallen dramatically was 
testimony to the capacity of the Government to take concrete steps to halt violations. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>242. The delegation welcomed the acknowledgement of the international community of 
its need for assistance on the road to peace, which implied respect for human rights  
</p>
<p>243. The delegation wished to provide clarification in relation to some concerns that had 
been expressed, stressing that the Central African Republic had demonstrated its good faith. 
Since 2003, tangible efforts had been made to address the issue of summary executions and 
to ensure security. The delegation mentioned the situation in the east of the country, which 
was experiencing incursions by rebels from Uganda. The international community was 
fully aware of the situation as well as of the financial and military capacity of the State. The 
delegation insisted on the necessary assistance by the international community in this 
regard, while underlining that the Central African Republic should remain a State governed 
by the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>244. With reference to the Wanfiyo Goungaye case, the delegation noted that efforts had 
been made to address the situation.  
</p>
<p>245. The delegation added that amnesty was a legal means used to ensure national peace 
and reconciliation and not to strengthen impunity. Stakeholders were involved in the 
inclusive political dialogue, which had identified a number of measures to ensure peace.  
</p>
<p>246. Regarding the reform of the justice system, the strengthening of capacities and the 
need to address the issue of prison overcrowding, the delegation underlined the fact that this 
required financial resources and the assistance of the international community. The Central </p>


<p>African Republic was ready to implement all recommendations, but needed assistance in 
that regard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Monaco 
</b></p>
<p>247. The review of Monaco was held on 4 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Monaco in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MCO/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MCO/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MCO/3). 
</p>
<p>248. At its 14th meeting, on 23 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Monaco (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>249. The outcome of the review on Monaco comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/3), the views of Monaco concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and  
on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>250. The head of delegation and Permanent Representative of Monaco to the United 
Nations Office at Geneva thanked all delegations who made comments during the Working 
Group discussions held on 4 May. He assured that they had been duly taken into 
consideration by the Monegasque authorities. He underlined the fact that the preparation of 
the national report was complex and mobilized forces in the country. Owing to the size of 
the State, problems arising on the ground are small in both number and scale. Although 
each individual case would be tackled, the overall human rights situation was rather good 
thanks notably to freedom of expression guaranteed by a recently adopted legislation and to 
a properly proportioned and efficient judicial system. 
</p>
<p>251. The head of delegation recalled that Monaco had already accepted a number of 
recommendations during the review and committed to reply to others during the current 
session. Regarding the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, Monaco had signed it on 7 February 2007. However, in view of the fact that 
a legal reform, including a legislative reform, was required for its incorporation into 
Monegasque law, and although this process has already started, it would be long and 
complex. Therefore Monaco could not commit firmly to its ratification at present. 
</p>
<p>252. On the adhesion of Monaco to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the head 
of delegation recalled three important issues that currently prevented Monaco from 
adhering. Firstly, Monegasque legislation on trade union law is not compatible with ILO 
Convention No. 87 on three different issues. A legislative reform was envisaged to that end. 
Secondly, the employment priority system had to be seen in the light of ILO Conventions 
Nos. 100 and 111. The latter deals with national extraction, a concept distinct from 
citizenship, which therefore did not raise any problem in Monegasque law. However, the 
Monegasque employment priority could be regarded as discriminatory against foreigners 
living in Monaco. Although real, this issue was largely theoretic, as there were 8,000 
nationals and 45,000 working people in the country. Thirdly, the reporting obligations 
resulting from the various ILO legal instruments were too onerous for a State like Monaco, 
which would not be in a position to respect these obligations with diligence and efficiency. </p>


<p>Monaco recalled that the jurisprudence of the Monegasque tribunals relating to labour law 
demonstrated its respect for the principles elaborated by ILO. 
</p>
<p>253. Regarding the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, Monaco recalled that it had been a party to the Convention 
since 2005 and had shown its commitment to its ideals and values. The exercise of 
fundamental values guaranteed in the Constitution could not give rise to any difference of 
treatment; section III of the Constitution defined precisely all such fundamental rights and 
freedoms. Women benefited from the same economic and social advantages and rights as 
men. With regard to domestic violence, Monaco attached great importance to having a 
specific law on this issue, a draft law having been recently adopted and to be enacted soon. 
The Optional Protocol did not add any values and principles to the Convention, but its 
ratification would require a review of the legal apparatus beforehand. 
</p>
<p>254. Monaco recalled that it had signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court in 1998. It had undertaken a constitutional and legislative review, which had 
highlighted discrepancies between the Statute and Monegasque domestic law. This would 
therefore require the revision of both the Constitution and various laws, which constituted a 
large-scale reform process. 
</p>
<p>255. Regarding the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the head of delegation recalled that 
Monaco had only one jail, housing a yearly average of 30 detainees serving short-term 
sentences. No instances of mistreatment or poor living conditions had ever been recorded or 
even alleged. Therefore, the establishment of an independent visiting body did not seem 
appropriate for the situation of Monaco, which would therefore not commit to it. The 
definition of torture derived from the Constitution. Monaco adhered to the Convention 
against Torture and was party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(which also prohibited torture in article 7), the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the European Convention for the Prevention 
of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, all of which were 
integrated in domestic law. Therefore, although the law did not provide for a definition of 
torture, judges may directly refer to article 1 of the Convention against Torture; acts of 
torture were punished in the criminal code since 1967. Today, no instances of such 
treatment were considered by the tribunals and the criminal procedure code made explicit 
reference to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>256. With regard to a national human rights institution, Monaco had reopened a national 
discussion after the review by the Working Group, but was not of the view that such an 
institution was needed. Indeed, its responsibilities were currently performed by the human 
rights cell, the <i>M&#233;diateur</i> and existing rights to appeal. The <i>M&#233;diateur</i> was competent for 
disputes between individuals and the administration, and legal recourses were available for 
any individual or corporate body residing in Monaco, without distinction based on 
citizenship or wealth, and with the possibility of legal aid. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>257. Algeria<b> </b>commended the dialogue between Monaco and the Working Group. Algeria 
also commended Monaco for its interest in international cooperation, notably through the 
acceptance of the recommendation to increase its public aid to 0.7 per cent of its GNP by 
2015. Algeria thanked Monaco for its explanation regarding its recommendation on 
adhesion to ILO. Algeria commended the measures adopted by Monaco regarding the 
education, health and housing of migrant workers, but considered that the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families was the most comprehensive international instrument in this regard. Although </p>


<p>Monaco considered that this convention was not applicable to the situation in the country, 
the mere fact that Monaco may consider its ratification at a later stage could serve as an 
incentive for other countries. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>258. In a joint statement, the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-Europe), 
the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot 
Integratie von Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC Nederland commended Monaco for accepting the 
working group recommendation to use public awareness-raising campaigns to prevent 
discrimination, including on the grounds of sexual orientation. While developing such 
campaigns, which could support the 2005 law which punishes incitement to hatred and 
violence, they urged the Government to (a) take into account specific issues that related to 
each type of discrimination, and specifically on the basis of sexual orientation and gender 
identity; (b) identify the means by which such campaigns would be developed; and (c) 
include civil society stakeholders. In developing such campaigns, they suggested that 
Monaco use the Yogyakarta Principles, and encouraged it to endorse the joint statement on 
human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, delivered to the General Assembly on 
18 December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>259. Monaco reiterated its commitment to reach its objectives regarding public aid 
devoted to the most vulnerable persons in the poorest countries. Regarding the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, Monaco recalled that there were discrepancies between this convention and the 
national law, noting that the measures adopted by Monaco for migrant workers were more 
protective than in the convention insofar as labour law, social security and health were 
concerned. In its conclusion, the head of delegation recalled that the review of the human 
rights situation in Monaco should be done through a legal and pragmatic approach. In order 
to better assess the situation, Monaco extended a standing invitation to all special 
procedures and recommended a generalized acceptance of such invitations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Belize 
</b></p>
<p>260. The review of Belize was held on 5 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Belize in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/BLZ/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/BLZ/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/BLZ/3). 
</p>
<p>261. At its 14th meeting, on 23 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Belize (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>262. The outcome of the review on Belize comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/4), the views of Belize concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/12/4/Add.1/). </p>


<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>263. The representative from Belize and High Commissioner from the United Kingdom 
stated that Belize viewed human rights as fundamental to the country&#8217;s development, its 
democracy and the very way of life of its citizens. For that reason, Belize had accepted the 
vast majority of recommendations, and that further consultations at home were required on 
a mere 10 recommendations. Belize had approached the universal periodic review seriously 
and with the frankness and sense of commitment that was indispensable to making the 
review meaningful. Belize&#8217;s final position in respect of all the recommendations was 
contained in the addendum to the report (A/HRC/12/ 7/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>264. Belize would continue to take a measured approach to the consideration of and 
accession to new treaties, which would include a thorough review of obligations and 
reporting requirements to ensure meeting fully those obligations upon accession.  
</p>
<p>265. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize was in an advanced 
stage of discussions with OHCHR in Panama to organize a workshop in Belize aimed at 
building the capacity of Government and stakeholders in drafting reports for the treaty 
bodies.  
</p>
<p>266. The representative reiterated her call to OHCHR, and the international community 
generally, to assist small countries like Belize in improving their technical capacity to meet 
their reporting obligations. 
</p>
<p>267. Belize had noted that meeting reporting obligations was a shortcoming that plagued 
many small States. It may be necessary to rethink the existing process so that there could be 
more consolidation and streamlining of reports. 
</p>
<p>268. Similarly, the Government of Belize had made initial contact with OHCHR to 
express its interest in exploring the possibility of establishing a national human rights 
institution. Full consideration of all aspects of the establishment of such an institution had 
to be undertaken before a final decision could be taken. In the interim, however, a number 
of existing institutions, such as the National AIDS Commission, the National Women&#8217;s 
Commission, the National Council on Aging and the National Committee for Families and 
Children, were tasked with ensuring the implementation of the particular human rights 
treaty. The National Women&#8217;s Commission of Belize was presently engaging in a project 
aimed at building the capacity of Belizean women to become more active participants in 
local and national politics, a deficiency acknowledged in the national report. 
</p>
<p>269. These were only a few examples to demonstrate that Belize was already beginning 
to take action on a number of the recommendations, and would continue in this vein.  
</p>
<p>270. The fundamental human rights of all Belizeans were enshrined in the Constitution. 
The preparation of the national report for the universal periodic review provided an 
opportunity to assess Belize&#8217;s human rights framework, the effectiveness of its 
implementation programmes and the reach of its human rights promotion initiatives. The 
interactive dialogue provided constructive and insightful comments and recommendations. 
Belize had found the review process forthright, but was appreciative of its socio-economic 
context and resource constraints. It was the view of Belize that the universal periodic 
review had achieved its objective, demanding the self-reflection that is imperative for 
improvement. It had also provided the opportunity to reaffirm Belize&#8217;s unwavering 
commitment to human rights. </p>


<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>271. Algeria praised the acceptance by Belize of 36 recommendations of the 46 made. It 
welcomed Belize&#8217;s readiness to consider the possibility of establishing a national human 
rights institution in conformity with the Paris Principles. Algeria encouraged Belize to 
pursue its efforts in improving the situation of women in the country, and welcomed its 
willingness to promote their rights and to ensure their empowerment and advancement. It 
noted that the programmes adopted by Belize to eradicate poverty and to improve social 
indicators, including in health and education, testified to its commitment in this regard. 
</p>
<p>272. The Russian Federation expressed particular satisfaction at having been a member of 
the troika in charge of Belize&#8217;s review. The Russian Federation noted that Belize&#8217;s main 
priorities included fighting HIV/AIDS, ensuring the right to education and overcoming the 
high level of unemployment of youth, and assistance to people living with disabilities. It 
wished the country progress in implementing the various programmes in place to promote 
and protect human rights, and success in implementing the obligations assumed under the 
universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>273. Cuba appreciated the efforts and actions taken by Belize to implement the 
recommendations made during the Working Group dialogue, and noted the acceptance of 
the majority of them. Cuba commended Belize for the efforts made to implement its 
national action plan for children and youth in the areas of education, health, protection and 
HIV/AIDS, among other sectors. It recognized positively the establishment of a committee 
to combat trafficking in persons, and the measures taken to promote and protect the human 
rights of women. It encouraged Belize to continue on the path chosen. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>274. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed its appreciation of Belize&#8217;s clear 
responses to the recommendations. It welcomed Belize&#8217;s acceptance of recommendation 
12, by which the Government agreed to provide human rights training with regard to the 
protection of vulnerable groups, including persons of minority sexual orientation or gender 
identity, to law enforcement officials, judicial officers and all State officials. It regretted, 
however, that Belize was not yet ready to accept recommendations 9 and 28, which urged 
the Government to ensure that no one was subject to criminal sanctions for same-sex 
activity between consenting adults, and to ensure that there was no discrimination on these 
grounds. It referred to the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s ruling in the case of <i>Toonen v. 
Australia</i>, underlining the fact that laws criminalizing same-sex conduct violated the 
international rights to privacy and non-discrimination, and impeded measures to address 
HIV and AIDS by driving marginalized communities underground. It thus noted that this 
was inconsistent with Belize&#8217;s acceptance of recommendation 18.  
</p>
<p>275. Finally, the Network welcomed Belize&#8217;s support for the resolution of the 
Organization of American States on sexual orientation, gender identity and human rights 
adopted by consensus earlier in 2009. In keeping with that commitment, it urged the 
Government to bring the criminal code into conformity with its international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>276. The representative from Belize thanked the Council for its support and 
recommendations. She noted with great respect the constructive comments made during the 
interactive dialogue by the countries who had taken the floor. Belize looked forward to 
continuing this constructive dialogue in the interim years until the next review, as the 
discussions on human rights must continue between the sessions of the Council and 
between the cycles of the universal periodic review.  </p>


<p><b>  Congo 
</b></p>
<p>277. The review of the Congo was held on 6 May 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by the Congo in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/COG/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/COG/2 and Corr.1); and the summary 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/COG/3). 
</p>
<p>278. At its 15th meeting, on 23 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the Congo (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>279. The outcome of the review on the Congo comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/6), the views of the Congo concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>280. The Minister for Primary and Secondary Education in charge of literacy, Rosalie 
Kama Niamayoua, noted that democracy was a process affected by a wide range of 
constraints, including cultural difficulties inherent to each country and society. The Congo 
reaffirmed its commitment to the universal periodic review mechanism, and expressed its 
determination to live up to all its international obligations. Despite the obstacles faced in a 
number of areas, the Government would spare no effort to bring about a society in the 
Congo where people can live, think, express their views, move and act freely. 
</p>
<p>281. The delegation indicated that it was in this spirit that the 50 recommendations 
accepted by the Congo on 8 May 2009 were already being implemented. For this purpose, 
an inter-ministerial commission responsible for monitoring the implementation of the 
recommendations had been established.  
</p>
<p>282. The Congo had ratified the two protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. Moreover, it planned to ratify several other international conventions and the 
protocols thereto. The bill allowing the ratification of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as well as the 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance were being 
considered by the two chambers of Parliament. 
</p>
<p>283. The National Human Rights Commission was independent and had the authority to 
convene its own meetings (auto-court referral). The Government had taken due note of the 
recommendation to establish an institution in line with the Paris Principles. In that regard, 
the procedure of accreditation was under way and the Congo was working, inter alia, in the 
framework of the 2010 budgetary period to implement two basic commitments: to increase 
the funds allocated to the institution; and to speed up the rehabilitation of its headquarters.  
</p>
<p>284. The measures aimed at strengthening the protection of human rights and setting 
needs-related priorities were contained in the preliminary draft of the national action plan 
on human rights for the period 2009&#8211;2013. In order to achieve this goal, the Government of 
the Congo requested the support and assistance of the international community. With regard 
to the rights of the child, the Congo was bound by the provisions of the international 
conventions that it had already ratified.  </p>


<p>285. The Congo indicated that, under the article 136 of the Constitution and article 14 of 
the organic law concerning the Higher Council of the Magistracy, the judiciary was 
independent and that judges were only subjected to the law in exercising their functions. It 
confirmed that the authorities were concerned by the conditions of detention. Indeed, 
detention facilities were regularly inspected both by the Attorney General of the Republic 
and by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), as well as by non-
governmental organizations and the general directorate for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>286. The Congo noted that the establishment of a ministry in charge of the promotion and 
integration of women in development strategies responded to their claims. The delegation 
also informed the Council that, concerning violence against women, the Minister for Justice 
and the Minister for the Promotion of Women were working on a draft law to strengthen 
the provisions of article 309 and related articles of the penal code. The draft would be 
considered before the end of the current legislative term. 
</p>
<p>287. Concerning the recommendation related to the elaboration of a law on protection of 
and assistance to displaced persons, the Congo reaffirmed its firm commitment to set up a 
national legal framework in that regard, also taking into account the draft African 
convention on the situation of internally displaced persons, which provided for an effective 
normative framework for the protection of displaced persons and the assistance that they 
should benefit from. The Government would speed up the process of adoption of the draft 
law related to the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples currently being 
processed by national institutions. It also provided information on the work of the 
commission in charge of reviewing and drafting Congolese legal codes to remedy gaps and 
the lack of appropriate legislation in relation to certain human rights issues, which had 
started its work on 10 August 2009. Concerning the Congo&#8217;s reporting obligations to treaty 
bodies, the inter-ministerial committee established to that effect had convened twice in the 
past three months and the Congo would present its initial report to the Committee against 
Torture during its next October session. As it was aware of the necessity to incorporate 
human rights education in school curricula, the Congo requested the support of OHCHR 
and other partners to assist the country in finalizing the programmes and text books 
currently being developed at the Institut national de recherche et d&#8217;actions p&#233;dagogiques. 
</p>
<p>288. The Congo expressed the will that the conclusions of the Working Group be 
reflected comprehensively and faithfully in the report submitted for adoption by the 
Council. According to the Congo, the question raised by recommendation 25 in the report 
had already been taken covered by recommendations 23 and 24. Therefore, the Permanent 
Mission of the Congo in Geneva had, in a note dated 22 May 2009, contacted the secretariat 
of the Council asking for that recommendation to be withdrawn. As it was a prerogative of 
the plenary, the Minister asked that this fact be reflected in the report. The Minister 
indicated that the Congo would continue to rely on the valuable support of OHCHR and 
other international institutions, as well as on the wide-ranging support of its partners, so 
that it could live up to its commitment in the area of the promotion and protection of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>289. Algeria<b> </b>commended the Congo for having accepted more than 90 per cent of the 
recommendations, which showed its cooperative and constructive attitude towards the 
universal periodic review. It welcomed its acceptance of the recommendation made by 
Algeria on the establishment of a national institution for the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and stressed the important need that OHCHR provide technical assistance in 
this respect. Algeria also welcomed the special attention given to the protection and </p>


<p>exercise of the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and children, particularly with 
regard to access for children to education and the participation of women in the 
development of the country. Algeria stressed the importance of the support from United 
Nations programmes, specialized institutions and agencies to assist the Congo in this area.  
</p>
<p>290. The Russian Federation pointed out that the Congo had already agreed to 
approximately 85 per cent of the recommendations received. It wished the Congo success 
in its implementation of its commitments during the universal periodic review process and 
of its human rights programmes. 
</p>
<p>291. Morocco<b> </b>commended the Congo for having accepted a large number of 
recommendations in order to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, despite the many 
constraints, including economic ones. It also commended the Congolese authorities for 
having repeatedly stressed their support for the rights of vulnerable groups, in particular 
women and children. Morocco reaffirmed its support for the Government of the Congo in 
its constant efforts in the area of human rights.  
</p>
<p>292. The United States of America welcomed the efforts made to provide free treatment 
for those living with HIV/AIDS and the Congo&#8217;s willingness to allow independent 
monitoring of its prisons, also to ensure separation of women, men and children in 
detention centres. It called upon the Congo to increase its efforts to prosecute human 
trafficking offenders and provide assistance to victims of trafficking. It strongly supported 
the Working Group recommendations to encourage the participation of civil society during 
election cycles, increase the independence and capacity of the national human rights 
commission, and consider providing property rights to women. It appreciated the decision 
to allow the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of indigenous people to visit the country in 2010.  
</p>
<p>293. Djibouti congratulated Congo&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic review. The 
review process had helped identify a number of challenges the Government had committed 
to address. In this respect, Djibouti asked the Government to do its utmost to implement the 
recommendations and called on the international community to provide support.  
</p>
<p>294. Burkina Faso commended the Congo for its efforts, in particular the accession to a 
number of international human rights instruments and the acceptance of the majority of the 
recommendations put forward during the universal periodic review process. Burkina Faso 
congratulated the Congo on the action-oriented measures to implement these 
recommendations. It reaffirmed its solidarity with the Congo in its efforts to improve the 
human rights situation, and supported its call for assistance in this regard.  
</p>
<p>295. Egypt noted with appreciation the responses provided by the Government of the 
Congo to the recommendations made during its review. The Congo&#8217;s acceptance of most of 
the recommendations made reflected its commitment to human rights, especially in the 
areas of children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rights, health and education. Egypt reiterated its request to 
the Congo to maintain its efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms with the assistance of the international community.  
</p>
<p>296. Cameroon noted that the information provided by the Congo on its various efforts to 
protect the rights of persons in the country and related shortcomings had given rise to a 
number of recommendations during the Working Group dialogue. Cameroon extended full 
support to the Congo and invited it to implement the various recommendations as much as 
possible.  
</p>
<p>297. Cuba noted that the Congo&#8217;s acceptance of a number of recommendations showed 
its commitment to human rights. It also noted that the review in the Working Group 
dialogue highlighted the Congo&#8217;s major efforts in a number of areas, including some 
mentioned by Cuba, such as prevention of HIV/AIDS and the treatment extended to </p>


<p>affected persons. Cuba underscored the Congo&#8217;s efforts in the area of education, 
notwithstanding the clear obstacles arising for this underdeveloped country, which was yet 
another victim of the current unfair international economic order. Cuba launched an appeal 
for the strengthening of cooperation with the Congo, including concrete actions such as 
external debt relief and a commitment to official development assistance, which could 
provide the Congo with the resources necessary to face challenges. 
</p>
<p>298. The Democratic Republic of the Congo congratulated the Congo for having 
launched, on 10 August 2009, the work of the Commission and the Division of Legal Code 
in order to amend the human rights legislation. Regarding the recommendation made by the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo on the elaboration of national legislation for the 
protection and assistance of internally displaced persons, it thanked the Congo for the 
information provided in this regard and commended the country for the role played in the 
area of human rights and the efforts made to bring their commission into line with the Paris 
Principles. It also called upon the High Commissioner to provide the Congo with the 
assistance it had requested.  
</p>
<p>299. Chad<b> </b>noted with satisfaction that the Congo was party to a number of international 
instruments on human rights and had begun applying a number of recommendations. Chad 
made an appeal to the international community to provide material and financial assistance 
to the Congo so as to enable it to rise to the challenge. 
</p>
<p>300. Gabon welcomed the Congo&#8217;s establishment of a think-tank to review the various 
recommendations put forward. It also noted that the national human rights institution of the 
Congo was in conformity with the Paris Principles. It also made reference to the multiple 
political military crises that had hit the Congo and slowed down the progress in the area of 
respect for human rights. It commended the Congo for its commitments and efforts towards 
peace in the country.  
</p>
<p>301. The Central African Republic expressed its satisfaction at the Congo&#8217;s achievements 
and the recent stability. It added that these efforts should continue with the support of the 
international community, which it urged to provide such support.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>302. The International Federation of ACAT (Action by Christians for the Abolition of 
Torture FIACAT) commended the Congo for having accepted many recommendations 
calling for the abolition of the death penalty. FIACAT and ACAT the Congo encouraged 
the Congo to take measures to deal with overcrowded prisons where men, women and 
children live together and lack food. They encouraged the Congo to provide access to non-
governmental organizations working in the area of human rights. They also welcomed the 
Congo&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendation on the respect of the provisions of the criminal 
code regarding torture. The organizations expressed the hope that a revision commission, 
which would bring Congolese codes in line with international standards, would be 
established. They remained concerned about the continued practice of torture, and arbitrary 
and illegal detention in the Congo, and the absence of a standing invitation to all special 
procedures of the Council. 
</p>
<p>303. In a joint statement, the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-Europe) 
and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network<b> </b>referred to the recommendations contained in 
paragraphs 23, 27 and 59 of the Working Group report on the Congo, which urged the 
Government to repeal provisions in the penal code to decriminalize same-sex sexual 
activity between consenting adults. Reference was also made to the lack of legislation to 
protect lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people, with a negative impact on 
important HIV-prevention work.  </p>


<p>304. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and its member 
organization, the Congolese Observatory of Human Rights, commended the Congo for the 
commitments made during the universal periodic review. Nonetheless, it noted that some 
recommendations had not been accepted, while others that were accepted had not yet been 
put into effect. The Federation encouraged the Congolese authorities to bring into national 
law the additional protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the 
Rights of Women, especially regarding property and the sharing and transmitting of 
heritage of land and access to education. Both bodies called upon the Government to bring 
to an end the common practice of arbitrary detention and arrests, torture and deplorable 
conditions in prisons in police stations, and to punish the perpetrators. The Federation noted 
that the commitment of holding peaceful and free presidential elections in 2009 had already 
been ignored. They both also regretted that no delegation had recommended that the Congo 
better protect human rights defenders. They also regretted that the Congolese authorities 
had refused to implement the recommendations relating to depenalizing homosexuality.  
</p>
<p>305. Interfaith International noted that, for a number of years, the village communities of 
Djeno, Bondi, Tchicanou in the county of Kouilou had been complaining about the effects 
on their land, wild life and health of the pollution arising from the exploitative activities of 
multinational oil companies. A number of appeals had been made by environmental 
organizations and civil society, but no initiative had been taken to implement article 36 of 
the Constitution providing for compensation. Interfaith International urged the Government 
to find a solution and to protect the human rights of indigenous peoples, and to fight 
corruption.  
</p>
<p>306. Comit&#233; pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte Africaine des droits de l&#8217;homme 
et des peuples commended the Congo for the various mechanisms set up for better legal 
protection of women, children, indigenous peoples, displaced people, people affected by 
HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and vulnerable persons victims of exploitation and 
violence. The Congo had taken up challenges such as fighting poverty, strengthening the 
judiciary system, promoting intercommunity dialogue and disarmament, reinsertion, 
demobilization, ratification of a number of international instruments and needed the support 
of the international community in that regard.  
</p>
<p>307. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des Grands 
Lacs referred to a number of specific actions taken by the Government for national 
reconciliation after the civil war, as well as for the promotion and respect for human rights, 
despite the material, human and financial problems in the country. It called upon the 
international community to support the initiatives of the Congo mentioned in the Working 
Group report in the areas of rule of law, democracy and the full enjoyment of economic and 
social rights. 
</p>
<p>308. Action Canada for Population and Development and the Polish Federation for 
Women and Family Planning indicated that the Government of the Congo should, inter alia, 
ensure that the legal protection of women and children victims of violence becomes 
effective in rural areas; in conformity with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women, adopt the legislation necessary to prohibit the practice of 
sexual violence to which Congolese women have been exposed; continue to invest in the 
consultation of obstetrics and information provided by qualified midwives; continue efforts 
to protect the rights of people affected by HIV/AIDS; and continue efforts in favour of 
sexual equality and the health of mothers and girls.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>309. The representative stated that the presidential elections held in July 2009 were in 
conformity with the rule of law and international practice. The Congo thanked all those 
who supported it, and all those who had urged the adoption of the report. The Government </p>


<p>would keep its promises and do its best to ensure the implementation of all 
recommendations it had accepted. 
</p>
<p><b>  Malta 
</b></p>
<p>310. The review of Malta was held on 6 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Malta in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MLT/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MLT/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MLT/3). 
</p>
<p>311. At its 15th meeting, on 23 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Malta (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>312. The outcome of the review on Malta comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/7), the views of Malta concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/12/7/Add.1/Rev.2). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>313. The delegation of Malta told the plenary that the Maltese authorities felt the 
country&#8217;s review was a challenging and rewarding experience, offering a genuine 
opportunity for States to seriously examine their human rights processes in a spirit of 
mutual understanding and cooperation. It reiterated Malta&#8217;s commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>314. Noting that the present cycle of the universal periodic review process was an 
important first step to be taken forward by continued work in the following years, the 
delegation stressed Malta&#8217;s commitment to engaging in the process to the greatest extent 
possible. It expressed its appreciation for all the actors who had made Malta&#8217;s review 
possible. 
</p>
<p>315. The delegation stated that Malta&#8217;s detailed response to the recommendations made 
in the course of the Working Group dialogue was contained in the addendum to its Working 
Group report. Malta could accept most of the 47 recommendations in part or in full, stating 
that a number of them urged continuation and reinforcement of current practices and 
legislation. Other recommendations included suggestions regarding measures that were 
already in place in Malta or in the process of implementation. Malta explained what 
currently existed, and measures it would continue to take, in the addendum. 
</p>
<p>316. With specific reference to the recommendations on international treaties, Malta 
indicated that it would ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and that it would 
withdraw the declaration made upon the signing of the Optional Protocol on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict. Malta would also ratify the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It would not, however, accede to the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families nor would it ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women or the Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. </p>


<p>317. Malta would also retain its reservations to articles 11 and 16 of the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The delegation reiterated 
Malta&#8217;s position that the right to life was an inherent right of every human being, including 
the unborn child from its conception. It would thus retain existing national legislation on 
abortion. On the question of legislating to recognize the relationship between two partners 
irrespective of their sex, Malta believed that this was a matter of national competence. 
</p>
<p>318. Regarding the issue of irregular migration, it noted a number of recommendations on 
Malta&#8217;s policies and practices in this area. It expressed appreciation for the recognition by 
many delegations of the challenges arising for Malta from an unmanageable influx of 
illegal immigrants. The Government of Malta explained in the addendum that it was 
committed to resolving any issues that arose in this matter with full respect for the rights 
and dignity of the individuals concerned. It reiterated its commitment to respecting all its 
international obligations in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>319. Algeria welcomed Malta&#8217;s candour and transparency during its review. It noted that, 
in recent years, Malta had experienced a major influx of illegal immigrants and welcomed 
its policy in that respect, particularly in guaranteeing the equitable, just and humane 
treatment of migrants and the protection of their human rights. It expressed its wish to see 
Malta considering, in the long-term, the possibility of acceding to the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. It noted Malta&#8217;s decision not to establish a separate national human rights 
institution, given that there were several human rights institutions responsible for specific 
areas, such as children, equal opportunities and disabled persons. Algeria was encouraged 
by the measures and efforts already under way to promote the rights of vulnerable groups, 
especially children and women, and by the increased participation of women in the labour 
market.  
</p>
<p>320. The United States of America recognized the many challenges Malta faced in 
dealing with a large number of seaborne irregular migrants, given its small size and large 
area of responsibility. It welcomed Malta&#8217;s commitment to its international obligations with 
respect to refugees and persons who qualify for humanitarian protection. It commended the 
decision to establish a detention service with suitably trained civilians as managers to help 
address the humanitarian needs of irregular migrants and work with non-governmental 
organizations to facilitate the provision of legal services. It welcomed Malta&#8217;s cooperation 
with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Recognizing that irregular 
migrants from African countries arriving en route to Italy and elsewhere may be vulnerable 
to trafficking, it urged Malta to increase its efforts to eradicate trafficking in persons, 
including in taking steps to protect victims and through the vigorous prosecution of 
traffickers. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>321. In a joint statement with the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, Federatie van 
Netherlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie van Homoseksualiteit COC Nederland, the 
International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-Europe) called for further measures to 
fight discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. It called for a 
policy ensuring that same-sex couples enjoy equal rights and obligations as opposite-sex 
couples; effective access to health advisory services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people; and legislation allowing the change of legal status of transgender 
persons following Maltese court decisions and the European Convention. Citing the 
Government&#8217;s indication that it would include sexual orientation and gender identity in </p>


<p>human rights awareness-raising campaigns, ILGA-Europe asked about the means by which 
this would be done, and called for inclusion of civil society in the development, execution 
and evaluation of such campaigns. Commending Malta&#8217;s policy on sexual health and 
education, it recommended that sexual orientation and gender identity be explicitly 
included and that civil society be involved. 
</p>
<p>322. Interfaith International indicated that Malta was a transit crossroads for potential 
immigrants to other countries in the European Union. It recalled that Argentina and Sweden 
had called upon Malta to bring its legislation concerning the detention of migrants into line 
with international standards. Interfaith International stated that Maltese law systematically 
placed migrants, most of whom were asylum-seekers, into detention centres for a maximum 
period of 18 months in congested and unhygienic conditions. It recommended that 
appropriate measures be taken to deal with the distress of these vulnerable people. 
</p>
<p>323. The International Commission of Jurists welcomed in particular the 
recommendations regarding administrative detention of migrants and asylum-seekers and 
access to justice and procedural safeguards for detained migrants. While welcoming 
Malta&#8217;s timely response to the recommendations, it regretted its rejection of 
recommendation 40 on the legal consequences of the use of the term &#8220;prohibited migrants&#8221;, 
in particular, administrative detention. The Commission recalled that, while Malta, because 
of its geographical position, faced large-scale migration, it must respect its international 
obligations in its migration policy, particularly those arising from international human 
rights and refugee law. It expressed concern at the automatic resort to administrative 
detention of asylum-seekers and migrants and at the excessive length of such detention, 
even if entry was in contravention of domestic law. It urged the revision of Maltese 
legislation and policy on the detention of migrants and asylum-seekers in accordance with 
the principle of proportionality. It recommended that Malta ensure that such detention was 
only resorted to where necessary, subject to a clear legal maximum duration and regular 
judicial review. It urged for measures alternative to detention to be provided for in primary 
legislation, and that procedural safeguards be effectively guaranteed to asylum-seekers and 
all other migrants. In particular, it recommended that Malta provide free legal assistance, 
where necessary, to those subject to administrative detention or other measures, regardless 
of their status as asylum-seekers and in appeal and review proceedings. The Commission 
urged Malta to improve conditions in its detention centres in accordance with the 
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Body of Principles for the 
Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>324. The delegation of Malta thanked the speakers for their additional comments and 
reiterated the State&#8217;s commitment to taking their views under serious consideration and to 
continue working to fulfil Malta&#8217;s obligations to the greatest extent possible. 
</p>
<p>325. Citing comments relating to the situation of migrants, the delegation reiterated that 
Malta was committed to dealing with the issues, bearing in mind the fullest respect for the 
rights and dignity of the individuals concerned. Malta was committed to ensuring the 
fulfilment of its international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>  New Zealand 
</b></p>
<p>326. The review of New Zealand was held on 7 May 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national 
report submitted by New Zealand in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/NZL/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in </p>


<p>accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/NZL/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/NZL/3). 
</p>
<p>327. At its 16th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on New Zealand (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>328. The outcome of the review on New Zealand comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/8), the views of New Zealand 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/12/8/Add.1 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>329. The delegation recalled that New Zealand strongly supported the introduction of the 
universal periodic review, which had lived up to its expectations. It also recalled that New 
Zealand&#8217;s national report had been the product of an open and consultative process, 
involving many groups both inside and outside Government.  
</p>
<p>330. The delegation indicated that New Zealand had received 64 recommendations, and 
had given serious consideration to all of them. A response to all the recommendations had 
been lodged with the Council secretariat and published on the Council&#8217;s website. Of the 64 
recommendations, New Zealand had accepted 33 unreservedly. An additional 12 had been 
agreed to with further discussion. A qualified response had been given to 11 
recommendations, and only 8 had been rejected.  
</p>
<p>331. The delegation highlighted some of the significant features of New Zealand&#8217;s 
responses, indicating that many of the recommendations focused on challenging areas that 
the Government itself recognized as requiring further attention. These included the social 
disparities between non-Maori and Maori; the status of the Treaty of Waitangi in domestic 
legislation; family violence; equality of opportunity; overrepresentation of Maori in the 
criminal justice system; and ratification of human rights treaties to which New Zealand was 
not party. 
</p>
<p>332. The delegation explained that Maori were integral to the national identity of New 
Zealand and represented about 15 per cent of the population. It acknowledged that there 
was a number of areas where improvements were needed, stressing that a wide range of 
measures to reduce social inequalities between Maori and non-Maori was under way. 
</p>
<p>333. Several countries had recommended that New Zealand give its support to the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In May 2009, the delegation had 
explained that New Zealand would like to move to support the Declaration, provided that it 
could protect its unique and advanced domestic framework for the resolution of issues 
related to indigenous rights. The treaty settlement process recognized the interests of Maori 
in relation to land and natural resources, and provided redress where these interests had 
been abrogated. New Zealand had some of the most extensive consultation mechanisms in 
the world and the historical treaty settlements process was an unparalleled system of 
redress, accepted by both Maori and non-Maori. The delegation indicated that New 
Zealand&#8217;s position on the Declaration was still under active consideration by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>334. New Zealand recognized the concerns raised about the Foreshore and Seabed Act 
2004, explaining that an expert and independent ministerial review panel had been 
established in March 2009 to review whether the Act effectively recognized and provided 
for customary and public interests in the coastal marine area. After an extensive </p>


<p>consultation process, the panel had reported to the Attorney-General and the Government 
was currently considering how to respond to its recommendations. 
</p>
<p>335. The delegation indicated that New Zealand had not accepted the recommendation to 
ratify the Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
ILO Convention No. 169 or the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but that it had undertaken to ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. New Zealand was also examining which legislative 
reforms would be required to move towards ratifying the Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and was committed to working progressively 
towards a withdrawal of its few remaining reservations to human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>336. As stressed by the delegation, a number of recommendations called for New Zealand 
to ensure that its legislation and policies gave effect to its human rights obligations. Noting 
that some rights were given effect in New Zealand through a variety of appropriate 
measures, the delegation stated that this was a subject under regular review, and that it 
accepted these recommendations.  
</p>
<p>337. Regarding the treaty of Waitangi, the delegation indicated that public discussion of 
its status certainly would continue, and that entrenchment as a constitutional norm was a 
possible outcome of that discussion, but not the only one.  
</p>
<p>338. The delegation stressed that a new broad-based approach had been developed to 
address the individual, family, community and justice sector factors that contributed to 
offending and victimization. Mindful of the overrepresentation of Maori in the criminal 
justice system as both offenders and victims, New Zealand was committed to addressing 
these factors in a concerted way. In the coming months, the Government would consider a 
number of priorities to address this issue. 
</p>
<p>339. The Child and Family Protection Bill had been introduced into Parliament in August 
2009, introducing changes to ensure that courts can act to protect children and families 
from all forms of violence and abuse. The bill also contained the last legislative amendment 
required for New Zealand to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>340. To conclude, the delegation stressed that New Zealand had learned from its 
involvement in the universal periodic review, with a reinforcement of contacts with the 
wide human rights constituency and a greater understanding of New Zealand&#8217;s own human 
rights situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>341.  While welcoming the endorsement by New Zealand of more than 90 per cent of the 
recommendations, Algeria<b> </b>regretted that its own recommendation to examine the possibility 
of adhering to the International Convention on the protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families had not been accepted. Algeria would have 
appreciated the endorsement by New Zealand of the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference. Algeria welcomed New Zealand&#8217;s agreement to consider<b> </b>the 
recommendations to take further measures to ensure full and consistent protection of human 
rights in domestic law and policies, and to take action to provide constitutional protection to 
national and international human rights instruments and standards. Algeria would have 
appreciated the acceptance of its recommendation to bring legislation into line with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  </p>


<p>342. Malaysia thanked New Zealand for its written responses to the recommendations 
and welcomed the acceptance by New Zealand of a number of recommendations, including 
those relating to efforts aimed at eradicating all form of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and Malaysia&#8217;s recommendation relating to trafficking 
in women and children and exploitation of women and girls in prostitution. Malaysia 
believed that New Zealand&#8217;s preparedness to address some of the issues related to 
intercultural and inter-faith relations would contribute positively to its effort in further 
instilling a culture of tolerance, inter-ethnic and intercultural understanding in the country. 
Malaysia hoped that the Government would fully implement the recommendations and 
outcomes of the review. 
</p>
<p>343. Sweden welcomed New Zealand&#8217;s advanced responses to the recommendations and 
its support of Sweden&#8217;s recommendation regarding violence against women. Sweden noted 
that it was unclear to what extent the Government had committed itself to recommendations 
that were only partially agreed to. Regarding the overrepresentation of Maori and Pacific 
persons in the criminal justice system, Sweden regretted that New Zealand could only agree 
in part to Sweden&#8217;s recommendations, and recommended continuing efforts to address this 
issue. Sweden expressed the hope that New Zealand would continue working on those 
problems and include all factors that could explain why certain groups were 
overrepresented.  
</p>
<p>344. The Islamic Republic of Iran regretted that some recommendations, including the 
ones put forward by Iran, had not been accepted. It reiterated that there were still some 
concerns about the overall situation of human rights in New Zealand, in particular 
regarding the situation of Maori and Asian and Pacific minorities. It encouraged New 
Zealand to bring its domestic legislation, policies and practices into full compliance with 
international law and to take serious efforts to further improve the rights of minorities and 
decrease disparities between Maori and non-Maori. Noting the poorly defined terms of the 
counter-terrorism legislation, it recommended that New Zealand ratify the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families and to review its position on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>345. The United States of America commended New Zealand for accepting, in whole or 
in part, most of the recommendations. It noted New Zealand&#8217;s intention to consider 
accession to additional human rights instruments, and its determination to protect the rights 
of minorities and indigenous persons. It appreciated New Zealand&#8217;s commitment to 
combating human trafficking, and welcomed the acceptance of the recommendation to 
record and document cases of trafficking in women and children as well as of the 
exploitation of migrant women and girls in prostitution, and to share information on 
trafficking cases as appropriate within the region. The United States strongly urged New 
Zealand to consider including domestic trafficking crimes within the scope of its anti-
trafficking law.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>346. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission appreciated the State&#8217;s active 
engagement with the universal periodic review. It emphasized the importance of action in 
seven priority areas identified by the Government, including implementation of the 
International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; support for the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; more systematic incorporation of 
international human rights obligations, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, 
into domestic legislation, policies and practices; further consideration of the status of the 
treaty of Waitangi; and action on all forms of unlawful discrimination and socio-economic 
disparities. It indicated that stronger responses to recommendations on gender equality and 
the pay gap would have been welcomed.  </p>


<p>347. The Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom urged New Zealand to 
ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families, ILO Convention No. 169 concerning the Protection and 
Integration of Indigenous and Tribal and Semi-Tribal Populations in Independent 
Countries, and the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, and to announce full support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. It reiterated the recommendations urging New Zealand to begin a process of 
constitutional change to give full effect to the treaty of Waitangi. It urged New Zealand to 
develop alternatives to imprisonment, to reconsider the pending legislation which would 
lower the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years, to clarify its response to the recent 
public referendum on section 59 of the Crimes Act, to work towards full gender pay equity 
and gender equality in decision-making and to increase efforts to reduce violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>348. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed New Zealand&#8217;s articulation of 
the significant steps to treat lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people with equal 
dignity and respect and to provide equal recognition to same-sex partners. It urged the 
Government to address remaining areas of inequality, such as in the area of parenting. It 
commended the 2008 report of the New Zealand Human Rights Commission on 
discrimination experienced by transgender people, and asked the Government for an update 
on its position. It recommended including gender identity and expression in human rights 
legislation and that the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human 
Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity be applied as a guide, that 
the Government support the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and that it 
enhance the constitutional status of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. 
</p>
<p>349. The Indigenous World Association appreciated the Government&#8217;s constructive 
approach to the universal periodic review process, marking a positive change from its 
previous approach of discrediting much international human rights oversight. It expressed 
concern at the rejection of recommendations to ratify international treaties. It strongly 
recommended support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and robust 
constitutional protection of the rights in the treaty of Waitangi and the Declaration, 
including its domestic treaty settlements policy. It urged the Council to continue to apply 
pressure to New Zealand to meet its treaty obligations and act on the recommendations of 
special procedures relating to Maori. 
</p>
<p>350. Amnesty International called for clear and unambiguous support for the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and for the Government to reflect its provisions in 
domestic legislation. It welcomed New Zealand&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations relating 
to the Foreshore and Seabed Act. It recommended ensuring that new legislation fully 
protects the human rights of Maori and enshrines the principles of recognition of customary 
rights, due process, good faith and compensation. It called for an amendment to the 
Corrections Act of 2004 to require that conditions in privatized prisons comply with the 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, for the ratification 
of the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and for 
greater recognition of economic, social and cultural rights in domestic legislation. It 
welcomed the commitment to ensure regular consultation with civil society in the follow-up 
to the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>351. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims welcomed New Zealand&#8217;s 
signing of human rights treaties and efforts to improve the justice system. It called on the 
Government to address the conditions of indigenous people and minorities, and to 
concentrate on the layers of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of 
intolerance against migrants and migrant workers. It cited social inequalities, including 
gender inequalities, in job opportunities and in aspects of the criminal prosecution system. </p>


<p>It called on the Government to strengthen the national legislative framework on the 
promotion of human rights and in combating domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>352. The Indian Council of South America commended New Zealand on its constructive 
participation in the universal periodic review, but added that any attempt to reduce or 
negate international obligations was unacceptable. Reduction or negation of already 
accepted international obligations with regard to indigenous peoples through politicization 
and selective application and implementation of rights was certainly not a best practice. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>353. The delegation of New Zealand indicated that most responses to issues raised had 
been provided in its introductory statement, in the national report, as well as the reports of 
the Working Group (A/HRC/12/8 and Add.1 and Corr. 1). It wished, however, to provide 
some additional responses. 
</p>
<p>354. New Zealand had not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, but had already in place a 
range of laws protecting all workers, including migrant workers, on the basis of equality. 
</p>
<p>355. New Zealand had not endorsed the outcome of the Durban Review Conference 
because it did not participate in that conference. 
</p>
<p>356. Regarding the assessment made by a participant that anti-terrorism legislation 
contained poorly defined terms, New Zealand stressed that the definition set out in the 
counter-terrorism legislation was extraordinarily clear and specific. 
</p>
<p>357. New Zealand had adopted a definition of trafficking that was in accordance with 
international law. 
</p>
<p>358. Violence against women and the overrepresentation of Maori and Pacific Islanders 
in the criminal justice system were a matter of great concern to New Zealand, and a number 
of processes were under way to improve the situation. 
</p>
<p>359. The delegation concluded by thanking all participants in the review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>360. The review of Afghanistan was held on 7 May 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Afghanistan in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 
15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/AFG/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/AFG/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/AFG/3). 
</p>
<p>361. At its 16th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Afghanistan (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>362. The outcome of the review on Afghanistan comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/9), the views of Afghanistan 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/12/9/Add.1). </p>


<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>363. The Deputy Minister for Justice of Afghanistan, Dr. Mohammad Qasim Hashimzai, 
noted that the universal periodic review had been a productive experience for Afghanistan. 
It supported most of the recommendations made during the interactive dialogue, and 
various ministries and institutions had already taken a number of initiatives, which was 
indicative of the firm political will of the Government to consolidate and improve human 
rights in the country. Afghanistan had also agreed to consider further a number of other 
recommendations. Its responses, after consulting with relevant ministries and departments, 
are contained in the addendum to the report of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>364. Measures taken by Afghanistan since May 2009 included Parliament&#8217;s current 
review of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the ratification of ILO 
Conventions Nos. 144 and 182, and the Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions; and the completion of the initial report under the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. Serious attention to the report&#8217;s findings and recommendations would facilitate 
securing better conditions for children&#8217;s rights in Afghanistan. Work had begun in early 
August 2009 to prepare the initial report for the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women for planned completion by July 2010. The report would also 
provide a better understanding of the condition of women and their needs in Afghanistan 
and help in better addressing the issue of women&#8217;s rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>365. Afghanistan needed to take steps for the review and revision of 700 laws currently in 
force to ensure that they are in keeping with the Constitution and international agreements 
to which it is a signatory.  
</p>
<p>366. Since May 2009, Afghanistan had passed a number of laws, including a law on the 
elimination of violence against women, which makes violence a crime, whether committed 
at home or elsewhere, prescribes sentences for its perpetrators and is in line with the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Shia 
personal status law, which was reviewed in the light of the Constitution and adjusted in 
accordance with Afghanistan&#8217;s obligations towards international human rights conventions; 
a new media law, which was published in the official gazette and guaranteed freedom of 
speech and publication; the recent implementation of a new police law, incorporating all the 
principles of human rights in police activities; a law on the establishment of a commission 
to supervise the implementation of the Constitution, which was published in the official 
gazette; and finalization of a draft of the new code of criminal procedure, encompassing the 
principle of fair trial and rectifying the loopholes and shortcomings existing in the interim 
code of criminal procedure to standards and rules.  
</p>
<p>367. In addition, Afghanistan had carried out a number of institutional reform 
programmes, including the following: (a) resources had been raised for the establishment of 
a human rights unit in the Ministry of Justice, with the assistance of the United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan; (b) implementation of merit-based prison reform aimed 
at improving the salaries of personnel to a level that meets the essential needs of staff and 
reduces corruption, resulting in better performance, especially in the implementation of the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; (c) the launch of the joint Peace 
through Justice Programme aimed at promoting human rights awareness activities and 
training for communities and local justice officials at the district level throughout 
Afghanistan; (d) the regular holding of sessions of the Justice Sector Coordination 
Commission in the Supreme Court, for coordinating human rights activities; (e) the 
establishment of the first core working group to set up a task force on formal justice 
relations, with an informal justice/traditional dispute resolution mechanism; a template for 
national policy had been formulated, the ultimate aim of which was to prevent the abuse of 
human rights values by informal justice, especially against women; (f) the setting up of a </p>


<p>high office for oversight of the implementation of the anti-corruption strategy, which has 
started working and required that all high-ranking government officials, judges and law 
enforcement bodies register their assets and show how they were acquired. 
</p>
<p>368. Afghanistan noted that, despite all the above-mentioned efforts and commitments by 
the Government in fulfilling its obligations with regard to the principles of human rights, it 
still faced a number of huge challenges, the main ones being terrorism, extremism and 
narcotics. Afghanistan had long argued that these challenges were interconnected with the 
regional and international situation, and that poverty and corruption had also made it 
difficult to tackle them. The issue of aid effectiveness, especially in justice sector 
programmes, had also caused concern for the Government and the international community.  
</p>
<p>369. Afghanistan concluded that the implementation of programmes and reforms required 
the cooperation and participation of all concerned governmental bodies, civil society 
institutions and also the direct cooperation of the international community. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>370. Algeria highlighted the will of Afghanistan to improve the human rights situation, as 
evidenced by the majority of recommendations accepted. It referred to concrete measures 
already taken by Afghanistan to meet its commitments, including the ratification of the 
additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions, the completion of its initial report under 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the adoption of several domestic laws. 
Algeria urged the international community to support the Government&#8217;s efforts and 
encouraged Afghanistan to promote transparency in its electoral system and the fight 
against drug-related corruption.  
</p>
<p>371. Malaysia was pleased that Afghanistan had accepted a large number of 
recommendations, in particular those relating to the improvement of the economic and 
social situation of its citizens. It highlighted Afghanistan&#8217;s preparedness to strengthen 
interaction with international human rights mechanisms and its promise to continue to 
engage with them constructively. It hoped that the Government would uphold its 
commitment to democratic ideals and implement fully the recommendations and outcomes 
of the review. 
</p>
<p>372. Qatar noted that Afghanistan&#8217;s acceptance of 96 recommendations demonstrated the 
importance it attributed to cooperation with the United Nations human rights system. It also 
noted the establishment of institutions and bodies to protect citizens&#8217; rights, and commented 
on the security challenges and constraints, which hindered the exercise of rights by Afghans 
and had a negative effect on the economic and social situation in the country. It welcomed 
the presidential elections. 
</p>
<p>373. Pakistan<b> </b>highlighted Afghanistan&#8217;s endorsement of most of the recommendations and 
acknowledged the Government&#8217;s limitations in providing basic services owing to long-
standing insecurity and armed conflict. It welcomed the measures towards the ratification of 
human rights treaties and institutional reform, and referred to the encouraging promotion of 
women&#8217;s participation in the life of the country. Pakistan expressed confidence in the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to meet current challenges and to take steps to improve the 
human rights situation by involving all stakeholders. Pakistan called on the international 
community to support efforts, including the creation of an enabling environment for 
improving the human rights system in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>374. The Russian Federation<b> </b>noted that the human rights situation in Afghanistan 
remained complex and ambiguous. While progress had been made in a number of areas, 
there was an urgent need to overcome serious problems, such as weak health and education 
systems and ensuring gender equality. It highlighted Afghanistan&#8217;s constructive approach to </p>


<p>the universal periodic review process, and stated that the consolidation of democracy 
should not be hindered by destructive Taliban activities or damage to the civilian 
population from many years of war.  
</p>
<p>375. Indonesia<b> </b>commended Afghanistan for its efforts to implement human rights 
standards, while acknowledging the ongoing difficulties faced by the country. It 
commended, in particular, the establishment of the commission for the elimination of 
violence against women, the strengthening of the work of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs 
and the adult literacy courses for women. Indonesia supported the ongoing efforts to 
achieve political stability as a prerequisite for achieving sustainable economic development 
and social progress.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>376. The United Arab Emirates noted the efforts of Afghanistan to improve living 
standards by, inter alia, fighting poverty, improving health and hygiene and establishing 
programmes in rural areas. It welcomed the efforts made to improve human rights in 
general, and especially to promote the rights of women and children. It noted that, as 
Afghanistan sought to implement the recommendations accepted, it needed to be 
encouraged in its efforts to promote economic and social development during this difficult 
transition period. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>377. India noted that, despite decades of conflict and turmoil, Afghanistan had achieved a 
remarkable transformation in its policy in recent years. The establishment of an 
independent human rights commission and the adoption of a national development strategy 
were particularly noteworthy. India also commended it for progress in the realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals, as well as recent developments, such as the ratification of 
ILO Convention No. 144 and the adoption of the law on the elimination of violence against 
women. India reiterated its commitment to the development of Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>378. Sweden welcomed the fact that Afghanistan had accepted its recommendation to 
take all the steps necessary to combat discrimination and violence against women. Sweden 
also appreciated its commitment to make further efforts to ensure that the status of freedom 
of expression was brought into line with international obligations. Noting that irregularities 
existed in the justice system and that there had been cases where detainees had been found 
innocent, Sweden encouraged Afghanistan to reconsider its position on the death penalty 
and move to support the reintroduction of a moratorium on executions. 
</p>
<p>379. Bahrain noted with pleasure the number of recommendations endorsed by 
Afghanistan, which was a clear reflection of the country&#8217;s interest in promoting human 
rights. Bahrain also welcomed the submission of the initial report under the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. Bahrain referred to the efforts made in all human rights areas, in 
particular in protecting women and adopting the law on violence against women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>380. While welcoming the decision of the Government of Afghanistan to accept most of 
the recommendations, Hungary expressed concern about its refusal of the moratorium on 
the use of the death penalty. It also stressed that further steps were necessary to prevent the 
recruitment of children and the use of child combatants by the Taliban. Hungary 
recommended the continuation of the revision of the Shia personal status law and its 
harmonization with international obligations. While emphasizing that progress in the 
presidential elections was a crucial step towards democratization, Hungary remained 
concerned about the large number of irregularities reported to the electoral complaints 
commission and urged the Government to take all necessary measures to remedy the 
situation.  
</p>
<p>381. The United States of America commended Afghanistan for its efforts to enhance the 
capacity of national human rights institutions. It welcomed the adoption of national 
strategies and policies to support human rights, and encouraged Afghanistan to implement 
them fully. It was encouraged by the signature of the comprehensive domestic violence law, </p>


<p>but shared concerns about flaws in the recently published Shia family law. It referred to 
concerns about intimidation and violence against journalists and limitations on freedom of 
expression, and encouraged Afghanistan to adopt a media law. It also supported 
recommendations to ensure an effective, independent and impartial judicial system that 
upholds human rights. 
</p>
<p>382. Kyrgyzstan followed closely the progress achieved in Afghanistan, given the 
country&#8217;s importance to the prosperity and security of the region. It noted that, despite 
political and economic and social difficulties, Afghanistan and the international community 
had made important achievements in creating a political system, ensuring legal and judicial 
reform and adopting laws in keeping with human rights standards. Kyrgyzstan noted the 
role played by the independent human rights commission in monitoring human rights and 
the work of the national mechanism in monitoring respect for the Constitution, laws and 
human rights obligations and to follow up on possible violations. Kyrgyzstan welcomed the 
ratification of human rights treaties and adoption of new laws designed to protect human 
rights in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>383. Kazakhstan noted that Afghanistan&#8217;s review provided a better understanding of the 
challenges facing the country. It welcomed the progress achieved in Afghanistan and 
supported the recommendations regarding the elimination of extreme poverty and hunger, 
access to primary education and the promotion of women&#8217;s rights. Kazakhstan recalled that 
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals should be a priority and that 
Afghanistan should continue its strong partnership with the international community, which 
in turn should bear in mind its moral obligation to help Afghanistan. Kazakhstan referred to 
its valuable contribution to development efforts in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>384. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission urged the Government to 
take practical steps to ensure women&#8217;s rights to life and security, education, employment, 
access to justice and political participation. It called on the Government to prioritize 
programmes creating employment opportunities so as to prevent displacement and risky 
migration, and urged it to respect the rights to freedom of speech and expression, protection 
of the life of journalists, fighting corruption, ending impunity and the promotion of good 
governance. The Commission urged all concerned to respect international humanitarian law 
fully and to refrain from actions causing civilian casualties. It also expected the 
Government to review and amend domestic law in compliance with international human 
rights law, and to value and respond positively to the recommendations of human rights 
civil society organizations. The Commission urged the Government to invite special 
rapporteurs to Afghanistan. It requested political and financial support from the government 
and State institutions, which would enable the Commission to fulfil its mandate. 
</p>
<p>385. The International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-EUROPE) and the Canadian 
HIV/AIDS Legal Network expressed in a joint statement regret that Afghanistan had rejected 
recommendations to either abolish or reinstate a moratorium on the death penalty. They 
noted the laws criminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults and the sharia 
law providing for the death penalty for consenting homosexual sex. They called on the 
Government to repeal these laws in accordance with Afghanistan&#8217;s international human 
rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>386. The Al-Hakim Foundation appreciated the efforts made by the Government in the 
area of human rights and the support provided to the Afghanistan Independent Human 
Rights Commission and other institutions, such as the commissions to combat corruption, 
reform civil administration and eliminate discrimination against women. The Foundation 
emphasized that the role of civil society should be strengthened. It expressed concern over 
the worsening of terrorist acts, calling on the international community, in cooperation with </p>


<p>human rights institutions and other governments in the region, to put an end to this 
phenomenon. It also emphasized the importance of the dissemination of human rights 
principles throughout Afghanistan in schools and women&#8217;s associations and through 
relevant programmes. 
</p>
<p>387. Amnesty International welcomed Afghanistan&#8217;s support for strengthening the 
capacity to implement the national development strategy. It urged the Government to 
safeguard the independence and work of the independent human rights commission, and 
implement fully the 2005 plan of action for peace, justice and reconciliation. It expressed 
concern that the passing of the amnesty law had undermined the plan of action, and called 
on the Government to conduct independent and judicial investigations into all credible 
allegations of serious human rights abuses, establish a truth-seeking mechanism to 
document past human rights abuses, repeal the amnesty law, and bar those suspected of war 
crimes, crimes against humanity or serious human rights abuses from holding government 
posts. Amnesty International noted that Afghan women and girls continued to encounter 
discriminatory laws, policies and practices and to face endemic domestic violence, 
trafficking, forced marriages and their use as currency in the settlement of disputes. It also 
stated that women victims and defendants were discriminated against in both the formal and 
informal justice systems. Amnesty International called for prompt, impartial and effective 
investigation of all reports of violence against women, that the Government ensure that 
those responsible were brought to justice and the victims granted reparations and that 
women be granted unqualified equality with men in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p>388. International Pen expressed satisfaction that the Government of Afghanistan would 
develop strategies to protect freedom of expression through legislation and adoption of new 
policies for the support for and protection and monitoring of human rights. It expressed 
concern about the recent decline in press freedom, particularly the growing violence against 
journalists. International Pen was also concerned about the existence of &#8220;blasphemy&#8221; laws, 
under which a number of writers and publishers had been charged and imprisoned and 
sentenced to death, and indicated that it would continue to call for the release of those 
imprisoned under such legislation. 
</p>
<p>389. Human Rights Watch underlined the need for the Government to make girls&#8217; 
education a priority, strengthen measures to prevent violence against women, promote 
awareness-raising on issues such as child marriage, and avoid entrenching in the law 
discriminatory practices against women, such as the Shia personal status law, which in its 
amended form allegedly included many egregious articles. It noted that the Government 
had committed itself to a wide range of measures under the 2005 plan of action on peace, 
justice and reconciliation, many of which did not require judicial action, such as according 
dignity to victims and vetting human rights abusers from positions of power. Human Rights 
Watch stated that the rule of law needed significant attention, including strengthening 
respect for human rights by the police and justice sectors, and building the institutional 
capacity of the Ministries of the Interior and Justice, while expressing the view that a 
comprehensive reform of these areas would involve greater transparency, accountability 
and oversight of the appointments process. It reported that the recent elections had been 
deeply flawed, including the low female turnout and widespread use of women&#8217;s polling 
stations and voter registration cards for fraudulent purposes. It expressed regret about the 
rejection by Afghanistan of the recommendation that called for a moratorium on the use of 
the death penalty, noting that legal experts and human rights organizations had long 
expressed concern that international due process and fair trial standards were generally not 
met in such cases. 
</p>
<p>390. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims, while commending the 
actions taken by the Government of Afghanistan, called for more extensive participation of 
women in the administrative and judicial system, the promotion of access of women to </p>


<p>employment, the participation of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs in legislation 
proceedings and the setting up of comprehensive guidelines for the elimination of gender 
discrimination, particularly in employment. It also called for measures to protect women, 
such as practical solutions to eradicate violence against women, a review of text-books in 
schools for the purpose of disseminating information on women&#8217;s rights, and increased 
public awareness on action against domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>391. Noting that war and conflict in the past three decades had weakened the political, 
social and economic structure, the Organization for Defending Victims of Violence viewed 
the setting up of human rights mechanisms and institutions in Afghanistan&#8217;s national 
development strategy as a step forward. It noted that war, terrorism and extremism 
produced violence and insecurity and expressed the hope that, inter alia, Afghanistan would 
be able to cope with these problems in the near future. 
</p>
<p>392. The Institute for Women Studies and Research commended the efforts of the 
Government of Afghanistan to promote and improve human rights, despite the problems 
and security priorities existing in the country, which was still in conflict. It noted that the 
situation of women and children was increasingly serious and that their fundamental rights 
were threatened. The situation increased the responsibility of the international community 
in properly monitoring the rights of Afghan women and children, promoting their access to 
equal rights and social security. The Institute believed that, if the promised aid and 
assistance from the international community were paid on time, the situation of the Afghan 
people, particularly the women and children, would improve.  
</p>
<p>393. The Islamic Human Rights Commission expressed concern that arbitrary arrest and 
detention of journalist by the police and other official security agencies were widespread. It 
was also concerned that women&#8217;s health rights appeared to be neglected, that cultural 
practices hindered women&#8217;s access to these rights and that maternal mortality was one of 
the highest in the world. It noted a number of human rights challenges facing Afghanistan, 
including the internal struggle in the process of democratization, gender equality, 
empowerment of women and the fight against terrorism. The Commission strongly urged 
the Government to ensure that, inter alia, the right to freedom of expression was not 
violated and the prompt and impartial inquiry of all cases of maternal mortality.  
</p>
<p>394. The International Institute of Peace and the Commission to Study the Organization 
of Peace noted that the Taliban regime denied women access to education, health and 
employment. The abduction of women, rape, the infliction of stoning, lashing and other 
forms of inhuman punishment had become commonplace. The Institute blamed those who 
had taken the responsibility for grooming and indoctrinating the Taliban and providing 
them with weapons. It expressed the view that those arguing for negotiations and a deal 
with the Taliban must be prepared to bear the responsibility for the oppression that would 
be unleashed upon the women of Afghanistan if Taliban-dominated rule became a reality.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>395. In his concluding remarks, the Deputy Minister for Justice for Afghanistan, thanked 
all participants for their additional comments. The Government of Afghanistan was 
committed to fulfilling all its obligations in the field of human rights in the light of its 
Constitution, including with regard to the implementation of recommendations it had 
accepted under the universal periodic review process. Regarding women&#8217;s rights, it was 
reiterated that Afghanistan had ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and had in place a law to protect women from violence, in 
conformity with the Convention, in order to give women an appropriate share in the 
Government and social life in Afghanistan.  </p>


<p>396. Regarding the recent presidential elections in Afghanistan, they were a significant 
achievement despite the problems facing the Government. A strong international election 
monitoring group and a complaint commission were working in Afghanistan and their 
comments on the performance of the elections were awaited and any allegations in that 
regard were to be dealt with by them. 
</p>
<p>397. Civilian casualties in Afghanistan were a concern for both the Government and the 
international community, and they had reached an agreement to reduce civilian casualties to 
a minimum. However, opposition groups had been using civilians and their villages as a 
shelter, which was an issue that also needed to be considered.  
</p>
<p>398. Reference was made to the concerns expressed about the Shia personal status law in 
the May 2009 session of the Working Group. The law had been reviewed on the order of 
the President of Afghanistan, and most of the controversial provisions not in line with the 
Constitution or international commitments were removed; it was then published. The path 
for further amendment was open, as one particular provision of the law had raised concern. 
Afghanistan&#8217;s commitment to international conventions was firm.  
</p>
<p>399. Finally, Afghanistan expressed its sincere appreciation to the Council, its President 
and all delegations, as well as to OHCHR in connection with the universal periodic review 
process and for the promotion and protection of human rights in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p><b>  Chile 
</b></p>
<p>400. The review of Chile was held on 8 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Chile in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/CHL/3). 
</p>
<p>401. At its 16th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Chile (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>402. The outcome of the review on Chile comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/10), the views of Chile concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>403. The Permanent Representative of Chile to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
expressed Chile&#8217;s appreciation for the questions and recommendations made by 51 States 
from all regions, which had allowed increased efficiency in the implementation of its 
commitments. Chile had already adopted several measures responding to the concerns 
expressed during its review.  
</p>
<p>404. Chile reported that, on 29 June 2009, the Government had deposited the instrument 
of ratification of the Rome Statute. The Congress had also recently approved the 
International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>405. The Headquarters Agreement for the Establishment of an OHCHR Regional Office 
for South America had also been recently signed, and Chile would sign the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that very 
week.<b>  </b></p>


<p>406. Congress had recently approved the establishment of a national human rights 
institution. The corresponding bill also provided for the reinstatement of the national truth 
and reconciliation commission and the national commission on political imprisonment and 
torture, for a period of six months.  
</p>
<p>407. In order to promote the effective implementation of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, a workshop had been held in August 2009, with a view to identify the best 
alternatives for the creation of a national mechanism for the effective prevention of torture.  </p>
<p>408. Chile announced that a legal procedure would be initiated to amend article 150A of 
the criminal procedure code, to adjust the definition of the crime of torture to the terms 
contained in the Convention against Torture. A bill would be submitted to restrict the 
competence of military courts and reform the military justice code in accordance with 
international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>409. Chile stated that the Government was working on a national human rights plan in 
order to mainstream the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>410. ILO Convention No. 169 had entered into force in September 2009, and actions 
aimed at implementing its provisions had been initiated. The procedure to regulate the 
consultation and participation of indigenous peoples on issues affecting them directly was 
being finalized.  
</p>
<p>411. With regard to the recommendations still under consideration, Chile reported that, as 
far as the domestic legal order in Chile was concerned, the Constitution and civil laws 
explicitly identified the family as the core unit of society. This recognition implied the 
protection of all types of families existing in Chile, whether single parental, expanded, 
recomposed or nuclear.  
</p>
<p>412. Chile also considered that the National Prosecutor&#8217;s Office policy strictly abided by 
the principle of legality. Thus, exhaustive criminal investigations were carried out under the 
control of supervisory judges. Likewise, freedom of expression was protected by the 
Constitution, and reporters and film makers enjoyed maximum freedom in the exercise of 
their respective professions. 
</p>
<p>413. Chile explained that the anti-terrorist law was meant to punish grave criminal 
offences causing public disturbance, and in no way applied to particular categories of 
individuals or social groups. It reported that democratic governments had not applied the 
anti-terrorist law to social demands or claims of the indigenous populations. During the 
period 1999&#8211;2009, this special law was invoked in only 16 cases, several of which related 
to accused persons who did not pertain to any indigenous community. Chile added that, in 
the past four years, the law had been applied to individuals of indigenous origin with regard 
to conduct of the afore-mentioned nature in only two cases. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>414. Algeria expressed appreciation for Chile&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of the 
recommendations made during the presentation of its national report. It commended Chile 
for its commitment to the elimination of discrimination against women and the measures 
taken to eliminate obstacles that prevent them from having access to the labour market. 
Algeria welcomed Chile&#8217;s acceptance of its recommendation to include in its legislation the 
principle of equal pay for equal work. It was encouraged by Chile&#8217;s readiness to guarantee 
access to education for all children, especially those from marginalized communities, such 
as refugee children and children whose families live in rural areas or below the poverty 
line. </p>


<p>415. Morocco<b> </b>thanked Chile for accepting the majority of recommendations made during 
its review, including those made by Morocco. It welcomed Chile&#8217;s prompt response in 
deciding to establish a national human rights institution. Morocco was convinced that Chile 
would continue to strengthen its reforms of the education system for the promotion of 
human rights, incorporating them into school curricula. Regarding Chile&#8217;s migration policy, 
the response received confirmed its commitment to the rights of migrants, placing them at 
the core of its deliberations on the new law on migration. Morocco noted with satisfaction 
Chile&#8217;s efforts in fighting human trafficking, as well as its promotion of non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>416. Colombia<b> </b>welcomed Chile&#8217;s diligence and attention given to the questions asked 
and the recommendations made during the review. Colombia congratulated Chile on the 
voluntary commitments made and its determination to draw up a national human rights plan 
and to hold broad consultations with civil society to that end. Colombia also valued the 
standing invitation that Chile had extended to the special procedures of the Council. The 
voluntary commitments made and the recommendations accepted demonstrated Chile&#8217;s 
firm commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>417. Mexico congratulated Chile on the recent ratification of the Rome Statute and the 
approval of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance by Congress. Mexico welcomed the announcement of the future ratification 
of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, as well as the progress made towards the establishment of the national mechanism 
for follow-up to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Mexico 
appreciated the information provided on the progress made in the preparation of a national 
human rights plan and on the implementation of ILO Convention No. 169. It encouraged 
Chile in its efforts to move towards protecting the human rights of indigenous peoples and 
the measures in place to protect the human rights of its entire population.  
</p>
<p>418. Nicaragua congratulated Chile on its progress in the implementation of the 
recommendations made during its review. It welcomed the recent initiative of establishing a 
national human rights institution, thus institutionalizing its own system to promote and 
protect human rights. It encouraged Chile to continue to pursue the approval and 
implementation of the various legislative initiatives submitted to Congress. 
</p>
<p>419. Hungary welcomed Chile&#8217;s decision to accept or answer all of the recommendations. 
It also commended it for the creation of a national human rights institution, and was pleased 
to note that Chile had launched a national human rights plan. It welcomed the ratification of 
the Rome Statute, the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance and ILO Convention No. 169. Hungary requested an update on the 
drafting of the amendment of the criminal law on combating trafficking in human beings. It 
also requested more information on the measures that Chile intended to take to guarantee 
the full realization of the rights of refugees. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>420. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed Chile&#8217;s acceptance of 
recommendations 27, 28 and 29, pursuant to which Chile agreed to implement initiatives to 
prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, to prohibit by 
law discrimination on those grounds, and to follow the Yogyakarta Principles. It requested 
more information on how Chile planned to implement its commitments. It regretted Chile&#8217;s 
rejection of two recommendations dealing with access to safe therapeutic abortion, noting 
that this rejection limited the ability of civil society to engage the Government on how best 
to address them. It encouraged Chile to involve civil society in the follow-up to the 
recommendations. </p>


<p>421. Amnesty International welcomed the ratification of the Rome Statute and the 
approval by Congress of the creation of a national human rights institution. It called on 
Chile to ensure the institution&#8217;s independence in its powers and functions. It also reiterated 
its call for Chile to nullify the 1978 amnesty law. Welcoming Chile&#8217;s support of the 
recommendations relating to the human rights of indigenous peoples, it reiterated concerns 
that in view of recent violent incidents, the anti-terrorism law may be applied in a 
discriminatory manner. It regretted that Chile had not supported recommendations to bring 
its abortion law into line with its human rights obligations and to review its legislation 
criminalizing the termination of pregnancies in all circumstances. It called for Chile to 
reconsider these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>422. France Libert&#233;s: Fondation Danielle Mitterrand noted that the criminalization of 
demonstrations by the Mapuche constituted an abuse, illustrated by the implementation of 
the anti-terrorist law and the expulsion of journalists reporting on the conflict between 
Mapuche communities and the Government. Despite a land restitution policy, lands were 
threatened by major hydroelectric, mining and forestry projects; the access of the Mapuche 
to resources, including water, has thus been compromised. The application of the anti-
terrorist law lead to a loss of guarantees to a fair trial, maintained much of the investigation 
secret, imposed preventive imprisonment and applied harsher sentences to the ones the 
criminal code would apply in similar circumstances. It called on the Council to ensure that 
Chile no longer criminalized the demands of indigenous communities and that it guaranteed 
conditions for dialogue. 
</p>
<p>423. The Society for Threatened Peoples noted that Chile defined itself as a united 
country, thus not recognizing the existence and singularities of peoples such as the 
Mapuche. Contrary to Slovenia&#8217;s recommendations on the implementation of bilingual 
intercultural programmes, Chile persisted in promoting cultural uniformity based on a 
European ethnocentric vision. The constitutional reform bill currently considered by 
parliament had not been discussed with indigenous peoples. Chile also denied the Mapuche 
their rights to their ancestral lands. Indigenous peoples were rarely consulted on matters 
that concerned them, whether they were development projects or infrastructure. In Arauco, 
620 projects had not been concluded for lack of funding. Chile has voted in favour of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, but criminalized Mapuche leaders who 
promote respect for free determination, autonomy and self-government. 
</p>
<p>424. Conectas Direitos Humanos welcomed the recommendations made to Chile during 
its review, drawing attention to the difficulties that Chile had shown in implementing 
recommendations made by other human rights instruments. The judicial power and 
Congress resisted incorporating international human rights standards into their work. 
Despite the authorities&#8217; agreement to create a body representing the three political powers 
and non-governmental organizations to follow up on the recommendations of the review, 
the proposal had not come into effect yet. It called on the Government to convene public 
authorities and non-governmental organizations to create such a follow-up mechanism. 
</p>
<p>425. The International Association against Torture stated that, with regard to 
recommendations requesting the investigation of alleged cases of torture and to bring 
perpetrators to justice, it was common for raids of Mapuche communities to be carried out 
without a legal warrant and with threats by the police. The police continued to inflict cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment on detainees, and peaceful protests were continuously 
repressed. Recalling that, in the past six years, six Mapuches had been murdered by the 
police and that the identified perpetrators had not been convicted, it highlighted the Czech 
Republic&#8217;s recommendation to provide human rights education and practices to security 
officers, including the Gendarmer&#237;a. Noting that Algeria had recommended poverty 
alleviation programmes, it stated that development projects lacked funding. Of the millions </p>


<p>of hectares taken from the Mapuche, only 140,000 had been returned. The Government did 
not acknowledge Mapuche identity, social organization or authorities. 
</p>
<p>426. Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
referred to recommendation 36 requesting Chile to take further steps to fight human 
trafficking, taking into account the countries of origin. It explained, that under a treaty of 
1883, the provinces of Tacna and Arica remained under the Government pending a 
plebiscite, which never held. Instead, Tacna became Peruvian territory and Arica, Chilean 
territory in 1929. Thousands of Peruvians, victims of trafficking for labour purposes, 
illegally reside in Chile and were exposed to violence and did not enjoy any protection. It 
requested support from the State to study the causes for the above, given the fact that the 
Acha prison held many Peruvians arrested at the border. Statistics also reflected a high 
degree of sexual trafficking at the border.  
</p>
<p>427. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence stated that Chile&#8217;s ratification 
of several international human rights instruments, and the investigation and follow-up to 
grave human rights violations in the past, showed its determination to promote human 
rights in the country. Addressing human rights shortfalls mentioned in the report, such as 
the rights of indigenous peoples, particularly in the area of land ownership, and the lack of 
a national human rights institution based on the Paris Principles would strengthen the 
human rights situation in Chile. Real signs of improvement had been seen in the conditions 
of indigenous peoples, victims of violence and past abuses, and the institutional promotion 
of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>428. The Indian Council of South America commended Chile for its support for the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which recognized, inter alia, treaty rights. 
It cited reports by Mapuche representatives that the historical treaties signed with Spain and 
Chile were the root of conflict, leading to detention and imprisonment, even when claims 
were raised in a non-violent manner. Referring to paragraph 47 of the report, where Chile 
stated that its anti-terrorist laws could not be applied because of ethnic, religious or political 
considerations, it noted reports of indigenous peoples in prison dating back to the Pinochet 
regime, and supported paragraphs 68, 69 and 70, which called for Chile to solve the 
problems of indigenous peoples and to ensure that the anti-terrorism act did not undermine 
their rights, especially those related to their non-violent claims. It called upon Chile to 
review its treatment of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>429. The International Commission of Jurists recalled the recommendations made 
regarding the need to review legislation related to military justice, which presented serious 
incompatibilities with international standards. Chile should study the enactment of a new 
military justice code that excludes the jurisdiction of military tribunals over civilians. 
Reforms should ensure that military tribunals meet the requirements of independence and 
impartiality stipulated by article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Military jurisdiction also requires that judges are officials in active service, subject 
to hierarchical subordination and due obedience. The Commission expressed concern over 
the existence of personal jurisdiction for members of the armed forces, as this privilege was 
linked to the military nature of the offender or the victim, not to the offence. It urged the 
Council to include these recommendations and to supervise their implementation along 
with the other recommendations accepted.  
</p>
<p>430. Conscience and Peace Tax International commented on paragraph 53 of the report, 
noting that, while it was commendable that relatives of victims of past human rights 
violations were exempt from military service, this was not a question of conscientious 
objection. It noted that Chile had been able to meet its military service needs with 
volunteers, but all young men were registered for military service, and the law permitted 
the military to select them for obligatory service without any recognition of conscientious 
objectors. The refusal of illegal orders was also an obligation, not a matter of conscientious </p>


<p>objection, but any change in giving protection to service personnel who attempted to refuse 
illegal orders should be commended.  
</p>
<p>431. The Federation for Women and Family Planning regretted Chile&#8217;s decision to reject 
the recommendations in paragraphs 24 (b) and 37 (a). The failure to implement these 
recommendations and to ensure that women and girls have access to safe therapeutic 
abortion violated Chile&#8217;s international human rights obligations. With respect to the 
implementation of recommendation 27, it urged Chile to, inter alia, provide protection for 
transsexuals, travesties and women engaged in sex work; implement sensitization 
programmes for State officers on gender identity; create employment policies for 
transsexual individuals; and that gender identity be established following a protocol for care 
that did not violate the rights or dignity of transsexual individuals. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>432. On the issue of reproductive health, Chile explained that, since the 1960s, it had 
made considerable advances in terms of maternal and child health care by having set up a 
free public health-care network, based on primary attention by doctors and other 
professionals throughout the country. For this reason, Chile was among the few countries 
likely to reach the Millennium Development Goals of reducing maternal mortality. 
Obstetric care, including attention to complications resulting from abortion, was provided 
in hospitals regardless of their cause. 
</p>
<p>433. Chile pointed out that its family planning programme had been in place since 1967, 
and that it provided free contraceptives to women. Emergency contraceptives were 
available under the express instruction of the Ministry of Health, and were handed out free 
by most municipal offices and non-governmental organizations. The Government had 
recently sent a draft bill to make these arrangements by the Ministry mandatory. Women 
also had free access to sterilization, without requiring the husband&#8217;s authorization, if 
globally accepted conditions were first met. Forced sterilization was illegal.  
</p>
<p>434. Induced abortion was forbidden by legislation, but the idea of reintroducing 
therapeutic abortion was part of the ongoing electoral discussion. The Ministry of Health 
had also instructed health services that, although abortion was illegal, no confessions 
should be extracted from women requiring medical care because of an abortion, especially 
when such a confession was required as a precondition for medical assistance.  
</p>
<p>435. Regarding indigenous peoples, Chile explained that the Government was seeking to 
increase their participation in decision-making. Over the years a range of goals had been 
achieved, such as the approval in the Senate of the proposal to constitutionally recognize 
indigenous peoples; the promulgation of a law relating to the maritime space for indigenous 
peoples; and the incorporation of norms adopting the concept of interculturality in 
education. 
</p>
<p>436. Chile explained that 650,000 hectares had been transferred to indigenous 
communities since 1994. The Government had increased grants for indigenous students and 
improved intercultural health programmes for indigenous peoples. It had built intercultural 
kindergartens and developed a rural infrastructure programme for indigenous communities 
to have better roads. Indigenous peoples were also granted housing subsidies.  
</p>
<p>437. Despite progress in these areas, Chile had seen increased conflict, especially 
regarding demand for land. The Government regretted the death of Mapuche activist Jaime 
Mendoza Coll&#237;o in August 2009, which had been condemned by the President. Chile 
informed a police officer was on trial.  
</p>
<p>438. Chile reported that the Government had recently appointed a minister as coordinator 
for indigenous issues, and would table a project in Congress to restructure the national </p>


<p>indigenous corporation. There would be complimentary norms adopted to regulate the 
hand-over of land, to ensure there was no abuse or speculation. A council of indigenous 
peoples was being established as an independent body representing the different groups.  
</p>
<p><b>  Chad 
</b></p>
<p>439. The review of Chad was held on 5 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Chad in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/TCD/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/TCD/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/TCD/3). 
</p>
<p>440. At its 17th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Chad (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>441. The outcome of the review on Chad comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/5), the views of Chad concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>442. The head of the delegation of Chad, the Minister for Human Rights and for the 
Promotion of Liberties, thanked the African Group for its goodwill and support in making 
the report of the Working Group of Chad available. In that regard, the delegation of Chad 
expressed surprise and frustration at the difficulties to have the report translated despite its 
cooperation. Chad also thanked the troika members, France, Slovenia and Zambia, and the 
secretariat for the work done.  
</p>
<p>443. Chad highlighted its full and transparent cooperation with the treaty bodies through 
the six reports recently submitted to them. The Chad delegation provided information on 
the preparations for a national forum on human rights, which would be held in N&#8217;Djamena 
in November 2009, with the participation of the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>444. Over 110 recommendations were formulated during the universal periodic review of 
Chad in May 2009. Chad immediately accepted 86 recommendations; 14 recommendations 
were postponed for further consideration and consultations with all stakeholders. Chad 
emphasized that it was not appropriate to regard the remaining recommendations as 
rejected; indeed, some were simply redundant, as they referred to matters on which 
legislative measures had already been taken, while others related to matters presently being 
considered by appropriate national bodies and institutions.  
</p>
<p>445. Chad noted that, among the authors of the postponed recommendations, the 
Netherlands had formulated recommendations on gender, Spain and Mexico on the death 
penalty, Switzerland on vulnerable groups, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire on peace, and Denmark on 
improved access for the ICRC to detention centres, specifically Korotoro. Canada, Norway 
and the United Kingdom had made recommendations on impunity and investigations and 
prosecution of those who commit crimes against women and children, and on child soldiers. 
The Czech Republic had made a recommendation on the training of prison wardens, Egypt 
on the application of the penal code and its conformity with international human rights 
standards, and Japan on refugees and displaced persons.  </p>


<p>446. Chad stated that its replies to all questions were to be found in a document circulated 
to the Council. Real work was under way in Chad to make sure that all recommendations 
would be followed up in an operational manner, and that it was expected that, by the end of 
2009, the first results would be visible.  
</p>
<p>447. The constructive and interactive dialogue was much appreciated by Chad, which had 
received positive feedback about its approach to the universal periodic review and its 
related action. Chad was also grateful for all forms of assistance that would help in the 
implementation of the commitments it had made in the framework of the review.  
</p>
<p>448. Chad&#8217;s presence demonstrated to what extent its Government, the President and the 
Prime Minister were in step with what was done by the Council. Taking into account the 
very particular situation of the country, including aggression from a neighbouring country 
and the civil war, Chad would do everything in its power to ensure real human rights 
progress throughout the country. Chad drew the attention of the Council to initiatives such 
as the national forum on human rights and to the implementation of the Agreement of 13 
August for the holding of legislative elections, which would be supervised by an 
independent national electoral commission composed of 15 members from the majority, 15 
from the opposition and a president appointed by consensus. The holding of fair and free 
elections was a major advancement for democracy in Chad. 
</p>
<p>449. In its fight for universal human rights values, Chad called for peace, because human 
rights could not fully be ensured and protected in a context of war, and it appealed to the 
international community to support its efforts for peace, human rights and democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>450. Algeria congratulated Chad&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights. It welcomed Chad&#8217;s will, in line with Algeria&#8217;s recommendation, to pursue 
its efforts to strengthen the primacy of law and respect for human rights, particularly by 
finalizing the reform process under way in the legislative, judicial and territorial 
administration areas. Algeria stressed that Chad&#8217;s efforts to guarantee the right to education 
for all citizens, despite its limited resources, were noteworthy, and renewed its appeal to the 
international community to provide Chad with the assistance it needed in this regard. 
Chad&#8217;s firm desire to promote and respect human rights, despite development and stability 
challenges, justified the international community&#8217;s support for this country.  
</p>
<p>451. Qatar noted that Chad&#8217;s acceptance of 86 recommendations made in the Working 
Group reflected its determination to cooperate with the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms. In spite of limited resources and difficult political conditions, the Government 
had been able to make major progress in building a modern State, and promoting and 
protecting human rights, in particular the right to education. 
</p>
<p>452. The Russian Federation noted Chad&#8217;s constructive approach manifested through the 
acceptance of 86 recommendations at the fifth session of the Working Group. It welcomed 
the intention of the Ministry of Human Rights and Promotion of Liberties to organize a 
forum on human rights. It expressed perplexity regarding the fact that the secretariat did not 
ensure a translation in the official languages of the United Nations, including Russian, of 
the Working Group report. It requested that the translation of the document be made 
available for the next session of the Council.  
</p>
<p>453. Morocco pointed out the objective manner in which the Government had depicted 
the situation of human rights in terms of both progress and challenges. It congratulated 
Chad on the number of recommendations that it had accepted. It thanked the Government 
for accepting Morocco&#8217;s recommendation on the establishment of a national programme on </p>


<p>human rights education and training, and called on the international community to provide 
technical assistance in this regard.  
</p>
<p>454. The United States of America urged the Government to continue and to strengthen 
its efforts to demobilize child soldiers and to end their recruitment and use. It stressed that 
recruitment from refugee camps continued to be a particular concern and welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s recent awareness campaign for law enforcement. It noted with satisfaction 
the transfer of some child soldiers to UNICEF custody. The United States called upon the 
Government to allow the magistrates examining the cases related to the abuses that took 
place between 28 January and 8 February 2008, especially that of Ibni Oumar Mahamat 
Saleh, to work without interference. It also encouraged the Government to revise its press 
law to ensure respect for freedom of the press. 
</p>
<p>455. Djibouti congratulated Chad for its openness to the Council mechanisms despite the 
difficult situation in the country. It hoped that the international community would assist 
Chad in implementing the universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>456. Burkina Faso noted that the human rights situation in Chad was still marked by the 
crisis prevailing for several years. The sporadic armed conflicts within the country and at its 
borders had caused human rights violations. The situation had led Chad to give priority to 
the consolidation of peace and national reconciliation, without which the enjoyment of 
human rights was problematic. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s efforts to comply with its 
international human rights obligations and noted that the implementation of certain 
recommendations would require support from the international community.  
</p>
<p>457. Senegal stated that, during the Working Group session, it had expressed support for 
the initiatives that Chad had undertaken in the areas of education and health. It commended 
the acceptance of the recommendations concerning the fight against poverty and 
strengthening the protection of the right of women and children. It underlined Chad&#8217;s 
commitment to improve the human rights situation, and noted that it should be provided 
with technical assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>458. Cameroon encouraged Chad in its efforts to build a State based on the rule of law 
and respectful of universal and African values, despite an unfavourable context. Cameroon 
was convinced that the implementation of the accepted recommendations would allow 
Chad to achieve, more easily, the objective of respect for human dignity. It added that Chad 
could count on Cameroon&#8217;s support and called for multiform assistance to the country.  
</p>
<p>459. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted with satisfaction Chad&#8217;s determination 
to raise awareness regarding women&#8217;s education. It welcomed Chad&#8217;s commitment to set 
up permanent structures, with the support of UNICEF, against the exploitation of children 
working as herdsmen. It encouraged Chad to put into practice its willingness to promote all 
human rights, congratulated it on the efforts to make higher education accessible to all and 
for the commitment to improve progressively the social situation of students. 
</p>
<p>460. Ghana welcomed Chad&#8217;s acceptance of most of the recommendations and hoped that 
it would receive the necessary assistance from the international community to enhance its 
efforts. Ghana expressed concern regarding the preparation and translation of the Working 
Group report on Chad. While searching for a solution to the problem in the short term, the 
Council needed to also find a long-term solution to the question of resources for the 
universal periodic review process to avoid ad hoc measures, which risked undermining the 
principle of equal treatment for all States.  
</p>
<p>461. Congo congratulated Chad for its efforts to implement the universal periodic review 
recommendations. The efforts deserved recognition and support because Chad suffered 
from constant attacks from rebel movements, which undermined its endeavours to promote </p>


<p>and protect human rights. Chad needed technical and financial assistance from the 
international community.  
</p>
<p>462. South Africa expressed concern about the late publication of the Chad report, 
particularly for the Chadian delegation, which needed to review the report prior to its 
adoption. South Africa pointed out the substantial number of recommendations enjoying 
Chad&#8217;s support, and it reiterated the call to the international community to assist Chad 
through the provision of technical assistance and capacity-building programmes. It 
encouraged Chad to continue efforts to restore peace and security, to strengthen the 
implementation of domestic legislation, to enhance conformity of its domestic law with its 
human rights obligations, and to ensure full protection of, in particular, economic, social 
and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>463. The International Federation of ACAT (Action by Christians for the Abolition of 
Torture-FIACAT) congratulated Chad for accepting the recommendation on the definition 
of torture in accordance with article 1 of the Convention against Torture. It recalled that the 
practice of torture was recurrent in police stations, gendarmerie and the so-called parallel 
prisons run by the traditional authorities, and encouraged Chad to incorporate in its criminal 
code appropriate sanctions against this crime. It encouraged Chad to deal with prison 
overcrowding and ensure decent conditions for detainees. It welcomed the acceptance of 
the recommendation related to giving the ICRC access to all detention facilities, including 
Korotoro. It remained concerned about the persistence of extrajudicial executions 
committed by the unit in charge of the protection of the environment.  
</p>
<p>464. Interfaith International noted with satisfaction the reforms made by Chad to improve 
its legislative and institutional framework, notably the provisions on fundamental freedoms, 
the justice system, female genital mutilation, early marriages and domestic violence. It 
encouraged the Government to create a healthy atmosphere, which would allow judging 
those who had committed crimes under the dictatorship of Hiss&#233;ne Habr&#233;, as well as the 
crimes committed during the events of February 2008. 
</p>
<p>465. Amnesty International called on Chad to implement the recommendations of the 
national commission of enquiry into the events of N&#8217;Djamena in 2008 and to bring to 
justice those suspected of serious human rights violations; to cease the forced eviction of 
people in N&#8217;Djamena and to conduct a full and impartial enquiry into the role of police and 
the military in such evictions; to investigate and disclose the whereabouts of victims of 
enforced disappearance; to end the practice of secret detention and to make public the name 
and location of all detention facilities; to refrain from harassing human rights defenders and 
journalists and to repeal the provisions of ordinance No. 5 of 20 February 2008; and to 
improve measures to protect women and girls in internally displaced person and refugee 
camps in eastern Chad. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s initiative to hold a forum on human 
rights and its efforts to strengthen the national human rights commission and the Ministry 
of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>466. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues congratulated Chad for its 
universal periodic review commitments, but deplored the absence of any specific 
commitment regarding the protection of human rights defenders and journalists, and called 
on Chad to take into account the reality of sexual violence against women and to implement 
the Optional Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights regarding 
women&#8217;s rights. It welcomed Chad&#8217;s commitments to bring an end to arbitrary detentions, 
deplorable detention conditions, the use of torture in prisons, police stations and illegal 
detention places, and to punish perpetrators. It hoped that Chad would incorporate the 
definition of torture of the Convention against Torture into its criminal code. It encouraged </p>


<p>Chad to shed light on the disappearance of Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh and to implement 
the recommendations of the commission of enquiry into the events of 2008. 
</p>
<p>467. Human Rights Watch welcomed the Government&#8217;s support for the recommendations 
addressing the recruitment of child soldiers, and urged Chad to keep the Council informed 
on the steps taken to ensure the prompt and complete demobilization and reintegration of 
all child soldiers, and to prevent any further recruitment. It expressed concern regarding 
continued restrictions imposed on UNICEF access to the Direction general de services de 
s&#233;curit&#233; des institutions de l&#8217;&#201;tat. It urged Chad to take all necessary measures to protect 
women and girls from sexual violence, to submit a report to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and to extend a standing invitation to all 
special procedures.  
</p>
<p>468. The International Human Rights Association of American Minorities commended 
the decision of Chad to move the Oure Cassoni refugee camp away from the Sudanese 
border. It also commended the progress made on the demobilization of child soldiers. 
Freedom of speech continued to be curtailed, democratic values continued to be eroded, 
nepotism continued at all levels of power, social mobility was extremely limited and 
opposition leaders were frequently arrested. It stated that a constitutional amendment in 
2005 allowed the president to serve an unlimited term. It expressed support for several 
recommendations of the Working Group report: accession to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, to ratify the International Convention on the protection of all 
persons from enforced disappearance, to achieve poverty reduction target and to invite the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>469. The delegation of Chad expressed its deep satisfaction at the recognition by Member 
States and observers, of the very difficult situation Chad was presently facing and of the 
efforts that the Government was making to improve the human rights situation in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>470. With regard to the interventions made by some non-governmental organizations, 
Chad noted that their information seemed to be outdated. The Ministry of Human Rights 
and the Promotion of Liberties was responsible for the protection of freedom of expression 
and for the free circulation of ideas and individuals. No journalist or human rights defender 
was currently imprisoned or persecuted. Chad also recalled that, in 2005, immediately after 
his appointment, the Minister for Human Rights and the Promotion of Liberties declared to 
the media that he could not be Minister for Human Rights in a country where journalists 
and human rights defenders were imprisoned. Should non-governmental organizations have 
specific names to provide the Chad delegation with, action would be taken immediately to 
ensure that human rights defenders, journalists and the civil society at large could work 
without interference.  
</p>
<p>471. On the issue of disappearances, in February 2008, an international commission of 
enquiry, convened by the Government, submitted a report. The Government subsequently 
set up a technical subcommittee composed of magistrates, police officers and inspectors to 
ensure due consideration of the commission&#8217;s findings and to clarify the way in which 
those events had happened. The Government did not tolerate patterns of impunity and had 
made available to the judiciary all necessary resources to carry out due judicial 
proceedings. Hearings were still ongoing and justice would ultimately be done. 
</p>
<p>472. The disappearance of Ibn Oumar Mahamat Saleh, like many other cases, was being 
dealt with by the Government seriously, and investigations on that case were ongoing. It 
was worth recalling however, that, in February 2008, most of the capital city was under the </p>


<p>control of rebels forces and that the legitimate authorities, not to mention ordinary citizens, 
were in danger of being annihilated.  
</p>
<p>473. On child soldiers, Chad stated that the Government spared no effort, including 
legislative steps, to prevent and eradicate this phenomenon. An agreement had been signed 
with UNICEF on this issue and all possible measures had been taken to avoid child 
recruitment by the national army.  
</p>
<p><b>  Viet Nam 
</b></p>
<p>474. The review of Viet Nam was held on 8 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Viet Nam in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 
15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VNM/3). 
</p>
<p>475. At its 18th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Viet Nam (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>476. The outcome of the review on Viet Nam comprises of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/11), the views of Viet Nam 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/12/11/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>477. In his opening statement, the First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam, 
Pham Binh Minh, stated that the Vietnamese delegation had had a productive dialogue with 
countries on the protection and promotion of human rights in Viet Nam at the May session 
of the Working Group. He thanked delegations for commending Viet Nam&#8217;s serious 
universal periodic review preparation, the quality and comprehensiveness of the report, and 
for acknowledging Viet Nam&#8217;s achievements in national construction and development. He 
reiterated that these achievements were the result of Viet Nam&#8217;s reform process and its 
consistent policy to respect, protect and promote human rights. At the same time, the 
universal periodic review process had helped Viet Nam understand more fully the 
challenges faced and to identify areas for further improvement. Viet Nam also saw this as 
an experience-sharing exercise, laying the ground for a better protection and promotion of 
human rights by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>478. In May 2009, the Vietnamese delegation expressed agreement with most of the 
views and recommendations of States. After the Working Group session, a comprehensive 
report had been submitted to the Government with proposed follow-up steps to implement 
these recommendations. Briefings on the outcomes of the session were held for people 
organizations, government agencies as well as the diplomatic corps and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>479. In the past four months, Viet Nam had shared its development experiences with 
several countries, ratified the Convention against Corruption, withdrawn its reservations to 
the optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and included in the 
National Assembly&#8217;s 2010 work programme an item on consideration of the ratification of 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Viet Nam would also consider 
favourably the recommendations on accession to the ILO Convention on Forced Labour </p>


<p>and would consider accession to other appropriate ILO conventions. Nevertheless, Viet 
Nam did not find accession to Convention No. 169 indispensable. It was strongly 
committed to continuing to fully implement all recommendations that it had accepted. 
</p>
<p>480. The First Deputy Minister provided additional information on a number of issues. 
Firstly, the freedom of press and freedom of expression were protected by Vietnamese laws 
in accordance with international norms. At the same time, journalists were accountable 
before the law for their actions. Secondly, Viet Nam paid attention to the development of 
human rights institutions, including a national committee, which it believed depended 
mainly on the particularities of each nation. Viet Nam had in place a diversified system of 
institutions to protect and promote human rights with efficiency and effectiveness. Thirdly, 
Viet Nam stood ready to cooperate with special procedures. Recently, it had extended 
invitations to five special procedures, was discussing with the independent expert on human 
rights and extreme poverty the timing of a visit, and was looking positively at the timing of 
a visit by the independent expert on minority issues. Fourthly<i>,</i> the total number of offences 
subject to capital punishment had been cut to 21. However, circumstances did not allow 
Viet Nam to abolish or place a moratorium on the use of death penalty. Lastly, Viet Nam 
was positively considering accession to the Convention against Torture, and other ILO 
conventions, and ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
Viet Nam was studying the possibility of accession to the Rome Statute on the International 
Criminal Court and other international treaties.  
</p>
<p>481. Viet Nam reaffirmed the universal and particular nature of human rights as defined 
in core human rights treaties and in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
and reiterated that human rights must be addressed in a fair, impartial, constructive and 
non-selective manner through dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>482. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic recognized that Viet Nam had successfully 
implemented the renovation policy of <i>Doi Moi</i>, and had achieved comprehensive socio-
economic and cultural development along with achievements in human rights 
implementation. It also acknowledged Viet Nam&#8217;s consistent policy of considering its 
people at the centre of social and economic development, and welcomed Viet Nam&#8217;s 
commitment to poverty reduction, the growth strategy for 2005&#8211;2010, the strategy on 
judicial reform, the strategy on the development of a legal system vision for 2020 and the 
national strategy on gender equality for 2011&#8211;2020. 
</p>
<p>483. Brunei Darussalam stated that Viet Nam&#8217;s constructive approach to the 
recommendations illustrated its commitment to enhance human rights. It supported Viet 
Nam&#8217;s endeavours to promote democracy, social equality and security, and welcomed 
measures to better ensure economic, cultural and social rights, especially of women, 
children, ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. It appreciated Viet Nam&#8217;s role in 
the realization of the Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  
</p>
<p>484. Myanmar welcomed Viet Nam&#8217;s constructive engagement and its acceptance of 
most of the recommendations. Since 1986, the Government had enacted and revised 13,000 
laws and bylaws to be in conformity with the Constitution. Significant progress in socio-
economic development had been achieved and Viet Nam had already attained or surpassed 
many of the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015. Myanmar expressed its belief in 
Viet Nam&#8217;s continued commitment to strengthening the full enjoyment of all human rights 
by its citizens. </p>


<p>485. China appreciated the detailed responses to the recommendations, which 
demonstrated the importance that Viet Nam attached to the universal periodic review. Viet 
Nam had been trying to strengthen democracy and rule of law, promote social equity, 
improve material standards and cultural rights, and had attained achievements in nation-
building. Viet Nam committed to implementing recommendations, considering accession to 
relevant international conventions, improving its legal framework for human rights 
protection, promoting economic and social rights, protecting the rights of women, children 
and ethnic minorities, and reducing poverty. China wished it continued progress in nation-
building and the protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>486. Algeria appreciated Viet Nam&#8217;s determination to meet its obligations under 
international treaties and to consider accession to other human rights international 
instruments, such as the Convention against Torture. Its conclusive experience in the field 
of economic, social and cultural rights had allowed a substantial reduction of poverty. Viet 
Nam would share this experience with interested developing countries, thus contributing to 
strengthening South-South cooperation. Viet Nam had been able to show the added value of 
the universal periodic review and how it could contribute to implementing the goals 
underlying the establishment of the Council. 
</p>
<p>487. Thailand welcomed Viet Nam&#8217;s commitment to considering becoming party to a 
number of international human rights treaties and its readiness to cooperate with the special 
procedures system. It also welcomed the plans to further improve the national legal 
framework. It noted Viet Nam&#8217;s acceptance to continue to provide and expand human 
rights education and training for relevant Government authorities. Thailand appreciated 
Viet Nam&#8217;s contributions in the establishment of the ASEAN Intergovernmental 
Commission on Human Rights, and looked forward to working closely in this endeavour. 
Thailand expressed confidence that Viet Nam would translate the recommendations into 
actions, thus making a real difference on the ground. 
</p>
<p>488. Cambodia, as an ASEAN country, was pleased with the significant progress and 
achievements of Viet Nam in recent years. Particularly appreciated were the various follow-
up activities carried out in the past four months. Cambodia took note of the continued 
commitments of Viet Nam to address the challenges ahead through further implementation 
of programmes and relevant plans aiming at promoting and protecting the rights of its 
citizens, especially in the economic, social and cultural areas, including minority rights. 
</p>
<p>489. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted that Viet Nam&#8217;s cooperation with the 
universal periodic review demonstrated its commitment to human rights. It appreciated the 
achievements in the promotion of human rights, the presentation of development plans for 
social progress and the increase in the standard of living of the population. It also noted the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to provide care to people with disabilities as a result of the past neo-
colonial war. It expressed satisfaction at Viet Nam&#8217;s commitment to comply with the 
Millennium Development Goal regarding poverty reduction.  
</p>
<p>490. Cuba indicated that Viet Nam had accepted the majority of the recommendations 
made during the review. The success of the country, based on the political, economic and 
social system that had been freely chosen by its people, was significant, both in civil and 
political rights and in economic, social and cultural rights. Viet Nam had been able to 
demonstrate this success after its struggle against colonialism and military invasion. Cuba 
expressed its appreciation to a country that was clearly committed to the full respect for and 
enjoyment of all human rights for all. Its political willingness deserved recognition. 
</p>
<p>491. Malaysia was encouraged by Viet Nam&#8217;s steps towards implementing many of the 
recommendations. It welcomed the various mechanisms in place to guarantee the protection 
of fundamental freedoms and rights and to promote employment, economic growth and 
alleviate poverty. Malaysia was encouraged by Viet Nam&#8217;s commitment to speed up law </p>


<p>reforms and the public administrative programme, and hoped that Viet Nam would remain 
committed to implement fully the universal periodic review recommendations and outcome.  
</p>
<p>492. Yemen indicated that Viet Nam&#8217;s participation showed its commitment to the work 
of the Council and the universal periodic review. The report presented by Viet Nam to the 
Working Group had showed that it was implementing a strategic approach in the area of 
human rights. Yemen was pleased that Viet Nam had accepted many recommendations. 
This was a step forward in implementing the human rights instruments to which Viet Nam 
was a party. 
</p>
<p>493. The Russian Federation appreciated Viet Nam&#8217;s efforts to ensure fundamental rights 
and freedoms, maintain social stability, rapid economic growth and higher living standards. 
At the Working Group session in May 2009, Viet Nam had already expressed its readiness 
to implement the majority of the recommendations. The recommendations made by the 
Russian Federation were among the 93 supported. By the next cycle of the review, Viet 
Nam would have made major efforts to meet its goals, including raising living conditions 
and improving the quality of health and education. It wished Viet Nam further progress in 
protecting human rights and successful implementation of the obligations it had assumed 
under the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>494. The Vietnam Peace and Development Foundation appreciated the Government&#8217;s 
promotion of the participation of non-governmental organizations. Despite many 
challenges, the Vietnamese people benefited from the general improvement in living 
conditions, poverty reduction, women empowerment and the caring for children, persons 
with disabilities and ethnic minorities, and an active religious development. The process of 
building a law-governed State created better conditions for people to participate in the 
political life of the country. The political social system and media structure served the 
people&#8217;s interests best and were suitable for the situation.  
</p>
<p>495. Amnesty International regretted the rejection of important recommendations, 
including the repeal or amendment of national security laws of the 1999 penal code 
inconsistent with international law; the removal of other restrictions on dissent, political 
opposition, the freedoms of expression and assembly; and the release of prisoners of 
conscience. It was concerned that several prisoners of conscience were in detention and 
regretted that Viet Nam had not supported recommendations to adopt a moratorium on 
executions. It urged Viet Nam to reconsider these recommendations with a view to taking 
steps towards abolishing the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>496. The Vietnam Family Planning Association thanked the Government for involving 
non-governmental organizations in the universal periodic review process and commended 
its efforts in education, health care, child rights, gender equality and the elimination of 
discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. It appreciated the achievements made 
in improving living standards, reducing poverty, promoting social justice and progress, and 
noted the promulgation of laws on gender equality. Although the results were encouraging, 
Viet Nam still needed further improvements in providing better access to quality health 
services, including reproductive health, for ethnic minority people, youth and adolescents, 
and in further strengthening HIV/AIDS prevention and control.  
</p>
<p>497. International Pen noted that Vietnamese authorities had included freedom of 
expression, press and information among their priorities, but a significant number of 
writers, journalists and dissidents were being held in detention for having expressed their 
opinions or dissent publicly. Viet Nam was, in particular, urged to lift pre- and post-
publication censorship. Finally, International Pen concurred with the Human Rights 
Committee&#8217;s recommendation to bring Viet Nam&#8217;s legislation into conformity to article 19 </p>


<p>of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. International Pen also 
demanded that the Viet Nam authorities bring to an end the pattern of imprisonment and 
residence surveillance against those who held dissenting views. 
</p>
<p>498. Human Rights Watch noted Viet Nam&#8217;s rejection of recommendations pertaining to 
arbitrary detention and mistreatment, restrictions on peaceful expression, association and 
religion, the use of capital punishment and the lack of prohibitions of torture. It noted the 
rejection of recommendations to lift Internet controls, expedite local registration of 
religious organizations, repeal or amend national security laws used to criminalize dissent, 
and release prisoners of conscience. On the positive side, Viet Nam had reduced the 
number of crimes punishable by capital punishment. Recently, Viet Nam had arrested seven 
democracy activists and more than 30 Montagnard Christians. Montagnard Christians had 
been sentenced to prison, and another eight democracy activists awaited trial.  
</p>
<p>499. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues was concerned about Viet 
Nam&#8217;s rejection of a number of essential recommendations. Since the review, journalists, 
bloggers, human rights lawyers and opponents had been arbitrarily arrested. Numerous 
countries had called for transparency on prisons and camps, the number of detainees and 
the reasons for their incarceration. Viet Nam should recognize independent religions. 
Regrettably, Viet Nam had rejected the recommendation to extend an invitation to various 
special procedures. 
</p>
<p>500. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers Europe and the Third World 
Centre commended Viet Nam for the achievements regarding poverty reduction, right to 
education, right to health and right to food, gender equality and promotion of women&#8217;s 
rights. Viet Nam was a developing country that had undergone 30 years of war and had 
overcome the aftermath of war, for example by providing support for the many victims of 
bombs, mines and agent Orange/dioxin, as millions of people still suffered from its tragic 
effects, for which, to date, no one had assumed responsibility. Despite significant progress, 
the Vietnamese legal system contained some inconsistencies and contradictions, with the 
adoption of free-market laws. 
</p>
<p>501. The World Peace Council noted that the Vietnamese people had suffered colonial 
domination and foreign interventions. There were still millions of victims suffering from 
agent Orange-related diseases. Regretfully, the perpetrators and the international 
community had not dealt with this issue adequately. The Constitution guaranteed and made 
provisions for all fundamental human and civil rights, including the right to freedom of 
belief and religion. All question-and-answer sessions in Parliament were broadcast live on 
television. The media often openly criticized the mistakes of the authorities. It encouraged 
the Vietnamese to pursue universal values in their own way and not to impose formulas that 
had many limitations.  
</p>
<p>502. North-South XXI, in a joint statement with the Union of Arab Jurists, remained 
concerned about the Government&#8217;s limitation of freedom of expression, and encouraged the 
Government to continue to work closely with journalists and media organizations to ensure 
that a variety of views were expressed in the media. North-South XXI hoped that Viet Nam 
would consider subscribing to the General Assembly moratorium on the death penalty. The 
international community had a legal duty to support Viet Nam&#8217;s efforts with adequate 
resources and cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>503. In his concluding remarks, the Deputy Minister thanked States and some non-
governmental organizations for their objective remarks and the comments of goodwill on 
the challenges facing Viet Nam. He affirmed that the Government gave priority to 
addressing these challenges. </p>


<p>504. It was emphasized that the development of the press and the Internet in Viet Nam 
was clear evidence of the fact that the freedoms of the press, expression and the Internet 
were well protected. Freedom of religion was also protected, resulting in the growth of 
religions in all aspects. Special treatment was provided to ethnic minorities to assist them in 
preserving their culture and way of life. These policies had been crucial in forging unity 
among all religions and ethnicities in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>505. The Deputy Minister reaffirmed that the ultimate goal, also a manifestation of efforts 
to promote human rights in Viet Nam, was to develop a prosperous people, strong country 
and a just, democratic and advanced society. The promotion of democracy and human 
rights was both the goal and the driving force of the reform process. Viet Nam had 
continued to strengthen the legal framework to better protect and promote human rights. 
The civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the people were being better 
ensured. Viet Nam believed that, in this common cause, each nation had its own political, 
historical, social, cultural, religious and ethnic particularities. In each case, the State bears 
the primary responsibility to do what is needed for the interests of the nation and the 
people. Therefore, any State would need to take necessary measures to maintain social and 
political stability for development, and in this connection, any activity that violates the law 
and threatens this fundamental interest of the nation should be punished in accordance with 
the law. 
</p>
<p>506. Viet Nam believed that the universal periodic review mechanism would continue to 
uphold the principles of cooperation and dialogue on the basis of equality and respect for 
national sovereignty in order to truly contribute to the promotion and protection of human 
rights in each and every nation. For its part, Viet Nam would develop a plan of action to 
implement effectively the universal periodic review recommendations and would stand 
ready to discuss and share experience with all countries and international organizations to 
better ensure human rights in Viet Nam and the world. 
</p>
<p>507. Finally, the delegation thanked countries for their support and assistance to Viet 
Nam in its efforts to protect and promote human rights, the Working Group troika and the 
secretariat for the active technical assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Uruguay 
</b></p>
<p>508. The review of Uruguay was held on 11 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Uruguay in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/URY/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/URY/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/URY/3). 
</p>
<p>509. At its 18th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Uruguay (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>510. The outcome of the review of Uruguay comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/12), the views of Uruguay concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>511. At the 18th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Director of Human Rights and 
Minister for Education and Culture made an opening statement, thanking all 46 delegations </p>


<p>that had made observations and recommendations. She stated that Uruguay had examined 
the 86 recommendations received during the interactive dialogue, and was proud to have 
accepted them all.  
</p>
<p>512. Uruguay wished to provide clarification on some recommendations, to brief about 
actions already initiated to respond to many of them, and to provide information on the road 
ahead. 
</p>
<p>513. With regard to the first recommendation requesting Uruguay to consider ratifying 
the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, Uruguay had indeed 
deposited the instrument accepting this convention on 3 May 2004, and as such, it had 
entered into force for Uruguay on 3 August 2004.  
</p>
<p>514. As requested in the second recommendation, Uruguay wished to report that it would 
sign on 24 September 2009 the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in New York. It also stated that it had submitted a 
revised report to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in July 2009.  
</p>
<p>515. Uruguay indicated that it had started to comply with its own voluntary commitments 
made during the Working Group session, including the submission of five reports to 
various treaty monitoring bodies &#8211; the Committee on Migrant Workers, the Committee 
against Torture and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination &#8211; and on 
the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>516. In accordance with recommendations 11 and 20, Uruguay had initiated consultations 
to establish a permanent inter-institutional high-level political coordination mechanism for 
the elaboration of human rights reports and follow-up to recommendations, including those 
emanating from the universal periodic review. As in the case of recommendations 10 and 
11, the civil society would be directly involved in this mechanism.  
</p>
<p>517. At the regional level, Uruguay was committed to formulating human rights policies, 
and specifically supported the MERCOSUR high-level meetings on human rights, which 
were currently introducing reforms to its structure with the aim of improving it.  
</p>
<p>518. At the national level, Uruguay approved in 2008 its national human rights institution 
established in accordance with the Paris Principles. The new Government that would come 
into office in 2010 would put into effect this institution, to which 12 countries referred to in 
recommendations 8 and 9. A bill was also currently being drafted to harmonize the 
competencies of the national human rights institution with those of the parliamentary 
commissioner for prisons.  
</p>
<p>519. Uruguay wished also to refer to three fundamental issues which were part of the 
recommendations, and were also very<b> </b>important for the Government: the situation of 
persons deprived of their liberty; the situation of women and children; and the issue of 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>520. Uruguay reported on measures taken to guarantee the rights of persons deprived of 
their liberty, making reference to, inter alia, two bills to reform the penal code and the penal 
procedure code. Uruguay recalled that, already in 2005, the current Government had 
declared a humanitarian emergency for the prisons. A plan to reduce overcrowding in the 
prison system was being currently implemented, which would also allow for the 
classification of people deprived of their liberty in accordance with international standards 
and to provide special attention to imprisoned mothers. The plan of action for the reform of 
the prison system was approved in June 2009; a new health-care system had already been 
put in place in one of the main penitentiary centres, and would be further extended to 
others. Specialized treatment for persons affected by HIV/AIDS and deprived of their 
liberty was also available. In 2009, the work and study programmes had been strengthened 
and an internal affairs department to investigate cases of ill-treatment had been established. </p>


<p>521. With regard to the situation of boys, girls and women, the subject of many 
recommendations, Uruguay noted that this had been a major concern in Government 
policies in the past four years. The delegation made reference to a number of efforts, 
including the equity plan; a bill to increase the age of marriage for both sexes to 16 years; a 
recently approved law to prevent and punish sexual harassment in schools and at work; the 
implementation of a general law on education universalizing education as of the age of 3 
years; the creation of a national commission for human rights education and the national 
commission for non-formal education; a recent law on adoption, which modified the 
children and adolescents code; a national survey recently initiated on child labour; and the 
&#8220;Ceibal&#8221; plan providing one laptop per child in public schools. 
</p>
<p>522. Regarding efforts to address discrimination, Uruguay stated that, in consultation 
with civil society, it had initiated a process for the drafting of the State report to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the elaboration of a national 
plan against discrimination. Efforts to redress the housing situation, centred on Afro-
descendents, had also been initiated. A day of the &#8220;Charr&#250;a nation and indigenous identity&#8221; 
on 9 September had been declared. With regard to the rights of gays, lesbians and 
transsexuals, and the legislation that recognized the rights of couples cohabiting and 
couples of the same sex, Uruguay reported on the new law on adoption guaranteeing this 
right for these couples and on the bill on gender identity.  
</p>
<p>523. Regarding reference in the recommendations to the abolition of the law on the 
expiry of punitive claims (<i>ley de caducidad</i>) and the approval of the exercise of the right to 
vote by citizens resident abroad, Uruguay noted that, once the processes established by the 
Constitution in this regard had been completed, they would be decided in two referendums, 
to be held on 25 October 2009 during the national elections. 
</p>
<p>524. In connection with the State terrorism that Uruguay had suffered in the recent past, 
the delegation stated that Parliament had recently adopted a law recognizing the illegal 
action carried out by the State and the comprehensive reparation of victims of human rights 
violations during this shameful period in the history of Uruguay. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>525. China noted with satisfaction the openness with which Uruguay had agreed to the 
recommendations made by various States. It noted with appreciation that over the past 20 
years, Uruguay had rapidly set up a system to protect civil rights, eliminate poverty, 
promote the right to information, and promote the right of minorities, social harmony and 
international cooperation. China encouraged Uruguay to work on the basis of national 
realities, by analysing and considering any valid recommendation from the universal 
periodic review, and expand its international cooperation to ensure that the enjoyment of all 
human rights was increased for the population.  
</p>
<p>526. Algeria welcomed the delegation of Uruguay and thanked it for the additional 
information provided on the follow-up to the recommendations of the Working Group. 
Algeria noted with satisfaction that Uruguay had endorsed most of the recommendations 
and was determined to follow up on them. Algeria also welcomed Uruguay&#8217;s readiness to 
accept the recommendations to set up a national committee to combat discrimination 
against people of African descent and indigenous peoples, to abolish gender disparity in 
employment and ensure that there was equal pay for equal work. Algeria also praised the 
penal reforms carried out by Uruguay.  
</p>
<p>527. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted Uruguay&#8217;s commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights and open cooperation with the universal periodic review 
mechanism. It noted with appreciation the efforts made through Uruguay&#8217;s social plans and </p>


<p>programmes, in particular the measures taken to respond to the problems of children and 
adolescents in extreme vulnerability. It appreciated Uruguay&#8217;s determination to continue 
the necessary consultations in the follow-up to the recommendations, which were accepted 
without major reservations. 
</p>
<p>528. Cuba admired Uruguay&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights, which had led 
to significant achievements in all fields, civil and political rights, as well as economic, 
social and cultural rights. As a developing country with limited resources, aggravated by 
the current economic and financial global crisis, Uruguay had nonetheless multiplied its 
efforts. The achievements reached by the country were unquestionable, including in the 
need to end impunity. Cuba highlighted the equity plan and its comprehensiveness, since it 
encompassed areas such as health, education, food, employment and social security. Cuba 
noted the indicators obtained since the plan&#8217;s application clearly reflected its effectiveness 
in combating poverty, promoting equality and social justice. Experiences such as these 
were examples of good practices for the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>529. The Russian Federation welcomed the Uruguayan delegation and noted its 
successful completion of the universal periodic review process. It welcomed the readiness 
of Uruguay to implement all recommendations, including the two recommendations 
submitted by the Russian Federation on alleviating poverty and on the outcome document 
of the Durban Review Conference. It wished Uruguay every success in implementing the 
obligations which it had assumed under the universal periodic review process.  
</p>
<p>530. Nicaragua applauded Uruguay&#8217;s cooperation in sharing its national experience in 
implementing recommendations made to strengthen its system of protection and promotion 
of human rights. Nicaragua, which prioritized citizen participation in policy and decision-
making processes as founding principle of democracy, congratulated Uruguay on having 
consulted with civil society to follow up on its international human rights commitments. 
The review of Uruguay permitted the sharing of good practices. 
</p>
<p>531. Colombia congratulated Uruguay on the referendum to be organized on 25 October 
2009, which could provide Uruguayans residing abroad with the opportunity to exercise 
their right to vote, and on the second referendum on the issue of justice, which would help 
combat all forms of impunity inherited from dictatorship. Colombia highlighted Uruguay&#8217;s 
advances in the fight against all forms of discrimination by creating a national plan against 
discrimination and by adopting laws based on the universality of human rights, reaffirming 
non-discrimination against sexual orientation. Colombia acknowledged Uruguay&#8217;s 
commitment to the defence and promotion of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>532. Following recommendations made by the Czech Republic, the Federatie van 
Netherlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie van Homoseksualiteit (COC Nederland) and the 
Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network recommended that Uruguay explicitly include sexual 
orientation and gender identity as grounds for discrimination in the development of such a 
framework. Referring to a bill pending adoption by Parliament recognizing the right of all 
persons to the free development of their personality in accordance with their gender identity 
without requiring sex-reassignment surgery, COC Nederland commended Uruguay for 
adopting this legislation as well as for its announcement to develop initiatives that 
recognized the rights of same-sex couples. It welcomed the role Uruguay had played in 
bringing attention to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons in 
international forums, and the measures taken nationally, including its leadership in being 
the first country in Latin America to provide for same-sex civil unions. 
</p>
<p>533. Conectas Direitos Humanos noted the difficulties in the consultation process in 
preparation for the universal periodic review, including the selective way of convening </p>


<p>organized civil society, without sufficient time or information to allow adequate analysis. It 
welcomed recommendations 10 and 11 reiterating the importance of civil society 
involvement. It noted the urgency of advancing the national institute for human rights, 
ensuring the necessary technical and financial resources, in line with recommendations 8, 9, 
12 and 13. It recognized the normative advances in the present legislature, but regretted the 
slow progress in approving the new penal and penal process codes incorporating protection 
to victims; the derogation of laws discriminatory to women; the updating of codification of 
crimes such as torture; and the completion of the guarantees of due process according to 
international standards. Conectas Direitos Humanos highlighted the absence of a national 
plan for education in human rights and, in this regard, welcomed recommendations 11 and 
</p><p>13.  
</p>
<p>534. The International Commission of Jurists, recommended that Uruguay derogate the 
law on the expiry of punitive claim of the State; bring legislation into line with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to avoid using prison sentences as a first instance; 
derogate unconstitutional aspects of the law for police procedures; and derogate the law of 
disrespect, defamation and injury related to civil servants. It noted with satisfaction some 
recommendations, such as the importance of revision and, if necessary, the derogation of 
laws that favoured impunity for crimes committed during the dictatorship, as well as the 
improvement of the prison system, specifically the alternative measures to liberty 
deprivation for minors. It regretted the fact that no recommendations had been made 
regarding the law on police procedure, which gives a wide margin of discretion to police 
officers. It also regretted the fact that no recommendation had been made on the law 
concerning the disrespect, defamation and injury of civil servants, which had led to the 
imprisonment of several journalists.  
</p>
<p>535. In relation to recommendation 22, the Federation for Women and Family Planning 
commended the Uruguayan Parliament for having passed, in December 2008, the 
comprehensive law to defend sexual and reproductive rights, and noted that, unfortunately, 
this was later restricted by a presidential veto; it asked about the plans to implement this 
law. It urged the Government to prioritize public policies aimed at youth and the inclusion 
of sexual and reproductive rights in these policies. It welcomed the commitments to 
increase investment to guarantee rights to freedom in terms of sexual orientation and gender 
identity, as well as the design and implementation of a national plan to combat all forms of 
discrimination. With regard to recommendations 19, 29 and 33, it noted that women victims 
of violence complained about the lack of an adequate judicial procedure. It also noted that 
procedures for reporting cases of violence against children were extremely long and lacked 
comprehensive measures to respond and provide care to those affected.  
</p>
<p>536. In relation to human trafficking (recommendations 16, 18, 43, 45 to 51) Action 
Canada for Population and Development recognized the efforts made by the State after the 
set-up of specialized courts for crimes that required special treatment. In relation to the 
prison system (recommendations 7, 28, 29, 39, 40, 52 to 60, 61, 63, 67 to 70), it expressed 
concern about prison conditions. It made reference to the 63 per cent of detainees in prison 
in preventive custody for many years and made reference to the recent death of five inmates 
in the Comcar prison. Regarding the right to truth, justice, memory and reparation and 
guarantees against non-repetition (recommendations 62, 64 to 66), it was essential to annul 
the law of expiration of punitive State claims because it was a major obstacle to the fight 
against impunity. It also referred to the excavations that had been resumed to find about 
200 people still missing and requested to know the truth about the events, access to all files 
of the repression and that the independence of the powers of the State be ensured. </p>


<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>537. Uruguay thanked all delegations for their interventions and repeated that Uruguay 
had already accepted all recommendations at the time of the adoption of the Working 
Group report in May 2009, although it was not possible to address all of them in four 
months. It noted that 130 of 600 laws adopted in the past four years expanded and further 
guaranteed human rights, which was a clear sign of the State&#8217;s commitment. Uruguay noted 
that much remained to be done, and renewed its commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>538. The review of Yemen was held on 11 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Yemen in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/YEM/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/YEM/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/YEM/3). 
</p>
<p>539. At its 18th meeting, on 24 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Yemen (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>540. The outcome of the review on Yemen comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/13), the views of Yemen concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/12/13/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>541. The delegation stated that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms were essential links in a single chain. It reaffirmed its commitment 
to all voluntary pledges made in the national report and to the implementation of the 
recommendations over the next four years. The delegation provided replies to the 21 
recommendations that were under consideration by its authorities. 
</p>
<p>542. The delegation indicated that it had accepted recommendations 2, 6, 7 and 9 to 21. 
Recommendation 6 had been accepted within the framework of the decision adopted by 
Parliament to raise the minimum age of marriage of girls to 17 years. The possibility of 
raising it to 18 years would be considered in the future. On recommendation 9, the 
delegation added that it had set up a national committee to harmonize national legislation 
with the international instruments already ratified by Yemen. Yemen accepted 
recommendation 10 within the limits of Islamic sharia. 
</p>
<p>543. Concerning recommendation 12, the delegation stated that the Yemeni constitution 
and laws criminalized and punished severely all forms of violence against women and girls, 
and that no honour crimes were committed in Yemen. On recommendation 13, the 
delegation mentioned that spousal rape did not exist in Yemen and that all marriages were 
based on mutual consent. Wives could separate from their husbands in view of divorce 
under Sharia and personal status laws. Regarding recommendation 14, Yemen noted that 
the Ministry of Human Rights, civil society organizations and ICRC were allowed to 
undertake prison visits and enquire about prisoners&#8217; conditions. </p>


<p>544. With regard to recommendation 17, the delegation added that the President of the 
Republic had declared a decision prohibiting the imprisonment of any journalist for matters 
relating to freedom of opinion and speech. With regard to recommendation 19, Yemen 
stressed that the Constitution granted the right to set up organizations to defend human 
rights in accordance with international standards to all citizens. 
</p>
<p>545. The delegation stated that five recommendations remain under review. Regarding 
recommendation 1, Yemen did not intend to become a party to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women for the time 
being. Recommendation 3 could not be supported until a decision was taken by the 
authorities in that regard. Recommendation 4 was presently not accepted and would be 
examined in the future. Regarding recommendation 5, Yemen did not intend to accept 
individual complaint procedures under the treaties to which it is a party for the present. There 
were a number of national institutions and mechanisms that received individual and group 
complaints and dealt with them in a serious manner, in conformity with constitutional 
provisions and applicable laws. On recommendation 8, Yemen did not intend, for the time 
being, to extend a standing invitation to all special procedures. This request would be 
considered by Parliament in the future. 
</p>
<p>546. The delegation indicated that it had accepted a total of 125 recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>547. Lebanon noted with deep appreciation the efforts made by Yemen within the 
framework of the universal periodic review. It welcomed measures taken by Yemen to 
strengthen and consolidate human rights despite the limited resources and challenges it 
faced. Lebanon encouraged Yemen to continue its efforts to enhance the rights of women 
and children and all other human rights. 
</p>
<p>548. Viet Nam appreciated the openness and cooperation of Yemen during the universal 
periodic review and underlined the fact that Yemen had accepted 125 of 142 
recommendations. It noted with satisfaction the measures taken to implement the 
recommendations accepted, including the two recommendations presented by Viet Nam. 
This demonstrated Yemen&#8217;s political will and commitment to respect and protect human 
rights, despite its limited resources and many economic and social challenges.  
</p>
<p>549. China appreciated the openness of Yemen towards States&#8217; recommendations. It 
underlined the drop in the poverty rate over the past decade and the substantial progress 
made in promoting people&#8217;s rights to education, health and food. China noted the 
establishment of several human rights institutions, the improvement of domestic law and 
the work done for the promotion and protection of human rights. Yemen had actively 
cooperated with the international community and United Nations human rights institutions. 
China acknowledged that Yemen still faces challenges, but expressed confidence that it 
would make further progress with regard to both the economy and human rights. 
</p>
<p>550. Algeria noted the acceptance of most recommendations, including Algeria&#8217;s 
recommendation to create an independent human rights commission. It noted with 
satisfaction Yemen&#8217;s will to continue subscribing to its human rights obligations and 
cooperating with international mechanisms, while taking into account its religious, social 
and cultural specificities. It encouraged Yemen to continue to promote women&#8217;s issues in 
development plans, to improve health-care services for women, particularly in rural areas, 
and to improve women&#8217;s access to education. It welcomed efforts to combat poverty and 
unemployment. Referring to the recent painful events in Yemen, Algeria reaffirmed its 
support for the country&#8217;s security, stability and unity.  </p>


<p>551. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) highlighted the work done by Yemen on social 
development over the past years, leading to a notable improvement in health indicators. It 
reiterated its recognition for the efforts made in the humanitarian sphere by receiving many 
refugees from Africa, stressing that this involved major challenges for Yemen and urging 
that the country be supported by the international community. Venezuela noted with 
appreciation the establishment of an institutional mechanism to comply with universal 
periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>552. Egypt welcomed Yemen&#8217;s national strategy for the promotion of gender equality in 
all areas, as well as its legislative and constitutional reforms, which were expected to have a 
positive impact on the lives of citizens. Yemen had demonstrated a strong will to strengthen 
human rights and improve living conditions of all its citizens despite scarce resources and 
the burden of fighting terrorism and hosting refugees from the horn of Africa. Egypt called 
upon the international community to provide Yemen with the necessary support so that it 
could continue its efforts to improve living conditions and promote all human rights.  
</p>
<p>553. Qatar paid tribute to Yemen for its positive and constructive attitude regarding the 
universal periodic review recommendations, 125 of which had been accepted. Despite the 
challenges faced by Yemen, it had adopted many policies and strategies to protect human 
rights; great improvements had been made in that field since 1990. The Constitution 
guaranteed all human rights. Qatar had always endeavoured to preserve Yemen&#8217;s unity, 
stability and territorial integrity, as it believed that unity was the basis for Yemen&#8217;s security 
and development.  
</p>
<p>554. Cuba noted that, despite the scarcity of resources that Yemen faced as a developing 
country, the review had pointed to its clear will to improve further the daily life of its 
citizens, in particular with respect to basic rights such as education, health, food and to 
poverty eradication. Cuba noted the measures taken to broaden health coverage and 
improve the quality of health services. It welcomed measures for the promotion and 
protection of the rights of women, in particular in areas such as access to higher positions, 
education and the labour market.  
</p>
<p>555. The Syrian Arab Republic welcomed Yemen&#8217;s strategic vision, which tied 
sustainable development to human rights, reflecting the seriousness of Yemen in improving 
the human rights situation. Yemen had been able to overcome difficulties such as lack of 
resources, poverty, terrorism and growing numbers of refugees, improving the promotion 
and protection of human rights, including the right to development. This has been done in a 
transparent and responsible manner while respecting the cultural and religious specificities 
of the State and its people. 
</p>
<p>556. Pakistan noted Yemen&#8217;s strong commitment to human rights, which was evident 
from its acceptance of most of the recommendations and the introduction of a wide-ranging 
reform process to improve the human rights situation. It expressed confidence that Yemen 
would take the steps necessary to expedite the operationalization of an independent human 
rights institution, in accordance with the Paris Principles, and take actions to implement the 
accepted recommendations. It appreciated Yemen&#8217;s openness to human rights mechanisms 
and expected the international community to extend all possible assistance to Yemen for the 
political, economic and social uplift of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>557. Bahrain welcomed the positive steps taken by Yemen to implement the universal 
periodic review recommendations and improve the human rights situation, which reflected 
Yemen&#8217;s commitment to promote human rights and cooperate with United Nations 
mechanisms. It welcomed Yemen&#8217;s interest in ensuring women&#8217;s rights and its acceptance 
of Bahrain&#8217;s recommendation to promote the role of women in society and their access to 
decision-making posts, as well as of other recommendations relating to discrimination 
against women. </p>


<p>558. The United Arab Emirates noted with appreciation Yemen&#8217;s positive steps towards 
implementing universal periodic review recommendations and voluntary commitments. It 
welcomed the efforts made by the Government to strengthen and promote human rights, in 
particular the rights of women and children. Yemen had accepted all recommendations 
related to these rights and to the rights to education and health and to poverty alleviation. It 
welcomed Yemen&#8217;s will to strengthen national institutions and raise the level of human 
rights awareness of its people. The United Arab Emirates asked the Council to extend to 
Yemen the support it requested. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>559. The International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-Europe) and the Canadian 
HIV/AIDS Legal Network, in a joint statement, commended Yemen for having accepted 
recommendation 9, but expressed serious concern that Yemen maintained the death penalty 
for consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex. The International Convention on 
Civil and Political Rights stated that, in countries that have not abolished the death penalty, 
the death sentence may be imposed only for the most serious crimes. In its resolutions on 
the death penalty and extrajudicial executions, the General Assembly had emphasized that 
homosexual acts did not fall within the definition of the most serious crimes. No 
international human rights document condoned this violation of human rights principles.  
</p>
<p>560. The Al-Hakim Foundation noted Yemen&#8217;s commitment to universal periodic review 
recommendations despite the difficulties and obstacles encountered by the country, in 
particular the ongoing military operations in the north, which had led many inhabitants to 
leave their homes. Many citizens were in need of food, shelter and medical care, and access 
to these people is difficult because of the continued fighting. It expressed concern regarding 
the increasing tension in the south, where the Government ignored claims related to basic 
services and development issues, which had led to demonstrations resulting in 
confrontations with security forces.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>561. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies had noted an increase in human rights 
violations in recent months, in particular violations of the freedom of information and the 
press and peaceful assembly by the Government, in contradiction to a number of universal 
periodic review recommendations. Recent reports had confirmed the continued use of 
political arbitrary detentions, prolonged detentions and torture by governmental authorities. 
With regard to the war in Saada, governmental forces had killed 85 civilians in an aerial 
attack the previous week, resulting in the displacement of 150,000 people. 
</p>
<p>562. Amnesty International urged Yemen to implement the recommendations on 
women&#8217;s rights, including prohibiting any practice of forced marriage of girls. It strongly 
encouraged the Government to reconsider its position on recommendations regarding the 
death penalty, which it has rejected. It welcomed Yemen&#8217;s support for recommendation 55, 
and urged it to commute all outstanding death sentences imposed on individuals convicted 
of having committed a capital offence while under the age of 18 years. It called on the 
Government to immediately end violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
law in the context of the conflict in the Saada region and to investigate urgently all 
allegations of serious violations by its forces. It requested a clarification on Yemen&#8217;s 
position on recommendations 20 and 21.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>563. Human Rights Information and Training was pleased that Yemen had accepted most 
recommendations. It called for the implementation of all recommendations, particularly 
those regarding the establishment of a human rights institution, allowing the Ministry of 
Human Rights and non-governmental organizations&#8217; greater access to prisons, especially 
those controlled by the political security department, and allowing the spread of human 
rights culture. It stressed that detainees held by the political security department should be 
given access to legal advice and information and that international humanitarian law be </p>


<p>respected during armed conflicts and the fight against terrorism. It called for enhancing 
cooperation with civil society and was concerned at Yemen&#8217;s refusal to ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>564. Human Rights Watch urged Yemen to implement the accepted recommendations, 
including in the southern and northern regions. While the Government publicly claimed to 
listen to southern grievances, its security forces had responded to largely peaceful protests 
with a crackdown and attacked independent media and outspoken southern academics and 
students. Yemen should respect recommendations 72 to 76 and commit to implement 
recommendations made by Norway and the Czech Republic. It was extremely concerned 
about the grave humanitarian consequences of current fighting in northern Yemen. The 
Government should facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of impartial humanitarian relief 
for civilians, and all parties to the armed conflict should respect the prohibition of targeting 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>565. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues<b> </b>welcomed the support of 
Yemen for several recommendations relating to counter-terrorism; Yemen should therefore 
amend its draft anti-terrorism laws. In view of the widespread use of forced disappearance, 
arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, it expressed concern at Yemen&#8217;s reluctance to 
ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Highly restricted access to 
prisons was a main concern. Fair trial guarantees were widely disregarded and the 
functioning of the specialized criminal court was unconstitutional. It noted that freedom of 
expression and press had been gradually restricted in recent years, with journalists under 
trial and eight newspapers closed after being accused of working against Yemeni unity. 
</p>
<p>566. The Arab Network for Environment and Development welcomed Yemen&#8217;s 
acceptance of most recommendations and endorsed recommendations 74 to 76 on freedom 
of opinion and the press. In implementing these recommendations, Yemen should reform 
laws in accordance with the principles of good governance and freedoms of expression and 
peaceful assembly. A number of citizens in the south had been killed, oppressed or forcibly 
made to disappear for having demonstrated peacefully. It<b> </b>endorsed recommendation 13 and 
stressed the importance of abolishing all unconstitutional exceptional courts. Several laws 
stipulate death penalty in areas not under sharia law, including freedom of opinion and 
belief. It reaffirmed the importance of ensuring equality between Jewish Yemeni citizens 
and others in enjoying all political rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>567. The delegation hoped that the international community would provide Yemen with 
every support to reach the required security, democracy and respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>568. Responding to some observations by national and international civil society 
organizations, the delegation noted that their presence and participation as well as that of 
journalists in the present discussion were proof that Yemen was a truly democratic country. 
Civil society organizations needed to substantiate their allegations with concrete evidence, 
since not everything stated was true. It asked the international community whether anyone 
would accept that rebels have the right to take up arms against the State. The war in Saada 
had been imposed on Yemen, which found itself under the obligation to defend the Yemeni 
people living in this province. Yemen had repeatedly called for an end to the hostilities and 
for dialogue through national mediations and national and regional dialogue. Regretfully, 
these calls remained unanswered by the rebels, who welcomed the language of weapons. 
The claims of the Huthis, the objectives of the war and whether the war was motivated by 
religion or was a quest for power remained unclear to the Government. The delegation 
believed that elections were the way to reach power, and noted that the recent election of 
the President had been followed by all international organizations. </p>


<p>569. With regard to internally displaced persons, it noted that the Ministry of Human 
Rights was part of the commission composed of, inter alia, United Nations funds and 
programmes (UNDP, UNICEF) and ICRC, which visited the areas of conflict and provide 
assistance. There was no shortage of assistance from neither international organizations nor 
the Government.  
</p>
<p>570. The delegation stated that prisons under the supervision of the political security 
department had been established in accordance with a law accepted by Parliament. 
Regarding the adherence of Yemen to international humanitarian law and cooperation with 
ICRC, there was a national committee dealing with the implementation of this law. The 
delegation emphasized that Yemen strove to have a full partnership with civil society 
organizations; the national human rights strategy was the best example of this cooperation. 
It reaffirmed that the Government would engage civil society and political partners to 
implement universal periodic review recommendations.  
</p>
<p>571. The delegation reaffirmed its acceptance of recommendations 20 and 21 mentioned 
by stakeholders. It stressed that a governmental committee had been established to study all 
legitimate demands of the citizens of the south and to respond to them as soon as possible. 
If there were any legitimate demands, the Government was ready to implement them all. 
The delegation added that there were no restrictions on the freedom of peaceful assembly, 
and that any arrests or closure of newspapers were made in conformity with the law. Public 
information activities were conducted in conformity with the Constitution and the press and 
publications law, which granted all citizens the right to freedom of opinion and to seek 
information, without restriction. Every citizen had the right to seek redress through the 
courts. 
</p>
<p><b>  Vanuatu 
</b></p>
<p>572. The review of Vanuatu was held on 12 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Vanuatu in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/3). 
</p>
<p>573. At its 19th meeting, on 25 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Vanuatu (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>574. The outcome of the review on Vanuatu comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/14), the views of Vanuatu concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(A/HRC/12/14/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>575. The representative of Vanuatu, the Vice-Chairperson of the Vanuatu UPR 
Committee, reaffirmed that Vanuatu was committed to the promotion and protection of the 
human rights of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>576. The representative stated that the Government had already taken positive steps 
towards the implementation of the universal periodic review recommendations through 
various policies and frameworks inside government departments and ministries.  </p>


<p>577. Vanuatu had accepted all recommendations, except for recommendations 2, 3, 5, 7 
and part of recommendation 20. Regarding recommendation 2 on the ratification of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Vanuatu was not yet 
prepared to ratify it. The existing legislative framework provided for protection against all 
forms of discrimination, including racial discrimination, for instance, in article 5 (1) of the 
Constitution. With regard to recommendations 3, 5 and 7 concerning the ratification of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families and accession to the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on the 
Civil and Political Rights, Vanuatu was not prepared to ratify them, one of the main reasons 
being the financial constraints Vanuatu was facing. An appropriate assessment and 
consultations would be undertaken with a view to ratifying these conventions when deemed 
appropriate. The second part of recommendation 20 calling for considering applying 
adequate sanctions for parents who failed to send their children to school was not 
acceptable to Vanuatu. The delegation stated that Vanuatu was prepared to provide 
appropriate counselling services to parents who fail to send their children to school.  
</p>
<p>578. Vanuatu had developed a justice sector strategy for 2009&#8211;2014, aimed at promoting 
and protecting the rights of vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, detainees, 
women and children. One major challenge was to formulate policies aimed at ensuring the 
complementarity of human rights/local legislation and custom. The representative stated 
that the Millennium Development Goals had been taken into consideration in the strategy, 
which would lead to relevant legislative reforms. Vanuatu had also established a task force 
with a view to facilitating the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals by 
ministries and departments. 
</p>
<p>579. The Department of Correctional Services had taken steps to improve the situation in 
correctional centres by renovating them and separating high-risk and low-risk detainees. A 
disciplinary committee for correctional services had also been established to handle 
complaints relating to the mistreatment of detainees.  
</p>
<p>580. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment was scheduled to visit Vanuatu on 4 December 2009 to discuss the treatment 
of detainees in the context of international standards.  
</p>
<p>581. The representative stated that the Family Protection Act had come into effect. 
Vanuatu had taken positive steps to ensure its full implementation. The Government was 
working on awareness-raising programmes for the Act in collaboration with a leading non-
governmental organization working on violence against women. Vanuatu also prioritized 
work on a proposal for the review of all relevant legislations that were discriminatory and 
that marginalized women. It had established a family protection unit within the police force 
to deal with domestic violence issues to ensure that all cases were properly investigated.  
</p>
<p>582. The delegation stated that Vanuatu was seriously considering the setting-up of a 
human rights commission or unit within the Government to oversee the implementation of 
universal periodic review recommendations. The Government had already held talks with 
some international partners for appropriate technical assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>583. Algeria commended Vanuatu&#8217;s sustained efforts to promote and protect human 
rights despite the constraints as a small-island developing State and a least developed 
country. It invited the international community and the United Nations to provide necessary 
technical assistance to further enhance this protection. Algeria was encouraged by the 
measures taken to ensure gender equality, the condition of women and their participation in </p>


<p>political life. It also noted efforts to improve the health system, combat disease and reduce 
child mortality, calling on relevant United Nations actors to provide the necessary technical 
assistance in this regard. Acknowledging the Government&#8217;s readiness to develop a policy of 
free education, it encouraged efforts to guarantee free and compulsory primary education 
by enhancing implementation of the national plan of action for education for all. Algeria 
would welcome a representation of the Pacific Islands Forum in Geneva, to be able to 
engage in dialogue with the Forum. 
</p>
<p>584. India welcomed Vanuatu&#8217;s constructive engagement with the universal periodic 
review despite the lack of a representation in Geneva, regarding this as symbolic of 
Vanuatu&#8217;s commitment to human rights. It noted with appreciation Vanuatu&#8217;s recent 
ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well 
as the enactment of the Family Protection Act, which could contribute to protecting and 
promoting women&#8217;s rights. It acknowledged the challenges Vanuatu faced as a small-island 
developing State and a least developed country.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>585. Australia recognized Vanuatu&#8217;s challenges as a small State and acknowledged the 
extensive consultations with Government departments and non-governmental organizations 
in the preparation of the report. Australia commended Vanuatu&#8217;s commitment to improving 
conditions in prisons and detention centres, particularly by separating minors and adults. 
Recognizing Vanuatu&#8217;s commitment to human rights principles, including women&#8217;s rights, 
Australia welcomed the Family Protection Act and encouraged practical steps to ensure its 
timely implementation. 
</p>
<p>586. The United States of America commended Vanuatu&#8217;s engagement with the universal 
periodic review despite its constraints. It noted that accountability and transparency in 
Vanuatu&#8217;s public sector remained an area of concern. While appreciating efforts by the 
offices of the Ombudsman and the Auditor General to investigate corruption in the public 
sector, it asked for more resources to be provided to them to allow for vigorous 
investigation. It commended the renovation of detention centres to meet international 
standards and the passage of the Family Protection Act to prevent and punish abuses 
against women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>587. New Zealand recognized that participation in the review process was a major 
undertaking for small-island States in the Pacific region and welcomed Vanuatu&#8217;s 
willingness to share its experience with other Pacific countries at a seminar on the universal 
periodic review held in early 2009. It welcomed Vanuatu&#8217;s acceptance of over 90 per cent 
of the recommendations and commended its justice sector strategy 2009&#8211;2014, which 
addressed human rights protection, including for persons with disabilities. It looked forward 
to working with Vanuatu on the implementation of the recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>588. Amnesty International welcomed Vanuatu&#8217;s progress in ensuring human rights, 
particularly the enactment of the Family Protection Act, and urged that the Act be 
implemented through training programmes for stakeholders and allocation of adequate 
resources. It also welcomed the steps taken to consolidate various family laws into a single 
one, urging that this review take place through adequate public consultation, and that the 
necessary assistance be provided by the international community. Welcoming the fact that 
Vanuatu was at the preliminary stages of ratifying the Convention against Torture, it 
encouraged Vanuatu to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. This would send a strong signal of commitment to addressing poverty-related 
issues. It urged the international community to assist Vanuatu in addressing poverty, lack of 
access to health services, clean water and adequate housing. </p>


<p>589. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network appreciated the high rate of acceptance of 
most recommendations. It encouraged the use of the format of Vanuatu&#8217;s response, since 
clarity with regard to recommendations was crucial to the universal periodic review 
process. Welcoming Vanuatu&#8217;s response on recommendation 25, it emphasized that explicit 
anti-discrimination legislation could enhance Vanuatu&#8217;s commitment to human rights and 
the protection accorded to marginalized groups. It further encouraged Vanuatu to accept the 
recommendation and to explicitly prohibit discrimination on grounds including disability, 
economic status and sexual orientation or HIV/AIDS status. It suggested that Vanuatu 
strengthen protection of marginalized groups through awareness-raising and public 
education campaigns, encouraging Vanuatu to apply the Yogyakarta Principles as guidance 
for policy-making. It also encouraged Vanuatu to join the declaration made by 67 States at 
the General Assembly in 2008, calling for an end to discrimination on the grounds of sexual 
orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p>590. Franciscans International welcomed Vanuatu&#8217;s commitment to achieving free 
education from grades 1 to 8 by 2010 and its acceptance of recommendation 42, 
encouraging Vanuatu to support children whose families could not afford to pay additional 
expenses for compulsory primary education. It also encouraged the expansion of schooling 
infrastructure to allow access to free education beyond grade 8. It called on Vanuatu to 
consider a creative secondary school curriculum and the implementation of education 
services for unemployed youth. It also encouraged Vanuatu to collect statistical data and to 
analyse the causes of the low rate of progression from primary to secondary school and the 
drop-out rates. Welcoming the standing invitation issued to special procedures, it was of the 
view that a visit of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education could contribute to the 
improvement of that right, and would provide an opportunity to share best practices with 
other countries in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>591. The delegation of Vanuatu reiterated that the universal periodic review was a new 
process for Vanuatu, but that the Government was firmly committed to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. Vanuatu would take on board the comments made by States and 
stakeholders and use them to improve its human rights-related policies and laws.  
</p>
<p><b>  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
</b></p>
<p>592. The review of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was held on 12 May 
2009 in conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and 
was based on the national report submitted by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/MKD/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MKD/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/MKD/3). 
</p>
<p>593. At its 19th meeting, on 25 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (see section C 
below). 
</p>
<p>594. The outcome of the review on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
comprises the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
(A/HRC/12/15), the views of the State concerning the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of 
the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed 
during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also A/HRC/12/15/Add.1). </p>


<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>595. The Head of Sector for Multilateral Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
stated that the recommendations made during the Working Group session largely 
corresponded to the priorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with regard to 
the promotion and protection of human rights, and would constitute an additional valuable 
guide in the country&#8217;s action in this area. The comments and suggestions clustered in 42 
recommendations were generally acceptable for the State under review. 
</p>
<p>596. With regard to international treaties, the country had recently signed the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A working group 
consisting of representatives of ministries and non-governmental organizations had been 
established to carry out all necessary activities for the ratification of the Convention and the 
protocol. The procedure for the signature and consequent ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was 
expected to commence in the near future, and there were possibilities for the ratification of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, as well as the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. On the rights of the child, the provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child were taken into consideration fully in the assessment 
of the applicable laws and in the adoption of new legislation. The country UNICEF office 
was consulted and involved. A separate department for the rights of the child within the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s office was to be formally established, in line with the recently adopted 
amendments to the law on the Ombudsman.  
</p>
<p>597. The recent amendments to the law on Ombudsman were also aimed at the consistent 
implementation of the provisions of the law on the ratification of the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture. The new law strengthened the role and the financial 
independence of the Ombudsman, established as a national prevention mechanism, and 
ensured its financial independence in line with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>598. On the Ohrid framework agreement and inter-ethnic relations recommendations, the 
framework agreement remained a priority for the Government, all envisaged laws 
regulating rights of non-majority communities had been adopted, and the recruitment 
procedures for persons belonging to non-majority communities were pursued according to 
envisaged dynamics. A committee of ministers had been established to monitor the 
implementation of the agreement and a series of projects implemented, including a joint 
UNDP, UNICEF and UNESCO project supported by the MDG Achievement Fund, centred 
on the improvement of inter-ethnic dialogue and cooperation among communities. A 
strategy entitled &#8220;Integration through education&#8221; was being drafted, the four national action 
and operative plans under the Roma Decade and Strategy had been revised, and the State 
was starting to implement a project for women in rural areas, including women belonging 
to ethnic communities. 
</p>
<p>599. On status registration, the law on registers set forth the obligation of registering the 
birth of a child; no fees were charged for documents and procedures. It had been 
established that the Roma population had the greatest problems with the registry records; 
among other things, a large number of educational and information meetings and debates 
had been organized by the Government and non-governmental organizations to deal with 
this problem. 
</p>
<p>600. The current penitentiary reform consists of two components: an improvement in the 
accommodation facilities for convicted prisoners, for remand prisoners and juveniles; and 
improvement in working conditions for the staff, and an increase in staff numbers. A 
training and education programme had been adopted, as well as an operative plan for staff </p>


<p>training. A project entitled &#8220;Piloting prison reforms in accordance with European Union 
required standards&#8221; will be implemented and funds have been requested, under the 2009 
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, for the preparation of a national prisons system 
development strategy, as well as for the assessment and implementation of a prison health-
care strategy. 
</p>
<p>601. Concerning anti-discrimination recommendations, the draft law on the protection 
against discrimination would be soon considered by the Government for formal approval. A 
series of non-discrimination training sessions had started in mid-June 2009. A series of 
public awareness-raising campaigns had also been organized. Discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender were explicitly prohibited under the draft law. The 
recommendation on the rights of same-sex partners was not at this stage acceptable for the 
country.  
</p>
<p>602. The implementation of the law on equal opportunities and of the gender equality 
plan of action was expected to help the continuous positive trend in the representation of 
women in all spheres of social life. An analysis of the relevant legislation had been 
prepared and citizen logs were designed in cooperation with Roma women&#8217;s non-
governmental organizations and the Ombudsman&#8217;s office in the context of activities to 
overcome unequal treatment and access of Roma, especially of Roma women, to State 
institutions. The national strategy for protection against domestic violence 2008&#8211;2011 was 
being implemented. All relevant institutions and ministries took measures to raise the 
expertise standards of relevant professionals. Measures were also taken to improve public 
information about legal measures to protect victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>603. A plan of action aiming at the effective implementation of the law on juvenile 
justice was in force. By-laws had been adopted and programmes for specialized training of 
all involved institutions had been prepared. The State had continually improved the 
coherence of the activities of various institutions, non-governmental and international 
working on the detection and prevention of trafficking in human beings. The Convention on 
Action against Trafficking in Human Beings had been ratified in April 2009, and a new 
national plan of action for 2009&#8211;2012 and a new strategy had been adopted. 
</p>
<p>604. The reform of the judiciary and the promotion of its independence and efficiency 
remained major priorities. The 2004 reform strategy had been fully implemented, a plan of 
action was being prepared and the judiciary budget had been increased by 11 per cent. 
There were independent and external mechanisms for control of the work of the police. The 
internal control and professional standards sector objectively and professionally examined 
all allegations of abuse by the police. 
</p>
<p>605. Concerning elections, the State indicated that it would implement fully the 
recommendations contained in the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation report of 2009, 
which involved further reform of the election system, as well as the revision of the voter&#8217;s 
list. 
</p>
<p>606. Regarding education, in particular drop-outs from school, a mentor project to help 
pupils, and parents to enrol their children in school and follow up their progress, had been 
implemented. A total of 650 scholarships for secondary schools had been awarded to Roma 
students and the secondary school enrolment criteria for Roma students have been lowered 
by 10 per cent. In the past three years, a project intended for Roma children a year before 
they start primary education had been implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Policy in cooperation with the Roma Education Fund and certain local governments. </p>


<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>607. Hungary commended the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for its full 
engagement with the universal periodic review and hoped that the implementation of the 
recommendations would contribute to the promotion of human rights in the country. It 
welcomed the clarification provided to its question concerning the credibility and 
effectiveness of the judiciary. Hungary fully supported the efforts already made to improve 
the efficiency of human rights institutions and encouraged the Government to strengthen 
further the rights of the Ombudsman in relation to non-discrimination issues. Hungary was 
convinced that the full implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement would contribute 
to the strengthening of the rights of minorities. It asked that more attention be paid to 
reassessing the legal status of the &#8220;Kosovo refugees&#8221;, and encouraged the Government to 
follow up on this issue.  
</p>
<p>608. Algeria noted the quality of the information presented, which demonstrated the 
serious approach of the authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the 
universal periodic review process. However, the process should involve not only the 
administration, but also the politicians in the country; therefore, ministerial involvement 
was encouraged. Algeria welcomed the acceptance by the State of its recommendation to 
make sure that the office of the Ombudsman was in line with the Paris Principles. Measures 
and concretes actions taken to tackle the question of dropout rates from school, in particular 
for Roma children, were underlined. Algeria also welcomed the favourable follow-up on its 
recommendation to ensure that certain minorities had access to adequate housing, 
education, employment and health care, and that particular attention was to be paid to the 
promotion of their integration in all sectors of social life. 
</p>
<p>609. The Russian Federation highlighted the serious attitude and constructive approach of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at all stages of the universal periodic review 
process. It thanked the delegation for its answers to the questions it had raised. The 
information provided demonstrated the commitment of the Government to, inter alia, 
accede to international human rights treaties and improve national human rights standards 
to bring them into line with international human rights requirements and standards. It 
understood that the creation of appropriate and effective implementation mechanisms was 
at the top of the Government&#8217;s agenda and wished the country further success in promoting 
and protecting human rights.  
</p>
<p>610. Bosnia and Herzegovina noted that the Government of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia was striving to fulfil its human rights obligations, and 
improvements had been made. Developments of plans of action, projects and strategies 
confirmed the commitment of the Government to face the human rights challenges in 
different areas. The steps taken for the adoption and ratification of international human 
rights instruments also showed the serious improvements of human rights in the country.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>611. Bulgaria noted that some improvements had been observed in the legislative and 
institutional framework of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the protection 
of human rights. It remained concerned about cases of ethnic intolerance and discrimination 
and appealed to the country&#8217;s authorities to take all appropriate measures to prevent 
discrimination based on ethnic affiliation and to foster tolerance and respect for ethnic 
diversity. Bulgaria also called on the authorities to make systematic efforts to guarantee the 
independence of the media while addressing the widespread practice of hate speech, and to 
take measures promptly to implement recommendation 13 of the report of the Working 
Group.  
</p>
<p>612. Slovenia thanked the Government for having addressed and replied to the questions 
it had raised, particularly with regard to the independence of the judiciary, the anti-</p>


<p>discrimination law and the implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement. Slovenia 
also welcomed the acceptance of its recommendation on the consolidation of the 
independence and overall capacity of the judicial system by the Government, and 
encouraged it to strengthen further the rights of minorities and the institution of the 
Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>613. The United States of America noted with concern that ethnic segregation in schools 
was increasing in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. While this was originally 
done to protect minority students from ethnically based violence, it tended to deepen the 
dividing lines between the different ethnicities, reinforce stereotypes and nullify 
reconciliation efforts. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to address the roots of 
ethnic violence and to foster tolerance and respect for ethnic diversity by focusing greater 
efforts on education. It fully supported the Ministry of Education&#8217;s goal of introducing 
courses on multiculturalism and tolerance as a means to enhance social cohesion among all 
ethnic groups.  
</p>
<p>614. Slovakia welcomed the State&#8217;s decision to implement fully the recommendations for 
improving the legislation on elections. It was pleased that the reform of the judiciary and 
the promotion of its independence and efficiency remained major priorities of the country, 
and encouraged the Government to continue all necessary efforts in preparation of the plan 
of action for justice system reform, as well as the improvement of conditions in prisons and 
detentions centres. Efforts should also be made to achieve full compliance of the anti-
discrimination law, currently in preparation, with international human rights standards. 
Slovakia also welcomed the determination of the Government to fully implement the Ohrid 
framework agreement and encouraged it to use the synergy of integration processes and 
instruments for pre-accession assistance in its efforts to tackle the challenges identified in 
the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>615. In a joint statement, the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-
EUROPE), the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Federatie van Netherlandse 
Verenigingen tot Integratie van Homoseksualiteit COC Nederland strongly commended the 
Government for having accepted most parts of recommendations 13 and 18 contained in the 
Working Group report. ILGA Europe called for the explicit inclusion of gender identity as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination in the anti-discrimination law, in order to better protect 
the rights of transgender people. ILGA welcomed the Government&#8217;s recent awareness-
raising campaigns and anti-discrimination programmes. It encouraged the Government, in 
the development and implementation of such campaigns, to work in partnership with 
relevant civil society groups and to use the Yogyakarta Principles for guidance. Regarding 
recommendation 18 (b), ILGA expressed its deep disappointment that the Government had 
decided not to treat same-sex couples in the same manner as opposite sex partners and 
urged the Government to reconsider its position on this matter.  
</p>
<p>616. The International Commission of Jurists remained concerned by frequent allegations 
of ill-treatment by law enforcement authorities and the failure to take effective measures to 
prosecute and punish the perpetrators, as required by the State&#8217;s international human rights 
obligations. It also regretted that the Working Group had not addressed some of the key 
issues for the effective prevention of torture, including the lack of prompt, effective and 
confidential access to a lawyer, and the need for a prompt, independent medical 
examination of those alleging torture or ill-treatment, as well as effective review by judicial 
bodies of the legality of the detention. It called on the Government to carry out an 
independent investigation on the circumstances of Mr. al-Masri&#8217;s abduction and detention 
in the country and the role of its intelligence services in that regard.  </p>


<p>617. Action Canada for Population and Development urged the Government to 
implement the Ohrid framework agreement fully, especially with respect to Roma 
communities. It also urged the Government to prioritize the formulation of an anti-
discrimination legal framework and the strengthening of administrative structures to 
sanction any form of discrimination. It called attention to the fact that shelter centres for 
victims of domestic violence remained inaccessible for Roma girls under the age of 18 who 
suffered violence based on early and/or arranged marriages within their families. With 
regard to the Kosovo Roma refugees, it expressed concern that the process of granting 
asylum was not fully gender-sensitive. It reported that there were cases of women who 
suffered the worst forms of gender-based violence, to the families of which the asylum 
status was denied. Concerning the situation of begging Roma children, it urged the 
Government to introduce affirmative measures to eliminate begging. Almost half of those 
children had problems of addiction and were thus in conflict with the law. It also strongly 
urged the Government to, inter alia, consider an amnesty for all children under the age of 
16 years for whom the State did not offer programmes to combat their addictions.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>618. In her concluding remarks, the head of the delegation indicated that all suggestions 
had been duly taken into account. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
acknowledged that improvement was always possible in relation to human rights and was 
living up to that belief. The country had developed a tolerant society, with its own 
specificities. It was also seeking to resolve its difficulties and was open to any further 
discussion on the issues raised by delegations. The universal periodic review process, in 
which the entire Government was fully involved, was an excellent opportunity to assess 
achievements, in terms of both national and international commitments, and to see where 
the country stood on a number of issues. The delegation reiterated that the 
recommendations would serve as useful guide in policy design and action on human rights, 
and the recommendations and suggestions given would be included therein. The State 
would continue to cooperate fully and engage with the review process in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comoros  
</b></p>
<p>619. The review of the Comoros was held on 13 May 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on information 
presented by Comoros, in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 
15 (a); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/5/COM/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/COM/3). 
</p>
<p>620. At its 18th meeting, on 25 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on the Comoros (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>621. The outcome of the review on the Comoros comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/16), the views of the Comoros 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>622. The delegation of the Comoros expressed its gratitude for the efforts made by the 
United Nations, and in particular the Secretariat, to ensure the participation of the 
delegation of the Comoros in the universal periodic review. Mexico, the United Kingdom </p>


<p>and Ghana were thanked for their assistance in the preparation of the outcome of the 
review, which the Comoros hoped would be adopted.  
</p>
<p>623. The delegation considered that almost six months after the review of the Comoros, 
positive results could rightly be expected regarding the human rights concerns raised. 
Regarding the attempted secession on the island of Anjouan in 2008, the delegation 
announced that the detained military separatists had been released and returned to their 
island of origin. It also stated that the politicians in Grande Comore who defied the 
implementation of the revised Constitution no longer faced judicial investigation and were 
not in detention.  
</p>
<p>624. The delegation stated that the 52 recommendations supported by the Comoros 
represented a commitment and reiterated their firm intention to implement them. The 
country was deeply attached to the ideals of human rights and reiterated that the outcome of 
the review would be fully embraced by the Comoros. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>625. Qatar appreciated that the Comoros had accepted 52 recommendations, including 
recommendation 45, presented by Qatar, on further efforts to provide education to all 
school-aged children free of charge. It applauded achievements such as the establishment of 
federal institutions in the context of the ongoing political and constitutional reform. It noted 
the lack of economic and financial resources and challenges posed by poverty, 
unemployment and illiteracy, particularly in realizing economic, social and cultural rights, 
as well as in reaching the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals. Qatar paid 
tribute to the efforts of the Comoros to combat corruption and poverty and with regard to 
good governance, in order to achieve human and social development. Qatar wished for 
more progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in the Comoros.  
</p>
<p>626. Algeria commended the Comoros for the efforts made in spite of the challenges 
faced and scarce resources. It noted that the acceptance of recommendations indicated the 
determination of the Comoros to implement its international human rights commitments. 
Algeria congratulated the Comoros, in particular, on the release of the detained rebels. It 
welcomed its efforts to fight poverty and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against 
women by adopting a national policy for gender equality and promoting the participation of 
women in public affairs and economic life. It commended its efforts to prepare a national 
growth and poverty reduction strategy and a national plan of action for access to education 
for all. It appreciated the acceptance of recommendations on training of judicial and law 
enforcement officials to improve child protection and juvenile justice systems. Algeria 
called on the international community to support the Comoros in its efforts. 
</p>
<p>627. Bahrain welcomed the adherence by the Comoros to human rights principles and 
values. It commended the Comoros for the commitments implemented or being 
implemented, in spite of the economic and social impediments. It applauded the policies 
and programmes to protect and promote human rights, including economic, social and 
cultural rights, as well as the right to development, in order to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals. It referred to the measures taken to alleviate poverty and increase 
education and health care for all. Bahrain appreciated the efforts made to improve the 
situation of women and to encourage the appointment of women to decision-making 
positions and their participation in economic activity. It welcomed the national policy for 
equity and justice and further measures to guarantee equality between men and women at 
work.  
</p>
<p>628. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya stated that the participation of the Comoros in the 
universal periodic review indicated the importance the country gave to human rights in </p>


<p>spite of the difficulties faced. It noted the number of structures set up in the Comoros for 
the protection of women and women&#8217;s rights, the mechanisms for the protection of children 
and the new strategies for the empowerment of women and to ensure access to education. It 
commended the efforts made to combat poverty and to continue securing access to 
education and health. It welcomed the accession of the Comoros to numerous international 
human rights conventions, and the fact that the interactive dialogue had resulted in 
recommendations accepted by the Comoros. It hoped that the United Nations and the 
international community would offer assistance to the Comoros, as required to support its 
efforts to improve the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>629. Morocco observed that the support of the majority of recommendations illustrated 
the determination of the Comoros to move forward in a spirit of transparency and 
objectivity. Morocco welcomed the decision of the Comoros to accept the 
recommendations concerning improvements in the situation of women and the promotion 
of education for children. It noted the readiness of the authorities to take measures to reduce 
child and maternal mortality and to improve the access of children to health care. It stated 
that implementing the recommendations required support and assistance from international 
agencies, such as WHO. The efforts made by the Comoros, despite scarce resources, 
showed the firm will to modernize and democratize government. It stated that substantial 
assistance and support from the international community to the Comoros was necessary and 
justified.  
</p>
<p>630. Senegal stated that, by accepting most recommendations, the Comoros had 
confirmed its readiness to improve the human rights situation in a difficult context. Senegal 
welcomed the willingness of the Comoros to accede to other international human rights 
instruments. It also looked favourably upon the acceptance of the recommendation 
concerning the establishment of a national human rights institution. The existence of such 
an institution could greatly contribute to the strengthening of the institutional human rights 
framework. Senegal encouraged the Comoros to be vigorous in its efforts to ensure the 
effective implementation of the accepted recommendations, and appealed to the 
international community to assist in this regard. 
</p>
<p>631. Ghana thanked the Comoros for the further clarifications to the recommendations, 
and appreciated the measures already taken since the review, including the release of the 
detained rebels. It recalled that the Comoros had announced its strong attachment to human 
rights ideals and its commitment to foster real human development, despite many economic 
and social constraints. It appreciated the State&#8217;s acceptance of 52 of the 59 
recommendations and its willingness to work with the Council to strengthen efforts to 
address human rights issues in the country. The Comoros deserved the support of the 
Council and the international community in its desire to improve the promotion and 
protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>632. The International Lesbian and Gay Association addressed recommendation 4 in 
paragraph 66 of the report and noted that same-sex activity between consenting adults was 
criminalized by article 318 of the penal code. It noted that the Human Rights Committee 
had repeatedly confirmed that such laws violated the rights to both privacy and non-
discrimination, contrary to articles 17 (1) and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and referred also to the calls by the High Commissioner on the issue. It 
noted the delegation&#8217;s responses that homosexuality was not prosecuted and the law not 
enforced, and considered that, if this was this case, the Government should be willing to 
accept the recommendation. Even when not enforced, such laws undermine the human 
dignity of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. It urged the Comoros to bring the </p>


<p>penal code into line with international human rights obligations by repealing those 
provisions, and to accept the recommendation to organize awareness-raising campaigns. 
</p>
<p>633. The International Human Rights Association of American Minorities appreciated the 
recommendations reflected in the outcome of the review. It expressed concern at the reports 
of harsh and insanitary conditions in which a number of people were held in detention. It 
commended the ratification of additional instruments, including the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It also commended efforts to improve the situation 
of children, reduce infant mortality, fight poverty and achieve gender equality, despite the 
serious challenges. It noted that climate change would have a negative impact on the human 
rights to life, health, food and water, and also affect the adequate standard of living and the 
environment. It demanded that the Council and the international community support the 
Comoros in its efforts to promote and protect human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>634. The Comoros welcomed the statements calling upon the international community to 
support the country to improve the promotion and protection of human rights. Regarding 
the concerns raised by the International Lesbian and Gay Association, the delegation 
reiterated that consenting adults had never been prosecuted in the Comoros for engaging in 
homosexual relations. The delegation took note of the recommendation to revise article 318 
of the penal code. In this respect, the Comoros recalled that countries did not evolve in the 
same manner and that time was needed for changes to materialize. In closing, the Comoros 
reaffirmed that it would strive to make human rights ideals a reality in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Slovakia 
</b></p>
<p>635. The review of Slovakia was held on 13 May 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the national report 
submitted by Slovakia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 
(a) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/SVK/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/SVK/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/5/SVK/3). 
</p>
<p>636. At its 19th meeting, on 25 September 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Slovakia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>637. The outcome of the review on Slovakia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/12/17), the views of Slovakia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/12/17/Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome  
</b></p>
<p>638. The delegation of Slovakia stated that the universal periodic review process was a 
unique opportunity to assess the implementation of its international human rights 
obligations. The majority of recommendations had been identified as constructive and 
target-oriented, and many of the recommended measures had already been incorporated in 
plans of action and were at different stages of implementation.  
</p>
<p>639. The delegation emphasized that the majority of recommendations had been related 
to the Roma and the improvement of their standard of living, access to appropriate housing, </p>


<p>education, health care, employment, as well as to the elimination of acts of discrimination, 
ethnically motivated violence, and ill-treatment by law enforcement authorities towards the 
Roma. Slovakia considered this set of recommendations very complex and requiring huge 
financial resources, effort and cooperation of all involved, and noted that solutions were not 
imminent but would materialize in the future. 
</p>
<p>640. The delegation stressed that Slovakia had accepted 79 recommendations without any 
reservation, had not accepted nine recommendations, and supported three recommendations 
with reservations. 
</p>
<p>641. Slovakia noted that it could not accept recommendation 9, which called for the 
adoption of a comprehensive legal instrument that would recognize the rights of persons 
belonging to minority groups and would offer necessary protection, especially to children. 
Slovakia attached great importance to the protection of minority groups, including children. 
The rights of persons belonging to national minorities were guaranteed by the Constitution 
and other existing legal norms. Slovakia deemed this framework sufficient and did not 
foresee any new legal instrument.  
</p>
<p>642. Similarly, recommendation 11 proposed the development of more legislative 
guarantees aimed at achieving full compliance with the provisions of the Framework 
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and of the European Charter for 
Regional or Minority Languages. The delegation stated that the existing legislative 
guarantees were sufficient. The Council of the Government for National and Ethnic 
Minorities had reviewed the current periodical reports on the implementation of these two 
conventions without requesting any additional measures. 
</p>
<p>643. With regard to recommendation 14 calling for the formulation and implementation 
of a national plan of action on the protection of civil rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and 
transgender persons, the delegation drew attention to the plan of action for the prevention of 
all forms of discrimination, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance, which was 
a comprehensive document pertaining also to the rights of those persons. 
</p>
<p>644. Slovakia did not accept recommendations 67 to 69 and underlined that forced 
sterilization had never been an official State policy or an officially endorsed practice, and 
that therefore the Government could not take any political responsibility. The accusations 
of forced sterilizations of Roma women in Eastern Slovakia had elicited an immediate 
reaction from the Government, which initiated a criminal prosecution against unidentified 
offenders for the criminal offence of genocide. In 2003, the criminal prosecution was 
stopped, as it was apparent that the act for which the criminal prosecution had been 
undertaken had not taken place. In this connection, the legislation on health care was 
revisited, and Act No. 576 of 2004 stipulated the conditions necessary for sterilization, and 
institutionalized &#8220;informed consent&#8221; as a precondition for sterilization. 
</p>
<p>645. Slovakia did not accept recommendation 72, which called for enacting and 
implementing new legislative norms in order to put an end to discriminatory practices 
against Roma in the educational process. The School Act of 2008 and the Anti-
discrimination Act provided equal conditions for all children with regard to access to 
education. The School Act accentuated equal access to education and training and the 
prohibition of all forms of discrimination and segregation as the main principles of training 
and education. The delegation considered that, for the time being, the above-mentioned 
legal framework was sufficient. 
</p>
<p>646. Slovakia did not accept recommendations 75 to 76 proposing working out and 
implementing a strategy for addressing the disproportionate enrolment of Roma children in 
special schools. The delegation stated that the School Act provided clear criteria for 
enrolling children in specialized schools or classes, and clearly defined and distinguished 
between children and students with special educational needs, handicaps, disabilities, or feeble </p>


<p>health from those who came from a socially disadvantaged environment. No additional or new 
measures were planned. 
</p>
<p>647. With regard to the recommendations that Slovakia supported with reservations, the 
delegation stated that, while supporting the general aim of the second part of 
recommendation 47 calling for combating the exploitation of children in the workplace, it 
stressed that no cases of exploitation of children in the workplace had been reported, as the 
employment of children under 15 years of age was prohibited. 
</p>
<p>648. Slovakia expressed a reservation to<b> </b>recommendation 55, which proposed measures 
on religious freedom and more flexible norms and rules for religious groups with a small 
number of believers and avoiding their discrimination. It considered that the 
recommendation did not identify clearly the nature of the requested flexibility, the 
quantitative parameters of a small number of believers and the form of discrimination to be 
avoided. 
</p>
<p>649. Slovakia had a reservation to<b> </b>recommendation 22 asking for regular responses to 
questionnaires sent by special procedures mandate holders. As a small country, Slovakia had 
limited capacities and, despite all efforts, might not always be able to provide the requested 
information. Slovakia would do its outmost to meet the requirements, but asked for 
understanding if it did not always respond on time. 
</p>
<p>650. The delegation stressed that Slovakia had accepted the remaining 79 
recommendations. It considered the universal periodic review a continuing process and 
expressed its determination to implement the recommendations received through the 
cooperation of governmental and non-governmental bodies. Slovakia remained committed 
to working towards the implementation of the voluntary pledges undertaken when 
presenting its candidature to the Council. 
</p>
<p>651. In conclusion, the delegation highlighted that Slovakia had been among the first 
countries to sign the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, on 24 September 2009. It also noted that the information about the 
universal periodic review recommendations and their implementation would be presented at 
the upcoming meeting of the Council of the Government of Slovakia for non-governmental 
non-profit organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>652. Hungary welcomed Slovakia&#8217;s steps and recalled its recommendation to improve 
further the legislative guarantees of the rights of national minorities. It noted that the Slovak 
Parliament had amended the State Language Act on 30 June 2009, which entered into force 
on 1 September 2009, and said that, on several points, the Act ran counter to the various 
international commitments Slovakia had undertaken. Instead of protecting and promoting 
the rights and identities of national minorities, the law limited them. It expressed a 
preference for a mutually acceptable solution, based on international norms and serving the 
legitimate interests of minorities. It highlighted that Hungary and Slovakia had been 
involved in bilateral negotiations, also relying on international actors, in particular the 
OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities and that, on 10 September 2009, the 
heads of Government of Hungary and Slovakia had agreed to accept fully the 
recommendations of the High Commissioner concerning the amended language law. The 
two countries discussed the implementation of this commitment. Hungary hoped to inform 
the Council on progress achieved at the second Minority Forum in November 2009. 
</p>
<p>653. Algeria noted that Slovakia was a party to the majority of human rights instruments, 
which demonstrate its determination to promote and protect all human rights. It was 
encouraged by Slovakia&#8217;s readiness to examine the possibility of adhering to the </p>


<p>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. It welcomed the creation of a national strategy for gender 
equality (2009&#8211;2013) and the measures taken to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women, in particular the progressive integration of women in higher ranking and 
decision-making positions, as recommended by Algeria. It welcomed Slovakia&#8217;s efforts to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals and its commitment to increase the volume of 
official development assistance to least developed countries. 
</p>
<p>654. The Russian Federation believed that Slovakia&#8217;s review was in conformity with the 
requirements contained in General Assembly resolution 60/251 and in Council resolution 
5/1. It noted that the positive result was achieved thanks to the serious approach of the 
Slovak delegation at all phases of the process, and that Slovakia had agreed without 
reservation to most recommendations. It wished Slovakia further progress in the protection 
and promotion of human rights and the utmost success in the implementation of the 
commitments made during the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>655. Amnesty International was concerned that large numbers of Roma children were 
placed unnecessarily in special schools and classes for children with mental disabilities, 
which severely reduced future education and employment opportunities. It regretted the 
rejection by Slovakia of recommendations 75 and 76, and urged it to reconsider them 
without delay. It noted that several States had raised concerns about reported cases of 
forced sterilization of Roma women without their prior and informed consent. It remained 
concerned at the continued failure of the authorities to carry out impartial and effective 
investigations in this regard. The authorities&#8217; denial of cases of forced sterilizations in 
public hospitals was worrying in the light of reports of a series of halted prosecutions into 
cases of alleged forced sterilizations. Amnesty International regretted Slovakia&#8217;s rejection 
of recommendations 67 to 69 and urged the Government to reconsider them.  
</p>
<p>656. The International Gay and Lesbian Association of Europe, on behalf of Federatie 
van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie von Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC Netherlands and 
other associations, welcomed Slovakia&#8217;s acceptance of recommendation 14 to formulate 
and implement a national plan of action for the protection of the civil rights of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender persons, as well as the confirmation that the national plan of 
Action for the prevention of all sorts of discrimination was a comprehensive document 
pertaining also to the above-mentioned rights. It urged Slovakia to ensure the inclusion of 
sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds of discrimination in human rights 
legislation; to develop comprehensive legislation regulating gender reassignment 
procedures; to take legislative measures ensuring that same-sex couples enjoyed equal 
rights and obligations as opposite-sex couples; and to use the Yogyakarta Principles on the 
application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender 
identity as a guide to policymaking and the national plan of action. It commended Slovakia 
for supporting the joint statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity 
delivered at the General Assembly in December 2008, on behalf of 67 States from all five 
United Nations regions. 
</p>
<p>657. Franciscans International emphasized that any assessment of the social and 
economic status of the Roma population must be preceded by an accurate reflection of their 
situation, and encouraged Slovakia to consider data-gathering as a priority in its plans of 
action. It stressed that the State&#8217;s housing policy, focusing on the provision of economic 
instruments, should ensure that the Roma&#8217;s particular cultural and social contexts were 
taken into account. It stated that Slovakia must ensure effective participation of the Roma in 
decision-making processes on education and health related-matters and to identify why 
Roma children who were not in need of special education were enrolled in such schools, </p>


<p>and to analyse the reason for the large presence of such schools in Roma communities. It 
urged Slovakia to engage in campaigns for the promotion of an effective right to education.  
</p>
<p>658. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence stressed Slovakia&#8217;s spirit of 
cooperation and noted Slovakia&#8217;s efforts with regard to education, refugees&#8217; rights, the fight 
against racism, prohibition of torture and cruel and inhuman behaviours, poverty reduction, 
the fight against human trafficking, the protection of women and children&#8217;s rights, and 
attention to the rights of ethnic minorities. The lack of a fully independent human rights 
monitoring body at the national level was a highly noticeable problem which could be 
rectified by removing restrictions and expanding the authority of the current national centre 
for human rights. It also highlighted how the development and expansion of bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation, technical support, promotion of public awareness and the adoption 
of an interactive approach could help reaching a common human rights understanding and 
common objectives. The Organization hoped that, with the expansion of cooperation in 
human rights, particularly with civil society and non-governmental organizations, Slovakia 
could improve further the country&#8217;s human rights situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>659. The delegation of Slovakia thanked the delegations and non-governmental 
organizations that had taken the floor and for the positive views expressed. The delegation 
noted also some critical ideas or dissatisfaction regarding the responses provided by 
Slovakia and recalled the answers it had provided in its national report, oral statements and 
written responses. It assured that it would work on all recommendations in the hope that the 
views would be more positive in four years, when Slovakia undergoes its second review. 
</p>
<p>660. In addition to the response to Hungary&#8217;s recommendation given in May 2009, 
Slovakia reported on the forthcoming reviews by the Council of Europe, before the end of 
2009, regarding the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and 
the European Charter. Slovakia would see from these two monitoring exercises if there was 
any need for further improvement.  
</p>
<p>661. Regarding the new issue of the amended State Language Act, Slovakia expressed its 
satisfaction that the matter was becoming part of normal and civilized dialogue between 
friends and neighbours. Judging from the opinions of the OSCE High Commissioner on 
National Minorities, Slovakia was confident that the law was in line with its international 
obligations. Slovakia would focus on the implementation of the recommendations that both 
Slovakia and Hungary received from the High Commissioner and Slovakia would, together 
with Hungary, work on the implementation of the amended law and on the rules of 
implementation. The delegation stated that, on 25 September 2009, the Joint 
Intergovernmental Commission on National Minorities had met in Bratislava. It hoped that 
the final results of this and other meetings expected to be held in the future would be 
satisfactory to both sides.  
</p>
<p>662. While thanking for the interest attributed to the human rights situation in Slovakia, 
the delegation assured that Slovakia considered the universal periodic review a continuing 
process. Slovakia was at an early stage on the process and would provide sufficient 
attention to the recommendations.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Administrative and programme budget implications of 
resolutions adopted by the Council at its twelfth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>  12/15. 
&#8220;Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.2, the Human Rights Council 
requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to hold a workshop on 
regional arrangements on a regular basis and to convene the next one in the first semester of 
2010, to allow further sharing of information and concrete proposals on ways and means to 
strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements in the field 
of human rights and the identification of strategies to overcome obstacles to the promotion 
and protection of human rights at the regional and international levels, with the 
participation of representatives of the relevant regional and subregional arrangements from 
different regions, experts and interested Member States of the United Nations, observers, 
national human rights institutions and representatives of non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total additional amount of 
$445,800 would be required to implement activities under section 2 (General Assembly and 
Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management), for conference 
services ($176,100); section 23 (Human Rights) for travel of participants and experts and 
consultant services ($267,500); and section 28 E (Administration, Geneva) for conference 
services ($2,200). 
</p>
<p>3. The requirements to implement activities called for under the draft resolution have 
not been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $445,800 would be required for 
the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested at this time, as the 
Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the 
requirements within the provisions proposed for sections 2, 23 and 28E for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  12/17. 
Elimination of discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p>4. In paragraphs 15 and 16 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.3/Rev.1, the Council: 
</p>
<p>(a) Requested the High Commissioner to prepare a thematic study on women&#8217;s 
equality before the law, including an assessment on how the issue is addressed throughout 
the United Nations human rights system, in consultation with States, relevant United 
Nations bodies and mechanisms and agencies, including the Committee on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the agencies within the United Nations 
composite entity on gender equality and empowerment of women and all other relevant 
stakeholders, taking into account the efforts made in this regard, particularly by the 
Commission on the Status of Women, and to include recommendations on the ways and 
means the Council can engage with States in the fulfilment of their obligations and 
commitments to eliminate discriminatory laws against women; 
</p>
<p>(b) Decided to address the above-mentioned study, including conclusions and 
recommendations, at its fourteenth session, and to hold a half-day discussion on the issue in 
order to consider taking further possible action on discrimination against women at that 
session. </p>


<p>5. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $18,000 
would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) to provide for travel of experts from 
various regions to participate in a one-day panel discussion.  
</p>
<p>6. The requirements to provide for the travel of additional experts have not been 
included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. Although it is 
anticipated that a total additional amount of $18,000 would be required for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested at this time, as the Secretariat will seek to 
identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the requirements within the 
provisions proposed under section 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  12/18. 
The adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products 
and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. In paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.4, the Council decided to hold a 
panel discussion on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and 
dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its thirteenth session, 
with equitable geographic and gender participation of relevant experts and representatives 
of civil society, with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on 
adequate measures to control, reduce and eradicate these phenomena. 
</p>
<p>8. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $18,000 
would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) for experts from various regions to 
participate in a one-day panel discussion. 
</p>
<p>9. The requirements to implement activities in response to the draft resolution have not 
been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $18,000 would be required for 
the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested at this time, as the 
Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the 
requirements within the provisions proposed for section 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011.  
</p>
<p><b>  12/23. 
The right to development 
</b></p>
<p>10. In subparagraphs 2 (e) and (f) of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.6, the Council 
decided: 
</p>
<p>(a) To renew the mandate of the Working Group on the Right to Development 
until it completes the tasks entrusted to it by the Council in its resolutions 4/4 and 9/3, and 
that the Working Group shall convene annual sessions of five working days and submit its 
reports to the Council; 
</p>
<p>(b) To request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) to continue to take all necessary measures and allocate necessary 
resources for the effective implementation of the resolution, taking into account the needs 
for the effective implementation of the work plan for the task force referred to in paragraph 
2 (b) of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>11. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $206,900 
per annum or $413,800 per biennium would be required to implement activities under 
section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference 
Management) ($185,400 per annum or $370,800 per biennium); section 23 (Human Rights) 
($17,700 per annum or $35,400 per biennium); and section 28 E (Administration, Geneva) 
($3,800 per annum or $7,600 per biennium). </p>


<p>12. The requirements to implement activities in response to the draft resolution have 
been included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, therefore 
additional provisions are not required. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to subparagraph 2 (f), attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI 
of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent 
resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which 
the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and 
reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.  
</p>
<p><b>  12/4. 
World programme for human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>14. In paragraphs 4 and 7 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.9, the Council, requested: 
</p>
<p>(a) OHCHR to prepare, in cooperation with relevant intergovernmental 
organizations, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization and non-governmental actors, a plan of action for the second phase of the 
World Programme (2010&#8211;2014)and to submit it for consideration to the Council at its 
fifteenth session, keeping in mind that it should be properly structured, formulated in 
realistic terms and include an indication of at least minimum action and provisions to 
support activities undertaken by all actors; 
</p>
<p>(b) The United Nations Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee for Human Rights 
Education in the School System to submit a final evaluation report of the implementation of 
the first phase of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, based on national 
evaluation reports, in cooperation with relevant international, regional and non-
governmental organizations, to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. 
</p>
<p>15. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $163,500 
would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) for the travel costs of 20 
experts/participants and consultant services for elaboration of the plan of action called for 
in paragraph 4 ($134,600); and consultant services for the final evaluation report called for 
in paragraph 7 ($28,900). 
</p>
<p>16. The World Programme for Human Rights Education is part of the programme of 
work envisaged under section 23 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011. It is therefore considered that the requirements of $163,500 to implement 
activities called for under the draft resolution are provided for within the provisions 
proposed for section 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  12/21. 
Promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms through a better understanding 
of traditional values of humankind  
</b></p>
<p>17. In paragraphs 1 and 2 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.13, the Council requested: 
</p>
<p>(a) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, 
within existing resources, in 2010, a workshop for an exchange of views on how a better 
understanding of traditional values of humankind in conformity with international human 
rights law can contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, with the participation of representatives from all interested States Members of 
the United Nations, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and civil 
society, as well as experts selected with due consideration given to the appropriate 
representation of different civilizations and legal systems; </p>


<p>(b) The Office of the High Commissioner to present to the Council a summary of 
the discussions held at the workshop in conformity with the programme of the Council. 
</p>
<p>18. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $197,000 
would be required to implement activities, under section 2 (General Assembly and 
Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) ($114,400); section 23 
(Human Rights) ($81,000); and section 28 E (Administration, Geneva) ($1,600). 
</p>
<p>19. The requirements to implement the activities proposed in the draft resolution have 
not been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $197,000 would be required for 
the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested at this time, as the 
Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the 
requirements within the provisions proposed for sections 2, 23 and 28E for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011.  
</p>
<p>20. With regard to paragraph 1, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.  
</p>
<p><b>  12/25.

</b></p>
<p>21. In paragraph 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.18, the Council decided to extend by

the Special Rapporteur to report on the implementation of his mandate to the Council at its 
fifteenth session and to engage in a constructive manner with the Government of Cambodia 
for the further improvement of the situation of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>22. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $56,200 
would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) to provide for travel of the Special 
Rapporteur and OHCHR staff, and for general operating expenses during missions 
undertaken by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>23. The requirements to implement activities in response to the draft resolution have 
been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No 
additional resources would arise from adoption of the draft resolution.  
</p>
<p><b>  12/119. 
The effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of 
States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and 
cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>24. In paragraphs (a) and (b), of draft decision A/HRC/12/L.22, the Council decided to 
request OHCHR: 
</p>
<p>(a) To assist the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights in the implementation of the 
activities envisaged in Council resolution 11/5; 
</p>
<p>(b) To allocate sufficient budgetary resources for the implementation of the 
activities envisaged in its resolution 11/5, including the organization and holding of 
regional stakeholder consultations on the draft general guidelines on foreign debt and </p>


<p>human rights during the present term of the mandate holder (i.e., before the end of that term 
on 30 April 2011). 
</p>
<p>25. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $603,400 
would be required to implement activities, under section 2 (General Assembly and 
Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) for conference 
services and interpretation services during regional consultations ($201,800); section 23 
(Human Rights) for travel of experts, participants and staff and consultant services for five 
regional stakeholder consultations, to be held before April 2011 ($393,600); and section 28 
E (Administration, Geneva) for conference services ($8,800). Since the exact venues for the 
regional consultations are not known at this time, four assumed venues have been used for 
costing purposes. In that regard, the estimates do not include other costs usually incurred 
during the holding of regional meetings, such as rental of conference facilities, special 
security arrangements and miscellaneous expenses. 
</p>
<p>26. The requirements to implement the activities called for in the draft resolution have 
not been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $603,400 would be required for 
the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested, at this time under the 
regular budget. OHCHR will seek to fund the activities from extra budgetary resources, if 
available. In the event that sufficient extra budgetary resources are not available to fund the 
activities, the Secretariat will identify areas under the regular budget from which resources 
can be redeployed to meet the requirements within the provisions proposed for sections 2, 
23 and 28E for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>27. The Council decisions and resolutions adopted by the Council at its tenth, eleventh 
and twelfth sessions have resulted in additional resources in the 2010&#8211;2011 biennium 
which, although they have been proposed by the Secretariat to be met within provisions 
proposed under the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, will raise the issue of 
whether the proposals for new additional resources can be accommodated. It will therefore 
only be known during implementation of the 2010&#8211;2011 programme of work on which 
source of funding will be utilized to fund the activities called for in the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to paragraph (b), attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

<p><b>  12/28. 
Follow -up to the tenth special session of the Human Rights Council on the impact of 
the global economic and financial crises on the universal realization and effective 
enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>29. In paragraph 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.25, the Council decided to hold a 
panel discussion during the high level segment of its 13th session, to discuss and evaluate 
the impact of the financial and economic crises on the realization of all human rights 
worldwide, with a view to contribute to the work of the Open-ended Working Group of the 
General Assembly to follow up on the issues contained in the outcome document of the 
Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development, 
held in New York from 24 to 30 June 2009. 
</p>
<p>30. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total additional amount of 
$18,000 would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) for the travel of experts from 
various regions. </p>


<p>31. The requirements to implement activities called for under the draft resolution have 
not been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $18,000 would be required for 
the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested at this time, as the 
Secretariat will seek to identify resources that can be redeployed from the provisions to be 
made under section 23 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  12/1. 
Open-ended intergovernmental working group on the review of the work and the 
functioning of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>32. In paragraphs 1, 2 and 7 of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.28, the Council: 
</p>
<p>(a) Decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group with 
the mandate to review the work and the functioning of the Council; 
</p>
<p>(b) Also decided that the working group should hold two sessions for five 
working days each, in Geneva, after its fourteenth regular session; 
</p>
<p>(c) Requested the Secretary-General to provide the working group with all the 
necessary resources and facilities in order for it to carry out its mandate. 
</p>
<p>33. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $614,600 
would be required for the holding of two sessions for five working days each in Geneva in 
2010, under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and 
Conference Management) ($607,000), and section 28 E (Administration, Geneva) ($7,600). 
</p>
<p>34. The requirements to implement the activities proposed in the draft resolution have 
not been included under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $614,600 would be required for 
the biennium 2010&#8211;2011, no additional resources are requested at this time, as the 
Secretariat will seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the 
requirements within the provisions proposed for sections 2 and 28 E for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011.

<p>35. With regard to paragraph 7, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

Assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights  
</b></p>
<p>36. In paragraphs 10, 11 and 13, of draft resolution A/HRC/12/L.29, the Council: 
</p>
<p>(a) Decided to renew the mandate of the independent expert on the situation of 
human rights in Somalia for a period of one year, with a view to maximizing the provision 
and flow of technical assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights in order to support 
the Transitional Federal Government and regional authorities to ensure respect for human 
rights and strengthen the human rights regime in its work to complete the outstanding task 
of the transitional mandate, and requested the independent expert to submit a report on the 
status of implementation of technical cooperation inside Somalia to the Council at its 
thirteenth and fifteenth sessions; 
</p>
<p>(b) Encouraged the independent expert to devote, in the fulfilment of his 
mandate, specific attention to building the effective capacity of the rule of law, the </p>


<p>harmonization of laws, appropriate mechanisms to address impunity and the training of 
Somali security personnel on international human rights standards, also paying close 
attention to all human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, the right to 
adequate food, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health and the right to education; 
</p>
<p>(c) Requested the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all 
the human, technical and financial assistance necessary to carry out his mandate. 
</p>
<p>37. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $127,800 
would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) during the mandated period to 
implement the activities envisaged. 
</p>
<p>38. The related requirements for travel of the independent expert and OHCHR staff and 
general operating expenses during field missions have been included in the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No additional provisions would be 
required as a result of adoption of the draft resolution by the Council.
