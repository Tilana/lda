</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur has developed this framework for communications into an 
online digest, which illustrates the international standards with pertinent excerpts of the 
mandate holders&#8217; findings since 1986 according to the categories of the framework for 
communications. The online digest is available on the website of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights.1 
</p>
<p>3. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been 
obliged to summarize in this report the communications sent and received. As a result, 
replies from Governments could not be published in their entirety. The names of alleged 
victims are reflected in this report, although exceptions may be made in relation to children 
and other victims of violence in relation to whom publication would be problematic. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of cases transmitted and replies received 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Afghanistan  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent on 31 August 2009 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Independent Expert on 
minority issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding the <b>Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law</b> recently passed 
and published in the official Gazette on 27 July 2009 (Gazette 988). There are serious 
reasons for concern that the Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law violates the human rights of minority 
Shi&#8217;a women and girls, is in breach of Afghanistan&#8217;s national and international obligations, 
and will further entrench discrimination and violence against women, girls and members of 
religious minorities. Reportedly, while this new law contains a number of changes as 
compared to an earlier version of March 2009, several contentious provisions of the law 
have not been adequately amended to ensure their compliance with Afghanistan&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations or to bring it in line with Afghanistan&#8217;s constitutional 
guarantees.  
</p>
<p>5. The following listing illustrates a number of serious human rights concerns 
contained in the provisions of the new law as gazetted on 27 July 2009:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The law makes it impossible for Shi&#8217;a wives to inherit houses and land from their 
husbands, even though husbands may inherit them from their wives 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Only men are allowed guardianship rights  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A female virgin, whatever age she may be, is treated as a legal minor and requires 
the consent of her &#8220;guardian&#8221; to enter into marriage 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The law effectively condones the denial of maintenance by a husband to his wife if 
she refuses his sexual demands or what he perceives to be his &#8220;conjugal rights&#8221;;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A woman&#8217;s mobility, including the right to leave her house, continues to be 
potentially restricted to varying degrees, depending on the interpretations given to 
the qualifications in the provision which refer to &#8220;legitimate purposes&#8221; and &#8220;to the 
extent that local custom allows&#8221;  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Under-age Shi&#8217;a girls can be married against their will before the legal age of 
marriage if a guardian can demonstrate in a court that the child has the &#8220;ability and 
interest&#8221; to marry and they have reached puberty 
</p>
<p><b> (b) No response received from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has so far not received a reply from the 
Government of Afghanistan concerning the above mentioned allegations. She urges the 
Government to uphold its commitments to safeguard the rights of women and girls as 
contained in the following international treaties, which it has ratified: the Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 2 (f) of the Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, requires States Parties to &#8220;take 
all appropriate measure, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, 
regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women.&#8221; In 
General Recommendation No. 21 (1994) on equality in marriage and family relations, the 
Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women states that 
&#8220;many countries in their legal systems provide for the rights and responsibilities of married 
partners by relying on the application of common law principles, religious or customary 
law, rather than by complying with the principles contained in the Convention. These 
variations in law and practice relating to marriage have wide-ranging consequences for 
women, invariably restricting their rights to equal status and responsibility within marriage. 
Such limitations often result in the husband being accorded the status of head of household 
and primary decision-maker and therefore contravene the provisions of the Convention.&#8221; 
(para. 17). 
</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to General Assembly 
resolution 63/181 which urges States &#8220;to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and 
discrimination based on religion or belief, [&#8230;] with particular regard to members of 
religious minorities in all parts of the world, and devoting particular attention to practices 
that violate the human rights of women and discriminate against women, including in the 
exercise of their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief&#8221; (para. 12 a). She 
would also like to recall that the General Assembly in the same resolution invites all actors 
to address in the context of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, inter alia, within the 
framework of international human rights, &#8220;the situations of violence and discrimination that 
affect many women as well as other individuals on the grounds or in the name of religion or 
belief or in accordance with cultural and traditional practices&#8221; (para. 16 b).  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would also like to recall the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, 
in particular its article 4 which states that &#8220;States shall take measures where required to 
ensure that persons belonging to minorities may exercise fully and effectively all their 
human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination and in full equality 
before the law&#8221;. Women belonging to minority communities must not face discriminatory 
treatment either in relation to members of wider society or relative to male members of their 
own community. Equally, article 4, paragraph 2, establishes that &#8220;States shall take measures 
to create favourable conditions to enable persons belonging to minorities to express their 
characteristics and to develop their culture, language, religion, traditions and customs,<i> 
except where specific practices are in violation of national law and contrary to 
international standards</i>&#8221; (emphasis added). The Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize that the Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law, as it is drafted, contains provisions that are 
discriminatory and contrary to international standards. </p>

<p><b> B. Angola 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent on 20 November 2009 as a follow-up to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
country visit to Angola in November 2007 
</b></p>
<p>9. In a follow-up letter of 20 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur reiterated her 
appreciation for the cooperation of the Government in relation to her visit to Angola from 
20 to 27 November 2007. She emphasized that follow-up to country reports was of central 
importance to the cooperation and dialogue between mandate holders and States. Referring 
to her previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/8, para. 17), the Special 
Rapporteur indicated that the aim of such follow-up letters after country visits was to 
receive updated information about the implementation of the recommendations at the 
national level.  
</p>
<p>10. For ease of reference, the Special Rapporteur also transmitted a table containing the 
conclusions and recommendations in the related mission report (A/HRC/7/10/Add.4) as 
well as follow-up information from relevant United Nations documents, including from the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review, Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies. 
The Special Rapporteur asked the Government to provide her with updated information on 
the consideration given to these recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and 
any constraints which may prevent their implementation. This table, including any 
information provided by the Government, is available online on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
website (www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/visits.htm).

</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Urgent appeal sent on 20 March 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; and urgent appeal sent on 9 April 2008 jointly with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Independent Expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>13. In their urgent appeal of 20 March 2008, the Special Procedures mandate holders 
brought to the attention of the Government information they had received regarding reports 
of <b>violence during demonstrations in the Tibet Autonomous Region</b> <b>and surrounding 
areas in China</b>, killings of an unconfirmed number of people and arrests of hundreds of 
demonstrators. According to allegations received, demonstrations led by monks were 
organised on 10 March 2008 demanding greater freedom of religion and the release of 
monks detained since October 2007. It is reported that 300 monks from Drepung 
Monastery, near Lhasa, proceeded with a peaceful march towards the Potala Palace when 
they were stopped by the police. It is believed that around 60 monks suspected to be the 
leaders of the protest were arrested by the Public Security Bureau (PSB). Summaries of this 
joint urgent appeal are already reproduced in A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 23-33.  
</p>
<p>14. Subsequent to their urgent appeal of 20 March 2008, the Special Procedures 
mandate holders transmitted, in another urgent appeal of 9 April 2008, information they had 
received in relation to reports of <b>killings, injuries and arrests of protestors </b>in Gan Zi 
Xian, Sichuan Province, and the arrests of over 570 Tibetan monks, including children, in 
Aba Xian and in Ruanggui/Zoige Xian in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Summaries of this 
joint urgent appeal are already reproduced in A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 36-39. At the time 
the report to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council was finalized, the Special 
Rapporteur was not yet in a position to reflect the content of the reply from the Government 
of China dated 21 May 2008 as she had not received the translation of its content from the 
relevant services. The English translation has been carried out in the meantime and the 
Special Rapporteur reproduces its text below. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 21 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>15. In its letter dated 21 May 2008, the Government of China responded to the joint 
urgent appeals of 20 March 2008 and 9 April 2008. The Government indicated that the 
events which had occurred in March 2008 in Lhasa and other places were incorrectly 
described as &#8220;peaceful demonstrations&#8221; but were actually serious acts of criminal violence, 
involving beating, the destruction of property, looting and arson. Faced with such violent 
criminal acts, which seriously disrupted public order and did serious damage to human life, 
property and security, it emphasized that no responsible Government could simply sit back 
and not act. The Government indicated that the situation in the aforementioned areas had 
subsequently calmed down, and stability and public order had been restored. The judicial 
authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the other areas in question were dealing 
with the criminal suspects severely, in accordance with judicial procedures. Those whose 
offences were lesser and who displayed a positive attitude, acknowledging their guilt, had </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>been released. Those whose situations are more serious, the Government added, shall have 
their criminal responsibility investigated in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government indicated that the aforementioned serious violent criminal events 
had been carefully plotted in advance and instigated by the Dalai clique. The Government 
emphasized that, in their handling of the entire incident, the competent authorities of the 
Tibet Autonomous Region and other areas showed great restraint; they enforced the law in a 
civilized manner, and they enjoyed broad popular support. The Government argued, 
however, that some people at the international level had distorted the facts, creating untrue 
news stories and providing the United Nations special procedures with inaccurate 
information.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government stressed that Tibetan affairs were part of China&#8217;s internal affairs; 
nevertheless, in an effort to help the special procedures learn the truth about these events 
and to prevent the Dalai clique and anti-China elements from exploiting them, the 
competent authorities had thoroughly investigated the incidents described in the 
aforementioned letters and the Government provided the following details: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>The truth about the violent criminal events:</i> In mid-March 2008, a series of serious 
violent criminal acts took place in the city of Lhasa, in China&#8217;s Tibet Autonomous 
Region. Starting on 10 March 2008, a group of lawbreakers, acting without 
authorization, gathered illegally to create a disturbance; when police officers arrived 
to dissuade them, in accordance with the law, they clashed with them, cursing them 
and violently attacking the officers with clubs, rocks and knives. At approximately 
11 a.m. on 14 March 2008, some monks at the Ramoche Temple threw stones at the 
police officers on duty. Subsequently, a group of rioters began to gather in Barkhor 
Street, shouting separatist slogans and wantonly beating, smashing and looting. The 
situation quickly spread. The lawbreakers smashed and burned shops, primary and 
secondary schools, hospitals, banks, electrical and communications installations and 
news agencies along the main streets of Lhasa and set fire to cars, chased and beat 
pedestrians, and attacked stores, telecommunications and Internet outlets and 
Government offices. The rioters&#8217; savage behaviour during these incidents resulted in 
the slashing or burning to death of 18 innocent persons, including an infant less than 
one year old; 382 innocent persons were also injured, 58 of them seriously. The 
rioters set fire to over 300 sites, burning down 7 schools, 5 hospitals, more than 
1,300 stores and 120 homes, causing extensive loss of human life and property, and 
occasioning a direct economic loss of 280 billion yuan renminbi. Public order in the 
affected area was severely disrupted. All ethnic minorities in Tibet expressed their 
great indignation at and severe criticism of the violent criminal acts that took place 
in Lhasa. The Tibet Autonomous Region quickly organized the police and other 
relevant agencies to put out the fires, provide aid to the injured and reinforce the 
security provided to schools, hospitals, banks and Government offices. The Chinese 
Government and the Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region took these 
measures to protect law and order and social stability, and to safeguard the human 
rights of all ethnic groups in Tibet. In dealing with these violent criminal incidents 
and restoring law and public order in accordance with the law, the competent 
Chinese and Tibetan Government authorities exercised the utmost restraint. While 
enforcing the law they consistently acted in a lawful and civilized manner; they did 
not carry or use any lethal or injurious weapons. The People&#8217;s Liberation Army was 
not involved in the efforts to quell these violent criminal incidents. At 11 a.m. on 16 
March 2008, more than 300 monks in Aba, Sichuan Province, assaulted and beat 
police officers, handing out inflammatory flyers and shouting separatist slogans; 
they threw rocks and homemade Molotov cocktails at the police and went on a 
rampage of smashing and burning. At 3 p.m., a group of monks joined with other 
rioters to once again strike Government facilities, schools and police stations, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>engaging in smashing, looting and burning. On that day, rioters burned down 24 
stores and 2 police stations and set fire to 81 police and civilian vehicles. Some 200 
innocent bystanders, Government workers and police officers were injured. Seeking 
to restore law and order, the local Government immediately took steps to bring the 
situation under control and protect life, property and fundamental human rights. 
During these incidents, law enforcement was carried out in a civilized manner by the 
local police, who consistently displayed a high degree of restraint; even though they 
had shields to protect themselves during the rioters&#8217; brutal attacks, scores of police 
officers were injured from blows and burns, one critically. The Chinese People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army did not take part in the response to these incidents. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Questions regarding the use of lethal or injurious weapons:</i> In their efforts to deal 
with the violent criminal acts in the Tibet Autonomous Region in accordance with 
the law and to restore law and order, the local Government authorities exercised 
maximum restraint: law enforcement was consistently carried out in a lawful and 
civilized manner, and no lethal or injurious weapons were carried or used. For this 
very reason, there were only 242 casualties among law enforcement personnel, 
including 23 seriously injured and one dead. On 16 March 2008, in the Tibetan 
Autonomous Prefecture of Aba, Sichuan Province, rioters broke into the Aba 
Township police station and stabbed the police officers. When the rioters stole 
police firearms from a safe, the police fired warning shots, in accordance with the 
law, to no effect. They were thus compelled to open fire in self-defence, striking and 
injuring four rioters, who managed to escape with their co-conspirators in the 
confusion. Immediately afterwards, the officers involved in the incident, acting 
pursuant to regulations, submitted a report to their superiors, which the national 
police promptly published. The firing of weapons in self-defence by the Aba police 
was fully consistent with the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials, adopted at the Eighth United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Alleged control of reporting by the media: </i>During the violent criminal acts in Lhasa, 
when public order was severely disrupted and rioters were wilfully beating, burning 
and killing innocent persons, it was not safe for foreign reporters in Lhasa to cover 
the events. Reporters for the British publication The Economist and other foreign 
publications who were at the scene did provide coverage of the events. After the 
situation calmed down, the Chinese Government immediately organized a series of 
inspection tours to Tibet for representatives of 19 foreign media and delegations of 
foreign diplomats based in China. The Chinese media, including the Tibetan 
regional media, all reported on the events. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>The legal basis for the arrest and detention of monks and nuns:</i> In the wake of the 
destructive events in Lhasa, the competent authorities of China and the Tibet 
Autonomous Region arrested a number of major criminal suspects who had 
participated in the events and had been involved in their organization and plotting. 
Among these were a number of monks and nuns. International human rights 
instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 29, para. 2), 
stipulate that &#8220;[i]n the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject 
only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing 
due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the 
just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic 
society&#8221;. During the aforementioned incidents the rioters showed absolutely no 
respect for the rights and freedoms of innocent persons but wilfully disrupted public 
order and harmed the welfare of others. The Chinese and Tibetan Regional 
Governments consider that the lawful measures taken were fully consistent with the 
relevant provisions of international human rights instruments. China is a country </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>governed by the rule of law. Everyone is equal before the law, and anyone who 
violates the law shall be liable to punishment in accordance with the law, with no 
distinction made for citizens on account of their religious beliefs. During the violent 
criminal acts that were perpetrated in Lhasa and other locations, a small number of 
monks and nuns took part in unauthorized demonstrations; in the course of these 
demonstrations they engaged in violent activities that led to the death of scores of 
persons and the injuring of hundreds more; they burned and destroyed public 
property, including numerous homes and schools, they advocated separatism, they 
harmed the State and they jeopardized public safety, seriously violating the Law of 
the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions and Demonstrations and 
the Criminal Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The treatment shown by 
China&#8217;s law enforcement and judicial authorities will differ depending on the nature 
of the criminal offence: where the offence is serious, the offender&#8217;s criminal 
responsibility will be ascertained; where the offence is minor, the offender will be 
provided with education and released. This work is already under way. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Investigations, prosecutions and trials:</i> In the wake of the violent criminal events 
that transpired in Lhasa, the law enforcement and judicial authorities of China and 
the Tibet Autonomous Region conducted investigations and inquiries in accordance 
with the law. On 29 April 2008, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court 
held an open trial of some of the persons accused of participating in the &#8220;events of 
14 March&#8221;. The court found 30 accused persons (Pasang et al.) guilty of the crimes 
of arson, looting, instigating fights and troublemaking, assembling a group to attack 
a State organ, disrupting public service and theft. The defendants Pasang, Sonam 
Tsering and Tsering were sentenced to life imprisonment. The defendants Jigme, 
Kalsang Bagdro, Karma Dawa, Dorje, Migmar, Ngawang Choeyang and Bagdro 
were given sentences of fixed-term imprisonment of 15 years and more. The 
defendants Yargyal, Choephel Tashi, Dorje Dargye, Ngawang, Kalsang Tsering, 
Migmar, Sonam Tsering, Kelsang Samten, Tseten, Palsang Tashi, Lhagpa Tsering 
Chewa (Sr.), Lobsang Tashi, Lhagpa Tsering, Darchen, Thubten Gyatso, Tashi 
Gyatso, Kalsang Dondrub, Tenzin Gyaltsen, Kalsang Nyima and Yeshe were given 
sentences of fixed-term imprisonment ranging from 3 to 14 years. The court 
informed the accused that if they refused to accept these judgements they could file 
an appeal with the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court or with the Tibet 
Autonomous Region Supreme People&#8217;s Court within 10 days of the date of service 
of the judgement. China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that People&#8217;s Courts 
may or should appoint a defence counsel in cases where the defendant has not 
appointed counsel, the case is of great social significance, the defendant is totally 
without financial resources or the court considers that the prosecution arguments and 
evidence submitted may affect the proper determination of the severity of the 
sentence. Accordingly, the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court appointed 
defence attorneys for the 30 defendants. The defence arguments presented by these 
lawyers were given full value during the trial proceedings, and the mitigating 
circumstances that they cited in respect of the defendants, which were verified 
through investigation, were all accepted by the court. China&#8217;s Criminal Procedure 
Law stipulates that all citizens who are members of ethnic minorities have the right 
to use their own spoken and written language in an appeal. Of the 14 open hearings 
held in the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, the proceedings were fully 
conducted in the Tibetan language in 9 cases, while in the remaining 5 cases the 
defendants were provided with Tibetan-Chinese interpretation. It has been explained 
that the costs associated with the defence lawyers and interpreters provided for the 
defendants were entirely borne by the Tibet Autonomous Region Legal Aid Centre. 
On the day of the hearings, more than 300 Lhasa residents, students and monks 
representing all ethnic minorities and all groups within society attended the trials. </p>

</b></p>
<p>The judicial authorities of the Tibet Autonomous Region and other localities intend 
to continue their efforts to deal in accordance with the law with the criminal suspects 
who participated in these violent criminal acts. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Related cases:</i> Owing to time constraints and the incomplete nature of the 
information contained in the aforementioned letters, as well as the fact that the 
investigations being conducted by the Chinese authorities concerned are still in 
progress, the Government will continue to transmit to the relevant bodies 
information regarding the outcome of these investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of China replied to the joint 
urgent appeals of 20 March 2008 and 9 April 2008.

<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding the cases of <b>16 deaths of Falun Gong practitioners due to 
injuries allegedly sustained in custody</b> in China. While the circumstances under which the 
deaths occurred differ, all the victims were Falun Gong practitioners and they all died under 
the supervision of law enforcement officers or soon after their release from custody. 
Concern is expressed that the arrests and deaths of these individuals were solely connected 
with their activities as Falun Gong practitioners. 
</p>
<p>20. Ms. <b>Hu Yanrong</b>, from Xiaoyushulin Village, Beilu Township, Lingyuan City, 
Liaoning Province: On 1 August 2007 around 10 p.m., police officers blocked the entrance 
of the home of a Falun Gong practitioner, where some 40 persons including Hu Yanrong 
were present. About midnight, a dozen police officers arrested those practitioners trapped in 
the house. They beat the practitioners with electric batons and two-inch long metal rods and 
forced them into police vehicles. The police claimed that Hu Yanrong tried to jump out of a 
police car. She sustained severe injuries and fell into a coma after being taken to the 
Lingyuan Prison Hospital. Her head was swollen, her eyes, nose and mouth were bruised, 
the area between her temples and eyes was coloured in dark purple. There were traces of

committed suicide while on his way to the Sichuan Province Xinhua Forced Labor Camp, 
by jumping out of the vehicle. Mr. Xiong&#8217;s father was forced to sign the paper authorizing 
his body to be cremated immediately. He was also asked not to leak any information to the 
public; otherwise, his other two sons would lose their jobs. According to information 
received, the authorities gave inconsistent accounts of the cause of death, saying that he 
committed suicide in one instance and that he died in a traffic accident in other instances.

stopped their vehicle when they were on their way home, arrested them and took them 
directly to the Tongzhou District Detention Centre. On 6 February 2008, Yu Zhou died at 
the Qinghe District Emergency Centre. The police claimed that this was a result of him 
going on hunger strike although he had diabetes. However, other sources indicate that he 
had been healthy and had never been suffering from diabetes. When the family requested to 
see the body and to have an autopsy performed, the authorities refused and threatened them.  
</p>

of their possessions and interrogated them at the police station. When they refused to reveal 
any information, the officers poured boiling water over their necks and bodies. Three days 
later, they were taken to Pingdu City Detention Centre. Guards put shackles on Zhong 
Zhenfu and whipped him about the head with metal wires. He was detained in a metal cage 
with the shackles still on, and the guards ordered other inmates to ill-treat him. The latter 
tried to force him to curse the founder of Falun Gong. When he refused, they beat him for 
over an hour. He was sent to the hospital and released on medical parole, after having been 
forced to pay over 100,000 Yuan in medical expenses. He died on 20 July 2008. 
</p>
<p>33. Ms. <b>Yang Jingfen</b>, a resident of Panjin City, Liaoning Province: At approximately

they had received regarding the death of Mr. <b>Phuntsok Rabgay</b>, a 27-year-old monk, in 
Drango County, Garz&#234; Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province. On 25 March 
2009, Phuntsok Rabgay was pasting leaflets containing allegations that monks had been 
tortured and imprisoned by the authorities and an appeal to the local population to forego 
crop cultivation and harvest as a gesture of mourning and disobedience. He was detected by 
Drango County Public Security Bureau (PSB) personnel and tried to elude arrest by fleeing 
on a motorcycle. The PSB personnel, however, managed to pursue and catch him. Upon 
arrest, they beat him with batons. He died shortly thereafter. The PSB officers reportedly 
dropped his body from a hill in order to create the appearance of a case of suicide. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteurs, inter alia, referred to General Assembly resolution 63/181,

information they had received regarding Mr. <b>Yusufjan (Yuesefujiang)</b> and Mr. <b>Memetjan 
(Maimatijiang)</b>, two ethnic Uighurs belonging to the Muslim Fellowship. On 10 May 2009, 
Yusufjan and Memetjan, along with five other students of the Muslim Fellowship, held a 
meeting at Xinjiang University in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, 
in northwest China. The meeting was broken up by two officers from the local internal 
security police force, accompanied by more than ten men in plain clothes, who proceeded to 
take all seven men away for interrogation. The five other students were released after 15 
days and fined 5.000 yuan for &#8220;holding an illegal gathering&#8221;. The current legal status and 
whereabouts of Mr. Yusufjan and Mr. Memetjan remain unknown. Concern was expressed 
for their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Procedures mandate holders appealed to the Government to ensure the 
right to freedom of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on 
Religion or Belief and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. They also 
recalled that, according to article 2 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, persons belonging to national or 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities have the right to enjoy their own culture, to 
profess and practice their own religion, and to use their own language, in private and in 
public, freely and without interference or any form of discrimination. The Special 
Procedures mandate holders requested the Government to provide the full details of any 
prosecutions which have been undertaken and to explain how the arrest of Mr. Yusufjan and 
Mr. Memetjan is compatible with international human rights norms and standards, including 
with the right to freedom of religion or belief, as contained, inter alia, in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.

<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>46.  The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding Mr. <b>Zhou Xiangyang</b>. He was sentenced to 9 years 
in prison in May 2003, because he allegedly refused to give up his belief in Falun Gong. 
Reportedly, he was brutally tortured and was locked in a solitary cell for four months in the 
winter. At Gangbei Prison, Mr. Zhou was verbally and physically abused, and was detained 
in isolation numerous times. In February 2009, the guard captain at Gangbei Prison 
informed that Mr. Zhou was being force-fed five times per day and that he could die at any 
moment. When his family visited him two months later, four prisoners had to carry Mr. 
Zhou out of his cell as he was too weak and thin to walk by himself. During the visit, the 
other prisoners monitored his conversation and would kick him as a warning to change the 
subject, when they had the impression that he was disclosing information about the 
treatment he had experienced in prison.

<p>47. In April and mid-May 2009, Mr. Zhou was taken to the Police Hospital for 
emergency treatment, including intravenous injections. Mr. Zhou&#8217;s family requested his 
release on bail for medical treatment, but this was refused by the Gangbei Prison. The 
prison authorities allegedly indicated that he had to renounce his belief before he could be 
released for medical treatment. Based on Mr. Zhou&#8217;s deteriorating health, concern was 
expressed for his physical and mental integrity.

<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 4 September 2009

<p>48. On 4 September 2009, the Government of China replied to the joint urgent appeal of 
14 July 2009. Since the Special Rapporteur had not received the response&#8217;s translation from 
the relevant services at the time this report was finalized, she is unfortunately not in a 
position to summarize in English the content of the Government&#8217;s response in the present 
report. However, a copy of the original response letter is available online at the following

</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of China replied to the joint 
urgent appeal of 14 July 2009 and hopes to be able to make observations on the response in 
the next report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Communication sent on 5 August 2009  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she 
had received regarding the <b>draft legislation on children&#8217;s freedom of religion being 
considered in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region</b>. Reportedly, the regional 
government of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region was actively considering a draft 
legislation that would strengthen the existing legal restrictions on children&#8217;s freedom of 
religion or belief and parent&#8217;s freedom to impart religious education to their children. The 
draft legislation would build on the 1993 Implementing Measures for the Law on the 
Protection of Minors currently in force in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region which 
provides that &#8220;parents or other guardians may not permit minors to be engaged in religious 
activities&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>51. The draft legislation under consideration would allegedly include provisions 
indicating that &#8220;no organisation or individual may lure or force minors to participate in 
religious activities or use religion to obstruct minors&#8217; compulsory education&#8221;. Where minors 
are &#8220;lured&#8221; or &#8220;forced&#8221; into such activities, the draft legislation provides that children &#8220;can 
ask for protection from schools, neighbourhood committees, village committees, offices for 
the protection of minors or public security organs. Such organisations or work units 
receiving requests for help must take measures in a timely manner and not refuse or shift 
responsibility&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>52. While respecting the need to legislate on the question of freedom of religion or 
belief in order to protect children from exploitation or abuse, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed her concerns that the adoption of such draft legislation was specifically aimed at 
unduly restricting the freedom of religion or belief of the members of the Uighur Muslim 
community in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Furthermore, if adopted, the draft 
legislation could foster the existing tensions which had led to the violent clashes that 
erupted during Han and Uighur demonstrations in Urumqi on 5 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur appealed to the Government to ensure that the freedom of 
religion or belief of children and parents in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region is 
protected in accordance with the fundamental principles as set forth in Convention on the 
Rights of the Child to which China is a Party. The Convention affirms in its article 14 that 
&#8220;States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and 
religions; States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when 
applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her 
right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; Freedom to manifest 
one&#8217;s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law 
and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. In case the proposed draft legislation would entail limitations on children&#8217;s and 
parent&#8217;s freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur asked the Government to 
explain how these limitations would be compatible with international human rights law. She 
also asked the Government to indicate if any measures were envisaged to prevent the 
recurrence of violent clashes following the recent inter-religious tensions and violence 
between the Han and the Uighur Muslim communities. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 26 October 2009

<p>55. On 26 October 2009, the Government of China replied to the communication of 5

of the Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding Mr. <b>Wang Yonghang</b>, a former lawyer from 
Dalian City, Liaoning Province. On 4 July 2009, Mr. Wang Yonghang was arrested by two 
dozen Dalian police officers for &#8220;using a cult to damage the social and legal system&#8221;. He 
was severely beaten during his arrest, resulting in the breaking of his right ankle. He did not 
receive adequate medical treatment until 11 August 2009, when he had surgery as a result of 
a serious infection in his ankle. The police did not notify Mr. Wang&#8217;s family about the 
operation. However, on the same day, Mr. Wang&#8217;s family was provided with his arrest 
warrant, dated 10 August 2009.  
</p>
<p>58. Mr. Wang Yonghang is currently being detained at Dalian City Detention Center, 
where he has allegedly been subjected to more beatings. His family and lawyer have not 
been able to see him, because his case allegedly involves &#8220;state secrets&#8221;. His family has 
repeatedly complained to the relevant authorities about Mr. Wang Yonghang&#8217;s ill-treatment, 
but has not received any response. Mr. Wang Yonghang&#8217;s license to practice law was not 
renewed following his annual review period on 31 May 2008. Mr. Wang Yonghang has also 
published several open letters online in which he advocated for religious freedom and 
explained his views on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners. Concern is expressed that 
Mr. Wang Yonghang&#8217;s detention may be related to his work as a defence lawyer for Falun 
Gong practitioners. In light of above allegations of denial of adequate medical treatment and 
of beatings, further concern is expressed for Mr. Wang&#8217;s physical and psychological 
integrity.

</b></p>
<p><b> 8. Communication sent on 2 September 2009 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding the sentencing of Mr. <b>Palden Gyatso</b>, Mr. <b>Tsultrim</b>, Mr. 
<b>Sangpo</b>, Mr. <b>Jamyang Khedrub</b>, Mr. <b>Gendun</b>, and Mr. <b>Shrab Sangpo</b>, six monks from 
Ragya Monastery in Qinghai Province, Tibet Autonomous Region, together with Mr. <b>Hu-lo</b> 
and Mr. <b>Yang-kyab </b>from Gya-sa village.  
</p>
<p>62. On 10 March 2009, Mr. Tashi Sangpo, a monk from Ragya Monastery in Magin 
County, Qinghai Province, was arrested after the authorities allegedly found political 
leaflets and the banned Tibetan flag in his room. He was reportedly subjected to beatings, 
inhumane treatment and long interrogations during his detention. On 21 March 2009, Mr. 
Tashi Sangpo allegedly escaped from the detention centre after he asked to use the 
bathroom, and committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.  
</p>
<p>63. On the same day, several thousand monks and local Tibetans in and around Ragya 
Monastery gathered to demand an answer for Mr. Tashi Sangpo&#8217;s death. In response, the 
government authorities allegedly arrested monks from the Ragya Monastery, as well as 
local Tibetans.  
</p>
<p>64. On 13 August 2009, the Machen County People&#8217;s Court in Golog, Qinghai Province, 
tried and sentenced the following persons to varying prison terms for &#8220;inciting protests and 
demonstrations against the Chinese government&#8221; for taking part in demonstrations on 21 
March 2009:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Palden Gyatso, monk and disciplinarian at Ragya Monastery, sentenced to seven 
years of imprisonment 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Tsultrim, monk and former disciplinarian at Ragya Monastery, sentenced to four 
years of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Sangpo, monk and former treasurer at Ragya Monastery, sentenced to three 
years of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Jamyang Khedrub, monk and secretary of the Board of Directors at Ragya 
Monastery, sentenced to two years of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Gendun, monk, sentenced to one year of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Sherab Sangpo, monk, sentenced to two years of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Hu-lo from Gya-sa village, sentenced to one year of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Yang-kyab from Gya-sa village, sentenced to six months of imprisonment  
</p>
<p>65. Furthermore, according to reports received, psychological trauma has been inflicted 
on the monastic community through the imposition of &#8220;patriotic education&#8221;, requiring them 
to denounce the Dalai Lama, which has reportedly intensified in the aftermath of region-
wide protests in the Tibet Autonomous Region beginning in March 2008. Reports claim that 
since March 2008, 15 persons, including monks and nuns, have committed suicide in 
addition to Mr. Tashi Sangpo, and that three monks have attempted to commit suicide. 
These persons include:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Namdrok Khakyab, visiting scholar at Samye Monastery from Dorjee Drak 
Monastery, committed suicide on 19 March 2008 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1

Sichuan Province, committed suicide on 16 April 2008  
</p>

2008  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Trangma, monk at Drapa Yangden Monastery in Minyang Township, 
Nyagchuka County, Sichuan Province, committed suicide on 18 June 2008  
</p>

Ngaba Country, Sichuan Province, committed suicide on 3 July 2008  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Shedup, monk at a monastery in Tongren Country, Qinghai Province, 
committed suicide on 2 April 2009  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Kelsang and Mr. Damchoe, monks from Drepung Monastery, both originally 
from Kirti Monastery in Sichuan Province, attempted to commit suicide in April 
2008 by stabbing themselves in the chest, hands and wrists 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Tapey, monk at Kirti Jepa Monastery in Ngaba Country, Sichuan Province, 
attempted to commit suicide by self-immolation on 27 February 2009 as protest 
against the ban on Monlam religious festival. Reports claim that when Tapey was on 
fire, three gun shots were fired at him by the Chinese police 
</p>
<p>66. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Palden Gyatso, Mr. Tsultrim, Mr. 
Sangpo, Mr. Jamyang Khedrub, Mr. Gendun, Mr. Shrab Sangpo, Mr. Hu-lo and Mr. Yang-
kyab to imprisonment may represent a direct attempt to stifle freedom of expression, 
freedom of assembly and freedom of religion or belief in the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
Further concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of monks 
and nuns in the region, in light of the reported rise in the number of suicides.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteurs appealed to the Government to ensure the right to freedom 
of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief 
and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Furthermore, they referred to 
General Assembly resolution 63/181, in which the Assembly urges States &#8220;to step up their 
efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this 
end: [&#8230;] (b) To ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, 
liberty or security of person because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrary arrest or </p>

<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>detention on that account and to bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these 
rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to provide information on the basis 
upon which Mr. Palden Gyatso, Mr. Tsultrim, Mr. Sangpo, Mr. Jamyang Khedrub, Mr. 
Gendun, Mr. Shrab Sangpo Mr. Hu-lo and Mr. Yang-kyab have been sentenced to 
imprisonment and how that is compatible with the international norms and standards on the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion or 
belief. They also recalled that during the fourth session of the Universal Periodic Review in 
February 2009, the Government indicated that the recommendation of the Working Group 
to strengthen the protection of ethnic minorities&#8217; religious, civil, socio-economic and 
political rights is &#8220;pertaining to measures already being implemented or which had already 
been implemented&#8221; (A/HRC/11/25, para. 115). In this regard, the Special Rapporteurs asked 
the Government to provide details regarding how such measures are strengthening the 
protection of the rights of persons in the Tibet Autonomous Region, in particular persons 
belonging to the monastic community. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 26 October 2009

Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding Mr. <b>Li Feng</b> and Mr. <b>Yu Ming</b>. On 4 October 2002, Mr. Li 
Feng was sentenced to 15 years in prison at Prison No. 4 in Shijiazhuang City, due to his 
involvement in broadcasting a television program about Falun Gong. Mr. Li was allegedly 
tortured in prison, which resulted in him suffering from seizures, high blood pressure, 
breathlessness, bowel and urinary disorders. He also lost consciousness several times. In 
January 2006, he was kept in the hospital for two days after he lost consciousness for 12 
hours. His family was not allowed to visit him. Mr. Li is currently in critical condition. He 
suffers from lower limb oedema, dizziness and needs support to talk. He also suffers from 
constant vomiting. 
</p>
<p>72. According to additional information, on 3 March 2006, Mr. Yu Ming was sentenced 
to two and a half years of forced labour. He was detained at several centres and transferred 
to the Tuanhe Forced Labor Camp on 1 September 2006. Mr. Yu refused to renounce Falun 
Gong and held a hunger strike to protest his detention. As a result, he was tortured, force-
fed and tied to a chair with ropes around his neck, chest, waist, hands and legs. A dozen 
inmates allegedly took turns torturing him. He remained tied to the chair from mid-</p>

</p>
<p>September to the end of 2006. He was untied after suffering cardiac arrest. He was later 
detained in a solitary cell and tied to the bed. On 21 May 2007, Mr. Yu was transferred to 
the Masanjia Forced Labour Camp in Shenyang City, where he was taken to the camp 
hospital due to his overall weakness and stiff limbs. He was later transferred to the 
Luotaishanzhuang Brainwashing Center in Fushun City. On 2 September 2008, Mr. Yu&#8217;s 
term was extended for another year. He was sent back to the Masanjia Forced Labour Camp 
in October, and has been held in solitary confinement since then. At the camp, Mr. Yu was 
forced to sign a suicide letter, before he was beaten, including on his head with a steel 
baton, hung and shocked with electric batons. As a result, he bled severely and lost 
consciousness for more than a week. Repeated requests by his family to visit him have been 
denied. As a result of the alleged beatings suffered by both Mr. Li and Mr. Yu in detention, 
concern is expressed for their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteurs appealed to the Government to ensure the right to freedom 
of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief 
and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Furthermore, they referred to

<p>74. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has so far not received a reply from the 
Government of China concerning the above mentioned allegations. The Special Rapporteur 
is very concerned by the continued violations of freedom of religion or belief suffered by 
Falun Gong practitioners (see E/CN.4/2005/61, paras. 37-38; E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, para.

</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding Mr. <b>Bauyrzhan Imangaliev</b>, aged 30, citizen of 
Kazakhstan. Mr. Imangaliev is currently awaiting deportation in the refugee camp &#8220;B&#233;l&#225; 
Jezov&#225;&#8221; in the Czech Republic together with his pregnant wife and two small children. He 
claimed that in his country of origin, Kazakhstan, he was subjected to persecution on the 
part of the authorities for religious reasons as a member of an independent Muslim 
community which is not controlled by the official religious structures in Western </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>Kazakhstan. However, his asylum claim in the Czech Republic was recently rejected and 
the conclusions of the migration service of the Czech Republic, which made a decision on 
his deportation, reportedly failed to take into account that four of his Muslim associates who 
stayed in Kazakhstan were imprisoned under falsified charge. Also, some procedural 
violations have been reported, such as incorrect translations from Russian into Czech of 
interviews, which failed to reflect some of the accounts relevant to the asylum claims.  
</p>
<p>76. While still in Kazakhstan, Mr. Imangaliev reportedly was subjected to persecution 
on the part of the authorities for religious reasons, namely in connection with alleged 
extremist views. Between 1999 and 2005, he was regularly called in by the National 
Security Committee (KNB) and questioned. In 2005, he was held in custody in a KNB 
isolator in Atyrau on two occasions: In early 2005, he was suspended from handcuffs and 
beaten on his kidneys by the officers. In late 2005, he was held for five days without his 
family being notified. Several members of his religious community have been arrested in 
recent years and some are still in detention. There are reports of them being harassed by 
prison staff in order to force them to give up their religious convictions. 
</p>
<p>77. Mr. Imangaliev and his family subsequently fled from Kazakhstan and founded a 
human rights organization in Prague, Czech Republic, where demonstrations have 
repeatedly been organized to protest against the violations of freedom of religion or belief 
by Kazakh authorities, which may lead to reprisals by the latter, in case he is returned to 
Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>78. It appears that a large number of asylum seekers from Kazakhstan (222 persons, 
including 54 minors born in emigration) are currently at risk of involuntary return to 
Kazakhstan. All of them claim to have been persecuted by Kazakhstani authorities on the 
basis of their beliefs, which have been labelled as &#8220;extremism&#8221;.

<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has so far not received a reply from the 
Government of the Czech Republic concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would 
like to take the opportunity to refer to her reports to the General Assembly, in which she 
dealt with the vulnerable situation of refugees and asylum-seekers (see A/62/280, paras. 38-
63; and A/64/159, paras. 22-24 and 67). In particular, she would like to recall the obligation 
of <i>non-refoulement</i> in article 33 of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees: 
&#8220;No Contracting State shall expel or return (&#8216;refouler&#8217;) a refugee in any manner whatsoever 
to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his 
race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.&#8221; In 
addition, no reservation is permitted to article 33 of the 1951 Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees.

<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she 
had received regarding recent <b>attacks against members of the community of Coptic 
Christians in Farshout district</b>.  
</p>
<p>81. On 18 November 2009, a complaint was received by the police on the case of a 12 
year-old Muslim girl from the Hawwara tribe in the village of Al Sheqeify in Farshout </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>district, who reportedly had been raped by a 21 year-old Christian man from the village of 
Al Kom Al Ahmar in Farshout district. The man was arrested and is currently in detention.  
</p>
<p>82. On 21 November 2009, at approximately 2:30 a.m., at least three shops owned by 
Coptic Christians in Farshout were set on fire. Consequently, church leaders instructed 
Coptic Christians not to leave their homes or open their shops on that day for fear of further 
attacks. Later on the same day, at least 50 Muslim individuals, mostly from the girl&#8217;s 
extended family, started gathering outside of the Farshout police station demanding that the 
Christian suspect in the rape case be handed over to them. They were told by the police that 
the investigations were ongoing and that the forensic report was still pending. The Muslim 
individuals then started attacking Coptic property, breaking into closed shops and stealing 
their contents before setting them on fire. According to the allegations, fifteen shops and 
pharmacies were destroyed as well as a motorcycle and a bus owned by the local Coptic 
church. The attacks continued until the evening of 21 November 2009. Security forces 
arrived reportedly two hours after the beginning of the attacks and did not exert enough 
efforts to stop the attacks carried out by the mob. By the end of the day, the police 
reportedly arrested 70 men and charged them with arson and destruction of property. They 
seem to currently remain in detention. The public prosecution office inspected the damages 
but has not released its report yet. 
</p>
<p>83. On 23 November 2009, similar attacks were carried out in the neighbouring village 
of Abu Shousha (Abu Tesht district). One pharmacy and three shops were reportedly set on 
fire around 2:00 a.m., however no one was arrested in relation to the attacks. While reports 
suggest that the situation seems to be relatively calm, fears are being expressed that a back 
lash may occur in other places unless prompt preventive measures are not taken by the 
authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 4 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>84. On 4 January 2010, the Government of Egypt replied to the communication of 26 
November 2009. Since the Special Rapporteur had not received the response&#8217;s translation 
from the relevant services at the time this report was finalized, she is unfortunately not in a

<p><b> H. Germany 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent on 24 August 2009 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding the murder of <b>Ms. Marwa Al Sherbini</b> in a Dresden 
courtroom. On 1 July 2009, Ms. Marwa Al Sherbini, a pregnant Muslim woman of Egyptian 
origin, was stabbed 18 times by Mr. Alex W., a German of Russian origin, in a Dresden 
courtroom, in front of her husband, her 3 year-old son, judges and other witnesses.  
</p>
<p>89. Following an incident in a public park in Dresden in August 2008 where Mr. Alex 
W. called Ms. Marwa Al Sherbini, who wore a headscarf, an &#8220;Islamist&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
when she asked him to make room for her son on the playground swings, the first instance 
court of Dresden (Amtsgericht) found Mr. Alex W. guilty of slander. A 780 Euros fine was 
issued against him. However, during the trial, Mr. Alex W. claimed mitigating 
circumstances for the act of insulting Ms. Marwa Al Sherbini and suggested that &#8220;people 
like her&#8221; were not real humans and therefore could not be insulted. In addition, he told Ms. 
Marwa Al Sherbini that &#8220;you don&#8217;t have the right to live here&#8221;. Consequently, the Public 
Prosecutor appealed the verdict of the first instance court in order to get a harsher sentence 
for the openly xenophobic words of Mr. Alex W.  
</p>
<p>90. At the appeal trial in the second instance court of Dresden (Landgericht), Mr. Alex 
W, reportedly asked Ms. Marwa Al Sherbini: &#8220;Do you have a right to be in Germany at 
all?&#8221;. He then would have warned her that: &#8220;When the NPD [National Democratic Party] 
comes to power, there will be an end to that&#8221;. After Ms. Marwa Al Sherbini had testified, 
Mr. Alex W. lept in the courtroom to stab her with a knife killing her, while allegedly 
shouting &#8220;You don't deserve to live&#8221;. He also stabbed the husband of Ms. Marwa Al 
Sherbini, Mr. Elwi Okaz, who was critically wounded after he tried to defend her against 
Mr. Alex W. The police officer, who was called to intervene, mistook Mr. Okaz for the 
attacker and shot him in the leg.  
</p>
<p>91. Mr. Alex W. is now reportedly held on remand on suspicion of murder of Ms. 
Marwa Al Sherbini and attempted murder of Mr. Okaz. Condolences to the family of Ms. 
Marwa Al Sherbini and public apologies have been expressed by the German authorities, 
including by the Chancellor. On 10 July 2009, the Federal Foreign Minister also sent a letter 
to the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, where he said that &#8220;we are committed to 
ensuring that every person in Germany feels safe, regardless of their background, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>nationality or faith. This is the highest maxim for action by the State. Xenophobia and 
Islamophobia have no place in Germany.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteurs recalled Human Rights Council resolution 10/25, in which 
the Council urges States to &#8220;take the necessary measures, in accordance with international 
human rights law, to combat discrimination based on religion or belief by non-State actors, 
with particular regard to members of religious minorities and other persons in vulnerable 
situations&#8221;. In addition, General Assembly resolution 63/181 urges States to take &#8220;all 
necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards of human 
rights, to combat hatred, discrimination, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and 
coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to 
hostility and violence, with particular regard to members of religious minorities in all parts 
of the world&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur urged the Government to conduct an impartial and 
transparent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the murder of Ms. Marwa Al 
Sherbini with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and 
ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the murder, as well as to compensate the 
family of the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 20 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Government of Germany in its response dated 20 October 2009 confirmed that 
the facts alleged in the above summary of the case were accurate. With regard to the 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation with this case, the 
Government indicated that the investigation by the Dresden Public Prosecution Office, 
which had begun immediately following the incident on 1 July 2009, had meanwhile been 
concluded. The public prosecution office charged Mr. Alex W. with the murder of Ms. 
Marwa Al Sherbini as well as the attempted murder of, and aggravated bodily harm on, her 
husband, Mr. Elwy Okaz. The defendant had been in remand detention since the time of the 
alleged offence. The investigation has shown that the defendant stabbed Ms. Marwa Al 
Sherbini at least 16 times in the back and chest area as well the right arm, and stabbed her 
husband at least 16 times in the area of the head and throat, the upper body and the right 
arm. He used a kitchen knife with a blade measuring 18 centimetres, which he had brought 
unnoticed into the courtroom in a backpack. According to the public prosecution office, the 
murder element of malice forethought has been fulfilled because none of the victims had 
imagined that they might be attacked by the defendant, and because they were all helplessly 
subjected to the attack. Furthermore, the offence was committed out of base motives, 
because the defendant&#8217;s motive was his clear hatred for non-Europeans and Muslims. 
According to the evaluation by the psychiatric expert, there are no recognizable indications 
in the defendant of a lack of being able to control his actions or appreciate the consequences 
of them (so-called criminal responsibility). 
</p>
<p>94. After learning of the horrific act committed at the Dresden Regional Court, the 
Federal Public Prosecutor General has been receiving continual updates on the matter from 
the Dresden Public Prosecution Office. As a general rule, the Public Prosecution Offices of 
the <i>L&#228;nder</i> are responsible for criminal investigations. The law provides for assumption of 
the investigation by the Federal Public Prosecution Office only if very special prerequisites 
exist. The Federal Public Prosecutor General at the Federal Court of Justice has prosecution 
competence only in the very rare cases that an offence is to be classified as a state security 
offence directed against the state as a whole. 
</p>
<p>95. With regard to measures that are envisaged to prevent the recurrence of such violent 
acts, the Government indicated that an initial assessment of the incident had led to the 
review of the security concept for the courts of the Free State of Saxony. Saxony&#8217;s security 
had been directed in a reactive manner and had &#8220;open&#8221; judicial buildings without a general 
access control. Security was to be guaranteed by way of the most rapid possible alarm and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>reaction in unusual incidents, which was enabled primarily by building-technological 
security standards and the placement of areas intensively used by the public in the vicinity 
of the entrance. Further, relevant measures were taken in specific cases if a foreseeable 
danger might exist. In this specific case, this type of danger could not be anticipated in 
advance, however, the Government indicated that more care and sensitivity will surely be 
called for. Due to the grave incident at the Dresden Regional Court, in addition to the 
already-existing measures, there is now an increased focus on preventive measures which 
are designed to prevent bringing weapons and other dangerous items into the court building. 
The leadership level of the authorities in the courts and public prosecution offices have 
already taken measures in the exercise of their right to make rules in the building. These 
focus on increased access control, to the extent possible with the assistance of technical aid 
devices. Also, since 17 August 2009, members of a private security service have been 
employed at Dresden Regional Court to assist with access control. Metal detector frames 
and hand-held scanners are used as well. 
</p>
<p>96. The Government indicated that the incident had contributed greatly to sensitizing the 
public and those working in the justice system. The case had been extensively discussed in 
the German media as well and the people in Germany were unanimous in clearly expressing 
their outrage and sharp condemnation. The government and justice system in Saxony were 
well aware of the special dimension of the case and had reacted accordingly to clearly and 
publicly express condemnation of the racist crime. Among other things, the State Minister 
of Justice, Mr. Geert Mackenroth, visited the husband of the deceased woman in the 
hospital. Also, the Senior Public Prosecutor for the District of Alexandria in Egypt was 
personally received by Mr. Fleischmann, Public Prosecutor General of the Free State of 
Saxony and by the State Minister in order to gain an impression of the progress of the 
investigation. Claims by the family of the victim for financial compensation were being 
given favourable consideration by the competent offices in the Free State of Saxony, 
however, evaluation of these claims had not yet been completed. 
</p>
<p>97. Furthermore, the Government noted that it accorded great importance to the 
integration of Muslims and to a dialogue with Islam. It emphasized that Germany was 
engaging in multifaceted measures designed to protect and promote Muslims in Germany as 
well as to foster intercultural and interreligious dialogue. Examples of such measures were 
contained in the 16th to 18th State Report pursuant to Article 9 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and in the first State 
Report within the scope of the Universal Periodic Review procedure before the Human 
Rights Council of the United Nations. Special mention was also made of the German Islam 
Conference (<i>Deutsche Islam Konferenz</i>), which in 2006 created the first national framework 
for fostering relations between the state and Muslims in Germany. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Germany replied to the 
communication of 24 August 2009. She also welcomes that the Criminal Chamber of the 
Regional Court of Dresden delivered its judgment on 11 November 2009 by which it 
convicted Mr. Alex W. to life imprisonment for the xenophobic murder of Ms. Al-Sherbini 
and for the attempted murder on her husband. 
</p>
<p>99. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur wishes to take this opportunity to refer to her 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms 
and to the mandate practice concerning the vulnerable situation of religious minorities (see 
para. 1 above, category C. 5.). </p>

<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 12 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p>101. By letter dated 12 February 2009, the Government of India informed the Special 
Rapporteurs that a decision had been taken, after due consideration, to deport 67 Pakistani 
nationals at the earliest. The decision was taken after extensive consultations during which 
no well-founded evidence was discovered that could suggest any systemic persecution of 
these Pakistani nationals in Pakistan. No major internationally-recognized human rights 
organizations had drawn attention to any systemic persecution of Mehdi Foundation 
International of Pakistan. As per existing bilateral Protocol on Consular Access signed 
between India and Pakistan, consular access was provided to all these 67 Pakistani nationals 
during which the Pakistani High Commission of Delhi confirmed the nationalities of the 67 
nationals and provided them travel documents. Even though necessary arrangements had 
been made to release and repatriate these Pakistani nationals on 18 November 2008, they 
could not be repatriated to Pakistan on that date due to a stay granted by the High Court of 
Delhi on their deportation. The Government indicated that the matter was <i>sub judice</i>.

<p>102. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of India replied to the

information they had received concerning the eruption of <b>violence between the Bodo tribal 
and the Muslim communities in the Indian state of Assam</b>. Summaries of this

A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 50-54. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 25 June 2009 
</b></p>
<p>104. By letter dated 25 June 2009, the Government of India informed the Special 
Rapporteurs that of the 57 persons killed in the communal clashes that occurred in Darrang 
and Uladguri districts of Assam in the first week of October 2008, 23 persons were killed as 
a result of police firing and 34 persons were killed during the clashes. The Government 
emphasized that, at all times, the police opened fire at the mobs only as a last resort, as per 
the due procedure established under the law, on the orders of the Executive Magistrate who 
accompanied the police as required under the law, and only after the violent crowds had 
been given sufficient warning to disperse, other forms of milder tactics like baton charge 
and use of tear gas did not have any impact on these crowds, and the situation deteriorated 
to a point where there was no other alternative. The Government indicated that the use of 
force by the police had been both legitimate and proportional. It also noted that the intensity 
of the clashes reduced sharply subsequent to the firing by the police. 
</p>
<p>105. The Government indicated that a judicial inquiry, headed by a retired judge of 
Assam High Court, into the communal clashes had been ordered. Furthermore, the state 
authorities took all adequate steps to provide humanitarian aid to the affected people and to 
facilitate the safe return to their homes. Of the approximately 216,000 persons who had 
been displaced and put up in 98 relief camps, almost all people had returned to their villages 
and virtually all relief camps had been shut down by early March 2009, except for about 
1,040 people who were in the process of being sent to their villages. Apart from providing 
2.5 crores Indian Rupees (about USD 500,000) for relief measures in each district, the state 
authorities sanctioned payment of 3 lakhs Indian Rupees (about USD 6,000) to the next of 
kin of each person killed in the clashes. An amount of 50,000 Indian Rupees (about USD 
1,000) was also sanctioned for each of those grievously injured. The authorities provided 
food, blankets, mosquito nets and, separately, building material and cash amounts to each 
family that had lost its home. The Government indicated that separate grants were 
sanctioned for rebuilding schools and colleges that had been affected by the violence.

<p><b> 1. Communication sent on 26 November 2007  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>107. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she 
had received regarding the <b>local Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community </b>in Palolo, Donggala district, Central 
Sulawesi. Summaries of this communication as well as observations of the Special 
Rapporteur are already reproduced in A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 112-114. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 28 December 2007 
</b></p>
<p>108. In its letter dated 28 December 2007, the Government of Indonesia provided 
clarifications on the case of the local Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in Palolo.2 It had been reported that 
some individuals, allegedly government officials from the Office of Religious Affairs, tried 
to incite members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community living in the Donggala district of Central 
Sulawesi to recant their faith. The Government indicated that, according to the information 
available, some of the individuals in question were previously Muslims who, after choosing 
to become followers of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith, changed their minds and reverted back to their 
original religion, Islam. 
</p>
<p>109. The Government referred to the case of two individuals, Mr. X. aged 40 and Mr. Y. 
aged 70, who had embraced the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; doctrine for eight years, however, they voluntarily 
decided to convert back to Islam in November 2007. Before reconverting, these two men 
were invited, along with five other Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; followers, to a meeting organized by prominent 
religious figures in Palolo. This meeting took place in an Islamic religious schools known as 
the Madrasah Tsanawiyah Alkhaeraat. The object of the meeting was to encourage the 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; followers to clarify their position and intentions publicly and to give them the 
opportunity to explain their choices before the local community in order to dispel any 
misunderstandings or fears among the latter. One Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; member stated during the meeting 
that he would continue to follow the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith because of its teaching of oneness with 
God and the values of goodness which can be practised on a daily basis in everyday life. 
Equally, most members of the sect adhere to the ideology of respect for family members 
who still follow their previous religious beliefs. The meeting was also attended by the chief 
of the Palolo district police and he stated that he would be monitoring the developments in 
the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in that area in order to help them ensure that there was no conflict on 
this issue. 
</p>
<p>110. The Government further indicated that in November 2007 Mr. X. and Mr. Y. went to 
the Muhajirin mosque in Nuyyun Nur where they scheduled to publicly return to Islam. As 
part of the ceremony, there was a procession which was led by the head of the Religious 
Affairs Office of the Palolo sub-district of Nuyyun Nur. With regard to other communities 
of Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; believers mentioned in the communication, the Government noted that in Banpers 
village, in the Palolo sub-district of Donggala, South Sulawesi, there was a community of 
overt thirty Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; followers who had been living there peacefully, all of whom were also 
converts from Islam.  
</p>
<p>111. The Government reiterated the respect it holds for all religions recognized in the 
1945 Constitution and its subsequent amendments. The founding principles of the Pancasila 
and the ensuing national legislation had also established the right of every person to freely

<p>choose and practice the religion of their choice, as well as guaranteeing the freedom of 
worship of each person according to his or her own religion or belief. The Government 
emphasized that it was not at liberty to interfere in the religious affairs and choices of its 
citizens, nor could it be expected to intervene in the decision by certain individuals to 
follow a certain religious faith or to abandon it, or to subsequently voluntarily modify their 
original choice. The Government noted that the Pancasila State protects and facilitates the 
development of all religions adhered to by the people, without any difference in treatment. 
Therefore, allegations that certain individuals would seek to force others to choose a 
different faith than the one they have voluntarily adopted was as unconscionable as it was 
illicit. 
</p>
<p>112. The Government underlined that Indonesia was a country with a rich multi-cultural, 
multi-ethnic and multi-religious history. The Indonesian Constitution guarantees that every 
individual has the right to choose to practise any religion of his or her choice, just as he is 
free to leave it or to subsequently return to it if he should so choose. Therefore, the 
Government argued, allegations of intimidation and coercion were incorrect. It was 
particularly concerned that the communication alleges that Government officials would 
attempt to force certain individuals to recant their faith, whereas there were no videos or 
other media to show any evidence of pressure and intimidation. In the case of the men 
mentioned above, while two voluntarily chose to publicly revert to Islam, at least four 
others stated their desire to remain in the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith. The entire process was conducted 
openly and dispassionately, for information purposes and in order to defuse any wrong 
interpretations that might fuel controversy, on the understanding that not all people were 
necessarily familiar with the tenets of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith among a population that was 
predominantly mainstream Muslim. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Indonesia replied to the 
communication of 26 November 2007. She would like to take the opportunity to refer to her 
framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms 
and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;Freedom to adopt, change or renounce a religion or 
belief&#8221; (see para. 1 above, category A. 1.) and &#8220;Freedom from coercion&#8221; (ibid., category A. 
2.). Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee in its general comment no. 22 emphasized 
that article 18, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights bars 
coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief as well as policies 
or practices having the same intention or effect.

and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding the <b>adoption of the new Islamic Criminal Code</b> (<i>Qanun 
Jinayah</i>) in Aceh. On 14 September 2009, the Aceh Legislative Council adopted a new 
Islamic Criminal Code which imposes severe sentences for consensual extra-marital sexual 
relations, rape, homosexuality, alcohol consumption and gambling. Among other sanctions, 
the Code imposes the punishment of stoning to death for adultery; 100 cane lashes for 
sexual intercourse outside marriage; between 100 and 300 cane lashes or imprisonment for 
rape; and 100 lashes for homosexuality. In addition, the new Code legalizes marital rape.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>115. The National Commission against Violence on Women has called for a judicial 
review of Law No. 11/2006 of the Government of Aceh concerning the sources the Aceh 
Legislative Council has used to adopt the Aceh Islamic Criminal Code. Moreover, this Code 
applies to both Muslims and non Muslims. It was furthermore alleged that, although the 
Code is applicable to the population as a whole, in practice women are far more likely to 
become victims of stoning due to patriarchal and discriminatory practices and policies, as 
well as biological differences. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 23 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>116. In its response dated 23 December 2009, the Government indicated that the Province 
of Aceh is given a special status under law no. 18 of 2001, which incorporated a special 
system of autonomy. In the preamble of this law, special status is granted to Aceh for its 
distinct contribution to the formation of the Indonesian nation, as much as for Aceh&#8217;s 
unique historical and cultural background, as well as its religious, moral and social values 
which had been preserved from generation to generation. The special status of Aceh as an 
autonomous region was expressed through four specific areas over which it had sole 
decisional power: religious issues, customs, education and the role of the <i>Ulema</i> in the local 
policy-making process. This special status was further reinforced through law no. 11 of 
2006 on the Governing of Aceh. 
</p>
<p>117. The Government explained that, in accordance with the above national laws, the 
promulgation of local laws and regulations was meant to endow the <i>Muamalat</i> (Islamic civil 
code) and the <i>Jinayah</i> (Islamic criminal code) within the applicable norms in Aceh. The 
task of promulgating local laws and regulations was carried out by the Aceh House of 
Representatives. The legislation produced by this body is known as the <i>Qanun</i> (Islamic 
bylaw). So far, the <i>Qanun</i> related to <i>Jinayah</i> issues generally deals with regulations related 
to gambling, drinking and adultery. Within this framework the Islamic Religious Courts in 
Aceh which previously had jurisdiction over issues of marriage and divorce had been 
transformed into <i>Mahkamah Syariah</i> (religious court at the local level) and had been 
granted additional jurisdiction over the issues of the <i>Muamalat</i> and certain aspects of the 
<i>Jinayah</i>. This was completed by the issuance of a Decree of the Supreme Court of 2004, 
which transferred some of the jurisdictional power of the civil courts of Aceh to the 
<i>Mahkamah Syariah</i>. 
</p>
<p>118. The Government indicated that one of the types of punishment that have been used 
so far was public flogging. However, it noted that there were also alternative punishments in 
the <i>Qanun</i>, namely imprisonment and fines. Thus, the judges had a number of options in 
carrying out justice. The Government argued that many people who had been sentenced to 
flogging were done so by their own choice as they considered it a form of religious penance. 
</p>
<p>119. On 14 September 2009, two weeks before leaving office, the outgoing legislature of 
Aceh passed five <i>Qanun</i> draft bills, including the <i>Qanun Jinayah</i> (Islamic Criminal Law) 
and the <i>Qanun on Jinayah Procedural Law</i>, which have sparked a fierce debate at national 
level, especially with regard to law enforcement on stoning for offenders. However, 
international reporting on this issue focussed mostly on the aspect of the legislation which 
provides for &#8211; or even requires &#8211; the &#8220;stoning to death&#8221; of adulterers and the torture of 
women. Consequently, the international image of Indonesia generally, and Aceh in 
particular, has suffered as a result of this reductive interpretation. The real issue, according 
to the Government, concerned the extent to which democratic principles were finding a 
home in Aceh and in Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>120. The adoption of the <i>Qanun Jinayah</i> had sparked controversy and public debate in 
the local media and at the national level. The substance of the <i>Qanun</i> has also provoked 
protests and concern from various groups in the country, including members of the House of 
Representatives, the National Human Rights Commission, academics, religious leaders and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>NGOs. Aside from the controversial aspects of its substance, the adoption of the <i>Qanun</i> has 
also raised controversy on account of the fact that it was adopted just before the end of the 
term of office of the members of the provincial parliament for the 2004-2009 period, 
thereby insinuating a sense of politicization and haste in the adoption of these <i>Qanuns</i>.  
</p>
<p>121. About a month after receiving the draft bills by the provincial parliament, the local 
government in Aceh sent a letter to the local parliament refusing to endorse the draft bills 
and suggesting a revision of the proposed <i>Qanuns</i>, particularly the stoning provisions. The 
Governor of Aceh has so far not signed the <i>Qanun Jinayah</i>, the <i>Qanun on Jinayah 
Procedural Law </i>and the <i>Qanun on Nanggroe Guardian</i>. Legally speaking, all three <i>Qanuns</i> 
are not yet effective in view of article 23 (1.a.) and article 232 (1) of law no. 11/2006 on the 
Governing of Aceh, since the promulgation of the <i>Qanun</i> requires a joint agreement of both 
the local legislative and local executive. Thus, based on the two aforementioned articles, the 
approval from the Governor of Aceh is mandatory before a provincial law can be formally 
enacted. Moreover, according to article 235 (5) of law no. 11/2006, once the <i>Qanun Bill</i> has 
been ratified by the provincial parliament and accepted by the Governor of the region, it 
nevertheless remains subject to the final endorsement of the Minister of Home Affairs &#8211; as 
an advisor on regional legislation in Indonesia &#8211; as a prerequisite to the entry into force and 
implementation of these <i>Qanuns</i>. In addition, article 235 (3) and article 235 (4) of law no. 
11/2006 provide for the review and annulment of a <i>Qanun</i> through a material review by the 
Supreme Court. However, this process can only be conducted if the <i>Qanun</i> has been 
adopted by both the local parliament of Aceh and the Governor of Aceh. A material review 
of the <i>Qanun</i> can be proposed by the representatives of government agencies and equally by 
members of civil society. The Government emphasized that thus a natural system of checks 
and balances, as evident in a robust democratic country, concerning the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms exists and operates in Indonesia 
through public initiatives, the legislative or the executive, to guarantee respect for, and 
protection of, human rights. 
</p>
<p>122. The Government indicated that the public discourse on human rights issues was not 
a taboo issue, but belonged to the dynamics of any healthy society and was common to all 
democratic countries, including Indonesia. The Government underlined that the checks and 
balances system was effective because it was supported by freedom of expression and a free 
but responsible media, which was expected to further strengthen and guarantee the 
promotion and protection of human rights in Indonesia. According to the Government, the 
Ministry of Home Affairs had conducted an evaluation of numerous regional regulations 
and since 2002 it proceeded to cancel 1,123 regulations found not to be in conformity with 
national laws and regulations.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>123. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Indonesia replied to the 
joint urgent appeal of 2 October 2009. She would like to refer to General Assembly 
resolution 63/181, in which the Assembly urges States &#8220;to ensure that no one within their 
jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person because of religion 
or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, or arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to bring to 
justice all perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221; (para. 9 b). The Special Rapporteur also 
recalls that the General Assembly in the same resolution urges States &#8220;to step up their 
efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, [...] devoting 
particular attention to practices that violate the human rights of women and discriminate 
against women&#8221; (para. 12 a). Furthermore, the General Assembly invites all actors to 
address &#8220;situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women as well as other 
individuals on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief or in accordance with cultural 
and traditional practices&#8221; (para. 16 b). Moreover, the Human Rights Committee in its </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>general comment no. 22 emphasizes that &#8220;[i]f a set of beliefs is treated as official ideology 
in constitutions, statutes, proclamations of ruling parties, etc., or in actual practice, this shall 
not result in any impairment of the freedoms under article 18 or any other rights recognized 
under the Covenant nor in any discrimination against persons who do not accept the official 
ideology or who oppose it&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>124. Furthermore, she would also like to refer to the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
torture on his mission to Indonesia (A/HRC/7/3/Add.7), in which he had expressed concern 
&#8220;about penalties provided for by Sharia law, such as public flogging, incorporated into the 
2005 Aceh Criminal Code&#8221;, also indicating that &#8220;women are disproportionally affected by 
corporal punishment provided for by the Aceh Criminal Code, which is based on Sharia 
law&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate her wish 
to visit Indonesia in the framework of the mandate (see A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, para. 69).

Group on arbitrary detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>125. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding the arrest and continued detention of Ms. <b>Haleh 
Roohi</b>, Ms. <b>Raha Sabet</b> and Mr. <b>Sassan Taqva</b>. These three members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; 
community in the city of Shiraz have already been the subject of two joint communications 
sent on 9 June 2006 and 13 June 2006 (see A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, paras. 195-203 and the 
summary of the Government&#8217;s reply in paras. 204-205). According to new allegations, 
subsequent to the arrest and temporary detention of Ms. Haleh Roohi, Ms. Raha Sabet and 
Mr. Sassan Taqva in May 2006, a court in Shiraz sentenced each of them in August 2007 to 
a total of four years&#8217; imprisonment. Summaries of this communication as well as 
observations of the Special Rapporteur are already reproduced in A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 
86-89. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 14 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>126. In its response dated 14 July 2009, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
indicated that a three-member Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; group, by forging I.D. cards and introducing 
themselves falsely as representatives of Government institutions such as the Ministry of 
Education, Ministry of Islamic Guidance, Center for Children and Youth Education etc., 
deceived people for cooperation and recruited 61 young individuals for their activities. The 
Government stated that this group also fabricated titles of non-governmental organizations 
as a result of which they had filed complaints against the group.  
</p>
<p>127. The Government argued that the presence of a number of non-Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s among the 
members of the group proved the absence of a connection between the religious beliefs of 
the arrested individuals and their activities. According to statements by the relevant 
authorities, the group of 64 persons were arrested merely due to their illegal activities. After 
completion of judicial investigations, 10 persons were released unconditionally, 51 were 
released on bail 48 hours after their arrest. Three individuals, the principal organizers of the 
illegal entity, remained on remand custody, but later on they were also released on bail. The 
representatives of Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s in Geneva then claimed in an interview with Citizen Newspaper 
from Canada that the activities of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; group were in the framework of UNICEF 
educational programmes in Iran, which &#8211; according to the Government &#8211; was strongly 
rejected by the UNICEF office in Tehran. The Government indicated that this was not the 
first case of illegal activities of Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; groups in Iran and that the dissemination of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>fabricated news by Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; support groups abroad had been trying to present an unreal image 
of the situation of this group in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>128. The Government stated that the three individuals were tried by the pertinent court of 
Iran and they were sentenced to four years imprisonment. Following the appeal request by 
their lawyers, the appellate court upheld the ruling of the lower court. The Government 
indicated that they had access to the same amenities like other prisoners and received visits 
from their families and lawyers. Recently, they were given 20 days&#8217; leave outside of the 
prison, which &#8211; according to the Government &#8211; was exercised in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran as a humanitarian principle. The Government emphasized that all individuals were 
treated in accordance with the rule of law and with due regard to their illegal activities. 
Therefore, the Government categorically rejects any allegation stating otherwise.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran replied to the joint urgent appeal of 21 January 2008. She would like to take this 
opportunity to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the 
international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning the right to 
manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief and the teaching and dissemination of materials, including 
missionary activity (see para. 1 above, category A. 3. f).

information they had received regarding recent cases involving several members of the 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community<b> </b>in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including Ms. <b>Fariba Kamalabadi</b>, Mr. 
<b>Jamaloddin Khanjani</b>, Mr. <b>Afif Naeimi</b>, Mr. <b>Saeid Rezaie</b>, Mr. <b>Behrouz Tavakkoli</b>, Mr. 
<b>Vahid Tizfahm</b> and Ms. <b>Mahvash Sabet</b>. These seven Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; members had already been 
the subject of a joint communication sent on 19 May 2008 and fears were expressed that 
they were detained and convicted solely because of their beliefs or peaceful activities on 
behalf of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community. Summaries of this communication as well as observations 
of the Special Rapporteur are already reproduced in A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 93-94 and 
paras. 101-112. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 20 February 2009 
</b></p>
<p>131. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated in its response dated 20 
February 2009 that judicial procedure on different cases were carried out on the basis of 
law, disregarding social titles, positions, profession, belief or religion etc. of the accused 
individuals. The Government emphasized that the arrest of the individuals mentioned in the 
letters by Special Procedures mandate holders had been as a result of illegal activities and 
on the basis of charges laid against the above mentioned individuals in accordance with the 
rule of law. Any allegation stating otherwise, including attribution of their arrest to their 
belief or ideology, was in the Government&#8217;s opinion baseless and constituted a distortion of 
realities, with the purpose of inciting public opinion for politically motivated objectives. 
</p>
<p>132. The Government indicated that the judicial authorities of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran had received complaints from a considerable number of individuals of all walks of life 
against a sect-oriented organization, attributed to Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, under supervision of seven 
individuals, namely Khanjani, Tvakoli, Tizfahm, Rezaei, Fariba Kamalbadi, Afif Nafimi 
and Mahvash Shahriyari. On the basis of the statements and evidences provided by the 
complaints, they had received threats and intimidation from the above mentioned </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>individuals or their subordinates to join the sect organization. The complainants were &#8211; 
according to the Government &#8211; threatened through interference and meddling with their 
private lives and beliefs to be disconnected from their families and relatives. Following 
registry of the complaints and seriousness of the allegations, strict orders were issued by the 
pertinent authorities for carrying out thorough investigations into the case. The result of 
these investigations revealed that the above mentioned individuals had played an effective 
role in the occurring and realization of the mentioned offences. The Government stated that 
through formation of a clandestine and frightful organization, and systematic control of the 
private, social and economic activities of their sect members as well as accurate planning 
and programming for entrapping other people into their sect through abnormal and illegal 
methods including persuasion, temptation and threat, they intended to expand their illegal 
organization and ultimately achieve their goals through creating a deviant move. 
</p>
<p>133. The Government claimed that on the basis of the existing authentic evidences, the 
organization had received several directives from Israel, as the centre, as well as 
considerable financial assistance for the realization of its objectives. Pursuant to the registry 
of complaints and the result of the alarming investigation findings, particularly relation of 
the illegal organization with a foreign country, the above mentioned individuals were 
legally charged and sued for action against state national security. Therefore, six of them 
were arrested on 14 May 2008, on the writ issued by the Tehran Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
Later, the writ was objected and the case was transferred to the pertinent court. Pursuant to 
the review of the objection the writ was reinstated. The seventh individual, Ms. Mahvash 
Shahriyari, who was arrested earlier in Mashad city, was transferred to Tehran due to the 
result of investigations and the statements made by the above mentioned individuals on her 
connection with the dossier under investigation.  
</p>
<p>134. The Government indicated that the preliminary state of investigations was complete 
and that the case was referred to the competent court. Upon exhaustion of the national 
judicial procedures, the Special Rapporteurs would be advised of the final verdict. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>135. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran replied to the joint communication of 17 October 2008. She would like to reiterate the 
observations and concerns in her previous report (see A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 94 and 
paras. 111-112). The Special Rapporteur again urges the Government to ensure that the 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; members, who have been detained for more than 20 months so far, receive a fair trial 
and in this regard she would like to recommend the presence of independent observers 
during the trials. Reportedly, the trial of Ms. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, 
Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mr. Vahid Tizfahm and Ms. 
Mahvash Sabet began on 12 January 2010 in Tehran, however, no observers were allowed

Sobhani</b>, Mr. <b>Shahrokh Taef</b>, Mr. <b>Payam Aghsani</b> and Mr. <b>Didar Raoufi</b>, members of 
the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in Iran. On 14 January 2009, early in the morning, they were arrested 
at their respective homes in Tehran by Iranian Intelligence Ministry officials. No charges </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>were reportedly brought against them. It was alleged that these arrests were part of other 
raids on the homes of the five aforementioned persons in Tehran and of Mr. Riazullah 
Sobhani, Mr. Golshan Sobhani, Mr. Shahryar Cyrus, Mr. Changiz Fanaiyan, Mr. Nima 
Haghar, Ms. Minoo Sasani and Ms. Homa Etemadi. Intelligence Ministry officials 
reportedly seized laptops, books and photographs related to the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith. 
</p>
<p>137. Reportedly, Mr. Aziz Samandari, Ms. Jinous Sobhani, Mr. Shahrokh Taef, Mr. 
Payam Aghsani and Mr. Didar Raoufi were held incommunicado in Evin Prison. Allegedly 
there is indication that they were arrested for &#8220;threat to inner security and collaboration with 
hostile countries&#8221;. Their cases were under the same examining magistrate in charge of the 
cases against the seven members of the Baha&#8217;i leadership group, who have reportedly been 
arbitrarily detained without charge since May 2008 in the same prison. The seven members 
of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; leadership group, Ms. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif 
Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mr. Vahid Tizfahm and Ms. Mahvash 
Sabet, have already been the subject of joint communications sent on 19 May 2008 and on 
17 October 2008 (see above para. 130). 
</p>
<p>138. The Special Procedures mandate holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to 
General Assembly resolution 61/153, in which the Assembly &#8220;reminds all States that 
prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the 
safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person.&#8221; The Special 
Procedures mandate holders also asked the Government to indicate the legal basis for the 
arrest and detention of Mr. Aziz Samandari, Ms. Jinous Sobhani, Mr. Shahrokh Taef, Mr. 
Payam Aghsani and Mr. Didar Raoufi and how these measures were compatible with 
applicable international human rights norms and standards as contained, inter alia, in the

the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>142. On the night of 18 February 2009, about 200 government security forces, police and 
plainclothes agents surrounded the Hosseinieh of Nematollahi-Gonabadi Sufi order, located 
in the Takhteh Foulad Cemetery in Isfahan and reportedly demolished the building using 
bulldozers and loaders. Subsequently, on 21 February 2009, members of the Gonabadi Sufi 
community from all over Iran gathered in front of the Parliament in Tehran in order to 
protest the demolition of their place of worship. Security forces and plainclothes agents 
allegedly arrested more than 850 Sufis to prevent them from protesting in front of the 
Parliament. 
</p>
<p>143. Although most of those who were arrested have reportedly since been freed, the 27 
above mentioned members of the Gonabadi Sufi community were transferred to unit 240 
and 249 of the Evin Prison. The following questions were, inter alia, allegedly asked by the 
prison personnel to the detainees: &#8220;Are you a member of the Gonabadi Sufi Order 
Dervishes? Name at least ten members of the Gonabadi Sufi Order Dervishes! Why and 
how did you become a member of the Gonabadi Sufi Order Dervishes?&#8221;  
</p>
<p>144. Families of those who remained detained have allegedly been unable to obtain 
information about the legal status and health of the detainees. In addition, lawyers 
representing detained Gonabadi Sufis have been prevented from meeting with their clients. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) No response received from the Government

<p><b> (c) Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>145. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has so far not received a reply from the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. 
She would like to recall that the Human Rights Council in resolution 6/37 urges States to 
take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards of 
human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion 
motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility and 
violence, with particular regard to religious minorities.  
</p>
<p>146. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to General Assembly 
resolution 63/181, in which the Assembly urges States to step up their efforts to protect and 
promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this end, to exert the 
utmost efforts, in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity with 
international human rights law, to ensure that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are 
fully respected and protected and to take additional measures in cases where they are 
vulnerable to desecration and destruction. As mentioned, inter alia, in paragraph 4 of the 
Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment no. 22, places of worship are an essential 
element of the manifestation of the right to freedom of religion or belief to the extent that 
the great majority of religious communities or communities of belief need the existence of a 
place of worship where their members can manifest their faith. Moreover, unlike other 
forms of violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief, attacks or other forms of 
restriction on places of worship or other religious sites and shrines in many cases violate the 
right not only of a single individual, but the rights of a group of individuals forming the 
community that is attached to the place in question.  </p>

<p><b> 5. Urgent appeal sent on 28 April 2009 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>147. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding the execution of Mr. <b>Mehdi Qasemzadeh</b>, a follower of the 
Ahl-e Haqq religion, and the possibly imminent execution of another member of the group, 
Mr. <b>Yunes Aghayan</b>. Both men were reportedly convicted on charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; 
(&#8220;enmity against God&#8221;) on the basis of their participation in clashes between the police and 
Ahl-e Haqq followers in 2004.  
</p>
<p>148. In September 2004, clashes between members of a group of Ahl-e Haqq and police 
resulted in the death of five Ahl-e Haqq members and at least three police officers. 
Apparently, the clashes were triggered by the refusal of Ahl-e Haqq followers to take down 
religious slogans at the entrance to their cattle farm in Uch Tepe, West Azerbaijan Province.  
</p>
<p>149. In the following months, members of Ahl-e Haqq were arrested and charged with 
&#8220;mohareb&#8221;; Mr. Yunes Aghayan was arrested around November 2004. Five men, Mr. 
Yunes Aghayan, Mr. Mehdi Qasemzadeh, Mr. Sehend Ali Mohammadi, Mr. Bakhshali 
Mohammadi, and Mr. Ebadollah Qasemzadeh were tried before Branch 2 of the Mahabad 
Revolutionary Court and sentenced to death. The death sentences against Mr. Yunes 
Aghayan and Mr. Mehdi Qasemzadeh were upheld by the Supreme Court in April 2005. 
The death sentences against Mr. Sehend Ali Mohammadi, Mr. Bakhshali Mohammadi, and 
Mr. Ebadollah Qasemzadeh were overturned by the Supreme Court in September 2007. 
They are serving 13-year prison sentences in Yazd Province.  
</p>
<p>150. Mr. Mehdi Qasemzadeh was executed on, or around, 28 February 2009. Mr. Yunes 
Aghayan is reportedly held on death row in Oromieh Prison in West Azerbaijan Province. 
</p>
<p>151. The Special Rapporteurs indicated in their letter that, although the death penalty was 
not prohibited under international law, it had long been regarded as an extreme exception to 
the fundamental right to life, and must as such be interpreted in the most restrictive manner. 
Article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party, provides that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed 
only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law&#8221;. As the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions had explained in previous communications, 
the imposition of the death sentence on charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; was highly problematic. The 
Special Rapporteurs expressed their concerns that this charge, which according to 
information received was directed in the Islamic Republic of Iran mainly against political 
dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused of espionage, might not be 
sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set by article 6, 
paragraph 2, of the Covenant for the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty. In 
order for the sentence of death to be imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law in 
question must be sufficiently precise to clearly allow distinction between conduct 
punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so punishable. The Special 
Rapporteurs also referred to previous communications (A/HRC/4/20/Add.1, pages 165 et 
seq.; A/HRC/8/3/Add.1, pages 210 et seq.; and A/HRC/11/2/Add.1, pages 199 et seq.). 
</p>
<p>152. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to indicate the specific conduct Mr. 
Yunes Aghayan and Mr. Mehdi Qasemzadeh were found guilty of, the legal basis of the 
death sentences imposed against them and how these are compatible with international 
norms, specifically with article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs also asked the Government to 
explain the definition of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; under Iranian law. </p>

Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. 
She would like to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the 
international human rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning the intersection of 
freedom of religion or belief with other human rights, i.e. &#8220;Right to life, right to liberty&#8221;

</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>157. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding <b>Mohammed al-Tanani</b>, <b>Sa'id Salah Battah</b>, <b>Ahmed Isma'il 
al-Buhdri</b>, <b>Ahmed Tubail</b>, <b>Omar 'Abdul Hafez al-Seelawi</b>, <b>Hani Mohammed al-
Seelawi</b>, <b>Abdul Rahman al-Masamha</b>, <b>Ra'ed 'Abdul Rahman al-Masmha</b>, <b>Rajeh 
Ziada</b>, <b>Mohammed Mousa al-Seelawi</b>, <b>Bahaa' al-Ashqar</b> and <b>Hassan Hijju</b> who have 
reportedly been killed during air strikes against the Ibrahim al-Maqadna mosque in Jabalya 
town in the northern Gaza strip.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>158. On 3 January 2009, at approximately 5.20 p.m., while dozens of Palestinian civilians 
were doing their evening prayer, the Israeli army fired a missile at the entrance to the 
Ibrahim al-Maqadna mosque near Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalya town in the northern 
Gaza strip. Reportedly, the Israeli army suspected that the mosque was housing militants.  
</p>
<p>159. As a result, twelve Palestinian civilians, including four children and a man as well as 
his son, were killed and thirty others were wounded. Later, three of the wounded died of 
their wounds, so the number of deaths mounted to fifteen. The twelve victims who were 
killed instantly were Mohammed al-Tanani (aged 18), Sa'id Salah Battah (aged 22), Ahmed 
Isma'il al-Buhdri (aged 23), A. T. (aged 16), Omar 'Abdul Hafez al-Seelawi (aged 35), H. 
M. al-S. (aged 10), Abdul Rahman al-Masamha (aged 47), Ra'ed 'Abdul Rahman al-
Masmha (aged 21), Rajeh Ziada (aged 18), M. M. al-S. (aged 10), Bahaa' al-Ashqar (aged 
20) and H. H. (aged 14).  
</p>
<p>160. In addition to the above incident, many other mosques were allegedly completely or 
partially damaged in the governorates of Rafah, Gaza, Khan Younis, Dier El Balah during 
the recent conflict in the Gaza strip. 
</p>
<p>161. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the Government&#8217;s treaty obligations under the 
Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, and also the relevant rules applicable to all armed conflicts under international 
humanitarian law and human rights law. Both the treaty obligations of the Government and 
applicable customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the conduct of 
hostilities include prohibitions on attacks against the civilian population and civilian 
objects, and require respect for the principles of proportionality and precautions in attack. 
Civilians are all persons who are not members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict 
and are protected against attack unless and for such time as they take a direct part in 
hostilities. Civilian objects, including places of worship, are also immune from attack, 
unless their nature, location or use, make an effective contribution to military action and 
whose destruction offers a definite military advantage. In addition, during military 
operations, special care must be taken to avoid damage to buildings dedicated to religion. 
</p>
<p>162. The Special Rapporteurs emphasized in their communication that, in the event of a 
lawful attack on a military objective, the principle of proportionality prohibits such attacks 
when it can be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life or injury to the civilians 
which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected. 
Compliance with this rule should be assessed for each attack taken individually and not for 
an overall military operation. The Special Rapporteurs noted that this approach was also 
reflected in the Judgment of the Israeli Supreme Court of 14 December 2006 (<i>The Public 
Committee against Torture in Israel et al. v. The Government of Israel et al.</i>; HCJ 769/02), 
which observed that &#8220;when the damage to innocent civilians is not proportionate to the 
benefit of the attacking army, the attack is disproportionate and forbidden.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>163. The Special Rapporteurs indicated that the obligations to take all necessary 
precautions to spare the civilian population and to limit to the maximum extent any 
incidental civilian loss of life include taking all appropriate measures to ensure: that the 
target of the attack is indeed a military objective; that the chosen means and methods of 
warfare will avoid civilian loss of life or limit incidental civilian loss of life; and, that a 
careful assessment of the conformity of the attack to the principle of proportionality is 
made. The timing of an attack should also be taken into account when assessing the 
conformity of the attack with the principles of distinction and proportionality.  
</p>
<p>164. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government if a complaint had been lodged on 
behalf of the victims mentioned above and requested details and where available, the 
results, of any investigation or inquiries carried out in relation to this case. Furthermore, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur asked the Government to explain how the principle of precaution was 
respected in the case of the targeting of the Ibrahim al-Maqadna mosque, on 3 January 
2009, in particular the launching of the attack during evening prayers and the assessment of 
conformity of the attack with the principles of distinction and proportionality.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) No response received from the Government

<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>165. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has so far not received a reply from the 
Government of Israel concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to recall 
that the General Assembly, in its resolution 63/181, urges States &#8220;to step up their efforts to 
protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this end, [&#8230;] 
to exert the utmost efforts, in accordance with their national legislation and in conformity 
with international human rights law, to ensure that religious places, sites, shrines and 
symbols are fully respected and protected.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>166. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her report submitted to 
the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights (see E.CN.4/2005/61, paras. 49-50), 
in which it was pointed out that members of religious or belief communities, whenever they 
find themselves in places of worship, are in a situation of special vulnerability given the 
nature of their activity. More generally, as mentioned, inter alia, in paragraph 4 of the 
Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment no. 22, places of worship are an essential 
element of the manifestation of the right to freedom of religion or belief to the extent that 
the great majority of religious or belief communities need the existence of a place of 
worship where their members can manifest their faith. Moreover, attacks or other forms of 
restriction on places of worship or other religious sites and shrines in many cases violate the 
right not only of a single individual, but the rights of a group of individuals forming the 
community that is attached to the place in question.

</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent on 29 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>167. The Special Rapporteur raised concern on information she had received concerning 
the <b>Christian-Baptist family</b> <b>Isakov</b> in the village of Kulanak, in the Naryn region. 
Summaries of this communication as well as observations of the Special Rapporteur are 
already reproduced in A/HRC/10/8/Add.1, paras. 122-125.  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Response from the Government dated 10 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>168. On 10 November 2008, the Government of Kyrgyzstan replied to the 
communication of 29 July 2008. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
Procurator&#8217;s Office of Naryn district had established the death on 18 May 2008 of Amanbek 
uulu Alymbek, born in 1994, a resident of Kulanak village, Naryn district, Naryn oblast. 
The father of the deceased, Alymbek Isakov, is a member of the Evangelical Christian 
Baptist Church in Kulanek.  
</p>
<p>169. On 19 May 2008, the Procurator&#8217;s Office of Naryn district received a report that the 
residents of Kulanak intended to hold a meeting to protest against the burial by members of 
the Evangelical Christian Baptist Church of the deceased Amanbek uulu Alymbek near to 
the Muslim cemetery in Kulanak. In order to examine this situation, the Procurator of Naryn 
region, the Head of the Naryn District Department of Internal Affairs and the First Deputy 
Akim of Naryn district made an on-the-spot visit, which was followed by that of the Head </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>of Administration of Naryn district, the Head of the Office of Internal Affairs and the 
Deputy Procurator of Naryn oblast.  
</p>
<p>170. In situ, it was established that, on 22 April 2004, the committee of Uchkun Ail 
Okmot in Naryn district had decided to allot 0.40 hectares of land to the head of the 
Evangelical Christian Baptist group, E. Tumonbaev, for 40 years for the burial of members 
of that church. The allotted piece of land is situated 30 metres from Kulanak in close 
proximity to the Muslim cemetery. However, before 18 May 2008 no members of this 
church had been buried on this piece of land. The representatives of the authorities who 
went to Kulanak explained to the residents of the village that it was inadmissible to violate 
the rights of freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>171. The confrontation between the residents of Kulanak and the members of the above 
mentioned church regarding the burial continued until 21 May 2008. In order to prevent 
clashes in the village, a detachment of the special rapid response unit of the Office of 
Internal Affairs of Naryn oblast was called out. It interposed itself between residents of the 
village and the members of the above-mentioned church. 
</p>
<p>172. In order to resolve this situation, on 21 May 2008 the local authorities decided that 
Amanbek uulu Alymbek should be buried in a place specially allotted to the members of the 
above-mentioned church in the village of Akiyya, Naryn district, with a view to preventing 
clashes and the kindling of religious strife. Representatives of the local authorities attended 
the burial and tendered their apologies to the Isakov family. 
</p>
<p>173. On 23 May 2008, the State Administration of Naryn oblast received a petition from 
members of the above-mentioned church regarding the infringement of religious rights 
during the burial of the body of Amanbek uulu Alymbek. This petition was sent on the very 
same day to the State Administration of Naryn district for an examination of the subject 
matter. The petitioners were informed of the findings of the examination. 
</p>
<p>174. On 17 June 2008, the Procurator&#8217;s Office of Naryn oblast received from the Office 
of the Procurator-General of the Kyrgyz Republic an application from K. Manybaev, who 
was acting on behalf of A. Isakov, concerning the infringement of the religious rights of the 
Isakov family. This application was sent to the Procurator&#8217;s Office of Naryn district for an 
examination of the subject matter. The petitioner was informed of the findings of the 
examination. 
</p>
<p>175. Burial grounds for religious minorities are allotted by community authorizing 
documents; there is no law or regulation governing the allotment of land to religious 
minorities in the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Action Force (HINDRAF) was a non-registered society. The Government furthermore 
pointed to the activities of HINDRAF carried out at the end of 2007 which led to the arrest 
of Mr. P. Uthayakumar, Mr. M. Manoharan, Mr. R. Kenghadharan, Mr. V. Ganabatirau and 
Mr. T. Vasanthakumar under section 8 (1) of the Internal Security Act 1960 on the grounds 
that they were a threat to public order and security. The Government further informed about 
the placement of the above-mentioned individuals in the Detention Protection Center 
Kamuntin, Taiping, Perak, and about the conditions of their detention. The Government 
stated that the allegation that they were denied their right to worship was absolutely untrue. 
All detainees were allowed to pray and practice their respective religion. A religious teacher 
was also available every week for each religion, including Hinduism. For the Hindus, their 
religious lecture was scheduled on Wednesday every week. However, no worship at a 
temple outside the Detention Protection Centre was allowed due to security reasons.

the Nigerian security forces during fighting in Northern Nigeria</b>, including the killing of 
Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, Mr. Alhaji Buji Fai and eight unidentified persons in security force 
custody.  
</p>
<p>183. From 26 July 2009, members of a group called Boko Haram rioted and attacked 
police stations and other Government buildings as well as places of worship in the Northern 
Nigerian states of Bauchi, Yobe, Kano, and especially Borno. Reports suggest that Boko 
Haram sought to impose their interpretation of Shari&#8217;a law in Nigeria, and that they 
intended to threaten or attack individuals who did not agree with or observe Boko Haram&#8217;s 
interpretation of Shari&#8217;a. 
</p>
<p>184. Government security forces launched an operation to stop the group&#8217;s violent 
activities, and fighting between Boko Haram members and Government forces ensued for 
five days. By 3 August 2009, at least 780 bodies had been picked up from the streets of 
Maiduguri (Borno state) alone. Another 98 deaths were reported from Yobe and Bauchi 
states. The total number of dead is to date unclear, as is the number of dead who were Boko 
Haram members, police, military or civilians.  
</p>
<p>185. On 28 July 2009, three unidentified individuals &#8211; suspected Boko Haram members &#8211; 
were arrested by members of the security forces in Maiduguri. They were taken to an area 
just outside the police headquarters in Maiduguri, and ordered to kneel on the ground. They </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>were asked questions by the security forces. Each of the three was then reportedly shot at 
close range, while unarmed and kneeling.  
</p>
<p>186. On 29 July 2009, members of the security forces disarmed and detained five alleged 
members of Boko Haram in a suburb of Maiduguri called Customs Bridge. The detained 
individuals were ordered to lie down. One of the security force members yelled &#8220;fire&#8221;, and 
the soldiers shot and killed the five men.  
</p>
<p>187. Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, the leader of the Boko Haram group, was apprehended by 
the military on 30 July 2009. He was captured by the commander of the military operations 
against Boko Haram, and transferred over to police in Maiduguri (Borno state) that same 
day. Photographic evidence of Mr. Yusuf&#8217;s capture by the military indicates that he was 
alive and did not have any injuries at that time, except for a wound in his arm which had 
been treated. After his transfer to police custody, Mr. Yusuf was stripped naked, 
interrogated, and then shot at close range numerous times by police. A few hours later, the 
body was shown to journalists. According to some police accounts of the death, including 
by the Police Commissioner of Borno state, Mr. Yusuf was not shot by police, but sustained 
injuries during his capture by the military, and subsequently died from those wounds. 
However, Regional Police Assistant Inspector-General stated that Mr. Yusuf was killed by 
police while trying to escape from custody.  
</p>
<p>188. On 31 July 2009, a former Commissioner of Religious Affairs in Borno state, Mr. 
Alhaji Buji Fai, was killed by police. He was accused of having close ties to, or being a 
supporter of, the Boko Haram group. He was arrested on 31 July 2009 in a joint military-
police operation (&#8220;Operation Flush&#8221;), and taken to Police Force Headquarters in Maiduguri. 
According to information received, he was there stripped of his shirt, interrogated, and 
executed at the entrance to the police station.  
</p>
<p>189. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to conduct an impartial and 
transparent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of all those killed during 
the fighting, including Mr. Mohammed Yusuf, Mr. Buji Fai, and the eight unidentified 
individuals, with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and prosecutorial action and 
ensuring accountability of any person guilty of unlawful killings, as well as to compensate 
the families of the victims. The Special Rapporteurs also asked the Government to indicate 
if any measures were envisaged to prevent the recurrence of violent clashes, including inter-
religious ones. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) No response received from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>190. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has so far not received a reply from the 
Government of Nigeria concerning the above mentioned allegations. She wishes to refer to 
the recommendations in her mission report of her country visit to Nigeria in 
February/March 2005 (see E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.2, paras. 103-115), especially with regard to 
religious tensions and communal violence. 
</p>
<p>191. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 6/37, urges States to &#8220;take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity 
with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of 
violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as 
well as incitement to hostility and violence&#8221;. </p>

<p><b> 2. Communication sent on 20 November 2009 as a follow-up to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
country visit to Nigeria in February/March 2005 
</b></p>
<p>192. In a follow-up letter of 20 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur reiterated her 
appreciation for the cooperation of the Government in relation to her visit to Nigeria from 
27 February to 7 March 2005. She emphasized that follow-up to country reports was of 
central importance to the cooperation and dialogue between mandate holders and States. 
Referring to her previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/8, para. 17), the 
Special Rapporteur indicated that the aim of such follow-up letters after country visits was 
to receive updated information about the implementation of the recommendations at the 
national level.  
</p>
<p>193. For ease of reference, the Special Rapporteur also transmitted a table containing the 
conclusions and recommendations in the related mission report (E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.2) as 
well as follow-up information from relevant United Nations documents, including from the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review, Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies. 
The Special Rapporteur asked the Government to provide her with updated information on 
the consideration given to these recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and 
any constraints which may prevent their implementation. This table, including any 
information provided by the Government, is available online on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s

<p><b> R. Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Urgent appeal sent on 4 March 2009 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>194. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding five <b>members of the Ahmadiyya community</b> 
residing in Chak 172/TDA, Layyah district. On 28 January 2009, Mr. M. I. (aged 14), Mr. 
Tahir Imran (aged 19), Mr. Tahir Mehmood (aged 19), Mr. N. A. (aged 16) and Mr. 
Mubashif Ahmad (aged 50), were arrested at their respective homes. They were all charged 
for &#8220;use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet&#8221; under section 295-C of 
the Pakistani Penal Code, according to which a person may be subject to either death 
penalty or life imprisonment. They were accused of having desecrated the name of Prophet 
Muhammad by writing it on the walls of the latrines of the Gulzar-e-Madina mosque. 
</p>
<p>195. Despite the absence of witness or evidence of the Ahmadis&#8217; involvement in the 
alleged case of blasphemy, they were arrested before any investigation was carried out. 
Family members of the five people arrested were told that the police was under pressure of 
certain political and religious groups to take action against these people. These groups 
would have reportedly threatened to seal the whole city and attack the houses of Ahmadis, if 
the five people were not arrested. 
</p>
<p>196. The Special Procedures mandate holders asked the Government to provide the 
details and where available, the results, of any judicial investigation, or any criminal 
charges and other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. They also asked the 
Government to indicate the legal basis for the arrest and detention of Mr. M. I., Mr. Tahir 
Imran, Mr. Tahir Mehmood, Mr. N. A. and Mr. Mubashif Ahmad and how these measures 
are compatible with applicable international human rights norms and standards as 
stipulated, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, where applicable, 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Responses from the Government dated 17 August 2009 and 8 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>197. The Government of Pakistan in its letter dated 17 August 2009 provided the 
following detailed and up-to-date information regarding investigations, arrest and other 
inquiries carried out in relation to the above mentioned case. On receiving a written 
application from a resident of village no. 172/TDA a First Information Report was lodged 
against Mr. I. A., Mr. Tahir Mehmood, Mr. Tahir Imran, Mr. N. A. and Mr. Mubashir 
Ahmad under section 295-C of the Pakistani Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>198. Initial investigations of the case were conducted by Sub-Inspector of Police, Mr. 
Muhammad Afzal, who was in charge for investigation of police station in Kot Sultan. He 
carried out an on the spot inspection and recorded the statements of eight witnesses under 
section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code. All the witnesses supported the complainant. 
Subsequently, police arrested four out of the five accused, namely Mr. I. A., Mr. Tahir 
Mehmood, Mr. Tahir Imran and Mr. N. A. and produced them in the court of law on 29 
January 2009. Two days of physical remand of the accused were given by the court of Illaqa 
Magistrate.  
</p>
<p>199. As required under section 156-A of the Criminal Procedure Code, a blasphemy case 
has to be investigated by an officer not less than the rank of Superintendent of Police (SP). 
Since no SP investigation was posted in that district, the subject investigation was entrusted 
to Mr. Pervaiz Tareen, SP Investigation Rajanpur by the Regional Police Officer of DG 
Khan. On 30 January 2009, Mr. Pervaiz Tareen inspected the site and investigated the 
complainants and the witnesses. He also arrested the fifth person, namely Mr. Mubashir 
Ahmad and obtained his physical remand for two days of Illaqa Magistrate. In order to 
verify the initial investigation of the case, he also interrogated the four accused who had 
already been arrested. Further physical remand of the accused for four days until 3 February 
2009 was also obtained from the court. All the five accused were sent to judicial remand on 
4 February 2009. A charge sheet against all the accused was prepared and sent to the court 
of law for judicial verdict. The accused submitted their bail application in the Court of 
Additional District and Session Judge Layyah, which was cancelled on 13 June 2009. On 7 
July 2009, all the accused obtained &#8220;after arrest bail&#8221; from the Court of Mr. Justice Pervaiz 
Inayat Malik, Judge of Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, Multan. 
</p>
<p>200. The Government indicated that strict adherence to the laws of the land was observed 
throughout the proceedings of this case. The accused were arrested after registration of a 
First Information Report by the complainant and production of evidence by witnesses 
against them under section 295-C of the Pakistani Penal Code. Subsequently, the accused 
were produced before the court of law and their physical remand was given by the 
competent court of law. The Government added that, as required under section 156-A of the 
Criminal Procedure Code, the investigation of this blasphemy case was conducted by an 
officer not less than the rank of Superintendent of Police, SP Rajanpur. 
</p>
<p>201. In its letter dated 8 February 2010, the Government of Pakistan indicated that all the 
accused were granted &#8220;after arrest bail&#8221; by the Lahore High Court, which also ordered 
medical examination of four of the accused from Nishtar Hospital, Multan, to fix their age. 
On 3 November 2009, the Court examined the medical reports of the four individuals, 
declared them less than 18 years and directed the police to put up new <i>challans</i> of the 
accused separately. In compliance with the order of the Court, the concerned police 
department prepared and submitted appropriate supplementary <i>challans</i> in the Court of 
Law. The Government indicated that the case was <i>sub judice</i> in the court of Mr. Mian 
Muhammad Qasim, the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, Multan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>202. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Pakistan replied to the 
joint urgent appeal of 4 March 2009. She would like to stress the risk that efforts to combat 
blasphemy may be manipulated for purposes contrary to human rights and that any 
blasphemy legislation should not be used to censure all inter-religious and intra-religious 
criticism (see E/CN.4/2000/65, para. 111 and A/62/280, paras. 75-77).  
</p>
<p>203. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to make reference to the report of 
her predecessor on his country visit to Pakistan, in which Mr. Abdelfattah Amor stated that 
&#8220;applying the death penalty for blasphemy appears disproportionate and even unacceptable&#8221; 
(see E/CN.4/1996/95/Add.1, para. 82). International human rights law provides that States 
which retain the death penalty can only impose it for &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221;. As 
observed by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the 
conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of 
the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; 
provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that 
there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (see A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). 
</p>
<p>204. With respect to the two children involved, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer 
to article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which, inter alia, provides that 
neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be 
imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age and that the arrest, 
detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used 
only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Communication sent on 5 August 2009  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>205. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she 
had received regarding <b>attacks against the members of the Christian community</b> in the 
city of Gojra, Punjab Province. On 25 July 2009, in Korian village, near Gojra, some 
individuals made allegations of desecration of the Holy Quran against Mr. Talib Masih, Mr. 
Mukhtar Masih and Mr. Imran Masih, residents of the village, on account of three Christian 
children aged 5 to 6, who allegedly cut an Islamic book in order to play with the papers. Mr. 
Talib Masih, Mr. Mukhtar Masih and Mr. Imran Masih vehemently denied the allegations 
and the local people resolved the matter amicably on 28 July 2009.  
</p>
<p>206. Subsequently, an Imam of the mosque, Mr. Maulvi Imran Aslam and Mr. Ashraf 
Mochi (cobbler), refused to accept any apology and involved extremist religious groups, 
who manipulated the situation and raised a mob in Gojra. The mob burnt Christian houses 
with chemicals and Molotov cocktails. They used firearm and in the process, one person 
was injured and later passed away. The same evening on 31 July 2009, the Islamists, along 
with other Muslims, blocked the traffic and demanded the arrest of the three individuals 
accused of having desecrated the Holy Quran. The demonstration was organised and 
announced through loudspeakers of mosques before and during the Friday prayers. The 
crowd was charged and directed to reassemble the next day in Gojra. The mob swelled and 
moved towards a block of Christian housing. It was armed with sticks, stones, guns and 
other chemicals. Violence erupted and eight people (all Christians of the same family) were 
killed and several injured. 
</p>
<p>207. It was reported that the local authorities were warned by non-governmental 
organizations, leaders of the Christian community and the Federal Government on and 
throughout after 30 July 2009. The local authorities allegedly turned a blind eye. Although </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>enquiries have been ordered by the Chief Justice of the High Court and the National 
Assembly, the leaders of the mob have reportedly not been arrested yet. 
</p>
<p>208. The Special Rapporteur recalled that the Human Rights Council in its resolution 
6/37 urges States to &#8220;take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with 
international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
incitement to hostility and violence, with particular regard to religious minorities&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteur also urged the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the members of the Christian community are respected and 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. She also requested 
that the Government adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 11 August 2009 
</b></p>
<p>209. The Government, in its response dated 11 August 2009, referred to the Constitution 
of Pakistan which guarantees equal rights to all its citizens irrespective of race, religion and 
creed. The Government emphasized that it undertook its responsibility seriously and was 
committed to take all necessary and appropriate steps, in conformity with international 
human rights standards, to promote and protect the rights of all its citizens, including 
religious minorities.  
</p>
<p>210. Accordingly, the Government stressed that it had not only strongly condemned the 
incident of violence in Gojra, at the highest levels (President, Prime Minister and Federal 
Cabinet), but it had also taken a series of immediate steps to address the situation, which 
inter alia included the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Prime Minister of Pakistan visited the site along with the Chief Minister of 
Punjab and assured the local Christian community to protect the victims of the riots 
as well as to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Federal Government had ordered a high level inquiry and, on the request of the 
Provincial Government, the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court had initiated a 
judicial inquiry into the incident 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A Presidential relief package announced by the Government included 500,000 
rupees to the family of each of the deceased and 300,000 rupees for each family 
whose house had been burnt 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A grant of 200,000,000 rupees had been announced by the Federal and Provincial 
Governments for the rehabilitation of the affected houses in the Christian colony of 
Gojra 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government would also bear all expenses of the development, renovation or 
repair of churches and other places of worship 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A Committee was formed by the Chief Minister of Punjab to supervise the 
rehabilitation work in Gojra and to create religious harmony in the province 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An assessment team was carrying out a survey of the damaged properties to pay 
compensation in line with the package announced 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A relief camp had been established at site, while the Home Secretary of Punjab 
along with the Commissioner and Regional Police Officer of Faisalabad were 
monitoring and supervising the investigations and rehabilitation activities 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An officer of the rank of the Secretary had been appointed as Relief Commissioner 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Free medical treatment was being provided to the injured </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The President of Pakistan had tasked the Federal Minister for Minority Affairs to 
remain seized with the matter till the complete normalization of the situation 
</p>
<p>211. The Government shared the above information as an interim response regarding 
different immediate steps taken by the Government in the aftermath of this sordid incident. 
Furthermore, it indicated to provide the Special Rapporteur with further details of the steps 
taken by the Government together with responses to the questions addressed in her letter. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>212. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Pakistan immediately 
replied to her communication of 5 August 2009. She is looking forward to receiving further 
details of the steps taken by the Government to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the 
members of the Christian community are respected and accountability of any person guilty 
of the alleged violations is ensured.

<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>222. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding Mr. <b>Zulpakharov Amangeldi Zhumadullugli</b>, aged 39. On 30 
August 1999, Mr. Zulpakharov Amangeldi Zhumadullugli was sentenced to a prison term of 
nine years under article 159 of the Criminal Code (&#8220;Attempt at changing the constitutional 
order of the Republic of Uzbekistan&#8221;) on the basis of two Hisb-ut-Tahrir leaflets the police 
found when searching his house. He was first detained in KIN 64/61 in Karshi, then 
transferred to 64/49 and 64/25 in Bukhara. Between 2003 and 2008, he was held in KIN 
64/3 in Tavaksay, Tashkent Oblast. Few days before his sentence was to come to an end, he 
was brought before court for allegedly disobeying orders of the penitentiary administration, 
sentenced to an additional term of two and a half years and taken to the strict regime colony 
KIN 64/51 in Koson, Bukhara Oblast.  
</p>
<p>223. In March 2009, reportedly in order to punish him for praying, Mr. Zulpakharov 
Amangeldi Zhumadullugli was confined to a punishment cell and subjected to severe 
beatings. As a result, he suffers from fractures of one of his hands and of his collarbones. 
The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government if a complaint had been lodged by or on 
behalf of Mr. Zulpakharov and they requested further details, and where available the 
results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried 
out in relation to this case. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 5 June 2009 
</b></p>
<p>224. By letter dated 5 June 2009, the Government of Uzbekistan provided the following 
information on the case of Mr. Zulpakharov Omongeldi Zhumadillaevich, an Uzbek born in 
1970 in the Chinaz district of Tashkent province, who had no previous convictions and was 
unemployed prior to his arrest. The Chinaz district criminal court sentenced him on 26 
November 1999 to nine years&#8217; deprivation of liberty under the following articles of the 
Criminal Code of Uzbekistan: article 159, paragraphs 3 (a) and (b) (Repeated breach of the 
constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan by or in the interests of an organized 
group); article 244-1, paragraph 3 (a) (Preparation or distribution of material posing a threat 
to public safety and public order in concert with a group of persons); and article 216 
(Unlawful organization and active participation in the activities of illegal associations or 
religious organizations).  
</p>
<p>225. As Mr. Zulpakharov was liable to disciplinary measures on several occasions while 
serving his sentence in detention facility UY 64/3 (Bostanlyk district of Tashkent province) </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>for violations of established detention procedures and failure to comply with the lawful 
requirements of the penal institution administration, he was sentenced by the Bostanlyk 
district criminal court on 22 August 2008 to 3 years, 1 month and 17 days&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty under article 221, paragraph 2 (b), of the Criminal Code (Non-compliance with the 
lawful requirements of the penal institution administration by persons convicted of serious 
or very serious offences), and is serving his sentence in detention facility UY 64/51 (Kasan, 
Kashkadarya province). 
</p>
<p>226. The Government indicated that the penal administration described him in 
unfavourable terms. He was registered with the clinic on account of his chronic gastritis. 
His state of health was satisfactory and he was capable of working. An investigation into a 
complaint filed by Ms. U. Zulpakharova did not support her claims that Mr. Zulpakharov 
had been tortured. The Government indicated that the penal institution medical service 
workers and fellow prisoners in the colony said that no unlawful acts had been committed 
against Mr. Zulpakharov. Reportedly, medical examiners found no indications or traces of 
bodily harm while he was undergoing outpatient or inpatient treatment. 
</p>
<p>227. The main office for penal enforcement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs carried out 
an audit pursuant to an appeal by the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council. It 
established that according to the findings of the medical section of penal enforcement office 
No. 51 of the Department of Internal Affairs of Kashkadarya province, Mr. Zulpakharov 
was examined on 4 September 2008 and diagnosed with chronic gastritis. Mr. Zulpakharov 
was given the necessary medical assistance based on this diagnosis and received inpatient 
treatment between 17 to 25 September 2008 and 22 to 30 April 2009. Mr. Zulpakharov did 
not complain to the medical service while serving his sentence about bodily harm 
experienced, and his overall state of health was now satisfactory.  
</p>
<p>228. Moreover, the Government stated that Mr. Zulpakharov was not subjected to any 
disciplinary action or locked up for violating internal procedures in March 2009. The penal 
institution administration did not bring any physical or moral pressure to bear on Mr. 
Zulpakharov while he was serving his sentence, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
received no complaint or statement concerning torture from the prisoner himself. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>229. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the 
joint urgent appeal of 22 April 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Urgent appeal sent on 9 September 2009 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>230. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding Mr. <b>Sobit Zufarov</b>, aged 30, and his deceased brother, Mr. 
<b>Negmat Zufarov</b>, aged 45 at the time of his death, both of Tashkent.  
</p>
<p>231. According to the information received, Mr. Negmat Zufarov was arrested in 1999 on 
charges related to the practice of his religion. These charges included &#8220;upsetting the 
constitutional order&#8221; (article 159 of the Uzbek criminal code) and &#8220;setting up, leading or 
participating in a religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other banned 
organization&#8221; (article 244(2) of the Uzbek criminal code). In August 1999, Negmat 
Zufaraov was sentenced to a 20-year prison term by the Tashkent District Court. On appeal 
to the Supreme Court, the sentence was converted to an 18-year-sentence in a strict regime 
prison. Negmat Zufaraov served the first five years of his prison sentence at Jaslyk prison, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>where he sustained multiple beatings and ill-treatment as punishment for his praying. 
Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s family wrote letters of concern about his ill-treatment to the Uzbek 
Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate of Prison, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s office &#8211; the responses were dismissive and no action was taken in response 
to the allegations.  
</p>
<p>232. In 2004, Negmat Zufaraov was transferred to a prison in Chirchik, and then 
subsequently to Zarafshan prison colony. In spring 2007, he was sentenced to an additional 
20 months in prison to be served in Zarafshan, allegedly for violating prison rules. His 
family had not been informed in advance of the charges, nor were they sent a copy of the 
verdict. Whilst he was at Zarafshan prison, Negmat Zufaraov was allegedly subjected to 
torture and ill-treatment over several years. In particular, he was beaten by four fellow 
inmates with plastic bottles filled with water, and regularly placed in an isolation cell as 
punishment for praying. Even when he was in isolation, the fellow inmates who had beaten 
Negmat Zufaraov, were allowed access to him, and continued to beat him. In mid-May 
2009, Negmat Zufaraov commenced a hunger strike, demanding that he be allowed to pray. 
After six days, he was force-fed by prison authorities, who also performed a forced enema 
on him, using pepper solution. The beatings allegedly continued after his hunger strike.  
</p>
<p>233. When his family visited him between 2 and 5 June 2009, Negmat Zufaraov informed 
them that he was being subjected to intensified ill-treatment in prison, to the point where he 
feared for his life. On 16 June 2009, prison authorities telephoned Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s 
family and informed them that he had committed suicide. His body was delivered to his 
family who were also given a death certificate stating that he had died of &#8220;mechanical 
asphyxiation&#8221;. However, Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s body displayed signs of ill-treatment, 
including wounds to the head, visible blood clots, a hematoma on his neck, and bruises on 
his back. Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s family was instructed by the prison authorities to bury him the 
next morning, without any opportunity for a medical examination of his body. The burial 
was observed by police, who also monitored the family&#8217;s house in the days following the 
return of Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s body.  
</p>
<p>234. In 2000, the brother of Negmat Zufarov, Sobit Zufarov, was also arrested for 
religion-related charges. In spite of a serious medical condition, he was sentenced to 8 
years&#8217; imprisonment in a strict regime prison in 2000, and is currently serving time in 
Prison Colony 46 in Navoi region. In January 2008, just prior to his release date, Sobit 
Zufaraov was charged with violating prison rules, and was sentenced to a further 3 years 
and 6 months imprisonment. There have been reports that Sobit Zufaraov was being ill-
treated in prison, including being placed in an isolation cell for up to six months as 
punishment for praying. In light of above allegations of isolation, concern is expressed in 
relation to Sobit Zufarov&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>235. The Special Rapporteurs appealed to the Government to ensure the right to freedom 
of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief 
and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Furthermore, they referred to General Assembly 
resolution 63/181, in which the Assembly recognizes with concern the situation of persons 
in vulnerable situations, including persons deprived of their liberty. The Special 
Rapporteurs also recalled the conclusions of the Human Rights Committee in a custodial 
death case (<i>Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay</i>, communication no. 84/1981 of 21 October 1982, 
paragraph 9.2) and indicated that, in order to overcome the presumption of State 
responsibility for a death in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and impartial 
investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, 
including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural 
death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). The Special 
Rapporteurs urged the Government to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Negmat Zufaraov expeditiously, impartially and transparently, 
including the conduct of an independent autopsy, also with a view to taking all appropriate 
disciplinary and prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the 
alleged violations, as well as to compensate Negmat Zufaraov&#8217;s family. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 13 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>236. On 13 October 2009, the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the joint urgent 
appeal of 9 September 2009. Since the Special Rapporteur had not received the response&#8217;s 
translation from the relevant services at the time this report was finalized, she is 
unfortunately not in a position to summarize in English the content of the Government&#8217;s 
response in the present report. However, a copy of the original response letter is available 
online at the following address: www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/docs/

</p>
<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>237. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the 
joint urgent appeal of 9 September 2009 and hopes to be able to make observations on the 
response in the next report. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Urgent appeal sent on 2 October 2009 jointly with the Chairperson Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>238. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding a group of followers of Rasulzhon Rahmatov in the 
town of Shakhrikhan, including <b>Alibojev Akhroriddin, Akhmadaliev Dilshod, 
Akhmedov Mirzokhid, Akhunov Akhror, Bobojonov Ulugbek, Dolimov Zayniddin, 
Isroilov Erkin, Ismoilov Sherali, Juraev Zajnobiddin, Keldiev Rovshan, Latipov 
Khamidulokh, Muhammadjonov Mirzohid, Nabibullaev Kakhramonjon, Nazarbekov

Siddikov Muzaffarjon, Soliev Nematullokh, Usmonov Isroiljon, Usmonov Khokim, 
Usmonov Jamolddin </b>and<b> Usmonov Pulatzhon</b>. 
</p>
<p>239. According to the information received, in early June 2009, when hafiz Rasulzhon 
Rahmatov, an imam in the town of Shakhrikhan, was departing for Tashkent, a group of 
special forces officers with automatic rifles, masks and complete military equipage came to 
his home. The forces were looking for Mr. Rahmatov, whom they had previously 
interrogated after he had written a complaint letter to the city administration with regard to 
the disappearance of Sheikh Abdulavi Kori Mirzoev. However, once it became clear that 
Mr. Rahmatov was absent, they began to detain his followers and close friends. During the 
next two or three days sixty of his disciples were arrested in Shakhrikhan. When Mr. 
Rahmatov learned that he was being sought, he fled to Moscow. One week later, he 
continued on to Turkey. It is alleged that he has subsequently been put on an international 
wanted list. As of 30 September 2009, more disciples of Mr. Rahmatov have been arrested 
in Shakhrikhan. They were held in custody in Shakhrikhan for several days before being 
remanded in custody at a pre-trial detention centre in Andijan. Reportedly, all persons 
detained had been subjected to several methods of torture.  
</p>
<p>240. The Special Procedures mandate holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to 
General Assembly resolution 63/181, in which the Assembly urges States &#8220;to ensure that no </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person 
because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, or arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to 
bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221; (para. 9 b). The Special 
Procedures mandate holders asked the Government to indicate the legal basis for the arrest 
and detention of the abovementioned persons and how these measures were compatible with 
applicable international human rights norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Response from the Government dated 16 November 2009 
</b></p>
<p>241. In its response dated 16 November 2009, the Government indicated that the 
investigative department of the Shakhrikhansky district internal affairs office in 
Andizhanskaya province instituted criminal proceedings on 20 May 2009 for an offence 
punishable under article 244-2, part 1, of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The preliminary 
investigation established that from 2000 to 2009 Mr. Rasulzhon Abdurakhimovich 
Rakhmatov, Mr. Isroil Pulatovich Usmonov, Mr. Utkirbek Nazarbekov and others were 
active members of an extremist religious group whose aim was to commit criminal acts in 
Uzbekistan in order to overthrow the constitutional order and organize underground 
&#8220;jamoat&#8221; cells. According to the Government, they brought &#8220;jamoat&#8221; members together and 
instructed them, using prohibited literature and recordings of broadcasts by the leader of the 
Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Takhir Yuldashev, to unconstitutionally overthrow the 
Government. Reportedly, they trained people in methods of taking over power and 
removing the legally elected and appointed Government representatives, they 
unconstitutionally violated the country&#8217;s territorial integrity and they distributed materials 
with the same content as that mentioned above. 
</p>
<p>242. The Government indicated that Mr. Rasulzhon Abdurakhimovich Rakhmatov and 
other associates were prosecuted in a criminal case under article 242, part 1; article 159, part 
3 (a) and (b); article 2441, part 3 (a) and (c); article 2442, part 1; article 243; article 246, 
part 1; article 189, part 3; article 190, part 2 (b); and article 223, part 2 (b) of the Criminal 
Code of Uzbekistan. The accused were the subject of a pre-trial restraining order in the form 
of detention that was issued by the criminal court in the town of Andizhana. On 24 May 
2009, the decision was made to initiate the investigation of Mr. Rasulzhon 
Abdurakhimovich Rakhmatov. According to the Government, from the moment of their 
arrest the constitutional rights of the accused persons were fully respected. They were 
provided with State legal aid, and in accordance with article 217 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure of Uzbekistan, their relatives were informed of their arrest in a timely manner. 
</p>
<p>243. On 26 August 2009, a criminal indictment of Mr. I. Usmonov and others, issued in 
accordance with article 388 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was sent to the procurator&#8217;s 
office of Andizhanskaya province. On 3 September 2009, the indictment was approved and 
the case was sent to court. The criminal case against Mr. I. Usmonov and others began on 
25 September 2009. The judicial proceedings in the criminal case against I. Usmonov and 
others are continuing. 
</p>
<p>244. The Government indicated that during the consideration of this criminal case, no 
instances have been found of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of the 
defendants. It emphasized that all the defendants had been provided with defence counsel, 
and during the judicial hearings their interests had been defended by 14 lawyers. 
</p>
<p>245. In addition, the Government confirmed that criminal proceedings had been instituted 
against Mr. Pulatzhon Usmonov under article 223, part 2 (b), of the Criminal Code of 
Uzbekistan. However, in the course of the preliminary investigation, a decision issued on 28 
August 2008 by the Senate of the Majlisi Oli declared an amnesty in connection with the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>seventeenth anniversary of the country&#8217;s independence, and Mr. Pulatzhon Usmonov was 
absolved of any criminal liability without any decision as to his guilt or innocence. 
</p>
<p>246. According to the Government, Mr. Akhroriddin Aliboev, Mr. Ulugbek 
Babadzhanov, Mr. Zanobiddin Zhuraev, Mr. Mirzokhid Mukhammadzhonov and Mr. 
Akhunov Akhror were never brought to the internal affairs office and have not been cited in 
the criminal case as suspects, defendants or witnesses. Furthermore, no criminal cases had 
been brought against A. Aliboev, A. Akhunov, U. Babazhanov, E. Isroilov, Z. Zhuraev, M. 
Mukhammadzhonov, K. Nabibullaev, A. Sharofidinov and P. Usmonov in the national 
courts. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>248. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she 
had received regarding <b>acts of religious intolerance and violence against</b> <b>members of the 
Catholic and Jewish communities</b> in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>249. According to the allegations, on 22 January 2009, the Apostolic Nunciature was 
reportedly attacked when members of an organization called &#8220;La Piedrita&#8221; threw gas 
canisters into its house. Reportedly, the attackers also left pamphlets insulting Catholic 
leaders. It was reported that the attack may also be related to the housing of a student 
activist and opposition member by the Apostolic Nunciature.  
</p>
<p>250. On 30 January 2009, at around 10 p.m., fifteen unidentified armed men tied up a 
security guard at the Tiferet Israel Synagogue in the Marip&#233;rez district of Caracas and 
forced their way into the synagogue. They threw Torah scrolls on the floor, stole the 
Synagogue&#8217;s computers and spray-painted the walls with anti-Semitic graffiti, such as 
&#8220;Damn the Jews&#8221;, &#8220;Jews out of here&#8221;, &#8220;Death to all&#8221; and &#8220;Israel assassins&#8221;. Reportedly, this 
was the second time in a month that the Synagogue was vandalized with graffiti depicting 
anti-Semitic messages. In addition, earlier in January 2009, the message &#8220;Property of Islam&#8221; 
had been sprayed on its walls. President Hugo Chavez publicly condemned the attack on the 
Synagogue and promised representatives of Venezuela&#8217;s Jewish community that those 
responsible would be brought to justice. On 7 and 8 February 2009, reportedly seven police 
officers and four civilians were arrested for their alleged involvement in the attack.

<p>258. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Venezuela replied to her 
communication of 10 February 2009.  </p>

<p><b> 1. Communication sent on 25 November 2009 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and 
on the right to non-discrimination in this context, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Allegations transmitted to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>259. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information 
they had received regarding the recent <b>eviction of monks and nuns from Bat Nha 
monastery</b> and their future eviction from Phuoc Hue temple, due to take place on 30 
November 2009. 
</p>
<p>260. On 27 September 2009, about 150 people armed with sticks and hammers attacked 
the Bat Nha monastery. Plain-clothes police officers were reportedly amongst the mob and 
police officers in uniform blocked the roads leading to the monastery. The mob violently 
proceeded to the eviction of 379 monks and nuns from the monastery. Some monks and 
nuns were beaten up and four of them were sexually assaulted. According to the reports, the 
monks did not attempt to defend themselves, but they sat down and started to chant in order 
to respond in a non-violent manner to the attacks. Two senior brothers, Mr. Phap Hoi and 
Mr. Phap Sy, were beaten and would be still held under house arrest without proper charges 
in Hanoi and Nha Trang.  
</p>
<p>261. After being evicted, the monks and nuns were offered refuge by Mr. Thai Thuan, the 
abbot of Phuoc Hue temple in Bao Loc. On 28 September 2009, the police threatened the 
abbot, claiming he had no right to offer refuge to the Bat Nha monks and nuns. The police 
then surrounded the temple and they started an intimidation campaign. Flyers were 
distributed in Bao Loc in order to damage the reputation of the abbot and he was denounced 
through loudspeakers in schools and in the streets. Police officers threatened to undertake 
attacks on Phuoc Hue temple similar to the ones undertaken against the Bat Nha monastery 
on 27 September 2009. The intimidation campaign culminated with the demand that the 
abbot surrender fifteen monks and nuns. Under this extreme pressure, the abbot acceded to 
the demand and surrendered fifteen monks and nuns, who were taken into police custody 
and were driven more than 200 km away from Ho Chi Minh city.  
</p>
<p>262. The other Bat Nha monks and nuns who currently remain in Phuoc Hue temple were 
still reportedly undergoing pressure and threats from the authorities to leave the temple. 
They were living under strict control of the police. The police harassed and obstructed 
people who were bringing food and clothing to the temple. Anyone who stopped in the 
vicinity of the temple was being stopped and questioned.  
</p>
<p>263. Concerns were expressed that the crackdown on the Bat Nha Buddhist community 
was due to the teachings of Mr. Thich Nhat Hanh, leader of the Bat Nha Buddhist 
community. Mr. Thich Nhat Hanh would have made public recommendations in 2007 in 
order to improve the situation of religious freedom in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 
including a request to disband the country&#8217;s religious police.  
</p>
<p>264. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the members of the Bat Nha Buddhist community 
are respected and that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is 
ensured. The Special Rapporteurs also requested that the Government adopts effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  </p>

<p><b> (b) Responses from the Government dated 2 and 3 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>265. In its response letters dated 2 and 3 February 2010, the Government indicated that 
the information in the allegation letter of 25 November 2009 concerning the recent eviction 
of monks and nuns from Bat Nha monastery and their future eviction from Phuoc Hue 
temple did not accurately reflect the reality. The Government stated that no one at Bat Nha 
monastery and Phuoc Hue temple had been threatened, beaten up, sexually harassed, 
arrested or detained by local police officers. Reportedly, the monks and nuns of Lang Mai 
sect had to leave Bat Nha monastery due to the fact that they had no longer been offered 
refuge by the abbot of Bat Nha monastery. According to information given by the abbot of 
Bat Nha monastery, Lang Mai had carried out a number of activities in violation of the 
charter of the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha, including its self-made decisions on the 
appointment of the Deputy Administer of Bat Nha monastery and the organization of a 
religious training course without approval of the Administer of Bat Nha monastery. These 
actions taken by Lang Mai had &#8211; according to the Government &#8211; demonstrated the lack of 
respect towards the Administer of the monastery and had resulted in deep disagreement with 
the monastery&#8217;s Buddhist followers. 
</p>
<p>266. The Government stressed that over the past, while staying at Phuoc Hue temple, the 
monks and nuns of Lang Mai sect had continued not to abide by the charter of the Buddhist 
Sangha and laws, bringing about a conflict with local Buddhist followers and negative 
impacts on the social order. Due to these facts, the Sangha Patronage Council and the 
Buddhist Provincial Executive Board of Lam Dong Province had requested the monks and 
nuns of Lang Mai sect at Phuoc temple to return to their registered localities. The 
Government added that the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha had also given instructions to the 
Buddhist Provincial and City Executive Boards of Lam Dong to provide the monks and 
nuns of Lang Mai sect with favourable conditions to return to their registered residence and 
continue to lead their normal religious life. 
</p>
<p>267. Furthermore, the Government informed that at present the monks and nuns of Lang 
Mai sect had left Phuoc Hue temple and returned to their registered residence to continue to 
lead their normal religious life with the assistance and support given by the local authority. 
The competent Vietnamese authorities had not received any complaint lodged by the monks 
and nuns of Lang Mai sect with regard to the alleged incident. 
</p>
<p>268. The Government indicated that the Vietnamese authorities had immediately reported 
on the incident in question and that Government officials had been sent right away to Lam 
Dong Province to carry out inquiries on the ground. These inquiries had confirmed that the 
incident at Bat Nha monastery and Phuoc Hue temple constituted a nonviolent conflict on 
the modalities of leading a religious life between two groups and that no one had been 
beaten up, sexually harassed or illegally detained etc. Due to the lack of adequate evidence, 
the competent agencies had not carried out judicial investigations and subsequently no one 
had been accused of criminal charges. 
</p>
<p>269. The Government emphasized that the incident which happened at Bat Nha 
monastery and Phuoc Hue temple belonged to the Buddhist internal affairs since it was a 
pure disagreement on the organizational method of leading a religious life between those 
Vietnamese monks and nuns of Lang Mai sect (French) and Buddhist followers of Bat Nha 
monastery and Phuoc Hue temple (Bao Loc, Lam Dong Province). According to the 
Government, these Buddhist internal affairs should be solved by and guided by the Sangha 
Patronage Council of the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha without the intervention by the 
Vietnamese authorities except measures that are needed to be taken to safeguard the security 
and social order. 
</p>
<p>270. Finally, the Government added that Vietnamese law always respects and ensures 
that citizens carry out legitimate and legal religious activities. Due to the fact that Lang Mai </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>sect was a new Buddhist activity, the Government argued, in order to be accepted by a 
majority of the Vietnamese people, Lang Mai sect needed to have a dialogue with the 
Vietnamese Buddhist followers, to increase communication as well as knowledge about its 
activities and abide by the regulations of the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha. The Government 
indicated that Most Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh at present still refused to have such a 
dialogue. In this regard, the Government of Viet Nam had requested that in order to 
continue to carry out their activities in Viet Nam and avoid passive acts and public 
disagreement, the monks and nuns of Lang Mai sect should work with the Vietnamese 
Buddhist Sangha on the modalities on leading a religious life in accordance with the 
Buddhist tradition and abide by regulations and laws. For its part, the Vietnamese 
Government emphasized that it always created favourable conditions for Lang Mai to carry 
out its activities in Viet Nam. When the incident took place at Bat Nha monastery and 
Phuoc Hue temple, the Vietnamese authorities had taken all measures to maintain the 
security, order and protect life and property of the concerned persons and to ensure that the 
regulations provided for by the Vietnamese laws and the charter of the Vietnamese Buddhist 
Sangha were fully implemented on the ground. The Government also informed that a 
delegation from the European Union Mission in Ha Noi, including the Swedish Counsellor 
and the European Union Counsellor, had visited Lam Dong Province from 8 to 10 
December 2009 to understand the reality of the incident on the ground. According to the 
Government, the European Union Counsellor confirmed that no acts of destruction had 
taken place at Phuoc Hue temple and agreed that if Lang Mai as well as any Buddhist 
organization wished to carry out its activities, it should abide by laws and the charter of the 
Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha.

<p><b> (c) Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>271. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Viet Nam replied to the 
joint communication of 25 November 2009. She would like to take the opportunity to refer 
to Human Rights Council resolution 6/37, in which the Council urges States &#8220;to take all 
necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards of human 
rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion 
motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility and 
violence&#8221;. In the same resolution, the Human Rights Council urges States to &#8220;ensure that, on 
account of religion or belief or the expression or manifestation of religion or belief, no one 
within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person, 
subjected to torture or arbitrary arrest or detention, or denied the rights to work, education 
or adequate housing, as well as the right to seek asylum, and to bring to justice all 
perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221;. Furthermore, all public officials and civil 
servants, in the course of their official duties, should respect different religions and beliefs 
and the Human Rights Council urges States to provide all necessary and appropriate 
education or training. 
</p>
<p>272. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the recommendations of her 
predecessor in the country report after his mission to Viet Nam, in which Mr. Abdelfattah 
Amor emphasized that &#8220;there should be no controls which could potentially undermine the 
right to freedom of religion and belief and its manifestations, in particular through 
limitations, constraints, prohibitions and sanctions against religious leaders, individuals, 
organizations, places of worship and other religious property, publications and other 
activities&#8221; (E/CN.4/1999/58/Add.2, para. 122).
