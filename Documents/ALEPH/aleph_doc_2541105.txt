NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Southwestern Energy Company and Subsidiaries
September 30, 2005
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, such information reflects all 
adjustments  (consisting  solely  of  normal  recurring  adjustments)  which  are,  in  the  opinion  of 
management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The Company's 
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K").
In June 2005, the Company distributed additional shares of its common stock in a two-for-one 
stock split that was declared by its board of directors in May 2005. All historical per share information 
in the financial statements and footnotes has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK
In the third quarter of 2005, the Company consummated an underwritten offering of 9,775,000 
shares of its common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $580.0 million after 
deduction  of  the  underwriting  discounts  and  offering  expenses  payable  by  the  Company.  
Approximately $60.7 million of the net proceeds will be used to fund the recent increase in the 
Company’s 2005 capital program that was contingent upon the consummation of the offering and 
$125 million will be used to repay the Company’s 6.70% senior notes upon maturity in December 
2005.  The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding 
of the Company’s remaining 2005 and future capital expenditures relating to the acceleration of the 
Company’s Fayetteville Shale resource play.  Pending such uses, approximately $193 million was 
used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s revolving credit facility and the 
remainder has been invested in short-term marketable securities.

(3)  GAS AND OIL PROPERTIES
The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its natural gas and oil 
properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive) are capitalized and 
amortized  on  an  aggregate  basis  over  the  estimated  lives  of  the  properties  using  the  units-of-
production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, however, which limits such 
pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and 
oil reserves discounted at 10 percent (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of 
unproved properties. Any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The 
expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may 
subsequently increase the ceiling. Full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each 
accounting quarter, including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges, to calculate the ceiling 
value of their reserves. At September 30, 2005, our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties 
did not exceed this ceiling amount. At September 30, 2005, our standardized measure was calculated
7
based upon the latest quoted market prices of $15.22 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and $66.24 per barrel 
for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. The price for Henry Hub gas is 
based upon reported prices for September 26, 2005, which was the last reported date for Henry Hub 
gas  due  to  Hurricane  Rita.  A  significant  decline  in  natural  gas  and  oil  prices  from  the  above-
referenced levels or other factors, without other mitigating circumstances, could cause a future write-
down of capitalized costs and a non-cash charge against future earnings. 
 
(4)
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding during each period. The diluted earnings per share calculation 
adds to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding the incremental number of shares 
that would have been outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options and the vesting of 
unvested restricted shares of common stock.  All of the Company's outstanding options at September 
30, 2005 (3,664,402 options with an average exercise price of $6.60) were included in the calculation 
of diluted shares for both the three and nine month periods of 2005. At September 30, 2004, options 
for 8,000 shares, with an average exercise price of $19.87 were not included in the calculation of 
diluted shares because they would have had an antidilutive effect. Options for 4,425,534 shares at 
September 30, 2004, with a weighted average exercise price of $5.30 were included in the calculation 
of diluted shares. The number of weighted average restricted shares included in the calculation of 
diluted shares was 444,311 and 417,206 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, 
respectively. The number of options and the option prices, and the number of restricted shares for both 
2004 and 2005 reflect the two-for-one stock split distributed in the second quarter of 2005.

In January 2005, the Company arranged a new $500 million five-year unsecured revolving credit 
facility that amended and restated its existing $300 million three-year credit facility that would have 
expired in January 2007 and replaced a smaller unsecured credit facility that would have matured at 
the same time. The interest rate on the new credit facility is calculated based upon the Company's debt 
rating and is currently 125 basis points over the current London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The 
revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on the Company.  Under 
the credit agreement, the Company may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of its total capital, must 
maintain a certain level of shareholders' equity, and must maintain a ratio of earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense of 3.5 or above. There are also 
restrictions on the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur debt. At September 30, 2005, the 
Company's capital structure consisted of 19% debt (excluding its several guarantee of NOARK's 
obligations and including the current notes payable) and 81% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to 
interest expense of 17.4, and the Company was in compliance with its debt agreements.
As indicated in the table above, the 6.70% senior notes mature in December 2005. The Company 
intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from its recent common stock offering to repay these notes 
and, accordingly, these notes are classified as short-term.
(6)
DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133), as amended by FAS 137, FAS 138 and 
FAS 149 which requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or 
liability measured at its fair value. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative's gains 
and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement.
At September 30, 2005, the Company's net liability related to its commodity hedges was $264.2 
million. Additionally, at September 30, 2005, the Company had recorded a net of tax cumulative loss 
to other comprehensive income (the equity section of the balance sheet) of $171.1 million. The 
amount recorded in other comprehensive income will be relieved over time and taken to the income 
statement as the physical transactions being hedged occur. Assuming the market prices of futures as of 
September 30, 2005 remain unchanged, the Company would expect to transfer an aggregate loss of 
approximately $183.9 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to pre-tax earnings 
during the next 12 months. The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to 
derivatives were a loss of $193.4 million ($121.8 million after tax) and a loss of $16.2 million ($10.2 
million after tax) for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and losses of 
$241.8 million ($152.3 million after tax) and $34.8 million ($21.9 million after tax) for the nine 
months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional volatility in earnings and other 
comprehensive income (loss) may occur in the future as a result of the application of FAS 133.
In the third quarter of 2005, a loss associated with the ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges was 
more than offset by a gain on our basis hedges that do not qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in a 
net gain of $8.7 million and increasing our average gas price realized in the third quarter of 2005 by 
$0.58 per Mcf.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
(7)
The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 "Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." The Company's reportable business segments 
have been identified based on the differences in products or services provided. Revenues for the 
Exploration and Production segment are derived from the production and sale of natural gas and crude 
oil. Revenues for the Gas Distribution segment arise from the transportation and sale of natural gas at 
retail. The Gas Gathering and Marketing segment, referred to as Midstream Services, generates 
revenue through the marketing of both Company and third-party produced gas volumes and gathering 
fees  associated  with  the  transportation  of  natural  gas  to  market.  Gathering  revenues  have  been 
insignificant to-date but could increase in the future depending upon the level of production from our 
Fayetteville Shale area. In prior periods of 2005, capital expenditures and assets relating to gas 
gathering were included in the Exploration and Production segment.  The 2005 capital expenditures 
and September 30, 2005 assets for the Exploration and Production segment have been adjusted to 
exclude the gas gathering amounts and the gas gathering expenditures and assets are now included in 
the Midstream Services segment.
Summarized  financial  information  for  the  Company's  reportable  segments  is  shown  in  the 
following table. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to 
the financial statements in the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management evaluates 
the performance of its segments based on operating income, defined as operating revenues less 
operating costs and expenses. Income before income taxes is the sum of operating income, interest 
expense, other income (expense) and minority interest in partnership. The "Other" column includes 
items  not  related  to  the  Company's  reportable  segments  including  real  estate,  the  Company’s 
investment in the Ozark Gas Transmission system and corporate items.

The Company and the other general partner of NOARK, Enogex, Inc. (“Enogex”), have severally 
guaranteed the principal and interest payments on NOARK's 7.15% Notes due 2018. At September 
30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal for these notes was $66.0 million and 
$67.0 million, respectively. The Company's share of the several guarantee is 60%. The notes were 
issued in June 1998 and require semi-annual principal payments of $1.0 million. Under the several 
guarantee, the Company is required to fund its share of NOARK's debt service to the extent not 
funded by operations of the pipeline. Additionally, the Company's gas distribution subsidiary has a 
transportation contract for firm capacity of 66.9 MMcfd on NOARK's integrated pipeline system 
under which approximately $4.0 million in costs have been incurred by our gas distribution subsidiary 
in 2005. This contract expires in 2014.
In September 2005, Enogex announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary 
that holds its 75% interest in NOARK to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P., subject to regulatory review 
and customary closing conditions.  Enogex stated that a portion of the sale proceeds will be used to 
redeem their 40% share of the 7.15% Notes due 2018.
The Company leases certain office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases 
expiring through 2013.  Under certain of these leases the Company is required to pay property taxes, 
insurance, repairs and other costs related to the leased property. At September 30, 2005, future 
minimum payments under non-cancelable leases accounted for as operating leases are approximately 
$0.5 million in 2005, $1.8 million in 2006, $1.8 million in 2007, $1.7 million in 2008, $1.6 million in 
2009 and $2.5 million thereafter. Total rent expense for all operating leases was $1.2 million for the 
first nine months of 2005 and $1.0 million for the comparable period of 2004.
The Company's utility segment has entered into various non-cancelable agreements related to 
demand charges for the transportation and purchase of natural gas with third parties.  These costs are 
recoverable from the utility's end-use customers. At September 30, 2005, future payments under these 
non-cancelable demand contracts are $2.7 million in 2005, $10.0 million in 2006, $8.8 million in 
2007, $9.2 in 2008, $9.6 million in 2009 and $51.6 million thereafter. Additionally, the E&P segment 
has a commitment to a third party for demand transportation charges.  At September 30, 2005, future 
payments under these non-cancelable demand contracts are $1.1 million in 2005, $3.0 million in 2006, 
$0.7 million in 2007, $0.6 million in 2008, $0.6 million in 2009 and $0.4 million thereafter.

On July 1, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to fabricate five new land drilling rigs 
for an aggregate purchase price of $37.7 million. Including ancillary equipment and supplies, the total 
cost of these rigs is approximately $48.5 million. Scheduled payments under this agreement are $27.7 
million in 2005 and $10.0 million in 2006. On September 29, 2005, the Company entered into an 
agreement to fabricate an additional five land drilling rigs for an aggregate purchase price of $40.7 
million.  Including  ancillary  equipment  and  supplies,  the  total  cost  of  the  additional  five  rigs  is 
approximately $49.2 million. Scheduled payments under this agreement are $10.2 million in 2005 and 
$30.5 million in 2006, assuming that commencement of the fabrication of the first of the five rigs does 
not occur in 2005.
The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The 
Company's policy is to accrue environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature when it 
is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
Management  believes  any  future  remediation  or  other  compliance  related  costs  will  not  have  a 
material effect on the financial position or reported results of operations of the Company.
The Company is subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The 
Company accrues for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably 
estimated. In the opinion of management, the results of such litigation and claims will not have a 
material effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.
A lawsuit was filed against the Company in 2001 alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify 
the other party against settlement payments related to the Company's Boure prospect in Louisiana. 
The  allegations  were  contested  and,  in  2002,  the  Company  was  granted  a  motion  for  summary 
judgment by the trial court. The case was appealed to the First Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas, 
which subsequently transferred the appeal to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi. The 
appeal was briefed and argued during 2003. On April 14, 2005, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals 
reversed the orders of the trial court and rendered judgment denying the Company’s motion for 
summary  judgment  and  granting  the  motion  for  summary  judgment  of  the  other  party.    The 
Company’s motion for rehearing with the Thirteenth Court of Appeals was denied on May 19, 2005. 
The Company is pursuing this decision to the Texas Supreme Court.  Should the other party prevail on 
the appeal, the Company could be required to pay approximately $2.1 million, plus pre-judgment 
interest and attorney's fees.  Based on an assessment of this litigation by the Company and its legal 
counsel, no accrual for loss is currently recorded. 
 
(10)  ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock-based employee compensation issued pursuant to the Company's plans is accounted for 
under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock 
Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost related 
to stock options is reflected in net income as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price 
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The Company does 
record compensation cost for the amortization of restricted stock shares issued to employees. The 
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied
13
the  fair  value  recognition  provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123, 
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (FAS 123), to stock-based employee compensation.

There were no options granted in the first nine months of 2005. There were 11,000 options (pre-
split basis) granted in the first nine months of 2004 with a fair value of $0.1 million. The fair value of 
each option grant in 2004 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model with the following weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 
48.7%; risk-free interest rate of 3.7%; and expected lives of 6 years.
As discussed further in Note 13 below, "New Pronouncements," the Company will adopt the 
provisions of FAS 123 (Revised 2004) in the first quarter of 2006. This standard will require the 
recognition of the fair value cost of equity awards, including stock options, as an expense over the 
service period provided by employees and directors.
(11)  PENSION PLAN AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The  Company  applies  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  132,  "Employers' 
Disclosures  about  Pensions  and  Other  Postretirement  Benefits."  Substantially  all  employees  are 
covered by the Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. Net periodic 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs include the following components for the three- and

The Company currently expects to contribute $1.8 million to its pension plans and $0.4 million to 
its  postretirement  benefit  plans  in  2005.  As  of  September  30,  2005,  the  $1.8  million  has  been 
contributed to the pension plans, and $0.3 million of the $0.4 million has been contributed to the 
Company’s postretirement benefit plans.  
 
(12)  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," (FAS 
143) was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003. FAS 143 requires that the fair value of a 
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a 
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the associated asset retirement costs be 
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The Company owns natural gas and 
oil properties which require expenditures to plug and abandon the wells when reserves in the wells are 
depleted. These expenditures under FAS 143 are recorded in the period the liability is incurred (at the 
time the wells are drilled or acquired). The following table summarizes the Company's activity related 
to asset retirement obligations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 and for the year 
ended December 31, 2004:

For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the obligations settled/removed includes $0.8 
million of obligations removed due to the sale of oil and gas properties. The liability for the plugging 
and abandonment of these properties was assumed by the buyer.
(13)  NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 
(Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," revising FASB Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation" and superseding APB opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." 
This statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of services provided by employees and 
directors received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including stock options, at a grant-
date fair value. The fair value cost is then recognized over the period that services are provided.
In April 2005, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, issued Staff 
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to provide additional guidance regarding the application of 
FAS 123 (Revised 2004). SAB 107 permits registrants to choose an appropriate valuation technique or 
model to estimate the fair value of stock options, assuming consistent application, and provides 
guidance for the development of assumptions used in the valuation process. Additionally, SAB 107 
discusses  disclosures  to  be  made  under  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations" in registrants' periodic reports.
Based upon SEC rules issued in April 2005, FAS 123 (Revised 2004) is effective for fiscal years 
that begin after June 15, 2005 and will be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2006. See 
Note 10 of these financial statements for a disclosure of the effect of net income and earnings per 
share for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 if the Company had 
applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 ("FIN 47"), "Accounting for Conditional 
Asset Retirement Obligations – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143". FIN 47 requires an 
entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair
16
value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 states that a conditional asset retirement obligation is a 
legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are 
conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective 
no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect 
the adoption of FIN 47 to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
In  May  2005,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  Statement  of 
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” SFAS No. 
154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
and requires retrospective applications to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in 
accounting principle unless it is impracticable. This new accounting standard is effective for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2005.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following updates information as to Southwestern Energy Company's financial condition

OVERVIEW
Southwestern Energy Company is a growing integrated energy company primarily focused on 
natural gas. Our primary business is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and 
crude  oil,  with  operations  principally  located  in  Arkansas,  Oklahoma,  Texas,  New  Mexico  and 
Louisiana. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead 
through our natural gas distribution systems and our marketing business. Our marketing business has 
recently been expanded to include our gas gathering activities relating to our Fayetteville Shale 
resource play and is now referred to as Midstream Services.  All of our operations are located within 
the United States and we operate principally in three segments: Exploration and Production (or E&P), 
Natural Gas Distribution and Midstream Services.
Our E&P business has increasingly contributed to our financial results primarily due to the general 
increase in natural gas and crude oil commodity prices and the growth in our production volumes. For 
the three months ended September 30, 2005, 100% of our operating income was generated by our 
E&P and Midstream Services segments, as compared to 96% for the comparable period in 2004. Our 
natural gas distribution segment generated a seasonal loss for the third quarter of 2005 and 2004. For 
the first nine months of 2005, 97% of our operating income was generated by our E&P segment, with 
our Natural Gas Distribution segment generating 1% and our Midstream Services and other businesses 
generating 2%, as compared to 90%, 4% and 6%, respectively, for the comparable period in 2004. For 
fiscal year 2004, 90% of our operating income was generated by our E&P segment, with our natural 
gas distribution generating 5% and our Midstream Services and other businesses also generating 5%.
We operate our E&P business in four general regions—the Arkoma Basin, East Texas, the Permian 
Basin and the onshore Gulf Coast. Currently our E&P activities in the Arkoma Basin and East Texas 
generate  the  majority  of  our  production  and  proved  reserves,  accounting  for  37%  and  41%  of 
production and 38% and 47% of our proved reserves, respectively, in 2004. If we continue to be 
successful in the development of our Fayetteville Shale play, an unconventional shale gas play on the 
Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, we expect the production and proved reserves generated by our 
activities in the Arkoma Basin to significantly increase over the next several years.
18
Our natural gas production has increasingly generated a substantial portion of our total operating 
revenues as a result of the natural gas focus of our capital investments in the past three years. For the 
three months ended September 30, 2005, sales of natural gas production accounted for 92% of total 
operating revenues for the E&P segment as compared with 93% for the comparable period in 2004.  
For the first nine months of 2005, sales of natural gas production accounted for 91% of total operating 
revenues for the E&P segment as compared with 92% for the comparable period in 2004.
We currently derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas 
production of our E&P business and expect this to continue in the future.  We expect that growth in 
our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to 
increase our natural gas production.  There has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and 
crude oil market in recent years due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict.  These factors, 
which include weather conditions, political and economic events, and competition from other energy 
sources, impact supply and demand for natural gas.  In addition, the price we realize for our gas 
production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices.  Our 
ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and 
produce natural gas, our ability to control costs, and our ability to market natural gas on economically 
attractive terms to our customers.
Recent Developments
−  Successful Follow-on Equity Offering.  In September 2005, we offered and sold 9,775,000 
shares of our common stock at a price per share of $61.35 in connection with an underwritten 
offering.  The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $580 million, after underwriting 
discounts and expenses.
−
Increase in 2005 Capital Expenditures.  In early September 2005, we announced our intent to 
increase our 2005 capital budget to $499.5 million, up from the $438.8 million capital program 
announced in July of this year. The increased amount includes projected capital expenditures of 
approximately $485.8 million for our E&P and Midstream Services segments, up from $425.1 
million.  Of the $60.7 million increase in capital expenditures:
−  approximately $21.0 million is related to the 2005 portion of the estimated cost of
fabricating five additional land drilling rigs;
−  approximately $15.7 million is allocated to the development of gathering systems
related to our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas;
−  approximately $7.9 million is being allocated to fund activities in East Texas;  
−  approximately $5.2 million is allocated to our Fayetteville Shale play for additional
development drilling and leasehold acquisition costs; and
−  approximately $10.9 million is related to New Ventures and other exploration and
development activities.
−  Purchase of Additional Drilling Rigs. In late September 2005, we announced that we had 
entered  into  an  agreement  to  fabricate  five  additional  land  drilling  rigs  for  an  aggregate 
purchase price of $40.7 million. Including required ancillary equipment and supplies, the total 
cost for the additional five rigs is approximately $49.2 million. In connection with entering the 
agreement, we deposited into escrow approximately $10.2 million as a down payment. An 
additional  $10.2  million  is  required  to  be  deposited  into  escrow  upon  notification  of 
commencement of fabrication of the first of the five rigs.
19
−  Two-for-One Stock Split. In October 2005, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock 
split. The additional shares will be distributed November 17, 2005 to shareholders of record as 
of November 3, 2005.
Three Months Ended September 30, 2005 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 
2004
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2005 were approximately 46% higher than the comparable 
period in 2004 due primarily to higher market-driven commodity prices realized for our gas and oil 
sales. We reported net income of $39.5 million, or $0.51 per share on a diluted basis, on revenues of 
$162.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005, compared to $25.4 million, or $0.34 
per share, on revenues of $111.4 million for the same period in 2004. Operating income for our E&P 
segment was $68.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, up from $43.1 million for the 
same period in 2004. The increases in our net income and in the operating income for the E&P 
segment were primarily due to a 8% increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas 
and oil prices, which were partially offset by an increase in our operating costs and expenses. Our gas 
distribution segment incurred a seasonal operating loss of $3.2 million for the three months ended 
September 30, 2005, compared to a loss of $2.7 million for the same period in 2004. The decrease in 
operating income for our gas distribution segment resulted primarily from increased operating costs 
and expenses.
In the third quarter of 2005, our gas and oil production increased to 16.2 Bcfe, up from 15.0 Bcfe 
in the third quarter of 2004. The increase in 2005 production primarily resulted from an increase in 
production from our Overton Field in East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin.
Our capital investments totaled $154.2 million for the third quarter of 2005, up from $90.9 million 
in the third quarter of 2004. We invested $146.0 million in our E&P segment in the third quarter of 
2005, compared to $87.7 million for the same period in 2004.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 
2004
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $98.9 million, or $1.31 per share 
on a diluted basis, on revenues of $455.6 million, compared to net income of $70.7 million, or $0.96 
per share, on revenues of $327.6 million for the same period in 2004. Operating income for our E&P 
segment was $165.2 million for the first nine months of 2005, up from $114.0 million for the same 
period in 2004. The increases were due to increased production volumes and higher prices realized for 
our production. Operating income for our gas distribution segment was $1.9 million for the first nine 
months of 2005, compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2004. The decrease in operating 
income  for  our  gas  distribution  segment  resulted  primarily  from  increased  operating  costs  and 
expenses.  Our cash flow from operating activities was $215.8 million for the nine months ended 
September 30, 2005, compared to $183.3 million for the same period in 2004.  The increase in 
operating cash flow was primarily due to the improved operating results of our E&P segment.
In the first nine months of 2005, our gas and oil production increased to 45.2 Bcfe, up from 39.0 
Bcfe in the same period of 2004. The increase in 2005 production primarily resulted from an increase 
in production from our Overton Field in East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin.
20
Our capital investments totaled $340.9 million for the first nine months of 2005, up from $217.7 
million in the first nine months of 2004. Our cash flow from operating activities funded 63% of our 
capital investments in the first nine months of 2005, and funded 84% of the capital investments in the 
first nine months of 2004. We invested $323.3 million in our E&P segment in the first nine months of 
2005,  compared  to  $210.7  million  for  the  same  period  in  2004.  As  discussed  under  “Recent 
Developments” above, in September 2005, we announced an increase in our 2005 capital budget to 
$499.5 million, up from the $438.8 million capital program announced in July of this year.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenues. Revenues for our E&P segment were up 51% to $114.3 million for the three months 
ended September 30, 2005 and up 41% to $283.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 
2005, as compared to the comparable periods in 2004. The increases were primarily due to increased 
production volumes and higher gas and oil prices realized for our production. Revenues for the first 
nine  months  of  2005  and  2004  also  include  pre-tax  gains  of  $2.1  million  and  $3.0  million, 
respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory.

Operating Income. Operating income for the E&P segment was up 60% to $68.9 million for the 
third quarter of 2005 and up 45% to $165.2 million for the first nine months of 2005, as compared to 
the  respective  periods  in  2004.  The  increase  in  operating  income  resulted  from  the  increase  in 
revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.
Production. Gas and oil production during the third quarter of 2005 was 16.2 Bcfe, up 8% from 
15.0 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2004. Gas and oil production was 45.2 Bcf equivalent for the first 
nine months of 2005, compared to 39.0 Bcf equivalent for the same period of 2004. The comparative 
increase in production primarily resulted from an increase in production from our Overton Field in 
East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin. Production during the first nine months of 
2005 included the effects of curtailment of a portion of our production at our Overton Field due to 
pipeline repairs of a non-operated transmission line into which we deliver a large portion of our gas 
production. Gas production was 15.0 Bcf for the third quarter of 2005 up from 14.0 Bcf for the third 
quarter of 2004. Gas production was 42.0 Bcf for the first nine months of 2005 compared to 36.3 Bcf 
for the same period of 2004. Our oil production was 200 MBbls during the third quarter of 2005 and 
543 MBbls for the first nine months of 2005, up from 164 MBbls and 456 MBbls for the same periods 
of 2004, respectively.
In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast and in September 2005, Hurricane Rita 
made landfall along the Louisiana and the eastern Texas coasts.  There was no significant reduction in 
our production from our Gulf Coast operations as a result of the two hurricanes.
Average Realized Prices. The average price realized for our gas production, including the effect of 
hedges, was $6.98 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2005, up from $5.04 per Mcf for 
the same period of 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, we received an average gas price of $6.16 
compared to $5.07 for the same period of 2004.  The change in the average prices realized primarily 
reflects changes in average spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities. Our 
hedging activities decreased the average gas price realized during the third quarter of 2005 by $0.91 
per Mcf compared to $0.45 per Mcf for the same period of 2004. Our hedging activities decreased the 
average gas price realized by $0.58 per Mcf for the first nine months of 2005, compared to a decrease 
of $0.48 per Mcf during the same period of 2004. Locational differences in market prices for natural 
gas have continued to be wider than historically experienced and were exceptionally wide at the end 
of the third quarter, which will affect our fourth quarter results of operations. Disregarding the impact 
of hedges, the average price received for our gas production during the third quarter of 2005 was 
approximately $0.60 lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to the average for the prior 
year period of approximately $0.27 per Mcf. The average price received for our gas production during 
the first nine months of 2005 was approximately $0.42 lower than average NYMEX spot prices, 
compared to the average for the prior year period of approximately $0.26 per Mcf. In the third quarter 
of 2005, a loss associated with the ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges was more than offset by a 
gain on our basis hedges that do not qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in a net gain of $8.7 million 
and increasing our average gas price realized in the third quarter of 2005 by $0.58 per Mcf.
We realized an average price of $42.29 per barrel for our oil production, including the effect of 
hedges, during the nine months ended September 30, 2005, up from $29.51 per barrel for the same 
period of 2004. The average price we received for our oil production in the first nine months of 2005 
and 2004 was reduced by $11.07 per barrel and $8.56 per barrel, respectively, due to the effects of our 
hedging activities.
22
Hedging Activities. We periodically enter into hedging activities with respect to a portion of our 
projected natural gas and crude oil production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to 
support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. 
Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with 
appropriate credit standings. For the remainder of 2005, we have hedges in place for 11.1 Bcf of gas 
production and for 2006 and 2007 we have 49.9 Bcf and 38.0 Bcf, respectively, of our future gas 
production hedged. For the remainder of 2005, we have hedged 90 MBbls of our oil production at an 
average NYMEX price of $33.17 per barrel. For 2006 we have hedged 120 MBbls of our future oil 
production. Additionally, we have basis hedges on 9.3 Bcf for the remainder of 2005, 25.3 Bcf for 
2006 and 10.0 Bcf for 2007. These basis hedges do not qualify as cash flow hedges, therefore any 
changes in the fair market valuation of these hedges are immediately recognized as income or loss. 
For additional information regarding our commodity price risk hedging activities, we refer you to Part 
I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q.
Lease Operating Expenses. Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for our E&P segment were $0.51 
and $0.46 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, respectively, compared to $0.38 for both 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2004. The increases in lease operating expenses per Mcfe for 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, as compared to the prior year, primarily resulted from 
increases in compression, saltwater disposal and gas processing costs as well as generally higher oil 
field service costs.
General & Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $0.42 
for the third quarter of 2005 and $0.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared to 
$0.33 and $0.35 for the same periods of 2004. General and administrative expenses for our E&P 
segment increased to $18.2 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $13.8 million for 
the same period of 2004 due primarily to increased compensation costs associated with increased 
staffing levels.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.40 for the 
third quarter of 2005 and $0.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared to $0.24 and 
$0.26 for the comparable periods in 2004. The increase in severance taxes per Mcfe in 2005 is 
primarily due to comparatively higher average market prices in effect for natural gas and crude oil, as 
reflected in the average price received for our production excluding the effect of hedges.
Full Cost Pool Amortization. Our full cost pool amortization rate was $1.44 per Mcfe for the third 
quarter of 2005 and $1.37 for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $1.19 per Mcfe for the same 
periods in 2004. The increase in our full cost pool amortization rate was primarily due to increased 
finding and development costs. We currently expect our full cost pool amortization rate to average 
between $1.40 and $1.45 per Mcfe for 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for our 
E&P segment increased to $63.6 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $47.6 million 
for the same period of 2004 as a result of the 16% increase in our production volumes and the increase 
in the per unit rate of amortization.
Full Cost Pool Ceiling. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for capitalizing costs related 
to  our  natural  gas  and  oil  properties.  As  discussed  in  Note  3  to  the  financial  statements,  these 
capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits our pooled costs and requires us to write-off 
costs in excess of the ceiling as a non-cash expense. At September 30, 2005, our standardized measure 
was calculated based upon the latest quoted market prices of $15.22 per Mcf for Henry Hub gas and 
$66.24 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. The price for 
Henry Hub gas is based upon reported prices for September 26, 2005, which was the last reported date

For the nine months 
ended September 30, 
2005 
2004
Revenues. Gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the pass-through of gas supply cost changes 
and the effects of weather. Because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs, the revenue 
effect of the pass-through of gas cost changes has not materially affected net income. Revenues for the 
three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 increased 12% and 5%, respectively, from 
the comparable periods of 2004 due to higher gas prices, partially offset by lower volumes delivered 
to customers.
Operating  Income.  Operating  income  for  our  gas  distribution  segment  decreased  by 
approximately $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2005 and by approximately $2.8 million for the first 
nine months of 2005, compared to comparable periods of 2004, due to decreased deliveries caused by 
warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses. Weather during the first nine months of 
2005 was 10% warmer than normal and 4% warmer than the same period in 2004.
Deliveries. The utility systems delivered 3.0 Bcf and 16.0 Bcf to sales and end-use transportation 
customers during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005, compared to 3.2 Bcf 
and 16.8 Bcf for the same periods in 2004. The decrease in deliveries during the first nine months of 
2005  was  primarily  due  to  the  effects  of  warmer weather and continued customer conservation 
brought about by high gas prices.
Rates. Our utility's tariffs contain a weather normalization clause intended to lessen the impacts of 
revenue increases and decreases that might result from weather variations during the winter heating 
season. The increase in gas costs in the first nine months of 2005 was reflected in the utility segment's 
average rate for its sales which increased to $10.63 per Mcf, up from $9.18 per Mcf for the same 
period in 2004. The fluctuations in the average sales rate primarily reflect changes in the average cost
24
of  gas  purchased  for  delivery  to  our  customers,  which  are  passed  through  to  customers  under 
automatic adjustment clauses. Our latest request for a rate increase was heard by the Arkansas Public 
Service Commission (APSC) at a September 20-22, 2005 public hearing in Little Rock, Arkansas. The 
APSC has until October 28, 2005 to reach its decision regarding our request.
Hedging Activities. Our utility segment hedged 2.9 Bcf of gas purchases in the first nine months 
of 2005 which had the effect of increasing its total gas supply cost by $1.4 million. In the first nine 
months of 2004, our utility hedged 3.8 Bcf of its gas supply which decreased its total gas supply cost 
by $0.1 million. At September 30, 2005, we had 1.1 Bcf of future gas purchases hedged at an average 
purchase  price  of  $13.03  per  Mcf.  We  entered  into  additional  hedges  on  1.0  Bcf  of  future  gas 
purchases at an average price of $13.80 per Mcf subsequent to the end of the quarter. For additional 
information regarding our commodity price risk hedging activities, we refer you to Part I, Item 3 of 
this Form 10-Q.
Operating Costs and Expenses. The changes in purchased gas costs for our gas distribution 
segment reflect volumes purchased, prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas 
supply  contracts  (base  load,  swing  and  no-notice).  Other  operating  costs  and  expenses  for  this 
segment  were  higher  during  the  third  quarter  than  the  comparable  period  of  the  prior  year  due 
primarily to higher operating expenses.  For the first nine months of 2005, other operating costs and 
expenses were higher than the comparable period of the prior year due primarily to higher operating 
expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increases in operating expense in 2005 were 
due  to  an  increase  in  uncollectible  accounts,  fuel  and  labor  costs.  The  increase  in  general  and 
administrative expense primarily resulted from increased compensation costs.

September 30, 2005, compared to $85.0 million and $218.7 million for the comparable periods of 
2004. The increase in revenues from this segment is attributable to increased volumes marketed and 
an  increase  in  natural  gas  commodity  prices.  The  increase  in  revenues  was  largely  offset  by  a 
comparable increase in purchased gas costs. Gathering revenues have been insignificant to-date but 
could increase in the future depending upon the level of production from our Fayetteville Shale area.
Operating Income. Our operating income from Midstream Services was $1.5 million for the third 
quarter of 2005 and $3.5 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $0.7 million and $2.4 
million for the comparable periods of 2004. Operating income from natural gas marketing fluctuates 
depending on the margin we are able to generate between the purchase of the commodity and the 
ultimate disposition of the commodity.

Gas Volumes Marketed. We marketed 13.8 Bcf of affiliated gas in the third quarter of 2005, 
representing  81%  of  total  volumes  marketed,  compared  to  12.5  Bcf,  or  79%  of  total  volumes 
marketed, for the same period in 2004. Affiliated gas marketed for the first nine months of 2005 was 
35.5 Bcf compared to 32.6 Bcf for the same period in 2004.  We enter into hedging activities from 
time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection. We refer you to 
Item 3, "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market Risks" in this Form 10-Q for additional 
information.  
 
Transportation
We recorded pre-tax income from operations related to our investment in the NOARK Pipeline 
System Limited Partnership (NOARK) of $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2005 and $0.4 million 
for the first nine months of 2005, compared to pre-tax losses of $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the 
comparable  periods  of  2004.  These  amounts  were  recorded  in  other  income  (expense)  in  our 
statements of operations.
In September 2005, Enogex announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary 
that holds its 75% interest in NOARK to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P., subject to regulatory review 
and customary closing conditions. Enogex stated that a portion of the sale proceeds will be used to 
redeem their 40% share of the 7.15% Notes due 2018. 
 
Interest Expense
Interest costs, net of capitalization, increased 12% for the third quarter of 2005 and 11% for the 
first nine months of 2005, as compared to the same periods of 2004. The increase in interest costs in 
2005 resulted from higher average borrowings during the period at higher interest rates. Changes in 
capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our E&P 
segment and to our investment in drilling rigs under construction. 
 
Income Taxes
Our  effective  tax  rate  was  approximately  37%  for  the  three-  and  nine-month  periods  ended 
September 30, 2005 and 2004. The changes in the provision for deferred income taxes recorded each 
period  result  primarily  from  the  level  of  income  before  income  taxes,  adjusted  for  permanent 
differences. 
 
Pension Expense
We recorded pension expense of $0.6 million in the third quarters of both 2005 and 2004, and $1.7 
million for the first nine months of 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of pension expense 
recorded by us is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our 
plans. We currently expect to contribute $1.8 million to our pension plans in 2005, all of which had 
been contributed as of September 30, 2005. For further information regarding our pension plans, we 
refer you to Note 10 of the financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

New Accounting Principles
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 
(Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," revising FASB Statement 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation" and superseding APB opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." 
This statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of services provided by employees and 
directors received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including stock options, at a grant-
date fair value. The fair value cost is then recognized over the period that services are provided.
In April 2005, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting 
Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to provide additional guidance regarding the application of FAS 123 
(Revised 2004). SAB 107 permits registrants to choose an appropriate valuation technique or model to 
estimate the fair value of share options, assuming consistent application, and provides guidance for 
the development of assumptions used in the valuation process. Additionally, SAB 107 discusses 
disclosures to be made under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations" in registrants' periodic reports.
Based upon SEC rules issued in April 2005, FAS 123 (Revised 2004) is effective for fiscal years 
that begin after June 15, 2005 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of 2006.  In Note 10 of the 
financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, we disclose the effect on net income and earnings per 
share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 if we had applied the 
fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 ("FIN 47"), "Accounting for Conditional 
Asset Retirement Obligations – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143". FIN 47 requires an 
entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair 
value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 states that a conditional asset retirement obligation is a 
legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are 
conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective 
no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of 
FIN 47 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In  May  2005,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  Statement  of 
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” SFAS No. 
154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
and requires retrospective applications to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in 
accounting principle unless it is impracticable. This new accounting standard is effective for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2005.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We depend on internally-generated funds, our unsecured revolving credit facility (discussed below 
under "Financing Requirements") and funds accessed through public debt and equity markets as our 
primary sources of liquidity. We have the ability to borrow up to $500 million under our revolving 
credit facility from time to time. In September 2005, we consummated an underwritten offering of 
9,775,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the
27
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $580.0 
million after deduction of the underwriting discounts and offering expenses.  Approximately $193.0 
million was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s revolving credit facility 
and the remainder was invested in short-term marketable securities. As of September 30, 2005, there 
were  no  amounts  outstanding  under  our  revolving  credit  facility.  The  remainder  of  our  capital 
expenditures for 2005 will be funded by our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the 
recent equity offering.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $215.8 million in the first nine months of 2005, 
compared to $183.3 million for the same period of 2004.  Net cash provided by operating activities 
primarily consists of net income adjusted for depreciation, depletion and amortization, the provision 
for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the first nine months of 
2005 and 2004, cash provided by operating activities provided 63% and 84%, respectively, of our 
requirements for capital expenditures.
Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive 
for our gas production. The price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity 
hedging activities, as more fully discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements included in this Form 
10-Q and Item 3, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks." Natural gas and oil 
prices are subject to wide fluctuations. As a result, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future 
level of cash flow from operations. We adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash 
flow available.  
 
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2005 were $340.9 million, including $24.8 
million relating to the effects of accrued expenditures, compared to $217.7 million for the same period 
in 2004 including $6.4 million relating to the change in the amount of accrued expenditures. In 
September 2005, we announced our intent to increase in our 2005 capital budget to $499.5 million, up 
from the $438.8 million capital program announced in July of this year. Of the $60.7 million increase 
in capital expenditures, approximately $21.0 million related to the 2005 portion of the estimated cost 
of fabricating five additional new land drilling rigs; $15.7 million is allocated to the development of a 
gas gathering system related to our Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas; approximately $7.9 million is 
being allocated to fund activities in East Texas; approximately $5.9 million is allocated to New 
Ventures and other Exploration; approximately $5.2 is allocated to our Fayetteville Shale play for 
additional development drilling and additional leasehold acquisition costs; and approximately $5.0 
million is related to our shallow oil drilling program in Eddy County, New Mexico. Our 2005 capital 
investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations, borrowings under 
our revolving credit facility and the proceeds from our recent equity offering.  
 
Financing Requirements
Our total debt outstanding was $225.0 million at September 30, 2005 and $325.0 million at 
December 31, 2004. The total debt at September 30, 2005 included $125.0 million of 6.70% senior 
notes due December 2005, which we will repay using the proceeds from our equity offering. These 
notes are recorded as a current liability at September 30, 2005. There were no amounts outstanding 
under our revolving credit facility at September 30, 2005. In January 2005, we amended and restated
28
our previous $300 million revolving credit facility due to expire in January 2007, increasing the 
borrowing capacity to $500 million and extending the expiration to January 2010. The amended and 
restated credit facility also replaced another smaller credit facility. The interest rate on the new facility 
is calculated based upon our debt rating and is currently 125 basis points over the current London 
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Our publicly traded notes are rated Ba2 by Moody's and BBB- by 
Standard & Poor's, following a downgrade from BBB in January 2005. Any future downgrades in our 
public debt ratings could increase the cost of funds under our revolving credit facility.
Our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us. Under the 
credit agreements, we may not issue total debt in excess of 60% of our total capital, must maintain a 
certain level of shareholders' equity, and must maintain a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense of 3.5 or above. EBITDA is a measure 
required  by  our  debt  covenants  and  is  defined  as  net  income  plus  interest  expense,  income  tax 
expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Additionally, there are also restrictions on the 
ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt. We were in compliance with the covenants of our debt 
agreements at September 30, 2005. Although we do not anticipate any debt covenant violations, our 
ability to comply with our credit agreement is dependent upon the success of our exploration and 
development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas 
and oil. If we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we would have to decrease our capital 
expenditure plans.
At  September  30,  2005,  our  capital  structure  consisted  of  19%  debt  (excluding  our  several 
guarantee of NOARK's obligations) and 81% equity, with a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of 
17.4. Shareholders' equity in the September 30, 2005 balance sheet includes an accumulated other 
comprehensive loss of $171.1 million related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded 
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). This amount is based on the market value 
of our hedges as of September 30, 2005, and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive 
or pay when the hedges ultimately are settled, nor does it take into account revenues to be received 
associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged. Our debt covenants as to capitalization 
percentages exclude the effects of non-cash entries that result from FAS 133 as well as the non-cash 
impact of any full cost ceiling write-downs, and include the guarantee of NOARK's obligations. Our 
capital structure, including $39.6 million relating to our several guarantee of NOARK's obligations, 
would  be 19% debt and 81% equity at September 30, 2005, without consideration of the accumulated 
other comprehensive loss related to FAS 133 of $171.1 million.
As part of our strategy to insure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations, we have 
hedged approximately 70% to 80% of our expected 2005 gas production and 60% to 70% of our 
expected 2005 oil production. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We hold a 25% general partnership interest in NOARK, which owns the Ozark Pipeline that is 
utilized  to  transport  our  gas  production  and  the  gas  production  of  others.  We  account  for  our 
investment under the equity method of accounting. We and the other general partner of NOARK, 
Enogex, Inc. (“Enogex”), have severally guaranteed the principal and interest payments on NOARK's 
7.15%  Notes  due  2018.  The  notes  were  issued  in  June  1998  to  partially  finance  the  original
29
construction cost of the NOARK Pipeline. Our share of the guarantee is 60% and we are allocated 
60% of the interest expense. At September 30, 2005, the outstanding principal amount of these notes 
was $66.0 million and our share of the guarantee was $39.6 million. The notes require semi-annual 
principal payments of $1.0 million. Under the several guarantee, we are required to fund our share of 
NOARK's debt service which is not funded by operations of the pipeline. We were not required to 
advance any funds to NOARK in the first nine months of 2005 and 2004. We do not derive any 
liquidity, capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support from our investment in NOARK.
Our share of the results of operations included in other income (expense) related to our NOARK 
investment was pre-tax income of $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2005 and $0.4 million for the 
first  nine  months  of  2005,  compared  to  pre-tax  losses  of  $0.6  million  and  $1.1  million  for  the 
comparable periods of 2004.
In September 2005, Enogex announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary 
that holds its 75% interest in NOARK to Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P., subject to regulatory review 
and customary closing conditions. Enogex stated that a portion of the sale proceeds will be used to 
redeem their 40% share of the 7.15% Notes due 2018.

(2)  We lease certain office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2013. 
 
(3)  Our utility segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non-cancelable competitive bid 
packages and non-cancelable wellhead contracts. Volumetric purchase commitments at September 30, 2005 totaled 1.2 
Bcf, comprised of 0.7 Bcf in less than one year, 0.3 Bcf in one to three years, and 0.2 Bcf in three to five years. Our 
volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month. 
These costs are recoverable from the utility's end-use customers.
30
(4)  Our utility segment has commitments for approximately $92.0 million of demand charges on non-cancelable firm gas 
purchase and firm transportation agreements. These costs are recoverable from the utility's end-use customers. Our 
E&P segment has a commitment for approximately $6.5 million of demand transportation charges.
(5)  Our E&P segment has commitments for approximately $59.5 million related to the purchase of ten drilling rigs
expected to be delivered within the next year.
(6)  Our  significant  other  contractual  obligations  include  approximately  $1.1  million  for  funding  of  benefit  plans, 
approximately  $1.2  million  of  various  information  technology  support  and  data  subscription  agreements, 
approximately $1.0 million for drilling rig commitments, and approximately $0.3 million of land leases.
We refer you to Note 5 of the financial statements for a discussion of the terms of our debt. 
 
In July 2005, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to fabricate five new land 
drilling rigs for an aggregate purchase price of $37.7 million. The agreement calls for payments 
totaling $27.7 million during 2005, with the remainder due in early 2006.
On September 29, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to fabricate an additional five 
new land drilling rigs for an aggregate purchase price of $40.7 million.  Scheduled payments under 
this agreement are $10.2 million in 2005 and $30.5 million in 2006. 
 
Contingent Liabilities or Commitments
Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. 
As a result of actuarial data, we expect to record pension expense of approximately $2.3 million in 
2005,  $1.7  million  of  which  has  been  recorded  in  the  first  nine  months  of  2005.  For  further 
information regarding our pension plans, we refer you to Note 11 of the financial statements in this 
Form  10-Q.  In  addition,  as  discussed  above  in  "Off-Balance  Sheet  Arrangements,"  we  have 
guaranteed 60% of the principal and interest payments on NOARK's 7.15% Notes due 2018. At 
September 30, 2005 the outstanding principal of these notes was $66.0 million and our share of the 
guarantee was $39.6 million. The notes require semi-annual principal payments of $1.0 million. The 
foregoing  obligations  represent  commitments  and  contingencies  that  could  create,  increase  or 
accelerate our liabilities.
We are subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management 
believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse 
impact on our financial position or our results of operations but these matters are subject to inherent 
uncertainties and management's view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were 
to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of 
operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. A lawsuit was filed 
against us in 2001 alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify the other party against settlement 
payments related to our Boure prospect in Louisiana. The allegations were contested and, in 2002, we 
were granted a motion for summary judgment by the trial court. The case was appealed to the First 
Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas, which subsequently transferred the appeal to the Thirteenth 
Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi. The appeal was briefed and argued during 2003. On April 14, 
2005, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals reversed the orders of the trial court and rendered judgment 
denying our motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for summary judgment of the 
other party. Our motion for rehearing with the Thirteenth Court of Appeals was denied on May 19, 
2005. We are pursuing this decision to the Texas Supreme Court. Should the other party prevail on the
31
appeal, we could be required to pay approximately $2.1 million, plus pre-judgment interest and 
attorney's fees. 
 
Working Capital
We maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our above-
described credit facility. We had positive working capital of $143.4 million at September 30, 2005, 
including  $387.0  million  of  marketable  securities  and  current  notes  payable  of  $125.0  million, 
compared to negative working capital of $2.7 million at December 31, 2004. At September 30, 2005, 
we also had $500.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our 
current assets increased by 372% in the first nine months of 2005 while current liabilities increased 
255% compared to December 31, 2004. The change in working capital from December 31, 2004 to 
September 30, 2005 primarily is the result of the receipt of the proceeds from our equity offering, the 
investment of a portion of those proceeds in short-term marketable securities and our intention to use 
a portion of the proceeds to repay $125 million of notes.
Gas in Underground Storage
We record our gas stored in inventory owned by the E&P segment at the lower of weighted 
average cost or market. Gas expected to be cycled within the next 12 months is recorded in current 
assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long-term asset. The quantity and average cost of 
gas in storage was 8.7 Bcf at $3.72 at September 30, 2005 and 9.3 Bcf at $3.49 at December 31, 2004.
The gas in inventory for the E&P segment is used primarily to supplement field production in 
meeting  the  segment's  contractual  commitments  including  delivery  to  customers  of  our  gas 
distribution business, especially during periods of colder weather. As a result, demand fees paid by the 
Gas Distribution segment to the E&P segment, which are passed through to the utility's customers, are 
a part of the realized price of the gas in storage. In determining the lower of cost or market for storage 
gas, we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas 
in inventory. A significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write 
down of our gas in storage carrying cost.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
All statements, other than historical fact or present financial information, may be deemed to be 
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that 
address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, 
without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and 
reserve  growth  and  other  plans  and  objectives  for  our  future  operations,  are  forward-looking 
statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are 
based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have 
no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information 
concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Form 10-Q 
identified by words such as "anticipate," "project," "intend," "estimate," "expect," "believe," "predict,"
32
"budget," "projection," "goal," "plan," "forecast," "target" or similar expressions.
You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. They are subject to known 
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, 
services  and  prices  and  cause  our  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  to  be  materially 
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-
looking  statements.  In  addition  to  any  assumptions  and  other  factors  referred  to  specifically  in 
connection with forward-looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause our 
actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement include, but 
are not limited to:
* 
*
*
*
*
the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for natural gas and oil;  
the timing and extent of our success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating 
reserves; 
the extent to which the Fayetteville Shale play can replicate the results of other productive 
shale gas plays; 
the potential for significant variability in reservoir characteristics of the Fayetteville Shale 
over such a large acreage position; 
the extent of our success in drilling and completing horizontal wells;
*  our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the
Fayetteville Shale formation;
*  our lack of experience owning and operating drilling rigs;
*  our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures; 
*  our future property acquisition or divestiture activities;  
the effects of weather and regulation on our gas distribution segment;  
* 
increased competition;  
* 
the impact of federal, state and local government regulation;

the comparative cost of alternative fuels;
the availability of oil field personnel, services, drilling rigs and other equipment; and
We  caution  you  that  these  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  all  of  the  risks  and 
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, 
production and sale of natural gas and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to, third-party 
interruption of sales to market, inflation, lack of availability of goods and services, environmental 
risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating
33
proved  natural  gas  and  oil  reserves  and  in  projecting  future  rates  of  production  and  timing  of 
development expenditures and the other risks described in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K and 
this Form 10-Q.
Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural 
gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on 
the quality of available data and the interpretation of that data by geological engineers. In addition, the 
results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made 
previously. If significant, these revisions would change the schedule of any further production and 
development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of 
natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered.
Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in our 2004 Annual 
Report on Form 10-K or this Form 10-Q occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our 
actual  results  and  plans  could  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in  any  forward-looking 
statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in 
a forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, 
basis differentials and interest rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. We use natural gas and 
crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and 
cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates. Our Board of 
Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the 
reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks. These policies prohibit speculation with 
derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. 
 
Credit Risk
Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of 
trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of 
credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their 
dispersion across geographic areas. No single customer accounted for greater than 6% of accounts 
receivable at September 30, 2005. See the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities 
trading below.
Interest Rate Risk
Revolving debt obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Our policy is to manage 
interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be 
used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, although we do not have any interest rate 
swaps in effect currently.  
 
Commodities Risk
We use over-the-counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of 
our production, to hedge activity in our gas gathering and marketing segment, and to hedge the 
purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or 
locational pricing differences between a published index and the New York Mercantile Exchange 
(NYMEX) futures market. These swaps and options include (1) transactions in which one party will 
pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price 
(or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps), (2) transactions in which 
parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps), and (3) the 
purchase and sale of index-related puts and calls (collars) that provide a "floor" price below which the 
counterparty pays (production hedge) or receives (gas purchase hedge) funds equal to the amount by 
which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and a "ceiling" price above which we 
pay to (production hedge) or receive from (gas purchase hedge) the counterparty the amount by which 
the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling.
The primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and 
basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or 
loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged. 
Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties. The 
counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes 
present  minimal  credit  risks.  The  credit  quality  of  each  counterparty  and  the  level  of  financial
35
exposure  we  have  to  each  counterparty  are  periodically  reviewed  to  ensure  limited  credit  risk 
exposure.
The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to 
changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for our gas and oil production, gas 
purchases and marketing activities. The table presents the notional amount in Bcf and MBbls, the 
weighted average contract prices, and the fair value by expected maturity dates. At September 30, 
2005, the fair value of these financial instruments was a $264.2 million liability.

At September 30, 2005, we had outstanding fixed-price basis differential swaps on gas production 
volumes of 9.3 Bcf in 2005, 25.3 Bcf in 2006, and 10.0 Bcf in 2007 that did not qualify for hedge 
accounting treatment. The fair value of these differential swaps was an asset of $22.5 million at 
September 30, 2005. In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a corresponding gain of $22.3 million 
related to these differential swaps which was partially offset by a $13.5 million loss related to the
36
estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges.  We entered into additional hedges on 1.0 Bcf of 
future gas purchases at an average price of $13.80 per Mcf subsequent to the end of the quarter.
At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional volumes of 
12.9 Bcf at a weighted average price per Mcf of $5.11 in 2005 and 5.0 Bcf at a weighted average price 
per Mcf of $5.89 in 2006. Outstanding oil price swaps at December 31, 2004 on 360 MBbls are 
yielding us an average price of $33.17 per barrel during 2005. At December 31, 2004, we also had 
outstanding natural gas price swaps on total notional gas purchase volumes of 2.9 Bcf in 2005 for 
which we paid an average fixed price of $6.54 per Mcf.
At December 31, 2004, we had collars in place on 33.4 Bcf in 2005 and 22.0 Bcf in 2006 of gas 
production. The collars relating to 2005 production have a weighted average floor and ceiling price of 
$4.68 and $8.30 per Mcf, respectively. The collars relating to 2006 production have a weighted 
average floor and ceiling price of $4.64 and $8.69 per Mcf, respectively.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We  have  performed  an  evaluation  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness 
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other 
procedures  that  we  have  designed  to  ensure  that  we  record,  process,  summarize  and  report  the 
information that is required to be disclosed or submitted by us within the time periods specified in the 
SEC's rules and forms. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent 
limitations. Therefore, even those determined to be effective can provide only a reasonable assurance 
with  respect  to  financial  statement  preparation  and  presentation.  Based  on  the  evaluation,  our 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our 
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2005. There were no significant 
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 
2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting.

PART II 
 
 
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
OTHER INFORMATION
The Company is subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. 
Management believes, individually or in aggregate, such litigation and claims will not have a material 
adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or its results of operations but these matters are 
subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view may change in the future. If an unfavorable 
final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on the Company’s 
financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably 
estimable. As first reported in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2005, a 
lawsuit was filed against the Company in 2001 alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify the 
other party against settlement payments related to the Company's Boure prospect in Louisiana. The 
allegations were contested and, in 2002, the Company was granted a motion for summary judgment by 
the  trial  court.  The  case  was  appealed  to  the  First  Court  of  Appeals  in  Houston,  Texas,  which 
subsequently transferred the appeal to the Thirteenth Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi. The appeal 
was briefed and argued during 2003. On April 14, 2005, the Thirteenth Court of Appeals reversed the 
orders of the trial court and rendered judgment denying the Company’s motion for summary judgment 
and  granting  the  motion  for  summary  judgment  of  the  other  party.  The  Company’s  motion  for 
rehearing with the Thirteenth Court of Appeals was denied on May 19, 2005. The Company is 
pursuing this decision to the Texas Supreme Court. Should the other party prevail on the appeal, the 
Company  could  be  required  to  pay  approximately  $2.1  million,  plus  pre-judgment  interest  and 
attorney's fees.
