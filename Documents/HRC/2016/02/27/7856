<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mapping exercise and research on State responsibility to prevent violence 
against women included a series of regional consultations convened and/or attended by the 
Special Rapporteur. This addendum includes the summaries of the main issues of concern 
discussed during the regional consultations which took place in Tunisia (from 20 to 21 June 
2012), in Slovakia (from 9 to 10 December 2012), in Fiji (from 27 to 28 January 2013), and 
in South Africa and Uganda (from 8 to 9 December 2011 and from 2 to 3 April 2012 
respectively). These summaries are based on the discussions held with a wide range of 
expert participants in these meetings, and are not a reflection of the situation in any 
individual country. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Consultation  
</b>2. The meeting was held in Tunisia, from 20 to 21 June 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. General context 
</b></p>
<p>3. The region generally reflects strong patriarchal traditions and practices, and to 
differing extents, women face discrimination in numerous aspects of their lives, including 
in the justice, health and other sectors. Family laws are primarily based on religion, relying 
on the provisions of religious laws and are often administered by all male religious courts. 
In most countries, men are considered to be the head of the household, to whom women 
owe a duty of obedience.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Manifestations of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>4. Domestic violence was identified as the most common manifestation of violence 
against women in the MENA region, with physical violence being particularly prevalent. 
Reporting rates for rape are so low that prevalence is difficult to determine. Women who 
have been raped are sometimes forced by their families to marry the perpetrator. Single 
mothers and those who have had sex outside marriage (whether consensual or forced) are 
ostracized. Sexual violence in the family, in the context of marital relations, is generally not 
recognized as violence, either at State or non-State level.  In extreme cases, violence in the 
family manifests in killings of women and girl children, often in circumstances where 
&#8220;honour&#8221; is involved. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is prevalent in some countries. 
Forced and early marriages are also common in some countries. Across the region, migrant 
workers are particularly vulnerable to violence. Often they have no status and no legal 
protection under labour and other laws, and are unable to report abuse due to fear of 
deportation or being prosecuted under discipline or morality laws.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Law, policy and institutional responses 
</b></p>
<p>5. Most States in the MENA region have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women but the vast majority have made reservations 
to articles 2; 15, paragraph 4; 16; and 29, or general reservations on the basis of conflicts 
with Islamic Sharia law. Most of the constitutions in the region have provisions on equality 
between the sexes, equality before the law or the outlawing of sex-based discrimination. 
However, most constitutions also provide for the supremacy of Islamic Sharia laws, 
particularly in family law matters. 
</p>
<p>6. The vast majority of States do not have any specific legislation protecting women 
against gender-based violence. In most States, domestic violence is not a punishable </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>offence, and in those States where it is, prosecution is limited to crimes where there is 
visible injury. Severe acts of violence, including murder, carry either no punishment or 
extremely light sentences where crimes were committed in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221;. Some 
States provide for the bringing of private suits for domestic violence, while others have 
begun to abolish discriminatory provisions in criminal statutes, including viewing domestic 
assaults as an aggravating factor in such cases. Laws that criminalize acts of sexual 
relations outside of marriage or adultery carry severe penalties including stoning, lashes and 
the death penalty. Penalties for such acts are higher for women than for men.  
</p>
<p>7. Rape, abduction, prostitution and sexual offences are punishable in the penal codes 
of most States. In most States, rape, and in particular rape of a minor, is not punishable if 
the perpetrator marries the victim. Marital rape, as a specific offence, is not criminalized in 
the region. Sexual harassment is not a crime in most States, although some reforms have 
been made in North African countries to criminalize such acts. A few States have passed 
specific legislation to prohibit sex trafficking. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is 
criminalized in a few States, but sometimes in limited circumstances, such as where it 
would &#8220;result in prejudice&#8221; or if not carried out in health institutions.  
</p><p>8. Most States in the MENA region do not have a national strategy or a national action 
plan on violence against women, gender-based violence or gender equality. A few States do 
have general national plans that touch on issues of domestic violence or violence against 
women. There are a small number of States with policies on violence against women, 
which are multidisciplinary and include protection, prevention and education measures as 
well as monitoring and operational plans. However, these are not funded and are poorly 
implemented.  Overall, the State support that is provided is neither holistic nor multi-
sectoral. 
</p>
<p>9. As regards accountability, the criminal justice system is rarely used by women 
victims of different manifestations of violence. Police practices across the region do not 
meet core minimum standards and police are largely not adequately trained. A few States 
now have special units to police domestic violence. With regard to rape, women victims are 
often treated as the accused under provisions preventing sexual relations outside marriage, 
and are potentially subject to severe punishment. They are furthermore in danger of being 
forced into marriage with the rapist, to absolve him of punishment. Married women who 
report violence are also at risk of repudiation (divorce) by their husbands, and also of 
further violence within the extended family. Domestic violence is not classified as a crime 
in the majority of States. Where it is reported, police encourage women to return home. In 
cases of &#8220;honour&#8221; killings, police do not investigate the real cause of the killings and 
instead close files as &#8220;accidental deaths&#8221;. When cases concerning acts of violence do reach 
the courts, it is very rare for perpetrators to be convicted and the burden of proof is often 
placed on victims, adding to the challenges that they already face. Even when convictions 
do occur, mitigating circumstances are used to ensure minimal sentences, even if the law 
provides otherwise. Judges often refer cases of violence to mediation. Medical personnel, 
police, judges and service providers are not sufficiently trained to deal appropriately with 
women victims of violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Data collection and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>10. In most States, there have been no national surveys regarding the prevalence of 
violence against women. In those States where surveys have been carried out, data 
collection has focused on the prevalence of domestic violence. These surveys have not 
analysed the impact of interventions, the performance of the public sector, the attitudes, 
behaviours and experiences of the public or the social and economic costs of violence. In a 
few States surveys and studies have been used to develop policies and programmes.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Service provision 
</b></p>
<p>11. The services available in MENA States are varied, with some States providing 
shelter and hotline services, legal and psychological counselling and support. There is 
evidence that States are collaborating with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in this 
work. However, in many States the primary service providers are still NGOs funded by 
external donors. Often they have insufficient funding or capacity, while existing State 
institutions are frequently staffed with insufficiently trained officials who promote 
mediation and rehabilitation, rather than justice within a human rights framework that 
promotes victim safety and offender accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Assessment of fulfilment of due diligence standards 
</b></p>
<p>12. Overall most States in the region are failing in their responsibility to act with due 
diligence to promote the right of women and girls to live a life free from violence. In most 
States, legislation and policy fails to protect women, due to the lack of effective redress 
measures. In States where attempts to address such violence have been made, most women 
are not aware of their rights under the new laws and face discrimination and harassment in 
enforcing them. With regard to prevention of violence against women, in many States there 
are no laws and policies and awareness-raising efforts are insufficient. States are largely 
failing to investigate violence against women and police and court officers fail to act with 
due diligence to investigate and prosecute acts of violence. They dismiss the victim, 
exercise discretion to drop cases, or pressurize the victim to drop charges. Punishment for 
acts of violence against women is minimal. Where sentences are imposed they are 
mitigated to extremely low levels, including suspended sentences or a few months in prison 
for killing women in the family. There is also the problem of men avoiding punishment for 
rape and abduction by marrying the victim. Reparations for violence in the region are rarely 
provided. In the very few States where it is possible to get compensation for violence, this 
requires significant effort and does not address the victim&#8217;s needs. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Central and South-Eastern Europe and Baltics Consultation  
</b></p>
<p>13. The meeting was held in Slovakia from 9 to 10 December 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. General context 
</b></p>
<p>14. Patriarchal attitudes are common across the region. Not only does this encourage 
impunity and discourage reporting, it is manifested in a range of responses to violence. 
Victims are blamed when they report different forms of violence; mediation is promoted; 
accountability is not a reality; and victims are sometimes arrested when they report 
violence. Stereotypes of women&#8217;s proper role in society are common. This makes it more 
difficult for women to leave violent situations, and leads to less reporting of violence. The 
attitude of States to violence against women in the region is focused on the welfare 
approach. Political will to improve the situation for victims of violence is limited, with 
concerns about capacity and funding limitations. The financial crisis has been used as an 
excuse to cut large numbers of services across the region. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Manifestations of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>15. There is an increasing recognition of the problem of domestic violence in the region, 
particularly intimate partner violence. Domestic violence statistics are collected, and policy 
and legislation is designed around the issue. Human trafficking is another area in which 
States are developing policies, strategies and specific legislation. However, other forms of 
violence, including rape and sexual abuse, broadly defined, including violence and 
harassment in schools and workplaces, are increasingly subsumed into domestic violence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>policy, or are not addressed. Violence against women in conflict has not been sufficiently 
addressed in the region.  
</p>
<p>16. Vulnerable groups, including Roma women, ethnic minorities, rural women, and 
poor women suffer aggravated violence and have less access to services. This remains 
problematic despite some efforts to disaggregate data and create specific policies to address 
the problems faced by these groups.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Law, policy and institutional responses 
</b></p>
<p>17. All of the States have signed and ratified the core United Nations treaties regarding 
violence against women. There is also widespread acceptance of a range of Council of 
Europe and other European conventions. Countries in the region have started to sign the 
Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and 
domestic violence. All States have Constitutional provisions guaranteeing equality before 
the law. Most also provide for non-discrimination and equal rights for spouses in marriage. 
Most States have specific laws on gender equality and anti-discrimination, or on the 
equality of women and men, which prohibit direct and indirect discrimination and sexual 
harassment in the public sphere. All States have some prohibition of discrimination in the 
workplace. The violation of these laws is often a criminal offence, either at a criminal or at 
an administrative level. 
</p>
<p>18. There are specialist laws addressing domestic violence in most States. All States 
have some provision by which a protection order can be granted by the courts. Domestic 
violence is punishable as a criminal offence, although often by a lesser sentence both in law 
and in practice. In some instances, these laws do not cover all relationships, and thus fail to 
recognize non-cohabiting or same-sex relationships. In some States violence against 
women, unlike other forms of violence, requires a private prosecution. Many States deal 
specifically with human trafficking in law or policy. Penal codes in some States set out 
provisions for the punishment of perpetrators, for a range of forms of violence including 
physical and sexual violence, war crimes, and exploitation, trafficking and prostitution. 
</p>
<p>19. Most States have national action plans and strategies to deal with gender equality at 
a national and local level. However, fewer States have National Action Plans with regard to 
violence against women, and if there are such plans they tend to focus on domestic 
violence. There are intersectoral national programmes and protocols on domestic violence 
in most States. Many States also have specific programmes for human trafficking, including 
the protection of victims. Roma integration policies have been developed in certain States. 
These plans are far from comprehensive in some instances, while others have an extremely 
wide scope with little information on actual implementation plans. Furthermore, little or 
insufficient funding is allocated to such plans, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms 
are insufficient or non-existent.  
</p>
<p>20. There are very few dedicated bodies responsible for violence against women, with 
most institutions on gender equality. Some States have specific institutional bodies to deal 
with particular manifestations of violence, primarily with regard to human trafficking and 
less commonly domestic violence. Protocols for police units have been set up to try to 
ensure uniform standards. However, these are not always effective. The institutions, 
whether ministry, department, agency or parliamentary Committee, which are responsible 
for gender equality and/or violence against women, vary in different States.  
</p>
<p>21. While there are policy and programmes set up, including for police, health services, 
and justice officials, these are rarely implemented effectively. Many policies mandate the 
cooperation of different State organs responsible for addressing violence against women, 
but these organs do not collaborate substantively at the national or local levels. Institutions 
have overlapping obligations and capacities which often create confusion, and furthermore </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>exchange of information between the different institutions is poor. Victims of violence have 
to navigate what is often quite a bewildering system and are rarely provided with the 
needed support to do so.  
</p>
<p>22. Shelters and other institutions such as centres for social work focus on encouraging 
family reconciliation and are ill-equipped to deal with the numerous forms of violence. 
Some States in Central and South-eastern Europe have centres for social work, whose 
primary responsibility is to provide front-line services to victims of violence. However, 
staff at these centres are poorly trained and operate a family-centred, social welfare 
approach. They promote mediation in situations of violence, fail to report violence, and fail 
to provide adequate safety measures.  
</p>
<p>23. Police fail to comply with the obligations set out in national legislation and policy; 
promoting mediation, failing to record complaints, making dual arrests, and failing to 
investigate or prosecute crimes. The same is often true for court officials and health and 
social workers. Frontline services within the justice system, including emergency or interim 
protection orders, are rarely available to victims. Monitoring and evaluation of policies, 
funding allocations, governmental programmes and implementation of legislation is very 
rarely undertaken. Where it is undertaken, it is neither participatory nor meaningful, and it 
is not used to analyse and improve mechanisms and laws. There is an overall lack of 
accountability in State systems, with almost no sanctions for State officials who breach 
their obligations.  
</p>
<p>24. States have allocated funding for some awareness-raising efforts, and have also 
sought to ensure the engagement of NGOs in this work. However, the impact of these 
policies has not yet been adequately assessed and in most places, the attitude of society in 
general remains patriarchal.  
</p>
<p>25. There is insufficient funding provided by States for services, preventive 
programmes, financial assistance and other resources for addressing violence against 
women. Those services that are provided for by the State, especially State clinics and 
centres for social work, are often underfunded, and specific budget lines for violence 
against women are not provided. There is not enough funding provided to build the capacity 
of institutions or to train State officials such as police officers and judges to meet their 
obligations. Budgeting for violence against women is often delegated to local authorities. 
The financial crisis has led to an increase in cuts to funding for welfare services generally, 
but particularly for addressing violence against women. There is no current mechanism that 
can be used to highlight or address the impact of such funding cuts/austerity measures - in a 
context where funding allocation was insufficient to start with. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Data collection and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>26. There are insufficient data collection systems in place. Some States are beginning to 
collect data on violence against women but overall there is still a lack of information on the 
numerous forms and prevalence of different types of violence that exists. Data that is 
collected focuses in particular on domestic violence and intimate partner violence, leaving 
other manifestations of violence against women invisible, including sexual harassment and 
rape. Gender disaggregation or disaggregation on the basis of membership of a vulnerable 
group is rare. Data tends to focus mostly on prevalence rates, and there are no State-
sponsored studies on the attitudes, behaviours and experiences of victims. Methods of data 
collection fall below acceptable standards, including interviewing women while third 
parties are present. Data analysis is often poor, highlighting selective statistics such as the 
number of cases resulting in conviction, without comparison to the number of reported 
cases. The impact of interventions and the implementation of laws and policies is not 
generally monitored and evaluated. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Service provision 
</b></p>
<p>27. There has been an increase in cooperation between State bodies and NGOs, but 
work still needs to be done to ensure a coordinated and holistic response. Nevertheless, the 
vast majority of effective front-line services provided to women in the region are provided 
by NGOs. NGOs are the primary providers of shelter, psychological counselling, toll-free 
helplines and self-help groups, and legal aid. Hotlines are common throughout the region, 
but are operated by NGOs and are not available 24/7. This work is funded primarily by 
external donor funding and is project-based and not sustainable in the long term. Where 
States do support NGO efforts, it is often on a small financial scale and is often perceived 
as money being given in return for control over the activities of such organizations. 
Minimum standards for the provision of services do not exist; there are insufficient shelters, 
advocacy and counselling centres, and specialist rape crisis centres. Long-term support for 
victims is non-existent.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Assessment of fulfilment of due diligence standards 
</b></p>
<p>28. With regard to promotion of the right to be free from violence, States in the region 
have signed many of the key international and European conventions, demonstrating 
political will to deal with the issue. Constitutions provide for equality before the law for 
men and women, penal codes address violence against women, and laws and policies 
addressing specific forms of violence have been promulgated. However, States in the 
region demonstrate strong familial and protectionist attitudes, which make it difficult for 
women to realize their individual human rights. States, and in particular federal States, 
sometimes fail to respond to and prevent violence by delegating their obligations to local 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>29. Legislation prohibiting violence against women is often very specific, dealing with 
domestic violence and trafficking, and fails to deal with other forms of violence or address 
linkages between violence and other systems of oppression. While States have made efforts 
to set out laws, policies, protocols and institutions to address domestic violence and 
trafficking, these are often not implemented or funded appropriately. Other forms of 
violence have not been addressed through specific laws and policies. There is inadequate 
data collection on violence against women to allow for protection and prevention measures 
to be designed and implemented properly.  
</p>
<p>30. States are not exercising due diligence to investigate and prosecute acts of violence 
against women. Police often refuse to record complaints and attempt to persuade the victim 
to mediate/conciliate with the perpetrator. It is becoming a common practice for police to 
arrest and prosecute both the victim and the perpetrator. Police do not use proper 
investigatory techniques to examine and prosecute charges, often relying on victim 
testimony and forcing victims to drive the investigative process. Prosecutions effected are 
often for minor crimes or misdemeanours rather than other possible more serious charges, 
and prosecution is often by private suit. Programmes and protocols for the investigation of 
acts of violence are not implemented. At the institutional level, there is a lack of 
investigation and accountability for State officials&#8217; failure to address violence against 
women. Institutional mechanisms are not sufficiently independent or funded to provide 
effective oversight.  
</p>
<p>31. States are largely failing to provide protection and prevention services. Much of the 
service provision and awareness-raising effort has been undertaken by NGOs, largely 
funded by external donors. Where services are provided, a family welfare/protectionist 
approach is adopted, instead of a human rights approach. State-run services are provided by 
a range of overlapping institutions, leading to inefficiency and confusion. Staff at Centres 
for Social Work and other State institutions are insufficiently trained and largely promote 
mediation and reconciliation, thereby further endangering victims. A move towards gender-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>neutrality in the region has meant that specific services for women victims of violence are 
declining.  
</p>
<p>32. While protection orders are theoretically available across the region, it is often 
difficult for victims to access them, with judges also promoting mediation instead. Where 
protection orders are granted, they are done so after some delay, despite the urgent need for 
protection. When protection orders are breached, the State fails to respond timeously and 
effectively. If breaches are acted upon, they result in suspended sentences, warnings or 
perpetrator programmes, rather than further protection for victims to ensure safety.  
</p>
<p>33. With regard to punishment for violence against women, there are laws criminalizing 
most forms of violence against women across the region. However, inappropriately low 
sentences, including warnings and suspended sentences or anger management programmes 
for serious acts of violence, are often provided in law and in practice. The justice system 
places inappropriate pressure on victims, through scrutinizing their testimony rather than 
looking for other supporting evidence, blaming them, and forcing them to mediate or 
rebuild relationships with perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>34. Provision of reparations to victims is minimal in some States and is generally 
insufficient. Yet resources are allocated to male perpetrator programmes, at the expense of 
addressing victims&#8217; needs. The provision of compensation in most instances, in practice, 
requires the victim to go through a separate, expensive civil process to recover monetary 
compensation from the perpetrator himself, who often has no money or independent 
resources. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Pacific Islands Consultation 
</b></p>
<p>35. The meeting was held in Fiji from 27 to 28 January 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. General context 
</b></p>
<p>36. Violence against women in the Pacific Islands region occurs in the context of 
strongly patriarchal societies with a resurgence of societal conservatism, leading to 
increased silencing of victims. Many women live in close-knit, small communities and 
reporting violence and pursuing legal and other remedies is particularly difficult. Victims 
face stigmatization as well as constant pressure from the perpetrator or his friends and 
family. This leads to very low reporting rates, whether in respect of domestic violence, rape 
or sexual harassment, inter alia.  
</p>
<p>37. Women in the region are largely in a fragile economic position, bearing the brunt of 
unemployment and increasingly without access to resources, including rights to land. 
Vulnerable women in the region include women with disabilities, and women who face 
harassment and discrimination from both public and private sources, due to their sexual 
orientation and/or gender identity. For women living in rural areas in the region, there are 
minimal government services such as police, courts, or health services. They are at 
significant risk of violence but also of impunity in the face of such violence. In many States 
women have limited access to the legislature or the executive authorities, making it 
significantly harder for them to advocate for needed reforms in laws and policies.  
</p>
<p>38. In some States, customary law is the primary source of law in rural areas. There are 
States where women cannot own land. Even in matrilineal contexts, women are less likely 
to own land, despite past practices to the contrary. Bigamy is a criminal offence in most 
States, and some States prohibit adultery and abortion. Most States have a minimum age for 
marriage of either 16 or 18, and, in theory, laws provide for equal division of property after 
divorce. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>39. A positive development in the region is the existence of extremely strong networks, 
both intergovernmentally and in terms of cooperation between NGOs in different States. 
Institutions such as the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team, the Pacific Prevention of 
Domestic Violence Programme, United Nations agencies, the Secretariat of the Pacific 
Community, and the Melanesian Spearhead Group have a significant impact on the 
development of capacity within States and also in terms of information-sharing between 
States. NGOs also work within a range of networks to share information and expertise 
across the region.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Manifestations of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>40. The primary manifestation of violence against women in the Pacific region is 
domestic violence, which is common to all States and increasing in prevalence and severity. 
This violence includes intimate partner violence to a large extent, but there has also been an 
increase in child abuse, sexual assault and incest, which is reflected in the high number of 
pregnancies amongst girls. Rape, including marital rape, and sexual harassment are 
growing problems. There are some concerns about sex tourism in the region, as well as a 
rise in prostitution. It was stated that this increase is partly driven by the demands of 
expatriate workers in the extractive and other industries. This has led to an increase in sex 
trafficking, whereby women are trafficked into the Pacific Islands to provide services for 
foreign workers.  
</p>
<p>41. Recent family violence surveys have highlighted the problem of domestic violence 
and intimate partner violence in particular, thus resulting in responses by many States. The 
development of legislation and protocols to deal with these forms of violence against 
women has also included a focus on child abuse, including incest. However, other forms of 
violence, including rape and sexual harassment, receive less attention, despite an increase in 
prevalence. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Law, policy and institutional responses 
</b></p>
<p>42. States across the region have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and 
most have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. While a few States have ratified or signed the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, most have not, and have not acceded to the Convention against 
Torture or the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. However, 
international law obligations require an additional step of domestication at the national 
level in the majority of Pacific Islands States. This is very rare and results in States not 
meeting their international law commitments. 
</p>
<p>43. Some States do have provisions in their constitutions regarding equality and/or non-
discrimination rights, but in most instances discrimination on the grounds of sex is not 
explicitly forbidden. Many States have included provisions concerning the prohibition of 
slavery, forced labour, and torture and inhumane treatment. Some provide for guarantees to 
the right to life, personal liberty, health care, education, legal services and due process. 
Many States have explicit provisions guaranteeing the right to recognition and practice of 
custom and tradition, including customary law. 
</p>
<p>44. The criminal codes of all States prohibit offences against the person, including 
assault and battery, bodily harm and murder. In a few States there is legislation specific to 
domestic violence, both criminalizing violence and streamlining processes for applications 
for restraining orders and injunctions. These laws set out the duties of official bodies, as 
well as strengthen the remedies that courts can order. For those States without specific laws 
on violence against women, restraining orders can be obtained through the use of other 
laws. Often this is time consuming and expensive, and is applicable to certain 
relationships/status of relationships only, for example the breakdown of a marriage. There </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>are draft laws dealing with domestic violence in some States, demonstrating the political 
will to increase protection against domestic violence. However some of these draft laws 
have been in existence for a long time (up to five years in one instance).  
</p><p>45. Rape and other sexual offences are prohibited across all States. Rape is defined 
narrowly in some States, although there is a gradual move to more inclusive definitions of 
rape, including non-penile penetration and penetration other than vaginal. Marital rape is 
not criminalized in any of the countries. Most States have statutory rape laws in respect of 
young children, and some have offences of rape and other sexual assaults against teenagers. 
Prostitution, pimping, trafficking and other forms of crimes &#8220;&#8216;against morality&#8221; are 
prohibited across the region and a few States do have specific human trafficking legislation. 
Most States do not prohibit sexual harassment, and those that do only have civil law 
remedies for violations. In many States, customs and traditions are expressly taken into 
account when determining the guilt and sentencing of perpetrators, and this often leads to 
significant reductions in sentences.  
</p>
<p>46. In a number of States there are specific provisions in the criminal code placing a 
legal duty of support on those who have charge of persons who cannot support themselves, 
including (presumably) support for spouses and children. The law provides for specific 
offences of neglect and failing to provide necessaries. However, prosecution and penalties 
for such violations are extremely low.  
</p>
<p>47. There is generally political will to improve legislative and policy measures for 
addressing violence against women, but some States are failing to take the lead on drafting 
laws and policies, and this is placing significant burdens on NGOs to draft and cost laws. 
States in the region have taken steps towards establishing decrees, regulations and protocols 
as regards violence against women. In many States, there is a no-drop policy for domestic 
violence cases and a few have first response protocols for health and police workers. In 
certain States &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; zones have been established, but contrary to the stated 
intention, this has led to victims being actively discouraged from reporting, rather than 
complaints being taken more seriously. Overall, there are minimal or mostly informal 
regulations providing guidance to officials and service providers, usually with NGOs 
providing such guidance.  
</p>
<p>48. There exist in some States National Plans of Action which broadly address women 
and development and/or gender equality, with many including violence against women as a 
subsection of the overall policy. Only one State has a specific national plan on violence 
against women. Most of these plans are extremely broad and are not targeted to specific 
intervention. Also there is no money provided for their implementation, and no monitoring 
and evaluation provisions are included. Ministries and departments that are mandated to 
implement these plans do not have the human and financial resources for effective 
implementation; some are corrupt and inefficient; and their focus is often on formal 
compliance, rather than on developing sustainable and meaningful interventions. 
</p>
<p>49. With regard to both national plans and national policies, there is a lack of access to 
information. This makes it difficult for civil society to be involved in implementation 
and/or to assess and monitor compliance. Criticisms include: that such plans and policies 
are not drawn up in a participatory and consultative manner with NGOs, they are not 
always gender-sensitive, and often do not deal with violence against women with any kind 
of specificity. However, some States are working with NGOs to develop programmes, 
primarily on awareness-raising initiatives, to address violence.  
</p>
<p>50. There is a lack of a coordinated and multi-sectoral approach to violence. Police 
units, including those set up to deal with violence against women, are underfunded and only 
work at certain times. There is insufficient training for public officials at all levels. 
Prosecutors have insufficient training, and despite no-drop policies, they rarely prosecute </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>violence. When such cases are prosecuted, they are primarily brought in lower courts with 
limited sentencing authority. The prosecution services can, and do, decide in many 
instances, to drop cases. Women cannot afford to lodge private prosecution cases. 
Magistrates are poorly trained both in the law and on violence against women, and often 
push for reconciliation in such cases. Mitigating circumstances, based on both law and 
custom, are used commonly and inappropriately to lower sentences for perpetrators. 
Protection orders are rarely granted, and magistrates and judges demonstrate patriarchal 
views and perpetuate victim-blaming and victim-shaming stereotypes. International law and 
international norms are used rarely, and where cited, the focus is primarily on providing for 
the protection rights of children, rather than for women. Transportation for women in 
geographically remote areas is expensive and is not provided for by the State. Multi-
sectoral coordination is weak to start with, and this is exacerbated by the geographical 
complexities of the countries in the Pacific region.  
</p>
<p>51. There are insufficient State resources allocated to implement laws and policies on 
violence against women, and thus the majority of resources emanate from technical 
assistance programmes, and other resources from foreign donor funds. These sources of 
funding are increasingly diminishing. Some States have made efforts to train public 
officials on the nature and consequences of violence against women, including the police, 
judiciary, lawyers, and health workers. However, most training programmes have been 
initiated by NGOs. Some States have attempted to develop referral networks that 
incorporate or build on the work of NGOs, and there are increasingly positive working 
relationships being built between States and NGOs across the region.  
</p>
<p>52. Numerous criticisms were raised in respect of insufficient consultation by States and 
also by international organizations. It was argued that there was selectivity in who was 
included in meetings and consultations, who had access to information, and who received 
funding. The view was that the functioning of United Nations agencies sometimes resulted 
in creating divisions and competition amongst local NGOs. Also some United Nations 
agencies were seen as competing in programmatic activities, and also for donor funds, as 
opposed to collaborating and supporting NGO work in the region.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Data collection and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>53. Across the region Family Health and Safety Surveys have been and are still being 
undertaken. These studies, often undertaken in partnership with governments and local 
bureaus of statistics, are primarily funded by external international donors. They have 
highlighted the high prevalence rates of violence against women in the region, as well as 
the attitudes, behaviours and experiences of women, men and young people. The surveys 
do not address the social and economic costs of violence against women, the impact of 
interventions, or whether the State is meeting its obligations in addressing such violence.  
</p>
<p>54. The surveys have provided significant momentum for activists, NGOs and others to 
push for increased legislative and other support for victims of domestic violence, and in 
particular intimate partner violence. However, the surveys focus on family health and safety 
aspects. This means that many other forms of violence, including rape, sexual harassment 
and violence outside the home are not analysed or addressed. Furthermore, there have been 
some problems with the administration of the surveys in certain States, particularly where 
the World Health Organization (WHO) framework was disregarded, and some researchers 
were themselves subjected to violence.  
</p><p>55. It was found that data collection by service providers, including the police, hospitals 
and the court system, is extremely poor. It was also found that data that is collected is not 
generally made public, thus making it extremely difficult to design policies and 
programmes and to monitor the impact of interventions in a participatory and inclusive 
manner which includes the input of NGOs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Service provision 
</b></p>
<p>56. Frontline services provided by the police in the Pacific region are inadequate. 
Despite official no-drop policies on domestic violence in some countries, not only do police 
fail to register complaints, they also fail to investigate reports of violence, drop cases due to 
a lack of evidence, encourage &#8220;reconciliation&#8221; with perpetrators, fail to exercise powers to 
arrest the perpetrator, and fail to assist victims as regards their safety needs. There are also 
significant problems with corruption. Police across the region encourage male perpetrators 
to apply for protection orders, in order to pre-empt complaints of domestic violence by 
women, and also to use such protection orders as a coercive tool in relationships. Yet they 
fail to apply for, serve or enforce protective orders for victims. Victims are sometimes 
arrested and intimidated when reporting violence.  
</p>
<p>57. In a range of cases of violence against women, police fail to provide a confidential 
and safe environment for reporting, fail to investigate reports, and often abrogate their 
responsibility, by referring victims directly to NGOs. Specialist units set up to deal with 
violence against women often only operate during working hours and staff are 
insufficiently trained and have access to limited resources.  
</p>
<p>58. In the region, NGOs provide a significant proportion of the services provided to 
victims, including shelter, counselling and legal advice. In a number of States, NGOs are 
the primary if not the only providers of such services. Some States work collaboratively 
with NGOs to provide basic support as regards frontline services, despite initial 
reservations regarding working with NGOs. However, NGOs obtain most of their funding 
from external donors. Despite the strength of many of the NGOs and their provision of 
advocacy and counselling services, minimum service provisions are not being met. There 
are insufficient hotlines, shelters, and counselling services available. In particular, long-
term support is very rare. Health care is provided by the State in most cases but is not 
sufficient, and doctors rarely refer victims to other service providers. Access to 
reproductive and sexual health services is often particularly problematic.  
</p>
<p>59. The geographical challenges faced by States in the region mean that even if services 
were to be provided to the minimum standards as per population demographics, they would 
be unlikely to reach all women. Many women, particularly on outer islands, are isolated 
from almost all services, including the police and courts, and cannot access services 
provided by the State or NGOs. Such law as is applied in these regions is primarily 
customary. Some States and NGOs in the region have started to establish committees or 
authorized persons in remote locations to whom victims can turn, but the implementation of 
this is yet to be properly realized. Against this background, NGOs, both national and 
regional, and intergovernmental organizations have put significant resources and long-term 
advocacy into community mobilization and awareness-raising initiatives. There has been 
some similar input by the State in certain circumstances, but this input has primarily relied 
on the existing advocacy of NGOs and activists. Initiatives include the provision of training 
to local activists to provide focal points in local communities, and the development of 
educational curricula in schools. NGOs are also seeking to engage with religious leaders to 
encourage community sensitization. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Assessment of fulfilment of due diligence standards 
</b></p>
<p>60. In most States, the general criminal code is insufficient to deal with violence against 
women, and legislation to deal with specific types of violence, including domestic violence, 
is just beginning to emerge across the region. Recent legislative developments in some 
States include a specific focus on domestic violence, including for the provision of access 
to protection orders. However the lack of training of State service providers to implement 
such legislation has resulted in difficulties in obtaining protection orders. Also, the lack of 
support in going through the process, and financial and other costs, are a barrier to access. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>Furthermore, if granted, enforcement and violations are not effectively addressed by the 
justice system. Despite positive legislative developments, the protectionist approach to 
violence against women, as opposed to a human rights approach, is leading to problems in 
addressing victim safety and offender accountability. The lack of monitoring and evaluation 
of laws and policies across the region does not allow for an analysis of effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>61. Despite positive law and policy developments, this is not accompanied by awareness 
or education on rights and remedies, so women are often not aware of the developments. 
Minimal community awareness of the obligations of State providers has led to a lack of 
accountability demands at the community level. While there are a range of national 
complaints and oversight mechanisms, including ombudspersons and commissions, these 
are not sufficiently funded to provide advice and information or to address violations. The 
issue of functional independence was also raised as an issue that impacts effective 
functioning of such mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>62. As regards prevention, in some areas across the Pacific Islands, there is limited 
access to services, including counselling, shelter, and police and court services; often due to 
geographic realities. Women&#8217;s economic dependency on perpetrators, due largely to unpaid 
labour, is further exacerbated as they struggle to access support/maintenance payments, 
within a justice system that is not responsive to the consequences of such dependency.<b> 
</b>63. In terms of protection, the police and prosecution services were accused of failing to 
investigate reports of violence, either due to corruption within the system, protection of 
known offenders, or because of cultural attitudes that fail to recognize violence against 
women as a crime. When these systems do respond, insensitivity and inappropriate 
investigations are the norm. There are insufficient accountability measures in the police and 
other institutions to prevent corruption and inefficiency. Victims are often pressured into 
reconciliation or cases are prosecuted as minor offences. Sentences for domestic violence 
offences are low, and mitigating factors are used to lower sentences.  
</p>
<p>64. The lack of substantive individual or collective reparations, legal aid or State-
sponsored counselling, health and other services, is the reality in many States. When 
reparation is ordered, it is in lieu of punishment, and is often minimal. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Sub-Saharan Africa Consultations 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur attended meetings hosted by different organizations which 
were held in South Africa from 8 to 9 December 2011 and in Uganda from 2 to 3 April 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. General context 
</b></p>
<p>66. Patriarchal stereotypes and attitudes are prevalent across the region. In family and 
personal law, men are often considered the head of the household, with women being 
primary caregivers of children. In most States, customary and religious law regimes exist in 
respect of personal and family law, and these are often interpreted and applied in 
discriminatory ways. Marital rape is explicitly criminalized in some States. The minimum 
statutory age for marriage is found in some States&#8217; laws, and can range between 15 and 21 
years. Polygamy is permitted in most States, with some States regulating this practice. 
Some States have legislation which grants men and women equal rights in marriage, 
inheritance rights, the equal distribution of property after divorce, and the right to contract 
and execute deeds without the consent of the husband. 
</p>
<p>67. Despite legislative provisions in some States, in practice women are not granted 
rights to equal inheritance, including property and other resources. A husband and 
sometimes a father&#8217;s permission is required before women can exercise their rights to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement and contract. Bride price is a common practice and is sometimes 
interpreted as women being the &#8220;property&#8221; of the husband. Early marriage is common 
across the region, as are polygamy, widow inheritance and discriminatory widowhood 
rights.  
</p>
<p>68. Women in the region mostly live in poverty, and are often economically dependent 
on male members of the family. Often, they face discrimination and violence in both the 
formal and informal economy. Particularly vulnerable groups include: heads of households, 
internally displaced persons, refugees, rural women, children heading households, women 
with disabilities, elderly women, women who are HIV positive and lesbian women. Women 
face difficulties in accessing education and health-care services, leading to diminished life 
expectancy, high maternal mortality, and high rates of HIV/AIDs infection. 
</p>
<p>69. Some States in the region have experienced significant unrest and conflict, and 
violence against women has been perpetrated both by State and non-State actors. The 
gravity and scale of some forms of violence perpetrated in the region, whether in terms of 
sexual violence in conflict, or violence in peacetime, reflects a continuum of violence that 
is underpinned by discrimination and inequality.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Manifestations of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>70. Different forms of violence exist across the region, with domestic violence being the 
most prevalent form. Such violence is often of a severe nature, and is condoned by societal 
attitudes, and justified through the use of cultural and religious defences. Sexual violence, 
including rape, sexual abuse and incest, is a problem throughout the region. Sexual violence 
in schools is a particularly pervasive issue in some States, and this is reflected in the 
teenage pregnancy statistics and also the HIV/AIDS rates amongst young women. Sexual 
harassment, prostitution, sexual exploitation and trafficking across the region appear to be 
on the rise. Female genital mutilation and violence against women labelled as &#8220;witches&#8221; is 
also a problem in some countries. The abandonment and neglect of young wives is 
problematic in some States. In a number of States, chastisement of wives by husbands is 
still legal. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Law, policy and institutional responses 
</b></p>
<p>71. States in the region have ratified the key international conventions, particularly the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Most States have also ratified the Maputo Protocol 
to the African Charter, and some States in Southern Africa have signed the Southern 
African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development. 
However in many States, international law does not have direct effect, and in such instances 
States have not fully domesticated their international obligations.  
</p>
<p>72. Many States have incorporated constitutional rights to equality and/or non-
discrimination on the grounds of sex and gender. In some instances, de jure and de facto 
inequality and discrimination is permitted through the exemption of such provisions in 
personal status/family laws which emanate from customary and religious laws. This is 
despite the fact that in many instances there is a clear articulation that marriage is based on 
free and full consent, and that the right to equality in marriage is guaranteed. Some States 
also guarantee socioeconomic rights, including access to health and education rights.  
</p>
<p>73. Constitutions provide for a range of rights, including human dignity, freedom, the 
right to be free from torture and inhuman treatment, the right to personal liberty, physical 
and mental integrity, and the prohibition of slavery. There is an increasing trend for 
domestic violence to be covered by specific legislation, empowering courts to grant 
protection orders and also criminalize acts of domestic violence. In some instances, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>nature of the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim is broadly defined, thereby 
recognizing relationships other than those linked to intimate partners. Some States prohibit 
harmful customary practices. Some laws provide for a wide range of obligations, including 
those related to the powers and duties of the police. Some States have legislation which 
goes beyond domestic violence and covers other forms of violence against women, while 
other States rely solely on provisions of the penal code to address all forms of violence 
against women. States have begun to improve criminal procedures, allowing cases to be 
held in camera, abolishing corroboration requirements and preventing cross examination on 
previous sexual history. Often progressive laws are drafted with significant input from 
NGOs and international agencies, thereby reflecting international best practices.  
</p>
<p>74. There is specific legislation regarding human trafficking in many States, with some 
States including this in their penal codes. There are very few States that have no specific 
legislative provisions on trafficking. Prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation are 
often prohibited in the region. In many States, sexual harassment is prohibited under 
employment legislation, and is considered misconduct and criminalized in some instances. 
Rape is prohibited across all States, with definitions ranging broadly from coercive 
circumstances to narrow and outdated definitions, including the requirement of penile 
penetration. New legislation emerging in the region reflects international developments as 
regards definitions including gender-neutral forms of the offence. Other sexual offences, 
including sexual and indecent assault, attempted rape, abduction, defilement, indecent 
assault and incest, are criminalized across the region. Specific harmful practices are also 
forbidden in some instances. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is prohibited in a few 
States, sometimes only applying to girls under the age of 18.  
</p>
<p>75. Effective implementation of laws is a challenge in many States. The investigation, 
prosecution, conviction and punishment of violence against women is extremely rare across 
the region. Domestic violence in particular is rarely prosecuted, and rape cases often do not 
result in convictions. Despite progressive laws, the prosecution and conviction rates are low 
and sentences for perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence are generally quite low. 
Some States have begun to increase sentences for sexual offences, and have commendably 
removed provisions on immunity for military officials. Also, the inclusion of the HIV status 
of the perpetrator of sexual violence is considered an aggravating factor in some States. 
Legal remedies are inaccessible to victims for a variety of reasons including costs, courts 
are often inaccessible, particularly for rural women, and there is a lack of staff or resources 
to provide the remedies guaranteed in law. Even when relief is granted by the courts, 
compliance is a barrier that prevents effective redress. Customary courts, when 
implementing laws which are often discriminatory, continue to perpetuate stereotypes, and 
sometimes deny access to remedies to women.  
</p>
<p>76. Some States have national policies, action plans and programmes, including on 
equality, domestic violence, trafficking, HIV/AIDS, or on preventing and responding to 
gender-based violence. The trend however, is a primary focus on the advancement of 
gender equality, of which violence against women is one element. In a number of States, 
intersectoral obligations exist across a range of ministries, to deal with gender equality 
broadly and violence against women in particular. Notably provisions for referral between 
the police and the health sector are increasing. Ministries in many States provide training 
for a range of stakeholders, including those in law enforcement, the judiciary, health and 
education, community leaders, and women and girls. Many of these policies were 
developed with significant support and collaboration from NGOs and international 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>77. There are ministries and or departments that deal with gender or women in the 
majority of States. However, in many of these, the ministries are understaffed, under-
resourced and have insufficient capacity to carry out the tasks allocated to them. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, some State ministries reflect a welfare and patriarchal approach in addressing 
violence against women. Some States have committees and national agencies that deal with 
violence against women, some of which include collaborations between civil society and 
government.  
</p>
<p>78. There exist different oversight mechanisms, including human rights/gender 
commissions, ombudspersons, and women&#8217;s observatories in the region. Some of these are 
independent, under the terms of the Paris Principles relating to the Status of National 
Institutions. Many suffer from a lack of funding and support from the State, and some have 
been politicized through appointment processes. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>79. There have been a range of awareness-raising initiatives by governments, often 
collaboratively with NGOs and the media. In many States, governments actively participate 
in the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign. Some States have run 
campaigns encouraging women to stand for public office, including Parliament. These 
initiatives have met with some success in some States.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Data collection and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>80. Many States rely on NGOs and international agencies to provide them with data 
regarding the prevalence and forms of violence. Some States have set up data collection 
units and databases in ministries, as well as in the courts and the police services. Some data 
has provided an accurate reflection of the prevalence of different forms of violence and the 
attitudes of different stakeholders, but it does not assess the impact of violence against 
women holistically or the impact of the measures implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Service provision 
</b></p>
<p>81. Incidents of violence against women that are reported to the police are not reflective 
of the actual prevalence thereof, due to the stigmatization of victims of many forms of 
violence, tacit acceptance of violence in the community, and the fact that frontline services 
are not readily accessible for victims. States in the region rely heavily on the provision of 
services by NGOs and by international agencies. NGOs are providing most of the services 
available to victims of violence against women in many States, including counselling, 
training, advocacy and outreach, and shelter. This is provided on the basis of aid from 
external funders. Often such services do not meet the needs, do not subscribe to minimum 
standards, and are rarely long term and holistic. Legal aid is provided by some States, but is 
often insufficient and/or of poor quality; and many States rely on NGOs or pro bono 
lawyers to provide such assistance. There are some examples of States providing one-stop 
shops, toll-free helplines, and some psychosocial support. However, these programmes are 
often underfunded and are unable to provide support 24/7.  
</p>
<p>82. In many States there are specialized units in the police to deal with violence against 
women, through victim support units or desks, particularly for women and children. These 
units are insufficiently funded, and officials are poorly trained. Reporting of violence takes 
place in public and non-confidential spaces. Police fail to record complaints of violence, 
and perpetuate patriarchal stereotypes, failing to believe victims and telling them to go 
home, and actively encouraging withdrawals of cases. If cases are pursued, police 
encourage mediation and reconciliation. In certain instances, there are concerns about 
police violence, as well as with corruption in dealing with cases. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Assessment of fulfilment of due diligence standards 
</b></p>
<p>83. Despite significant awareness-raising activities, which are largely driven by NGOs 
and international organizations, legal literacy is low; and negative societal attitudes as 
regards women&#8217;s human rights continue to impact prevalence rates of violence against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>women. States in the region largely condone cultural practices that discriminate and 
perpetuate violence against women, both through the lack of legislation and also due to a 
lack of enforcement of existing legislation. Within the sphere of personal law, States&#8217; 
condoning of harmful customary practices means that many women are left without 
protection in the areas of early marriage, economic dependence, polygyny and widow 
inheritance.  
</p>
<p>84. Existing legislation in many States does not provide sufficient penalties for violence 
against women generally, including rape, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), witchcraft 
violence and other forms of customary violence. There are specialized units in the police in 
most States, but these are insufficiently funded. Reporting violence takes place in public 
spaces with no privacy. Police fail to fulfil their obligations. Hence investigation and 
prosecution of violence is rare. Police brutality and violence, as well as widespread 
corruption are the norm in some States. Courts rarely grant protection orders, and if they do 
so, these are rarely served on perpetrators, leaving women without protection. Furthermore, 
courts lack the staff or resources to provide the remedies guaranteed in law. Sentences for 
perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence are generally quite low. As discussed above, 
some States have begun to increase sentences for sexual offences. Also, there is insufficient 
legal aid for victims for access to justice. Health-care providers in some instances display 
discriminatory attitudes towards women who have been victims of violence. Approaching 
the State for protection in the face of violence is a challenge for many women in the region. 
</p>
<p>85. Most States rely on NGOs as the primary source of services to victims of violence. 
A few States provide some services, including one-stop shops, helplines and psychological 
support, but most fall below minimal requirements for effective redress, and are reliant on 
external funding. 
</p>
<p>86. The unstable political situation in some States, which often culminates in unrest and 
conflict, has left women without protection from the State, and also at risk of direct 
violence from State actors.  
</p>
<p>87. Reparations for victims of violence are extremely rare. While in some instances civil 
damages are available, the legal costs of such applications are prohibitive and victims are 
rarely aware of the possibility. Generally remedies are not transformative or sustainable.
