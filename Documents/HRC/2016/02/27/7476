report on Equatorial Guinea. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Equatorial Guinea: Estonia, Japan and South 
Africa. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Equatorial Guinea expressed satisfaction with regard to the 
significant progress that had been achieved in the field of human rights but acknowledged 
that challenges remained. The promulgation of the new Constitution had given new impetus 
to the State and to social development. 
</p>
<p>6. Fighting poverty was fundamental to advancing the full enjoyment of freedoms. 
Action was being taken in multiple areas, in particular social housing, hospitals and schools 
to enable the real enjoyment of the benefits generated by the State. 
</p><p>7. Pursuant to the recommendations made during the first UPR review, Equatorial 
Guinea had given thorough consideration to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, which had been submitted to the House of Deputies and to the Senate as a step 
towards ratification. 
</p>
<p>8. In that connection, the implementation of Decree No. 129/2004 on the integration of 
persons with disabilities into social security programmes conducted by the National 
Association of Disabled Persons was worthy of note. The delegation provided further 
details in that regard. </p>


<p>9. The Constitution provided for the independence of the judiciary and defined in detail 
its attributes and functioning. In addition to the relevant legislative provisions, a number of 
training initiatives on human rights had been carried out. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government&#8217;s decision not to tolerate torture and arbitrary detention had been 
applied at the national level, and robust measures had been adopted. In that context, the 
Ministry of National Security had developed a Police Reference Handbook on Human 
Rights, ,the first page of which quoted President Mbasogo, sayingwho that: &#8220;My biggest 
concern is, and will be, the welfare of my people; their right to safety and freedom is not 
negotiable. The Security and Order Forces must guarantee these rights and ensure the safety 
of all citizens.&#8221; That statement reflected the Government&#8217;s commitment to the prevention of 
torture, arbitrary detention and other degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>11.  Equatorial Guinea was taking steps to bring the National Human Rights 
Commission into line with the Paris Principles. At the same time, it was making 
considerable efforts to cooperate with United Nations agencies on a continuous basis, 
including through reporting to and engaging in constructive dialogue with the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the UPR, as well as participating without reservation in the activities of the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>12. A commission had been established to study the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women prior to their submission to 
the Council of Ministers for approval and, subsequently, to Parliament. 
</p>
<p>13. Equatorial Guinea had never been involved in the smuggling of migrants and 
trafficking in persons, particularly children. The ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography had already been approved by the Government and was being considered 
byhad been Parliament in 2014. 
</p>
<p>14. The International Committee of the Red Cross and representatives of various 
religious groups had free access to detention centres at the national level. In addition, the 
Attorney General and the National Human Rights Commission conducted periodic 
inspections of detention centres. Cases involving arbitrary detention, kidnapping, torture or 
similar acts had been tried by military courts; persons found to have perpetrated such acts 
had received prison sentences or, in other cases, had been dismissed from their postsed. 
</p>
<p>15. In April 2014, the Government had decided to send the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption to the national Committee on Political Affairs in order to obtain its 
opinion. The Commission of Jurists had already decided to suggest that that instrument 
should be signed, but had reservations regarding the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. The Government would rule on the matter once it had received the report 
of the Committee on Political Affairs. 
</p>
<p>16. The Office of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor was establishing rules designed to 
eradicate corruption effectively. It was under an obligation to declare the financial situation 
of people who were under surveillance, in view of possible conflict of interests and the use 
of privileged information. The delegation provided detailed information on action taken in 
that connection.  
</p>
<p>17. In 2014, the Government had approved the accession of Equatorial Guinea to the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>children in armed conflict, which had been sent to Parliament for completion of the 
formalities of accession. With regard to the Rome Statute, the Government had endorsed 
the Declaration of the African Union. 
</p>
<p>18. A number of legal initiatives had been introduced to ensure the adequate 
representation and participation of women in State institutions. Consequently, women were 
extensively represented and participated in the Government and in the Senate. .  
</p>
<p>19. Public spending on social sectors had been increased. 
</p>
<p>20. In addition, measures had been taken with regard to urbanization, housing, 
electricity and sanitation, including the construction of roads to improve access to rural 
areas and the construction of over 15,000 dwellings nationwide. 
</p>
<p>21. Measures had also been taken to improve health, in particular with regard to 
maternal and child mortality in rural areas, by ensuring that 90 per cent of births were 
assisted by midwives.. The goal of such measures was to reduce maternal mortality by 50 
per cent by 2015, and by 80 per cent by 2020.  
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, a number of measures had been introduced to combat AIDS and other 
sexually transmitted diseases, as well as malaria. 
</p>
<p>23. In connection with education, the national educational system had been reformed at 
various levels through the adaptation of curricula and textbooks.  
</p>
<p>24. The Ministry of the Interior was taking action to introduce more flexible criteria for 
the granting of permits to the numerous associations and non-governmental organizations 
that operated in Equatorial Guinea. Restrictions on the media had been reduced, and the 
fact that numerous magazines and publications flourished in the country was evidence that 
no censorship was imposed. 
</p>
<p>25. As a prelude to the abolition of the death penalty, the Government had adopted a 
Decree No. 426/2.014, declaring a temporary moratorium. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government would shortly restructure the Centre for Human Rights with a view 
to revitalizing it.  
</p>
<p>27. Many of the recommendations that Equatorial Guinea had not fully accepted in the 
past had been addressed. Those in respect of which a decision remained pending would be 
dealt with promptly, in order to maintain the honest and transparent dialogue between 
Equatorial Guinea and the United Nations system through the UPR process.

arbitrary detention, and perpetrators of such violations of human rights were punished

</p>
<p>86. Turning to diverse issues, the delegation indicated that sexual orientation was 
considered in the framework of general rights, which meant that all citizens of Equatorial 
Guinea were equal and protected under the law. In addition, an oversight and monitoring 
commission dealt with transparency issues, and a standing committee on corruption had 
been designated by the Chamber of Deputies. Human rights awareness campaigns, human 
rights programmes and human rights departments were being developed in a number of

recommendations.
