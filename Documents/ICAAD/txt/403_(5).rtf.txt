BAIL RULING

Introduction

This is an application forbailby the accused persons. The accused have been remanded in custody since 5th August 2013 after the case was first called and transferred to the High Court.

Section 3(1) of theBailAct provides that an accused has the right to be released onbailunless it is not in the interests of justice thatbailshould be granted. Consistent with this principle, section 3(3) of the Act provides that there is a presumption in favour of the granting ofbail to a person, but a person who opposes the granting ofbailmay seek to rebut the presumption. In determining whether a presumption is rebutted, the primary consideration in deciding whether to grantbailis the likelihood of the accused person appearing in court to answer the charges laid against him or her (section 17(2)).

Wherebailis opposed, Section 18(1) of theBailAct requires that the party opposingbailaddress the following three considerations:

(a) the likelihood of the accused person surrendering to custody and appearing in court;

(b) the interests of the accused person;

(c) the public interest and the protection of the community.

Section 19(1) of theBailAct provides that an accused person must be grantedbailby a court unless:

(a) the accused person is unlikely to surrender to custody and appear in court to answer the charges laid;

(b) the interests of the accused person will not be served through the granting ofbail; or

(c) grantingbail to the accused person would endanger the public interest or make the protection of the community more difficult.

Section 19 (2) of the Act sets out a series of considerations that the court must take into account in determining whether or not any of the three matters mentioned in section 19 (1) are established. These matters are:

(a) as regards the likelihood of surrender to custody 

(i) the accused person's background and community ties (including residence, employment, family situation, previous criminal history);

(ii) any previous failure by the person to surrender to custody or to observebail conditions;

(iii) the circumstances, nature and seriousness of the offence;

(iv) the strength of the prosecution case;

(v) the severity of the likely penalty if the person is found guilty;

(vi) any specific indications (such as that the person voluntarily surrendered to the police at the time of arrest, or, as a contrary indication, was arrested trying to flee the country);

(b) as regards the interests of the accused person 

(i) the length of time the person is likely to have to remain in custody before the case is heard;

(ii) the conditions of that custody;

(iii) the need for the person to obtain legal advice and to prepare a defence;

(iv) the need for the person to beat liberty for other lawful purposes (such as employment, education, care of dependants);

(v) whether the person is under the age of 18 years (in which case section 3(5) applies);

(vi) whether the person is incapacitated by injury or intoxication or otherwise in danger or in need of physical protection;

(c) as regards the public interest and the protection of the community 

(i) any previous failure by the accused person to surrender to custody or to observebail conditions;

(ii) the likelihood of the person interfering with evidence, witnesses or assessors or any specially affected person;

(iii) the likelihood of the accused person committing an arrestable offence while onbail.

In addition to these matters, the court must also bear in mind the presumption of innocence. This is that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty by the Court. 

In this application the State opposesbail for each of the accused persons. For the 1st accused, the prosecution has submitted that he has previous history of absconding bail, the seriousness of the charge and the expected sentence make the accused a flight risk. In addition the prosecution stated that if the accused is given bail he might re-offend. 

For the 2nd accused, prosecution objects on the following ground that the accused is likely to re-offend while on bail and the seriousness of the charge makes the accused a flight risk. 

The applicants have not made any substantive application for bail nor have they given adequate assurances to this Court of re-appearing in court on the next given dates. 

Having considered the application for bail by the accused persons. The Court is satisfied that the applicants are a flight risk. In public interest both accused will be remanded in custody and as both have entered pleas of not guilty and made their grounds of voir dire available this case will now be set for hearing. hearing 

Both accused are remanded in custody until hearing. Bailis refused. The applicants are advised of the right to appeal this decision to the High Court within 30 days.
