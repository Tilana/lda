<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, conducted an 
official mission to Brazil between 12 and 18 October 2009. The purpose of the mission was 
to assess the progress made since the 2002 mission of the former Special Rapporteur, Jean 
Ziegler,1 as well as the remaining obstacles to the realization of the right to food in Brazil.  
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur took part in the seminar on claim 
mechanisms for the human right to adequate food and the national system on food and 
nutrition security, jointly organized by the Ministry for Social Development and the Fight 
against Hunger, the National Council on Food and Nutrition Security (CONSEA) and the 
non-governmental organization (NGO) Brazilian Action for Nutrition and Human Rights. 
He met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, the Minister for Social 
Development and the Fight against Hunger, Patrus Anan&#237;as, and the Minister for Agrarian 
Development, Guilherme Cassel. He also met with officials of the ministries of health, 
education, and agriculture and with the vice-director of the Casa Civil, Mr. Dos Santos. At 
the Congress, he met deputies from various groups, as well as the President of the Senate, 
Jos&#233; Sarney, and the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Michel Temer. Meetings were 
organized also with the head of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Cooperation, Pedro 
Antonio Arraes; the President of the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian 
Reform (INCRA), Rolf Hackbart; the Inter-Ministry Chamber of Food and Nutrition 
Security; CONSEA, under the leadership of its chair, Renato Maluf; and members of the 
Federal Public Ministry, including Gilda Pereira de Carvalho, the head of the Federal 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office for the Defence of Citizens. The Special Rapporteur expresses his 
gratitude to Milton Rondo of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Crispim Moreira of the 
Ministry for Social Development and the Fight against Hunger, as well as to the Permanent 
Mission of Brazil to the United Nations in Geneva for their support during the visit. He is 
also very grateful to the representatives of civil society whom he met during his mission, 
including representatives of indigenous and Quilombola communities, and he particularly 
thanks Sergio Sauer, the National Rapporteur for the Human Rights to Food, Land and 
Territory.  
</p>
<p>3. This report offers a general introduction to the enjoyment of the right to food in 
Brazil. It then examines how Brazil is discharging the three levels of obligations identified 
by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights under article 11 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights:2 to respect, protect and 
fulfil the right to food. While fully acknowledging the impressive range of South-South 
cooperation programmes that Brazil either has initiated or is supporting which seek to 
promote agricultural and rural development in developing countries, the Special Rapporteur 
focused on the situation of the right to food in Brazil and regrets that the former aspect of 
the country&#8217;s policies could not be included in this report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of hunger and malnutrition in Brazil 
</b>4. According to the 2009 Human Development Report, Brazil ranks seventy-fifth 
among high-income countries. Its ranking according to the Human Development Index has 
improved considerably, from 0.685 in 1980 to 0.813 in 2007, an average improvement rate

<p>of 0.63 per cent per annum, although the improvement rate has been lower recently (0.41 
per cent per annum since 2000). If the index&#8217;s main components are decomposed, Brazil is 
above the world average in each category (except gross domestic product (GDP) per 
capita), but below the Latin America and Caribbean average (except in education). The 
country&#8217;s place on the Human Poverty Index (Brazil ranks 43 out of 135) is considerably 
better than on the Human Development Index. This suggests that Brazil has been 
particularly effective in tackling extreme forms of deprivation. However, average Human 
Development Index levels hide significant regional and ethnic disparities. The 2005 
Brazilian Human Development Report shows that African descendants enjoyed on average 
the same Human Development Index in 2000 as whites had enjoyed in 1980.3  
</p><p>5. The latest large sample survey on malnutrition was undertaken in 2003.4 Among 
adults, weight deficit was observed in 4 per cent of the population, excess weight in 40.6 
per cent and obesity in 11.1 per cent. Malnutrition among adults is a phenomenon closely 
related to gender in Brazil: below-average weight-to-height ratios above 6 per cent were 
only observed among women, particularly in the rural north-east, mid-west and south-east 
regions, and malnutrition was twice or more prevalent among women than among men in 
nearly all groups. Moreover, 8.5 per cent of women with income below a quarter of the 
minimum wage displayed weight deficit, whereas for men the prevalence was 4.5 per cent. 
Ethnicity was associated less strongly with the prevalence of weight deficit, although only 
among African and African-descendant women in rural areas did the malnutrition rate reach 
6 per cent. 
</p>
<p>6. More recent official data indicates that food insecurity exists in 37.5 per cent of 
households, although strong regional variations exist, with the rate ranging from 25 per cent 
in the southern region to 55 per cent in the north-east region.5 Severe food insecurity is 
concentrated in households belonging to the lowest income quintiles and in households 
where the mother&#8217;s schooling level is low. The National Demographic and Health Survey 
of Infants and Mothers showed that ethnic characteristics were also a determining factor: 
both moderate and severe food insecurity were nearly twice as likely in households where 
the respondent was an Afro-Brazilian. 
</p>
<p>7. Child malnutrition was substantially reduced between 1996 and 2006, in particular 
among children from the north-east region and, in general, among children of lower income 
families. The average stunting (height-for-age) rate observed was 7 per cent: this was 
higher for boys (8.1 per cent) than for girls (5.8 per cent), slightly more frequent in rural 
(7.5 per cent) than in urban (6.9 per cent) areas, with a much higher prevalence in the north 
of Brazil (14.7 per cent), than in the rest of the country. The mother&#8217;s educational level had 
greater bearing than income level differentials: in families where the woman had less than 
three years of schooling, the prevalence of stunting was eight times higher than in families 
where the mother had completed 12 years of schooling. Income differentials between the 
highest and lowest quintiles were associated with three times greater prevalence of stunting 
in the lowest quintiles. The average rate of wasting (weight-to-height ratio) was 1.4 per 
cent, and the rate did not exceed 3 per cent in any group, thereby suggesting that acute 
forms of malnutrition are now under greater control in the country. The prevalence of

<p>underweight children (according to weight-to-age) was 1.9 per cent nationally, although it 
reached 4.5 per cent in the case of children with mothers with little schooling and belonging 
to the lowest income quintile. Low intake of vitamin A was also observed in 17.4 per cent 
of children under the age of five: the highest prevalence rates were observed in the 
impoverished north-east (19 per cent) and comparatively wealthier south-east (21.6 per 
cent). Urban areas also saw higher prevalence rates than rural ones. This data also indicates 
that nearly 21 per cent of the population, on average, was anaemic and prevalence bore no 
correlation to income group or race. Considerable regional variations were observed, 
although the two poorest regions displayed opposite outcomes: the north had the lowest 
(10.4 per cent) and the north-east the highest (25.5 per cent) levels of prevalence in the 
country. Urban children were, on average, more at risk of anaemia than rural ones. Lastly, 
the risk of obesity reached a national average of 7.3 per cent. 
</p>
<p>8. The monitoring of food insecurity in Brazil has recently been significantly improved 
by the overhaul of the Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (SISVAN), which 
monitors the nutritional status and food intake of persons who use the services of the 
Unified Health System in all age categories. The various methodologies used include 
SISVAN-Web, a fully integrated national information technology platform that allows 
basic health units in municipalities throughout the country to provide observation data on 
child and mother nutrition. The provision of such data has been linked, since 2007, to the 
monitoring of the <i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia</i> conditionalities. In 2007, 39 per cent of municipalities had 
submitted some information on the nutritional situation of their population (although these 
submissions are admittedly not representative samples of the entire population), while 
among municipalities taking part in the <i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia</i> programme, reporting was much 
higher, exceeding 76 per cent.6 In the future, this should allow policymakers to assess 
progress much more often and in much greater detail. 
</p>
<p>9. The distinct methodologies employed within the SISVAN framework produce quite 
different results. The latest regional survey in the northern region7 reported that tremendous 
regional and subregional variations subsisted. Although the National Demographic and 
Health Survey of Infants and Mothers had observed acute malnutrition (low weight-to-age 
ratio) in 1.7 per cent of children nationwide, in the north, the regional survey revealed that 
the average rate of acute malnutrition was 3.4 per cent and, in three of the seven northern 
states, over 8 per cent. With respect to chronic malnutrition (low height-to-age ratio), the 
national average was 7 per cent, while the average for the northern region was nearly 15 per 
cent (and around 30 per cent in three of the seven states in this region). This suggests that 
an adequate and timely picture of the situation of malnutrition requires the use of tools that 
permit greater refinement in disaggregation, and a constant inflow of updated data.  
</p>
<p>10. According to data available, real income among the poor has steadily grown since 
</p><p>2002. This is attributed to the steady increase in the minimum wage, at a rate quite above 
inflation, and to cash-transfer programmes targeting those with the lowest income. 
</p>
<p>11. Based on the data from the National Household Sample Survey,8 the evolution of 
extreme poverty &#8212; defined as living with less than US$ 1 (parity purchasing power, PPP) 
per day &#8212; from 1992 to 2008 can be visualized as follows:

line &#8212; the decline in poverty is also marked:

<p> 
</p>
<p>13. It is clear from the data available that poverty and malnutrition are still 
predominantly affecting persons of African, Afro-Brazilian and indigenous descent, 
although the rate of poverty reduction is considerably higher among these groups as they 
start from much lower levels of income. 
</p>
<p>14. The remainder of this report examines the remaining challenges to ensuring the full 
realization of the right to food and the policies put in place by Brazil to remove them. 
Brazil has placed the fight against hunger at the centre of its development strategy. Since it 
was adopted, the 2006 law establishing a National Food and Nutritional Security System 
(SISAN) has been a benchmark for many countries across the world. The law reinstated 
CONSEA (which ensures the active participation of civil society in drafting 
recommendations to the Government); it improved the coordination of the variety of 
programmes set up under the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy, as well as the accountability of the 
agencies responsible for implementing these programmes; and it provided that an inter-
ministerial taskforce would develop a national policy and plan on food and nutritional 
security. The participatory nature of these programmes, particularly shown through the 
work of CONSEA, are remarkable, and the success of Brazil in combating hunger and 
malnutrition, particularly child malnutrition, bears witness to the contribution that such 
participatory strategies can make to fulfilling such an objective.

<p><b> III. The obligation to respect the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>15. The obligation to respect existing access to adequate food requires States not to take 
any measures that result in preventing such access.9 This requires that remedies be available 
to victims of violations of the right to food that stem from the adoption of such measures by 
States.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. The legal protection of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>16. On 3 February 2010, the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies cast the final vote needed to 
amend the Constitution in order to guarantee the right to food. The adoption of the 
amendment further confirms the leading role of Brazil in ensuring the legal and institutional 
implementation of the right to food. Such an amendment is particularly important since the 
courts appear reluctant to apply the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights directly, despite the clear constitutional mandate under article 5, paragraph 
3, of the Constitution that obliges them to recognize the applicability in the domestic legal 
order of international human rights treaties.10 The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the 
degree of involvement of civil society organizations in the process of constitutional 
amendment.  
</p>
<p>17. Nevertheless, at the time of the mission, gaps in the protection of the right to food 
remained. The Special Rapporteur notes that the protection of the right to food would be 
further strengthened by the establishment of an independent national institution for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the Paris Principles, as 
recommended by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,11 and Brazil has 
committed itself, under the universal periodic review process, to setting up such an 
institution.12 The Council for the Defence of the Rights of the Person, which is placed under 
the authority of the Special Secretariat for Human Rights, is not an independent institution 
ensuring the protection of the right to food, and its special commission for monitoring 
violations of the right to food, set up in 2003, has recently discontinued its monitoring 
activity.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the role played by the Federal Public 
Ministry in protecting collective interests and safeguarding the basic rights of the citizen, 
and he welcomes the adoption by the Federal Public Ministry of a set of recommendations 
to strengthen the protection of the right to food. According to information received during 
the mission, the Public Ministry of the state of Alagoas &#8212; in a first case for Brazil &#8212; 
successfully obtained a judicial injunction to guarantee the communities of the Orla 
Lagunar area of Macei&#243; their fundamental rights to food, education, health and housing. 
The Special Rapporteur considers this proactive use of the constitutional guarantees to 
ensure the realization of the right to food exemplary and calls upon the local government to 
take all measures required to comply with the recommendations of the judiciary. However, 
the Special Rapporteur notes that the capacity of the Federal Public Ministry remains &#8212; in 
certain regards &#8212; insufficient to ensure such actions are taken on a systematic basis.

<p><b> 2. Measures preventing access to productive resources 
</b></p>
<p>19. Indigenous, Quilombola and other traditional communities depend on the 
Government of Brazil to fulfil its constitutionally mandated obligation to demarcate their 
ancestral lands, and provide title and protection to this communal property. In the case of 
indigenous peoples, the Federal Constitution of 1988 required &#8212; under article 67 of the 
Transitional Constitutional Provisions Act &#8212; that the Government conclude all 
demarcations by late 1993; however, this constitutional requirement has not been fulfilled. 
Considerable difficulties persist in the territorial demarcation of all traditional communities. 
Some of these difficulties are linked to the insecurities regarding titling of lands, 
particularly in the Amazonian region, where land registration has not been completed, 
leading to competing claims of ownership. 
</p>
<p>20. According to information received from indigenous community representatives, the 
overall process of demarcations has virtually come to a standstill in recent years. These 
difficulties in demarcation procedures are being compounded by the criteria set by the 
Supreme Court in its <i>Raposa Serra do Sol</i> ruling. Meanwhile, private ownership claims 
over land and, more recently, settlements of INCRA are increasing pressure on these 
traditional communities and displacing them, often by State-sanctioned use of force. Large 
landowners have systematically relied on courts to expel indigenous peoples from their 
lands and to attempt to nullify the different administrative acts that lead up to the 
demarcation, thereby drawing out the procedure and leaving displaced communities 
exposed to egregious nutritional and sanitary conditions. A large number of bills have been 
filed in Congress, sponsored by large landowners, tending towards limiting the rights of 
indigenous people to their land or countering measures adopted by Government to ensure 
progress in demarcation. This paralysis of the land demarcation process for indigenous 
communities is of particular concern because the lands claimed by the traditional 
communities are, in the meantime, not protected against <i>grilagem</i>, i.e., the fraudulent 
appropriation of public lands by private persons, which is dealt with later in this report. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur understands the difficulties associated with the clarification 
of land registration and titling in the vast expanses of the Amazon region, as well as the 
difficulties involved in the demarcation procedures. Nevertheless, he urges the Government 
to adopt the measures necessary to ensure that the constitutionally mandated demarcations 
be accelerated, procedures and standards used in the process be clarified and streamlined 
and that, pending final determinations and assignment of lands, traditional communities be 
supported and have their right to food ensured either by a minimum level of access to 
productive resources or direct provision of culturally appropriate food aid. 
</p>
<p>22. Large-scale infrastructure projects that deprive communities of access to land also 
create a high risk of violations of the right to food. As Brazil increases investment in 
transport, energy and urban infrastructures it also exposes groups to displacement and 
adjustment vulnerability. The Brazilian Growth Acceleration Programme is expected to 
invest R$ 509 billion from 2007 to 2010, over half of which will be in the energy sector. 
Large projects such as dams, transportation and energy distribution networks are known to 
have a disproportionate impact on populations that are worst-off, aggravating their already 
precarious livelihoods.13 The increased number of projects and the tight time frame set for 
their conclusion raises the risk that expediency will trump the need to properly assess 
environmental, social and human rights impacts and involve local communities in effective 
consultations. For instance, whatever the merits of the transposition of the S&#227;o Francisco 
river, indigenous communities and other <i>ribeirinhos</i> (traditional riverside communities)

</p>
<p>should be meaningfully consulted and legal procedures &#8212; such as previous congressional 
authorization for the exploitation of natural resources in indigenous lands &#8212; fully 
respected. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Excessive use of force and criminalization of social movements 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that politically tense situations &#8212; 
particularly those involving disputes over land and the implementation of large 
infrastructure projects &#8212; can still result in violent repression by State security forces, in a 
manner that is inconsistent with the need to respond with due restraint and in a proportional 
manner. 
</p>
<p>24. In this context, the Special Rapporteur has taken note of the recent final report of the 
Special Commission of the Council for the Defence of the Rights of the Person on the 
criminalization of social movements.14 This report, focusing on the situation in the state of 
Rio Grande do Sul, reached the conclusion that &#8220;there is evidence of criminalization of the 
social movements in both rural and urban contexts by local authorities &#8230; this process of 
intimidation and criminalization [can be said to have] become a State policy, executed by 
the three branches of Government&#8221;. Further evidence of this process and the excessive use 
of State power to curtail the freedoms of social movements can be found in the two recent 
judgements of the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, one of which dealt with illegal 
wiretapping against organizations of the landless peasant movements, and the other with the 
impunity regarding a forced eviction by private militia.15 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur urges the State, at federal, state and municipal levels, to take 
all measures necessary to ensure that legitimate forms of protest and social activism enjoy 
the protections afforded to them by international human rights standards. Furthermore, he 
recalls that restrictions on activities deemed illegal must be based on the rule of law and 
strictly proportionate to the public goal pursued.16 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The obligation to protect the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>26. The obligation to protect the right to food requires each State to ensure that 
enterprises or individuals do not deprive individuals of their access to adequate food.17 
Measures conducive to this outcome include labour and environmental legislation, as well 
as the law on land ownership and use.

<p>the federal labour inspectorate have increased and Brazil has taken a number of measures to 
repress slave-like labour conditions, particularly in rural areas. These efforts, as well as the 
tremendous sacrifice of individual inspectors, some of whom have been murdered in the 
exercise of their duties, are to be commended. Brazil must step up efforts to tackle this 
problem. In particular, the Special Rapporteur encourages Brazil to adopt the constitutional 
amendment that would allow expropriation without compensation of farmlands in which 
slave labour was found to occur. Slave-like labour is both a serious violation of a human 
right in its own right, and the most extreme violation of the right to a decent standard of 
living, including the right to adequate food, that is recognized in article 11 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>28. One of the main tools that the Government has to protect the right to food of 
workers is its power to set the national minimum wages. Since 2002, minimum wages have 
been readjusted annually and these wage hikes have resulted in increased purchasing power 
in real terms. Accumulated inflation from 2002 to 2008 was of 64 per cent, while the 
minimum wage grew 158 per cent over the same period. The indirect effects also are 
noteworthy: pensioners, and particularly rural pensioners, have their income linked to the 
national minimum wage, the level of which also influences wages in the informal sector;18 
in addition, by consistently expanding the domestic consumer market, Brazil has developed 
greater resilience to externals shocks, such as the financial crisis of 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Environmental regulation 
</b></p>
<p>29. The protection of the environment affects the right to food in different ways: it 
ensures the long-term sustainability of the agricultural sector; makes sure that food 
produced is appropriate for human consumption and healthy; and guarantees that 
biodiversity is preserved, ensuring that seeds, plant and animal species remain available for 
food production and renewal of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>30. In this respect, Brazil has taken a number of measures to ensure the compatibility of 
agricultural expansion with the protection of the environment. Depending on the biome, 
agricultural establishments must set aside an area (&#8220;legal reserve&#8221;) varying from 20 to 80 
per cent of the farm&#8217;s surface for preservation purposes. Failure to register these areas and 
practising deforestation within them constitute punishable environmental crimes. Moreover, 
Brazil has recently concluded a national zoning for sugar-cane production which 
discourages its cultivation in over 81 per cent of agricultural land. At present, producers 
who do not respect the zoning would be sanctioned only by the denial of Government credit 
and other subsidies, but a bill has been presented to Congress that would effectively 
prohibit the cultivation of sugar canes in those areas. These initiatives have certainly 
reinforced the legal framework of environmental protection, but the crucial factor is the 
capacity of Brazil to monitor compliance with these regulations. Brazil should also step up 
its efforts to combat the excessive use of pesticides: the Brazilian Sanitary Vigilance 
Agency has found dangerous trace levels of pesticides in food, including substances 
prohibited by the agency. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Land ownership and use 
</b></p>
<p>31. In Brazil, the clarification of land registration in rural areas has long been an area of 
concern and, despite progress in the period under review, great challenges remain.

<p><i>Grilagem</i>, already referred to above, concerns an estimated 100 million hectares in Brazil, 
or roughly 12 per cent of the national territory, according to a Government estimate.19 In 
2000, for instance, INCRA cancelled the registration of 1,899 large properties which 
claimed over 62 million hectares. <i>Grilagem</i> is particularly frequent in the Amazon region, 
since 45 per cent of its surface has not been officially titled, and low population density 
invites informal occupation. The current accelerated process of land regularization for the 
Amazon region, the &#8220;Terra Legal&#8221; Programme, aims at addressing this issue by 
guaranteeing title to lands of up to 1,500 ha for settlers who have occupied land peacefully 
since 2004, where there are no rival claims to ownership. Titling will be free for properties 
up to 100 ha; below market price for properties up to 400 ha; and at market price for 
properties up to 1,500 ha. This initiative has raised concerns among indigenous 
communities and civil society that prior claims by traditional communities will not be given 
sufficient consideration, increasing tensions and ultimately slowing the pace of demarcation 
of indigenous lands. Moreover, there are fears that large landowners will use intermediaries 
to legalize properties and then consolidate them within their own property through fictional 
acquisitions.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The obligation to fulfil the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>32. The obligation to fulfil the right to food includes an obligation for the State to 
strengthen people&#8217;s access to and utilization of resources and means to ensure their 
livelihood, including food security.20 Under article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Brazil must take steps, &#8220;to the maximum of its 
available resources&#8221;, towards the full realization of the right to food. The burden is on the 
State to demonstrate that every effort has been made to use all resources that are at its 
disposal in an effort to ensure, as a matter of priority, that each individual has access to the 
minimum essential level of food required to be free from hunger.21 The Special Rapporteur 
was impressed by the level of commitment of Brazil to the full realization of the right to 
food, as illustrated by the policies described below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The national &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy 
</b></p>
<p>33. An impressive set of social policies have been grouped under the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; 
strategy pursued by the Federal Government. The strategy is to be commended, in 
particular, for its participatory dimension: the various policies it comprises are 
characterized by an impressive degree of involvement of civil society in their design and 
implementation, as well as by a decentralized approach that empowers local authorities and 
improves targeting. The &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy encompasses 53 initiatives implemented 
by 11 different ministries. Among these are social protection programmes, the most 
important of which are the <i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia</i> cash-transfer programme and the National School 
Feeding Programme. They also include a low-income restaurant programme, food banks, 
community kitchens, and cisterns, as well as the improvement of facilities for the storage of 
food in rural areas. It further includes income-generation initiatives, including support for 
family agriculture and &#8220;solidarity economy initiatives&#8221;. The strategy has achieved 
significant results in reducing malnutrition and poverty: child malnutrition has been

<p>reduced by 73 per cent between 2002 and 2008 and child deaths by 45 per cent.22 Brazil 
should be commended for these efforts.  
</p>
<p>34. The indigenous communities and Quilombolas face specific difficulties in accessing 
the programmes developed under the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy. Geographical distance from 
urban centres is, in many cases, a major obstacle. Illiteracy and lack of understanding of the 
procedures are also a barrier, as is the lack of cultural sensitivity in the design and 
implementation of the programmes concerned. It is the responsibility of the State to remove 
these obstacles. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The maximum use of available resources 
</b></p>
<p>35. The programmes implemented under the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy will only be 
effective if their funding is sufficient. As a minimum, the funding of these programmes 
should be insured against the risk of economic shocks, whether of a domestic or foreign 
origin: it is precisely in times of crisis that the role of such programmes is most important. 
The Special Rapporteur therefore encourages Brazil to include the right to food among the 
social objectives to be pursued by the Pre-Salt Social Fund. However, other reforms may 
also be required to ensure adequate funding of these programmes. Social spending has 
increased consistently since 1995 in nominal terms, and reached over 15 per cent of GDP in 
2007 (from 11 per cent in 1995).23 This sum was equivalent to US$ 1.3 trillion (in 2007) but 
included all spending by the ministries of health, pensions, education, social development 
and the fight against hunger. The budget allocated to food and nutritional safety24 has also 
increased steadily in nominal terms, but has remained roughly constant as a percentage of 
the budget effectively disbursed in social policy (averaging 4 per cent), and of the national 
budget (1 per cent). Of this amount, a growing part is linked to the <i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia</i> cash-
transfer programme, while other programmes of the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy have not used 
their budgets fully: although on average over 80 per cent of the budget allocated to &#8220;Zero 
Hunger&#8221; since 2004 was spent, the percentage would be considerably smaller &#8212; around 68 
per cent &#8212; without <i>Bolsa Fam&#237;lia</i>. So, although the data available suggests that there is no 
reduction of the budgetary effort of the State, the distribution of these resources and the 
modalities of expenditure vary considerably. The 1-per-cent national budget allocation to 
the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; programme contrasts with the 48 per cent of the 2009 budget earmarked 
for the issuance, rescheduling, reimbursement and servicing of the public debt.25

<p>36. The tax structure in Brazil remains highly regressive. Tax rates are high for goods 
and services and low for income and property, bringing about very inequitable outcomes. 
According to one estimate, families with an income amounting to less than two minimum 
wages pay an average of 46 per cent of their income in indirect taxes, while families 
earning over 30 times the minimum wage pay around 16 per cent in indirect taxes.26 A 
recent report by the Tax Services27 confirms the very low levels of property taxes. In 
particular, the rural territorial tax collected, in 2008, a mere R$ 416 million (US$ 239 
million) nationwide.28 As a percentage of GDP, this amounts to 0.01 per cent and, as a 
percentage of total taxation, the tax accounts for only 0.04 per cent. Given the very high 
level of land concentration and the large incomes generated by the agricultural sector, this 
is highly regressive. In contrast, taxes on goods and services, as well as social contributions 
to pensions and social security accounted for the lion&#8217;s share of Government income: over 
70 per cent in 2008. The Special Rapporteur concludes that, while the social programmes 
developed under the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy are impressive in scope, they are essentially 
funded by the very persons whom they seek to benefit, as the regressive system of taxation 
seriously limits the redistributive impact of the programmes. Only by introducing a tax 
reform that would reverse the current situation could Brazil claim to be seeking to realize 
the right to adequate food by taking steps to the maximum of its available resources.29

<p><b> 3. Supporting family agriculture 
</b>37. Under Brazilian law, a family farm is an agricultural establishment that occupies up 
to four fiscal modules,30 employs family labour predominantly, and is run by family 
members. Family farming plays a vital role for the food security and economy of Brazil (as 
proven by the latest agricultural census), accounting for R$ 54 billion worth of agricultural 
production. It outperforms large-scale plantations on land productivity measurements (R$ 
750 per hectare per year compared with R$ 358 per hectare per year for large-scale 
plantations). It also has a positive impact on rural communities and the environment. It is 
therefore welcome that, following decades of relative neglect, family agriculture is now 
supported actively by the Government. The results have followed: although extreme 
poverty is higher in the rural areas than in cities, extreme poverty in rural areas has 
decreased in relative terms from 28 to 9 per cent between 2002 and 2008, lifting over 1.5 
million people out of extreme poverty and 4 million out of poverty. Part of the &#8220;Zero 
Hunger&#8221; strategy aims at supporting family agriculture, in particular through the provision 
of credit under favourable terms (PRONAF). Resources allocated to PRONAF since 2003 
have gone from R$ 2 to 15 billion and an additional 1 million families have been given 
access to rural credit under better-than-market terms. This encouraging development must 
be tempered, however, by the observation that, according to data from the 2006 
Agricultural Census for 2006, large landowners owning only 1 per cent of rural 
establishments obtain over 43 per cent of all agricultural credit, while farmers with fewer 
than 100 ha (88 per cent of the total number of establishments) captured only 30 per cent. 
The census does not provide clear indication of how much of publicly funded credit and 
subsidy programmes are captured by small and large farmers. However, it is well 
established that the high level of credit default among large farmers &#8212; unrelated to climatic 
or crop price variations &#8212; has resulted in repeated rescheduling of their debt, with part of 
the default cost and risk being transferred to the Government, which in effect subsidizes 
agribusiness &#8211; some of which is clearly inefficient.31 Central bank data for 2008 shows that 
PRONAF funds represented only 13 per cent of the total value of loans to agricultural 
establishments,32 despite the fact that family agriculture produced 38 per cent of the total

 A fiscal module is a municipal unit of measurement, expressed in hectares, that reflects the

<p>predominant patterns of land occupation in the region, its profitability and the estimated agricultural 
needs of a family farm. In practice, a module can vary from 5 ha in fertile, market-connected areas, to 
110 ha in remote Amazonian areas. The national median currently is 30 ha.

<p>value of agricultural output.33 The focus on family farming in publicly subsidized credits is 
thus entirely justified, given the existing imbalances. The Special Rapporteur also 
encourages the Government to explore how it could be ensured that support will also reach 
the most vulnerable farmers, who should be assisted in overcoming barriers stemming from 
generally poor levels of education, lack of documentation, geographical distance and the 
lack of information. It should also conduct a review of the distributional aspects of its credit 
afforded to agriculture, and the possibility of increasing credit to family farming as a share 
of total credit, given this sector&#8217;s greater social and food security impact. 
</p>
<p>38. The Programme for the Acquisition of Food plays a particularly important role by 
ensuring that the Brazilian Corporation for Provisioning will purchase food from small 
farmers and encouraging the acquisition of food by family farmer cooperatives. Act No. 
11,947 of 16 June 2009 provides that a minimum of 30 per cent of all food acquired for the 
school feeding programme should be sourced from family farms. This innovative policy 
links social programmes to support to family farming, and could be scaled up in the future. 
It represents a powerful encouragement to family farming: for the fiscal year 2009, the total 
value of the National School Feeding Programme was R$ 2.2 billion (US$ 1.2 billion), 
ensuring that R$ 733 million will be purchased from family-farming establishments. The 
Special Rapporteur expresses the hope that the priority given in legislation to family farms, 
including <i>assentamentos</i> and those of indigenous communities and Quilombolas, will be 
realized in the future. 
</p>
<p>39. There is a heated debate within the Brazilian society about how to manage a possible 
coexistence between large-scale, industrial farming, on the one hand, and small-scale 
family farming on the other hand. Such a debate is welcome, but should take into account 
not only the question of productivity per hectare or per active labourer, but also the 
environmental and social dimensions of farming. Some forms of agriculture have important 
environmental impacts that are not accounted for, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas 
emissions, soil degradation, contamination of water tables and crop genetic erosion: these 
are social costs that are not reflected in the prices of commodities. Conversely, other forms 
of agriculture may contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems. Similarly, 
the impact of agriculture on the creation of employment and the incomes of the poorest 
groups of the population in the rural areas should be taken into account in assessing 
different forms of agricultural development.

<p><b> 4. Agrarian reform 
</b></p>
<p>40. Guideline 8.10 of the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of 
the right to adequate food in the context of national food security recommends advancing 
land reform to enhance access to productive resources for the poor and women.34 Building 
on this guideline, the Member States of the Food and Agriculture Organization emphasized 
the &#8220;essential role&#8221; of agrarian reform in the realization of basic human rights and food 
security at the Porto Alegre 2006 International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural 
Development. One of the most important challenges that Brazil is facing in the progressive 
realization of the right to food is the extraordinarily widespread inequality in access to land, 
which the country appears unable, under the current framework, to tackle effectively. Some 
2.4 million farms (47 per cent of the total) with less than 10 ha cover only 2.7 per cent of

<p>the agricultural surface, whereas 47,000 large properties (&gt;1,000 ha) &#8212; although 
constituting only 1 per cent of farms &#8212; cover 43 per cent of the land. The 2006 
Agricultural Census, carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 
reports a Gini coefficient for land distribution in Brazil of 0.872. This means that there is a 
higher degree of inequality than in 1995&#8211;1996, when the last census was conducted. As 
illustrated by the example of the state of S&#227;o Paulo, where land concentration increased by 
6.1 per cent, the planting of more sugar cane, itself the result of incentives for the 
production of ethanol, seems to have played a role in this situation. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts of INCRA to ensure a more equitable 
redistribution of land, in accordance with the principle established under the Constitution 
that property shall respect its social function. INCRA is responsible for executing land 
reform policy and supporting new settlements. Between its establishment in 1970 and 2006, 
this agency has founded over 8,000 settlements, covering 64 million hectares, and 
benefiting nearly 1 million families. Of these totals, the period of 2003&#8211;2006 accounts for 
29.9 per cent of settlements, 27.6 per cent of families and 45.3 per cent of the surface of 
land distribution, which shows considerable commitment by INCRA to carrying out its 
mission. Based on the mapping of families living in precarious encampments and settled 
families, the Special Rapporteur notes that in the contested areas of south-east, central and 
coastal Brazil &#8212; which are far more fertile and integrated into the domestic market &#8212; there 
is a huge, unmet demand for land. In contrast, there are a large number of settlements in 
northern Brazil. This illustrates the fact that the conflict for land is being mediated by the 
State by displacing landless peasants to the north, slowly dissolving the tensions in the 
highly productive areas of the south-east, but increasing pressure on land in the Amazon 
region. 
</p>
<p>42. Agrarian reform still encounters important obstacles. First, the index of productivity 
on the basis of which land may be found unproductive and thus &#8220;de-propriated&#8221;, has not 
been updated since 1975, despite the important advances made in improving yields since 
this period. For instance, average yields in sugar cane have increased 65 per cent since 
1975, and the increase for soy beans has been of 53 per cent35. Even when land is found to 
be unproductive, landowners may be tempted to speculate on the length of litigation, being 
rewarded by high compensatory interests for using tactics to delay judicial proceedings. 
Because of this situation, strict time limits should be imposed during judicial proceedings, 
in order to accelerate those proceedings, while incentives for landowners to abuse the 
judicial process should be removed. Second, when landless families occupy land &#8212; even 
when it is not cultivated &#8212; this could make registration and &#8220;de-propriation&#8221; impossible 
under the existing legislation, even where the other conditions are met. Third, once a 
settlement is recognized (<i>assentamento</i>), the settlement development plan that must be 
prepared in order for the settlement to benefit from credit and other forms of support 
sometimes requires months or years to be approved by the INCRA regional office, 
following a procedure that lacks clarity and for which little technical assistance is available. 
Lastly, land redistribution is delayed because of the failure to implement the constitutional 
provisions allowing the use of slave labour or environmental degradation to be considered 
as grounds for expropriation. The same can be said of the extremely low tax rate on rural 
property, which provides no disincentive to landowners who acquire or occupy land but do 
not realize its social function. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
review each of these obstacles to the acceleration of the land redistribution process and the 
successful development of settlements in areas which are unproductive.

<p><b> 5. The impact of trade and export-led agriculture 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the importance of international trade to the 
development strategy of Brazil, but notes that both the pursuit of access to foreign markets 
and the greater degree of openness of the domestic market to trade must be accompanied by 
serious consideration of the effects &#8212; economic, social and environmental &#8212; on different 
groups within the country and on the sustainability of the process seen in its entirety. He 
recalls, to this effect, the recommendations that he formulated in the report drafted 
following his mission to the World Trade Organization.36 From the point of view of the 
right to adequate food, what matters is not only the aggregate impacts of improved access 
to foreign markets and a fairer international trading system that is currently heavily skewed 
in favour of rich countries, but also the distributional effect of a more liberalized market on 
the poorest Brazilian households. It will be crucial, in this context, to ensure that the 
situation of households depending on family farming does not worsen, while households 
depending on the larger farms would benefit, as result of the expansion of export volumes. 
The commendable efforts made in favour of family farming should be stepped up as 
markets expand, and not lowered, despite the temptation to support as a matter of priority 
the large farms that are most competitive on international markets. 
</p>
<p>44. Brazil offers a particularly interesting context because of the coexistence of both a 
competitive agro-industrial, export-focused sector and a vibrant family agricultural sector 
that is responsible for the greater part of the domestic market while also contributing to 
exports. These two models of agriculture have served the country well in different contexts: 
the agro-export sector has ensured the exports required to ensure stability of the country&#8217;s 
balance-of-payments, whereas family farming has allowed Brazil not only to ensure food 
security in times of commodity price volatility, but also to ensure increased revenues and 
employment among the poorest populations of the country. Brazil should therefore continue 
to promote family agriculture, and ensure that it is afforded the support required to face the 
challenges of an eventual liberalization of agricultural trade. 
</p>
<p>45. The effects of trade liberalization on other activities, including industrial activities, 
and on urban populations should also be assessed. There is some evidence that 
liberalization since the 1990s &#8212; although associated with a significant reduction of poverty 
&#8212; has deepened the international division of labour and has resulted, in Brazil, in a certain 
level of deindustrialization and reduction of the value added in its exports, including in the 
agricultural sector. Expanded exports in agricultural products and increased investment in 
the Brazilian stock- and bond-markets are already resulting in considerable currency 
appreciation, which might harm other Brazilian exports, leading, in the long term, to 
deindustrialization. While industrial goods represent a larger proportion of Brazilian 
exports, the exports of primary commodities have been growing at a much greater rate. It is 
because of these uncertainties regarding the overall and distributional effects of increased 
agricultural trade that a comprehensive, participative impact assessment on the right to food 
should be conducted by Brazil. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Agrofuels: ethanol and biodiesel production 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the ongoing debate about the role of agrofuels 
in Brazilian development strategies. Brazil is expected to produce in excess of 563 million 
tons of sugar cane in 2009. It is the world&#8217;s largest producer of both raw and refined sugar, 
accounting for a third of global sugar-cane production, and 40 per cent of worldwide sugar 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>36
 See A/HRC/10/5/Add.2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11128 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>exports. Many of the State&#8217;s ethanol plants are actually compound sugar mill/distillery 
complexes, capable of producing both refined sugar and ethanol and of shifting from 60 per 
cent ethanol and 40 per cent sugar to 60 per cent sugar and 40 per cent ethanol. This allows 
Brazil to capitalize on the volatile price structure of the international sugar market by 
producing more sugar when rates are high, and more ethanol when rates are comparatively 
lower, thus maximizing the return on sugar cane. In addition, sugar-cane mills in certain 
cases provide low-carbon and affordable electricity to a number of rural households. 
</p>
<p>47. Although, according to the Government, the <i>Pr&#243;alcool</i> programme launched in 1974 
has led to 600 million fewer tons of carbon dioxide being emitted in the atmosphere as a 
result of the replacement of gasoline by ethanol in transport, there are mounting concerns 
that the current expansion of sugar-cane plantations for ethanol may not be sustainable 
because of its social and environmental impacts.37 The Brazilian Government has not 
remained inactive in the light of such concerns. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest: 
the initiative of the Government in conducting a national agroecological zoning, and 
denying governmental support to plantations that fail to comply with it; the recent 
Presidential proposal to prohibit the cultivation of sugar cane on 81 per cent of the 
agricultural land; and the National Commitment on working conditions in sugar cane 
agreed upon by the Government, employees and employers on 25 June 2009. These 
developments are welcome, as they demonstrate the will of both the Government and the 
other stakeholders to improve the sustainability of the production of ethanol from sugar 
cane. At the same time, sugar-cane production continues to be based upon a monocropping 
agricultural model that has certain environmental negative externalities. It results in a loss 
of biodiversity. The intensive use of pesticides may contaminate water reserves. The use of 
vinasse in the fields for fertigation purposes may contaminate land and groundwater, and 
the practice of sugar cane burning produces large, and unaccounted for, amounts of 
greenhouse gas emission, also resulting in serious and immediate impacts for the 
surrounding communities. In addition, as indicated above, the expansion of ethanol 
production may lead to reconcentration of land. Finally, there are recent indications that 
working conditions on the sugar-cane plantations remain very poor &#8212; and in many cases 
create a health hazard for the workers involved &#8212; and that wages remain low;38 although a 
positive step, the recent National Commitment to improve these conditions remains a 
voluntary instrument and is no substitute for stronger monitoring of compliance with labour 
legislation. Brazil has in place a number of instruments to achieve this, including relative to 
the maintenance of a list of companies which do not comply with labour legislation.39 It is 
encouraged to pursue its efforts in this direction.

<i>Energy Policy</i>, vol. 36 (April 2008), pp. 2086&#8211;2097. On 8 January 2010, it was announced that Cosan 
SA Industria and Comercio was placed on a list of enterprises found to be violating labour legislation, 
resulting in this enterprise being cut off from financing by Brazil&#8217;s State Development Bank after the 
company &#8212; considered to be the world&#8217;s largest sugar-cane processor &#8212; was found to have workers 
in slave-like conditions, This shows both that the problem persists, and the Government takes 
seriously its responsibility to tackle it.

</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly called for the definition of an international 
consensus on the sustainability of the production and use of agrofuels.40<b> </b>A similar call was 
made in the Declaration of the High-Level Conference on World Food Security convened 
in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008. Brazil should take a leading role in forging such a 
consensus. Any criteria developed at national or international level on the development of 
agrofuels should include the need to ensure that the development of agrofuels production 
increases the incomes of the poorest in the rural areas, for instance (as recommended in the 
preliminary conclusions of the International Conference on Biofuels held in S&#227;o Paulo from 
17 to 21 November 2008) by prioritizing the inclusion of small farmers in the production 
chains. That challenge &#8212; to ensure that agrofuels production shall not increase inequalities 
in rural areas &#8212; may be even more difficult to address than the challenges posed by 
compliance with environmental requirements and labour legislation. In Brazil, as 
elsewhere, there is a risk that crops for fuel will most often be grown by large agricultural 
producers or multinational companies that own or rent land for that purpose. Although, 
according to the 2009 National Commitment, 33 per cent of total production comes from 
&#8220;independent&#8221; sugar-cane producers, which include the 80,000 who produce less than 
10,000 tons, the pace of mergers and acquisitions has increased significantly in recent 
years, leading to fears that production will be increasingly concentrated and that the trickle-
down impacts on rural poverty will be less important.41 
</p>
<p>49. Partly in order to develop agrofuels that are more inclusive of family farming, Brazil 
most recently sought to encourage biodiesel production by establishing a national 
programme for biodiesel production and use that aimed at increasing production in a 
sustainable, socially inclusive manner by ensuring the use of different oilseeds well-adapted 
to different regions: castor, soybean, African palm, sunflower, babassu palm, peanut and 
<i>Jathropa curcas</i>. The programme includes measures for funding and establishing a &#8220;social 
fuel&#8221; seal (held by 93 per cent of biodiesel producers in December 2009) that rewards 
producers for purchasing raw materials from family agriculture with significant federal tax 
exemptions (from 68 to 100 per cent for producers in the northern region that buy palm oil 
from family farms or producers in the north-east and in the semi-arid region that buy castor 
oil from family farms), and more favourable credit from the national development bank and 
PRONAF. Concerns remain, however, as to how effective this policy has been so far, given 
that an estimated 76 per cent of the oilseeds still come from agribusiness and that between 
75 and 90 per cent of the oilseeds are soy beans which are largely produced in a monocrop 
basis, by large agricultural establishments.42 These establishments employ as few as 18 
workers per 1,000 ha; more than 90 per cent use pesticides, chemical fertilizers and 
mechanization; and as many as 46 per cent use GMO seeds.43 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Citizens&#8217; Territory Programme 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Citizen&#8217;s Territory Programme is an inter-ministerial initiative coordinated by 
the Ministry of Agrarian Development and implemented by 22 ministries, deploying 
roughly 200 policies in those territories found to have the lowest human development in the 
country. The programme originally focused on 60 areas and has now been extended to a 
total of 120 territories, with a current budget of R$ 25 billion, or roughly US$ 14 billion.

<p>These areas include 62 per cent of the low-income municipalities in Brazil, cover 52 per 
cent of the national territory and 24 per cent of its population, including more than half of 
the indigenous population and two-thirds of the Quilombola population. By combining 
multiple policies simultaneously in persistently poor regions, the Government expects to 
accelerate their development and make them converge with the national averages. This 
strategy constitutes a welcome recognition of the fact that only policies that target the most 
vulnerable have a chance of succeeding. At the same time, geographical coverage of certain 
regions cannot be a substitute for targeting the poorest households in the relatively 
wealthier areas. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends Brazil for its remarkable progress in the 
realization of the right to food since 2002. It has achieved significant results in 
reducing malnutrition and poverty by setting up food security laws and institutions 
that promote the right to food; by creating and subsequently scaling up &#8220;Zero 
Hunger&#8221; programmes; and by providing noteworthy support for family farming. 
However, major challenges remain. The Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Brazil should strengthen the protection of the right to food by the 
establishment of an independent national institution for the promotion and protection 
of human rights, in accordance with the Paris Principles, as it committed itself to do 
under the universal periodic review process;</b>44<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The National Food and Nutritional Security System (SISAN) should be 
further strengthened by the adoption of a national strategy for the realization of the 
right to food, establishing clear benchmarks with associated time frames, identifying 
responsibilities across different branches of Government, and ensuring an adequate 
monitoring of the objectives set; 
 (c) The capacity of the Federal Public Ministry should be strengthened, 
allowing it to make greater proactive use of the constitutional guarantees to ensure the 
realization of the right to food; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure that, in the 
process of regularization of land in the Amazon region and elsewhere, due 
consideration be given to the rights of indigenous peoples and other traditional 
communities. The National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) must be given the means to 
effectively carry out its tasks related to demarcation issues and guaranteeing access to 
other State programmes, including those of the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy. Moreover, he 
invites the Government to include in its regularization process a strong commitment 
to reducing land concentration and ensuring an effective and sustainable occupation 
pattern for the region, making sure that environmental, market-access and other 
considerations guide the titling of land. With respect to <i>grilagem</i>, the Special 
Rapporteur invites the Government to pursue all necessary measures to ensure that 
land registration throughout the country produces a single, clear and consolidated 
land-ownership framework, under which land ownership is accompanied by the 
responsibility to fulfil the social function of property, pay corresponding taxes and 
preserve the &#8220;legal reserve&#8221; within each establishment. The Government should 
accelerate the constitutionally mandated land demarcations for the indigenous,

</p>
<p><b>Quilombola and other traditional communities and, in the interim, better protect 
these communities from <i>grilagem</i>. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The authorities should systematically perform ex ante impact 
assessments on the right to food when engaging in large-scale infrastructural projects, 
such as dams, with the participation of the communities affected. They should ensure 
that no eviction takes place which would not comply with the existing relevant 
international standards, particularly general comment No. 7 of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to adequate housing (art. 11, para. 
1): forced evictions</b>45<b> and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based 
Evictions and Displacement presented in 2007 by the former Special Rapporteur on 
the right to adequate housing;</b>46<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Legitimate social protest should not be criminalized. The State, at 
federal, state and municipal levels, should take all measures necessary to ensure that 
legitimate forms of protest enjoy the protections afforded by international human 
rights standards. Restrictions to activities deemed illegal should be based on the rule 
of law and be strictly proportionate to the public goal pursued. A strong civil society 
and strong civil movements are key assets for a comprehensive approach to combating 
hunger in Brazil. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Social policies of the &#8220;Zero Hunger&#8221; strategy could be further 
consolidated by: (1) being institutionalized under a single, unifying legislative 
framework; (2) ensuring that the local-level authorities have the required capacity to 
deliver, which requires adequate training and monitoring; (3) ensuring that 
beneficiaries are clearly informed about their rights under the existing programmes, 
including their right to claim mechanisms; (4) ensuring that the administrations 
competent for indigenous communities and Quilombolas (including but not limited to 
FUNAI) have officers travelling to the communities concerned, in order to assist them 
in complying with the necessary formalities; (5) ensuring that indigenous communities 
and Quilombolas are systematically represented in the administrations concerned and 
receive adequate support to ensure the effectiveness of such participation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Brazil should review the structure of its existing public revenues and 
public spending in order to ensure that the progressive realization of the right to food 
is pursued through the maximum use of its available resources. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, only a tax reform that would reverse the current regressive nature 
of taxation would enable Brazil to make such a claim; and it would enable even 
greater progress in the fight against hunger. The Special Rapporteur also encourages 
Brazil to earmark a portion of the revenues from the pre-salt field for the &#8220;Zero 
Hunger&#8221; strategy by including the right to food among the social objectives to be 
pursued by the Pre-Salt Social Fund. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Government should pursue and scale up the strategy to ensure a 
more equitable redistribution of land, in accordance with the Voluntary Guidelines to 
support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of 
national food security. He urges the Government of Brazil to review the obstacles to 
the acceleration of the land redistribution process. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) The Special Rapporteur calls for a participatory assessment to be 
performed, in order to guide the choices made by the Government of Brazil relative to 
the support it provides to different forms of agriculture (large-scale and small-scale

<p><b>family farming), including through research. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to further increase its support to family agriculture by: (1) ensuring that 
such support reaches the poorest farmers, who should be assisted in overcoming 
existing barriers; (2) devoting the necessary means to ensure the rapid 
implementation of Act No. 11,947 of 16 June 2009 which provides that a minimum of 
30 per cent of all food acquired for the school feeding programmes should be sourced 
from family farms.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) The pursuit of access to foreign markets and the greater degree of 
openness of the domestic market to trade must be accompanied by serious 
consideration of the effects &#8212; economic, social and environmental &#8212; on different 
groups within the country and on the sustainability of the process seen in its entirety. 
In order to ensure that the promotion of export-led agriculture is not done at the 
expense of smallholders, Brazil should continue to promote family agriculture and 
ensure that it is afforded the support required to face the challenges of an eventual 
greater liberalization of agricultural trade, including by the promotion of cooperatives 
to increase scale economies and better adapt to certification and standardization 
procedures required by exacting import markets. The Government could study the 
possibility of using the Brazilian Export and Investment Promotion Agency as a 
coordination platform to develop actions to ensure the gradual integration of small-
scale farmers and their cooperatives in export-oriented projects, as it is actively doing 
with organic farmers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Brazil could lead by example in conducting a comprehensive 
participative right to food impact assessment in order to assess the overall and 
distributional effects of increased agricultural trade. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Brazil could step up its efforts to monitor compliance with social and 
environmental requirements in the sugar-cane plantations. It could set up task forces 
comprising members of the labour inspectorate, the Ministry of the Environment and 
the Federal Public Ministry, supported by the federal police, to make unannounced 
visits in plantations in order to verify compliance with these requirements and impose 
dissuasive penalties in cases of non-compliance, including expropriation without 
compensation. Brazil could also take the lead in establishing integrated social and 
environmental certification procedures, with a view to reducing inequalities of 
incomes in rural areas by using the ethanol production chain as a tool for human 
development. Public loans could be made conditional upon successful completion of ex 
ante impact assessments based upon these standards. The integration of food and 
energy production should be encouraged at the local level, which would mean that the 
current sugar-cane zoning initiative should be complemented by a microbiome zoning 
(maximum percentage of sugar cane on a given area in the regions where it is 
authorized).
