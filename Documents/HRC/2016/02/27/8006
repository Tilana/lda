<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth 
session from 22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Pakistan was held at the 11th 
meeting, on 30 October 2012. The delegation of Pakistan was headed by Hina Rabbani 
Khar, Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 17th meeting, held on 2 November 2012, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Pakistan: Chile, China and Congo. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review 
of Pakistan: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/PAK/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/PAK/2 and Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/PAK/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Pakistan through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister reminded the Working Group that Pakistan was a founding member of 
the Human Rights Council and during its prior tenure on the Human Rights Council, from 
2006-2011, it played an active role in its work and a constructive role in building 
convergences between the West and the Islamic world on the most contentious and 
challenging issues in the Council. Pakistan welcomed the engagement with the international 
community through an open and constructive dialogue on its human rights record and took 
this review exercise as an important opportunity to share with the international community 
the efforts that it is making for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Minister stated that the UPR had been a catalyst for Pakistan to bring positive 
changes in legislation, policy and practice. Following the completion of its first UPR, a 
process of consultation and dissemination of information was launched. Recommendations 
that were accepted in 2008 were shared with the relevant Government departments for 
follow-up. 
</p>
<p>7. The Minister underlined that Pakistan was a democratic, pluralistic and progressive 
State in the comity of nations. Pakistanis aspire to a society based on equality, the rule of 
law, respect for diversity, and justice. Pakistan&#8217;s Constitution reflected all these aspirations 
and Pakistan was committed to fulfilling these aspirations despite numerous challenges and </p>


<p>setbacks faced in its 65-year history. Following restoration of democracy in 2008, Pakistan 
had taken a number of steps to restore the democratic nature of State institutions. 
</p>
<p>8. The Minister highlighted that Pakistan was a functional democracy with an elected 
and sovereign parliament, an independent judiciary, a free media and a vibrant and robust 
civil society. The media, besides aggressively monitoring Government policies, worked 
zealously to raise awareness among the people of their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. Civil society played a key role in fostering a culture of accountability and 
transparency and assisted in changing societal attitudes. Similarly, an independent judiciary 
and legal community had taken wide-ranging steps to uphold the rule of law and ensure the 
protection of constitutional rights of all citizens. 
</p>
<p>9. The Minister stated that the human rights record of any country could not be 
assessed in a vacuum as one needs to study the situation on the ground in its proper context. 
The reporting period (2008 to 2012) had been one of the most challenging in recent. 
Pakistan continued to face enormous challenges on different fronts, ranging from security 
and terrorism to the economy, apart from natural calamities. 
</p>
<p>10. The Minister said that during the last four years, there had been transformational 
changes in Pakistan&#8217;s constitutional and legislative framework. Parliament had passed three 
constitutional amendments as part of an overarching compact between the country&#8217;s major 
political parties to engender long-term democratic values in the country, after the trauma of 
repeated military interventions. The right to education, the right to information and the right 
to a fair trial were now recognized as fundamental rights, which could not be suspended. 
The restored federal system empowered the provinces, and invested much more richly in 
the notion of the democratic significance of the State&#8217;s ability to engage with the grassroots. 
</p>
<p>11. The Minister highlighted that the years 2008 to 2012 had been the most active 
period of legislating on human rights in the history of Pakistan. A number of bills were 
passed by the Parliament to strengthen human rights in the country, including more than 
half a dozen laws for the promotion of women&#8217;s rights. In May 2012, Pakistan enacted a 
new law creating an independent National Commission for Human Rights in accordance 
with Paris Principles. Moreover, some long overdue changes were made to administrative 
governance in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Following amendments to 
the colonial-era Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) in 2011, the arbitrary powers of the 
local administration to make arrests and detain individuals were curtailed and prisoners 
given the right to bail. Furthermore, in 2011 the Political Parties Order 2002 was extended 
to FATA. 
</p>
<p>12. The Minister stated that, since the last review, Pakistan had ratified a number of 
international human rights instruments including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture (CAT) and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Pakistan had now ratified seven out of nine 
core international human rights treaties and was focused on implementing these instruments 
at the national level. An inter-ministerial process had been set up to coordinate 
implementation and to prepare reports for the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>13. The Minister stated that in the spirit of dialogue, Pakistan extended invitations to a 
number of special procedures of the Human Rights Council to visit Pakistan. The High 
Commissioner visited Pakistan in June 2012 at the invitation of the Government. The visit 
provided her an opportunity to observe first-hand the wide-ranging measures taken by 
Pakistan in promotion and protection of human rights. The Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers visited Pakistan from 19 to 29 May 2012, while the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances visited Pakistan from 10 to 20 
September 2012. Pakistan has also extended an invitation to Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. </p>


<p>14. The Minister stressed that in the past 10 years; terrorism and extremism have 
endangered national security and the social fabric and violated the human rights of citizens. 
Pakistan has made extraordinary efforts and sacrifices to eradicate the scourge of terrorism 
and build a peaceful and stable region. No country and no people had suffered more in the 
epic struggle against terrorism than Pakistan. To date Pakistan had lost nearly 7,000 
soldiers and policemen, and over 40,000 people in total. The total cost of this struggle to 
Pakistan&#8217;s economy over the last decade had been nearly US$ 70 billion. Despite these 
barbaric acts and gigantic losses, Pakistan&#8217;s commitment and resolve to combat the scourge 
</p>
<p>of terrorism remained unwavering. 
</p>
<p>15. The Minister stressed that drone strikes and resulting civilian casualties were 
counter-productive, against international law and a violation of Pakistan&#8217;s sovereignty. She  
urged the Council to discuss comprehensively the human rights challenges linked to the 
drone strikes. 
</p>
<p>16. The Minister said that Pakistan&#8217;s counter-terrorism response was in compliance with 
the obligations under international law. Counter-terrorism operations were conducted on 
specific intelligence with all precautions to avoid civilian causalities. Any complaints 
against law enforcement officials were taken seriously by their respective departments, 
Parliament and the courts. 
</p>
<p>17. The Minister stated that for centuries Pakistan hosted various religions whose 
followers had lived in peace and harmony. She said that the minorities were an integral part 
of Pakistani society and had played an important role in the development, peace and 
prosperity of the country. The Constitution guaranteed the rights of minorities to freely 
profess their religion and visit their places of worship. Extremists were targeting the vast 
majority of Muslims who were moderate and did not subscribe to their extremist agenda. In 
this connection, Pakistan had lost many bold voices advocating tolerance and respect. 
</p>
<p>18. The Minister stated that Pakistan attached importance to the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Following the restoration of 
democracy in 2008, all curbs against the media were lifted. Over 100 television channels 
and many more radio stations and newspapers regularly highlighted political, social and 
human rights issues and led the national debate on issues of public importance. 
</p>
<p>19. The Minister said that Pakistan hosted one of the world&#8217;s largest refugee 
populations, of over 3 million people, for more than 30 years. Despite drastic reduction in 
international assistance, Pakistan continued to host the refugees in the spirit of traditional 
hospitality. 
</p>
<p>20. The massive floods and rains of 2010 and 2011 caused dislocation of 2.6 million 
people. Extremist threats and the ensuing law-enforcement action in Swat and parts of 
FATA also resulted in dislocation of a section of the local population. The National 
Disaster Management Authority and the Provincial Disaster Management authorities  
established to provide emergency assistance and relief during natural calamities have fully 
integrated human rights and gender-sensitive training in their activities. 
</p>
<p>21. The catastrophic floods affected around 20 million people and caused immense 
damage to infrastructure. Energy shortfall also increased exponentially in the last few years. 
These developments adversely impacted the economic strength of the country, its ability to 
finance projects in the social sector and had slowed Pakistan&#8217;s progress in achieving 
MDGs. 
</p>
<p>22. The Minister reported that, despite economic constraints, efforts have been made to 
improve social-economic conditions of the citizens. In the 18th Amendment to the 
Constitution of Pakistan, the subjects of health, education, housing, social welfare, 
women&#8217;s development, local government, and water and sanitation have been devolved to </p>


<p>the provinces. Under the new formula, provinces will receive 57 per cent of federal 
resources. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2008, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was introduced to 
supplement the existing network and to provide immediate relief to low-income families 
enabling them to absorb the shock of rising prices of food and fuel. Since then, BISP had  
evolved into the country&#8217;s main social safety net and benefitted more than 6 million 
</p>
<p>families and provides health and life insurance, micro-credit and technical and vocational 
training. Women are its prime beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p>24. On women&#8217;s rights the Minister reported that the Government had taken a number of 
legal, institutional and administrative initiatives for the advancement of women. This series 
of legislation included the Prevention of Anti-Women Practices (Criminal Law 
Amendment) Act 2011, the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill 2010, the 
Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill and laws on sexual harassment. 
Political and economic empowerment of women was among the top priorities, with 33 per 
cent seats reserved for women in local government, 17 per cent in the National Assembly 
and Provincial Assemblies and 12 per cent in the Senate. The Government had also 
reserved 10 per cent quota for women in Central Superior Services across the board in the 
public sector.

</p>
<p>71. The Adviser on National Harmony stated that everyone was free to practise their 
faith and religion, as stated by the founder of Pakistan. He said that there was no organized 
intolerance toward religious minorities in Pakistan. Most cases of excess against members 
of minority communities were on account of personal animosities. He said that any 
violation of the rights of minorities had always been condemned by religious and political 
leaders. The Adviser said that the extremists were targeting not just the minorities but also 
the vast majority of Muslims who were moderate and did not subscribe to their extremist 
agenda. 
</p>
<p>72. On the issue of blasphemy, the Adviser said that there was a misunderstanding that 
this law was used to target only minorities. The majority of cases registered under this 
section had been against Muslims. The Government had taken measures to prevent possible 
misuse or abuse of the blasphemy law. An independent judiciary, free media and vibrant 
civil society also provided an effective safeguard against any misuse of the blasphemy law. 
</p>
<p>73. The Chairman, National Assembly Standing Committee on Human Rights, said that 
Pakistan strongly believed in the freedom of the press. Journalists were often targeted by 
extremists and terrorists and faced hurdles in performing their functions due to the very 
nature of their work. However, all cases of intimidation got immediate media attention and 
were duly addressed by the Government, the Parliament and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>74. A delegation member said that poverty was a daunting challenge as it posed a major 
hurdle in the realization of the people&#8217;s potential. Pakistan had a fairly elaborate network of 
direct and indirect social-protection mechanisms that included employment-based 
guarantees, direct transfers and market-based interventions. 
</p>
<p>75. Pakistan had made efforts to create an enabling environment for the elimination of 
child labour through raising awareness among stakeholders and the masses, improvement in 
legislation, mobilizing resources for child-labour programmes and institution-building. 
Child Labour Units have been established at the federal and provincial levels to exclusively 
run and monitor child labour programmes throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>76. Egypt noted the recent constitutional amendment and welcomed the establishment of 
a human rights commission, and measures to strengthen the National Commission on Status 
of Women. It enquired about the incorporation of ratified international human rights 
treaties. It shared concerns over impacts of extremism and intolerance. Egypt made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. France welcomed the moratorium on executions, the adoption of legislation 
strengthening women&#8217;s rights and the visit undertaken by the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Disappearances. It remained concerned about persistent enforced disappearances, acts of 
religious intolerance, child labour and violence against women and girls. France made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>78. Germany was concerned about the remaining challenges in improving Pakistan&#8217;s 
human rights situation, including protecting religious minorities and other excluded groups.

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Hungary welcomed the Government&#8217;s strong stand against the brutal attack on
