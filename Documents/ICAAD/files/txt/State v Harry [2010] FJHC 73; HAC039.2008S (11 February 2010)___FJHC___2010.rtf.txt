JUDGMENT

1.      
Following a trial lasting two days, the three assessors have returned with an unanimous verdict of guilty as charged of "robbery with violence".

2.      
I have reviewed the evidence called in this trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. Obviously, they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, was part of a group of youths that, violently robbed Anup Prasad of properties worth a total of $1,200, at Kinoya bus stop, on 18th January, 2008. It was open to them to reach such conclusion, on the evidence. In my view, their decision was not perverse.

3.      
I accept the decision of the three assessors, and I find the accused guilty as charged. I convict him accordingly.
