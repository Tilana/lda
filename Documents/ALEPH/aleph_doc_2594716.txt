FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED June 30, 2016 AND 2015
 (Unaudited)
(Stated in U.S. Dollars)
 
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
 
Organization and Nature of Operations
 
Lode-Star Mining Inc. (formerly International Gold Corp.) (“the Company”) was incorporated in the
State of Nevada, U.S.A., on December 9, 2004.  The Company’s principal executive offices are
located in Cypress, Texas.  The Company was originally formed for the purpose of acquiring
exploration stage natural resource properties. The Company acquired a mineral property interest
from Lode Star Gold Inc., a private Nevada corporation (“LSG”) on December 11, 2014 (See Note
3) in consideration for the issuance of 35,000,000 common shares of the Company. As a result of
this transaction, control of the Company was acquired by LSG.
 
On May 12, 2015, International Gold Corp. completed a merger with its wholly owned subsidiary,
Lode-Star Mining Inc., and formally assumed the subsidiary’s name by filing Articles of Merger
with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Name Change”).  The subsidiary was incorporated
entirely for the purpose of effecting the Name Change and the merger did not affect the
Company’s corporate structure in any other way.
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will
continue as a going concern.
 
The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to establish a business and to obtain
new financing to execute a business plan. As shown in the accompanying financial statements,
the Company has incurred accumulated losses of $1,560,145 for the period from December 9,
2004 (inception) to June 30, 2016, and has had no revenue.  There is no assurance that
management’s plans to seek additional capital through private placements of its common stock
will be realized, and these factors cast substantial doubt upon the use of the going concern
assumption. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The unaudited financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments which, in the
opinion of management, are necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position and the
results of its operations for the periods presented.  These first quarter financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company assumes
that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited
financial statements for the preceding fiscal year, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure
needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context.  Accordingly, footnote
disclosure which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the Company’s
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, has been omitted.  The results
of operations for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
results for the entire year ending December 31, 2016.
 
Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation
 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
These reclassifications on the interim statement of cash flows for the six months ended June 30,
2015 had no effect on the reported results of operations. Expenses paid by a related party on
behalf of the Company were removed from the net amount of loan advances and from the change
in accounts payable, and are shown as a Non-cash Financing Activity. The foreign exchange
gain component of the change in loan balances was removed and shown as an adjustment to
reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities. Accrued interest that was exchanged
for shares to be issued was removed from the decrease in accrued liabilities and from the net
amount of loan advances. The amount is included in Non-cash Financing Activity, as part of
Common shares issued for debt settlements. The remaining net amount of loan advances was
separated into repayments of loans payable to non-related parties, and loan proceeds from
related parties. These changes in classification decreased the amount previously reported as
Cash Used In Operating Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from $145,621 to
$104,451. Offsetting that change, the amount previously reported for the 2015 period as Cash
Provided By Financing Activities decreased from $139,776 to $98,606.

2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  Because a precise determination
of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial
statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using
careful judgment.  All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. The financial
statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of
materiality.
 
The Company has implemented all applicable new accounting pronouncements that are in
effect. Those pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.
 
3. MINERAL PROPERTY INTEREST
 
Given that permitting for operations on the Property is still to be completed, at the request of the
Company’s management, LSG granted, by a letter of agreement dated June 15, 2016, a
deferment to January 18, 2017 of payments totaling $173,901 otherwise due at June 30, 2016 in
accordance with the Mineral Option Agreement between the parties dated October 4, 2014.
The Company assessed its mineral property interest at June 30, 2016 and to the date of these
financial statements and concluded that facts and circumstances do not suggest that the mineral
property interest’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount and therefore no impairment is
required.
 
4. CAPITAL STOCK
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the
Company did not receive any cash subscriptions for shares of its common stock. No preferred
shares have been issued to the date of issue of these financial statements.

ITEM
2. 
 
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following
discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and
our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking
statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project
and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not
place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this
report. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States,
we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to
actual results 
 
History – Mineral Property Interest
 
On August 29, 2014, we entered into a Letter of Intent (the “LSG LOI”) with Lode-Star Gold, Inc.
(“LSG"), a private Nevada corporation, pursuant to which we agreed to issue shares of our
common stock and make certain payments to LSG in consideration for the acquisition of an
interest in LSG's Nevada Goldfield Bonanza property (the “Property”). As a result of the intended
transaction, control of us would be acquired by LSG.
 
On October 4, 2014, we entered into a definitive mineral option agreement (the "Option
Agreement") which superseded the LSG LOI. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we were to
issue LSG 35,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for a 20% undivided interest in
the Property (the “Acquisition”). In order to earn an additional 60% undivided interest in the
Property (for a total of 80%), we are required to fund all expenditures on the Property and pay
LSG an aggregate of $5 million in cash in the form of a net smelter returns ("NSR") royalty, each
beginning on the closing date of a subscription agreement for the shares (the “Closing Date”).
Until such time as ITGC has earned the additional 60% interest, the NSR royalty will be split as
to 79.2% to LSG, 19.8% to and 1% to the former Property owner.
 
On December 5, 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”)
with LSG pursuant to which we agreed to issue the 35,000,000 shares. On the Closing Date of
December 11, 2014, we satisfied all the closing conditions in the Subscription Agreement and
issued the 35,000,000 shares of our common stock to LSG, thereby completing the Acquisition.
As a result of the Acquisition, LSG became our controlling stockholder.
 
If we fail to make any cash payments to LSG within one year of the Effective Date of the Mineral
Option Agreement (October 4, 2014), we are required to pay LSG an additional $100,000, and in
any subsequent years in which we fail to complete the payment of the entire $5 million described
above, we must make quarterly cash payments to LSG of $25,000 until such time as we have
earned the additional 60% interest in the Property.
 
The Property is located in west-central Nevada, in the Goldfield Mining District at Latitude 37°
42’, and Longitude 117° 14’.  The claims comprising the Property are located in surveyed
sections 35 and 36, Township 2 South, Range 42 East, and in sections 1, 2, 11, and 12,
Township 3 South, Range 42 East, in Esmeralda County, Nevada.  The Property is accessible
by traveling approximately one-half mile northeast of the community of Goldfield, along a county-
maintained road that originates at U.S. Highway 95, which runs through “downtown”
Goldfield.  The town of Goldfield, which is the Esmeralda county seat (population 300), is
approximately 200 air miles south of Reno and 180 air miles north of Las Vegas.
 
The Property consists of 31 patented claims and 1 unpatented millsite claim, covering a total of
approximately 460 acres, or 186 hectares.  Only the single unpatented claim is administered by
the United States Bureau of Land Management, and annual assessment filings and payments
are due on it.  The patented claims are owned as private land by LSG, and only annual property
taxes must be paid.
 
The Option Agreement provides that we will act as the operator on the Property and that a
management committee will be formed, comprised of representatives from us and LSG, with
voting based on each party’s proportionate interest, to supervise exploration of the Property and
approve work programs and budgets.  As the operator, we are also obliged to perform a number
of functions, including the following:
 
■
Consider, develop and submit work programs to the management committee for consideration
and approval, and to implement work programs when approved;
■
Carry out operations in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable
laws and regulations, and all agreements, permits and licenses relating to the Property and LSG;
■
Pay and discharge all wages and accounts for material and services and all other costs and
expenses that may be incurred by us in connection with our operations on the property;
■
Maintain and keep in force and, upon request by LSG provide reasonable documentary
verification of, levels of insurance as are reasonable in respect of our activities in connection with
the Property;
 
 
10
 
 
ITEM
2. 
 
■
Maintain true and correct books, accounts and records of expenditures; and
■
Deliver to the management committee quarterly and annual progress reports.
 
To the issuance date of this report, no work programs have been approved and LSG has borne
all costs in connection with operations on the Property. We expect the first work program,
entailing Property-related costs for which we will be responsible, to be approved later this year.
 
Recent Developments
 
Given that permitting for operations on the Property is still to be completed, at the request of our
management, LSG granted, by a letter of agreement dated June 15, 2016, a deferment to January
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
18, 2017 of payments totaling $173,901 otherwise due at June 30, 2016 in accordance with the
Option Agreement.
 
On April 21, 2016, we announced the completion of two water monitoring holes required by the
Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP). The two wells were then sampled and
as of July 22, 2016, we completed our second of two water samplings as required by the NDEP.
That second set of samples has been sent to a testing lab for processing. Once the lab results
come back, we will complete and file our permit application.
 
Personnel
 
We have no employees. Our president and CEO, Mark Walmesley, receives no compensation for
his services. We expect to continue to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and
accountants as necessary.
 
Our Chief Operating Officer, Thomas Temkin, who is also a director, is a Certified Professional
Geologist and a Qualified Person under National Instrument (NI) 43101, with more than 38 years
of experience in the mining industry, primarily in exploration in the Western United States. He is
currently a consulting geologist working with LSG. Mr. Temkin has been associated with LSG
and the Property for over 15 years and has been instrumental through its entire exploration
program to date.
 
Our Corporate Secretary, Pam Walters, has been associated with the mining industry for over 25
years and has managed the corporate finance and business operations of LSG and its owners.
 
LSG’s History
 
LSG was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 1998 for the purpose of acquiring
exploration stage mineral properties.  It currently has one shareholder, Lonnie Humphries, who is
the spouse of Mark Walmesley, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and director prior to the
completion of the Acquisition, and now our President and Chief Executive Officer as well.  Mr.
Walmesley is also the Director of Operations and a director of LSG.
 
LSG is an exploration stage company and has not generated any revenues since its
inception.  The Property represents its only material asset. LSG acquired the leases to the
Property in 1997 and became the registered and beneficial owner of the Property on September
19, 2009.  Since the earlier of those dates, it has conducted contract exploration work on the
Property resulting in the identification of several high grade gold zones. This gold mineralization
has not been determined to be resource NI 43-101 compliant.
 
Plan of Operations
 
We anticipate that we will require approximately $2 million to pursue our plan of operations over
the next 12 months, as detailed in our previous quarterly filing.
 
Our primary focus is currently on the mine permitting process. We have retained the following
specialists in underground permitting of narrow vein, high sulphide mines to assist in executing
that permitting process:
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)
· Rubicon Environmental Consulting to act as the lead consultant
· Hydrogeologica Inc. to consult on water and geology
· Tierra Group International to consult on mine planning and engineering
 
Unique to our permitting is the proposed underground area of work named the Red Hills Stope
Zone. It is 150 feet above the 450 foot deep water table, making the mine essentially a dry mine.
 
 
11
 
 
ITEM
2. 
 
The mine’s 300 foot level workings has pockets of unused volume where our potentially acid
generating waste rock can be stored. This means no waste rock will come to the surface and
LSM will avoid, for the short-term, the expense of having to build and maintain a surface storage
facility.
 
We are hopeful that the two aforementioned mitigating circumstances will make our permitting
process more rapid and therefore, the costs of execution and infrastructure improvements will be
kept at a minimum.
 
Permitting costs are anticipated as follows:
 
Rubicon
$40,000
Hydrogeologica$135,000
Tierra
$75,000

Funding
 
We do not currently have sufficient funds to carry out our entire plan of operations, so we intend
to meet the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of
debt financing and equity financing through private placements.  Currently we are active in
contacting broker/dealers regarding possible financing arrangements; however, we do not
currently have any arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and
there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings.  
 
If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising efforts, we may
review other financing options, although we cannot provide any assurance that any such options
will be available to us or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. Further, if we are unable to
secure any additional financing then we plan to reduce the amount that we spend on our
operations, including our management-related consulting fees and other general expenses, so
as not to exceed the capital resources available to us. Regardless, our current cash reserves and
working capital will not be sufficient for us to sustain our business for the next 12 months, even if
$250,000
we decide to scale back our operations.
 
Going Concern
 
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that
we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional
capital to pay our expenses. This is because we have not generated any revenues to date and
we cannot currently estimate the timing of any possible future revenues. Our only source for cash
at this time is investments by others in our common stock, or loans.

■
Consulting services – Consulting costs for the first six months of 2015 were reallocated from IT
(in Office, foreign exchange and sundry) to Consulting in Q2 of that year. As a result, Consulting
services in Q2 of 2015 reflects six months of that expense compared to three months being
reflected in Q2 of 2016. The year to date Consulting services amounts are relatively equal in
2016 and 2015, with a minor variation due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
■
Mineral option fees were incurred in Q2 2016, but not in Q2 2015, under the terms of our Mineral
Option Agreement with LSG. They first became due in Q4 of 2015.
■
Office, foreign exchange and sundry was higher in 2016 primarily due to the reallocation
described above from Office, foreign exchange and sundry to Consulting services expense in Q2
of 2015.
■
Professional fees were lower in 2016 primarily due to non-recurring 2015 legal fees and 2016
fees from the previous auditor decreasing as a result of the handover of services.
■
Transfer and filing fees were higher in 2015 primarily due to two factors: The $10,000 annual fee
for the OTC Markets was first charged in the second quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of
2016, and a non-recurring fee to the Depository Trust Corporation of $8,000 was also incurred in
Q2 of 2015.
■
Interest, bank and finance charges were higher in 2016 mainly due to increased loan amounts.
Interest-bearing loan balances totaled approximately $340,000 at June 30, 2015 compared to
$533,000 at June 30, 2016.
■
Penalties consists of an amount charged by the IRS for 2012 for failure to file Forms 5472 by the
due date of our income tax return for that year, which has now been reversed in the current
quarter. The IRS notified us on May 30, 2016 that the penalty was waived. The outcome of our
appeal for an identical penalty for tax year 2013 is not determinable at this time.

$10,000 for 2015 professional fees.
■
Due to related parties increased as a result of new loan amounts totaling approximately $47,000
and new accrued interest of approximately $10,000, together with expenses paid by related
parties on our behalf totaling approximately 38,000, plus accrued Mineral option fees of
approximately $50,000.

Loans payable decreased due to a loan repayment of $10,000, offset by new accrued interest of
approximately $3,000.

The decrease in our working capital from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 was primarily due
to the increase in amounts due to related parties of approximately $145,000 plus the accrual of
approximately $20,000 for an IRS penalty for tax year 2013, offset by the decrease in loans
payable of approximately $7,000 and by payments totaling approximately $10,000 for 2015
professional fees.

 Net increase (decrease) in cash  $665 
 
Cash Used In Operating Activities
 The period over period decrease in cash used in operating activities of approximately $70,000
was mainly due to the following:
An increase in net loss for the period of approximately $50,000, offset by:
1.
A change of approximately $4,000 from a foreign exchange gain in 2015 to a loss in 2016;
2.
Accrued Mineral option fees of approximately $50,000 in Q2 of 2016, with none in Q2 of 2015
3.
A difference of approximately $62,000 in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
partly due to an increase in expenses paid by a related party on our behalf; and
4.
A difference of approximately $5,000 in the change in accrued interest, as interest-bearing loan
balances increased.
 
Cash Provided By Financing Activities
The approximately $64,000 decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due to related
party loan advances in 2016 being lower than those in 2015 by approximately $58,000, plus
repayment of loans payable that were higher by $6,000 in 2016 than in 2015.
 
As of the date of this quarterly report, we have yet to generate any revenues from our business
operations. Our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs is entirely
dependent on the issuance of shares or loans.
 
Our principal source of working capital has been in the form of loans and subscriptions for our
common stock. For the foreseeable future, we will have to continue to rely on those sources for
funding. We have no assurance that we can successfully engage in any further private sales of
our securities or that we can obtain any additional loans.
  
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
 
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
 
 
 
 
 
14
 
 
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the
Exchange Act. Based on this Evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer concluded that our Disclosure Controls were not effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report.
 
Subsequent to that date, but prior to the completion of our financial statements for the period
ended June 30, 2016, we determined that certain fees due under the terms of an agreement with
our majority shareholder had not been accrued at December 31, 2015 or March 31, 2016, and
would similarly need to be accrued at June 30, 2016. On review, we concluded that the amounts
were material and that the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the
quarter ended March 31, 2016 should be restated. Given that this determination was made after
June 30, 2016, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting
were not adequate as of June 30, 2016.
 
In order to address the weakness in Disclosure Controls and Procedures, the Company has
adopted, with immediate effect, a procedure to list and review all contract obligations at the end
of each reporting period, specifically with regard to possible liabilities to be accrued, with a formal
sign-off on the conclusions of the review being required by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, and the Company’s primary accounting personnel.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
 
The procedure described above that has been implemented by the Company starting in August,
2016 in order to address the weakness in disclosure controls and procedures existing at June 30,
2016 will impact on all financial reports to be filed going forward.
