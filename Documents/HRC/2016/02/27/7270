<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report contains an overview of the activities carried out by the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination during the period under review and 
</p>
<p>includes information on the sessions of the Working Group, communications and country 
</p>
<p>visits. 
</p>
<p> The report presents the findings of the Working Group&#8217;s ongoing global study of 
</p>
<p>national laws and regulations relating to private military and security companies. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group focuses on the laws and regulations of eight countries in Central America 
</p>
<p>and the Caribbean (Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, 
</p>
<p>Nicaragua and Panama), eight countries in South America (Argentina, Bolivia 
</p>
<p>(Plurinational State of), Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay) and four 
</p>
<p>countries in Europe (France, Hungary, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great 
</p>
<p>Britain and Northern Ireland). The Working Group&#8217;s global study aims to assess existing 
</p>
<p>national laws regarding private military and security companies and their effectiveness in 
</p>
<p>protecting human rights and promoting accountability for violations. Furthermore, it aims 
</p>
<p>to identify any commonalities, good practices and regulatory gaps that may exist. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes that, while there are common elements in the laws of 
</p>
<p>these countries, their regulatory approach to private military and security companies varies. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group reiterates the need to effectively regulate the activities of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies and invites all Member States to facilitate its study, which 
</p>
<p>aims to guide them in exercising effective oversight of the activities of such companies.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report covers the activities of the Working Group on the use of 
</p>
<p>mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of 
</p>
<p>peoples to self-determination since its previous report to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/50). In addition, it contains the results of the Working Group&#8217;s study on 
</p>
<p>national legislation concerning private military and security companies in Central America 
</p>
<p>and the Caribbean, South America and Europe.  
</p>
<p>2. The report is submitted pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 
</p>
<p>2005/2, which established the mandate of the Working Group, and Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 27/10, which further extended the mandate. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group comprises five independent experts: Patricia Arias (Chile), 
</p>
<p>Elzbieta Karska (Poland), Anton Katz (South Africa), Gabor Rona (United States of 
</p>
<p>America) and Saeed Mokbil (Yemen). During its twenty-third session, held in December 
</p>
<p>2014, Ms. Karska was elected Chair-Rapporteur for the period from January to December 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>4. A private military and security company is defined as &#8220;a corporate entity which 
</p>
<p>provides, on a compensatory basis, military and/or security services by physical persons 
</p>
<p>and/or legal entities&#8221;. Military services refer to &#8220;specialized services related to military 
</p>
<p>actions, including strategic planning, intelligence, investigation, land, sea or air 
</p>
<p>reconnaissance, flight operations of any type, manned or unmanned, satellite surveillance, 
</p>
<p>any kind of knowledge transfer with military applications, material and technical support to 
</p>
<p>armed forces and other related activities&#8221;. Security services refer to &#8220;armed guarding or 
</p>
<p>protection of buildings, installations, property and people, any kind of knowledge transfer 
</p>
<p>with security and policing applications, development and implementation of informational 
</p>
<p>security measures and other related activities&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p><b> A. Twenty-second to twenty-fourth sessions of the Working Group  
</b></p>
<p>5. From 1 July 2014 to 31 March 2015, the Working Group held three sessions. During 
</p>
<p>its twenty-second session, held in New York from 14 to 18 July 2014, it met with United 
</p>
<p>Nations officials to discuss the study on the use of private security companies by the 
</p>
<p>Organization, which was the basis of a Working Group report to the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>(A/69/338). It also held an expert meeting on a possible international legally binding 
</p>
<p>instrument on private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>6. At its twenty-third session, held in Geneva from 1 to 5 December 2014, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group held an expert meeting on foreign fighters and met with representatives of Member 
</p>
<p>States on country visits and issues concerning the mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. At its twenty-fourth session, held in Geneva from 2 to 6 March 2015, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group convened a second expert meeting on foreign fighters. It also considered a revised 
</p>
<p>draft convention on private military and security companies and a corresponding concept 
</p>
<p>paper.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Draft convention on private military and security companies (see A/HRC/15/25, annex).  </p>


<p><b> B. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since its last report to the Human Rights Council, the Working Group sent 
</p>
<p>communications jointly with other special procedures mandate holders to the World Bank 
</p>
<p>and to the Governments of Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.2
 
 
</p>
<p><b> C. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Working Group conducted an official visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 7 to 10 
</p>
<p>October 2014 (see A/HRC/30/34/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Information on individuals convicted of mercenary activities  
</b></p>
<p>10. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 21/8, requested the Working Group to 
</p>
<p>establish a database of individuals convicted of mercenary activities. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>sent a note verbale to all Member States on 22 January 2013, requesting information on 
</p>
<p>cases of mercenaries convicted by national courts. Reminders were sent on 6 March 2013. 
</p>
<p>No responses were received during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Other activities of Working Group members  
</b></p>
<p>11. From 5 to 6 November 2014, Ms. Karska was a panellist at a conference in Doha on 
</p>
<p>security and human rights. As Chair of the Working Group, she made a presentation at the 
</p>
<p>fourth session of the open-ended intergovernmental working group to consider the 
</p>
<p>possibility of elaborating an international framework to regulate, monitor and oversee the 
</p>
<p>activities of private military and security companies, held from 27 April to 1 May 2015. 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Arias participated in a seminar on private military and security companies in 
</p>
<p>Guatemala, held from 4 to 8 May 2015. 
</p>
<p>13. Mr. Gabor Rona made a presentation on the Working Group&#8217;s application of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights at a workshop on United Nations 
</p>
<p>guiding principles, post-conflict situations and fragile States, held at the University of 
</p>
<p>Nottingham, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on 20 and 21 May 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Mokbil met with senior officials of the Saudi counter-terrorism committee on 25 
</p>
<p>May 2015, in Riyadh. He also cooperated with the preparatory committee for the 
</p>
<p>international conference on the theme &#8220;Security and privacy versus terrorism&#8221;, to be held in 
</p>
<p>Venice, Italy, in September 2015. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Summaries of the communications will be included in a report to be submitted to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council at its thirtieth session. </p>


<p><b> III. Research on national legislation concerning private military 
and security companies  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Working Group continued its global study of national laws regarding private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies to assess their effectiveness in protecting human rights and 
</p>
<p>promoting accountability for violations. The study aims to identify any commonalities, 
</p>
<p>good practices and regulatory gaps that may exist. The present report focuses on the laws 
</p>
<p>and regulations of eight countries in Central America and the Caribbean (Costa Rica, Cuba, 
</p>
<p>El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama), eight countries in 
</p>
<p>South America (Argentina, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
</p>
<p>Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay) and four countries in Europe (France, Hungary, Switzerland 
</p>
<p>and the United Kingdom). In its 2014 report to the Human Rights Council, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group focused on eight francophone African States3 and eight Asian States 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/50);4 in its 2013 report, it focused on 13 Anglophone African States 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/24/45).5 In its next report to the Council, to be submitted in 2016, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group intends to focus on the national legislation of countries in Eastern Europe, the 
</p>
<p>Pacific and North America.  
</p>
<p>16. The Working Group hopes that its global study will result in guidance that will help 
</p>
<p>Member States to regulate the growing number of private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>The national laws on such companies in the present report were analysed using the 
</p>
<p>following elements: (a) scope of the legislation; (b) licensing, authorization and 
</p>
<p>registration; (c) selection and training of personnel; (d) permitted and prohibited activities; 
</p>
<p>(e) rules on the acquisition of weapons; (f) use of force and firearms; (g) accountability for 
</p>
<p>violations and remedies for victims; and (h) ratification of the International Convention 
</p>
<p>against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Analysis  
</b></p>
<p><b>Western Europe 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Scope of the legislation 
</i></p>
<p>17. France, Hungary, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have national legislation on 
</p>
<p>the private security industry. The United Kingdom, however, has only some provisions 
</p>
<p>related to licensing and authorization, and adopts a self-regulatory approach within the 
</p>
<p>framework of the British Association of Private Security Companies that covers such 
</p>
<p>aspects as financial sanctions, compulsory training courses, site inspections and the 
</p>
<p>suspension or withdrawal of membership rights.6 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3  Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Morocco, 
</p>
<p>Senegal and Tunisia. 
</p>
<p> 4  China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. 
 5  Botswana, Ghana, the Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South 
</p>
<p>Africa, Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p> 6  Kerry Alexander and Nigel White, &#8220;The regulatory context of private military and security services in 
</p>
<p>the UK&#8221;, (University of Sheffield, 30 June 2009), pp. 16-18.  </p>


<p>18. All four countries have national legislation covering the activities of private security 
</p>
<p>companies,7 including surveillance, the protection and guarding of persons and property or 
</p>
<p>goods, the transportation, protection and shipment of cash, jewels, precious metals and 
</p>
<p>other valuables, and the conduct of investigations. The regulation of the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>covers services provided by security consultants. In Switzerland, activities related to traffic 
</p>
<p>management, assistance to public authorities, the transport of detainees and private 
</p>
<p>detective services are also regulated.  
</p>
<p>19. In terms of geographical scope, legislation varies in range and content. The 
</p>
<p>legislation of France and Hungary does not have extraterritorial application.8 Swiss 
</p>
<p>legislation, however, covers not only the activities of local and private security companies9 
</p>
<p>but also the services provided by such companies hired locally or abroad by the 
</p>
<p>Government10 and by private security companies abroad as well.11 The legal system of the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom is based on the principle of territoriality, which means that individuals 
</p>
<p>cannot be prosecuted in the United Kingdom for crimes committed abroad (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/14/Add.2).  
</p>
<p><i>  Licensing, authorization and registration  
</i></p>
<p>20. In France and the United Kingdom, the entities that issue authorizations and licences 
</p>
<p>are appointed by or exist within the ministry responsible for internal security. In France, 
</p>
<p>that entity is the departmental prefect (or, in Paris, the police prefect),12 which is accredited 
</p>
<p>by the Council of State, whereas in the United Kingdom, the Security Industry Authority 
</p>
<p>issues licences for the domestic activities of security operatives.13 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding criteria for authorization, the laws of France and Hungary do not require 
</p>
<p>adherence with human rights standards. However, executives and employees who have 
</p>
<p>been convicted for a misdemeanour or a crime cannot be accredited. 
</p>
<p>22. In the law of United Kingdom, there is no reference to human rights standards. As 
</p>
<p>the Working Group noted in a 2008 report (A/HRC/10/14/Add.2), companies are chosen 
</p>
<p>according to criteria determined by government procurement services. All contracts contain 
</p>
<p>clauses allowing for the termination of a contract if a human rights violation has been 
</p>
<p>committed. However, there is no formal system specifically to review contracts. 
</p>
<p>23. According to Swiss legislation, the &#8220;competent authorities&#8221; can decide to prohibit, 
</p>
<p>wholly or partially, certain activities because they may be contrary to the aims of the law, 
</p>
<p>including services that may be used to commit human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to registration, none of the countries analysed in the present report 
</p>
<p>require a private military and security companies to undergo a special registration; they just 
</p>
<p>need to undergo general registration in trade and commerce registers. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7  France has Law No. 83-629; Switzerland has the Concordat on Security Companies of 1996 and the 
</p>
<p>decree on the hiring of private security companies of 2007; Hungary has Act No. CXXXIII of 2005; 
</p>
<p>and the United Kingdom has the Private Security Industry Act of 2001.

<p><i>  Selection and training of private military and security company personnel 
</i></p>
<p>25. Swiss law includes the most references to human rights-related standards. It requires 
</p>
<p>companies to train their personnel in applicable national and international law, including on 
</p>
<p>fundamental rights, except when no such company is available, stipulating a maximum of 
</p>
<p>six months for such contracts. 
</p>
<p>26. The laws of France, Hungary and the United Kingdom make no reference to human 
</p>
<p>rights training. 
</p>
<p><i>  Permitted and prohibited activities  
</i></p>
<p>27. French law emphasizes that the only activities to be carried out by security providers 
</p>
<p>must be the guarding and protection of persons and property or goods and the provision of 
</p>
<p>protection to transport funds, jewels and precious metals.14 Private security companies are 
</p>
<p>obliged to clearly indicate the private nature of their work in order to avoid confusion with 
</p>
<p>public security entities such as of the police. Similarly, in the Hungarian legislation it is 
</p>
<p>noted that those involved in private security activities have no public authority powers, 
</p>
<p>must use a uniform, cannot use the titles and insignia of the authorities and cannot prevent 
</p>
<p>the authorities from carrying out their activities. The relevant law in the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>does not contain a list of prohibited activities but notes that it is an offence to engage in 
</p>
<p>conduct for which a licence is required.15 
</p>
<p>28. Swiss law clearly prohibits direct participation in hostilities in an armed conflict 
</p>
<p>abroad, including through the hiring, training and provision of security personnel for direct 
</p>
<p>participation in hostilities abroad or the establishment, management or control of a 
</p>
<p>company in Switzerland involved in such activities.16 United Kingdom law does not define 
</p>
<p>what military or security activity can be outsourced to private companies, but there is an 
</p>
<p>understanding that military activity in situations of armed conflict can be delivered only by 
</p>
<p>military personnel under the command of a commissioned officer.17 Hungarian legislation 
</p>
<p>does not rule on the direct participation of company personnel in hostilities, but its 
</p>
<p>provisions are not applicable to members of the armed forces and State law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies.18
 
French law contains no provisions on the direct participation of private military 
</p>
<p>and security company personnel in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>29. In terms of the participation of law enforcement agents in the activities of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies, in France, as a general rule, no former police or military 
</p>
<p>personnel can take up positions in such companies.19 In Hungary, the law emphasizes that 
</p>
<p>staff members of the police and civil national security services performing official duties, 
</p>
<p>and individuals who are not staff but contribute to related official duties, cannot be 
</p>
<p>members or managers of companies providing private security services. Swiss and United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom laws contain no provisions on this question.

 18  Act CXXXIII of 2005, art. 2. 
</p>
<p> 19  Law No. 83-629, art. 9. </p>


<p><i>  Rules on the acquisition of weapons  
</i></p>
<p>30. In France, Hungary and Switzerland there are no rules on the illegal acquisition of 
</p>
<p>weapons. In the United Kingdom, the Export Control Act of 2002 envisages controls for 
</p>
<p>trade in military, paramilitary and certain other goods between countries outside the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom (controls apply to United Kingdom nationals anywhere in the world and to 
</p>
<p>activities carried out wholly or partially in the United Kingdom),20 which could also be 
</p>
<p>applied to private military and security company personnel, although the law does not 
</p>
<p>explicitly aim to regulate the private military industry. 
</p>
<p>31. The absence of specific provisions on the illegal acquisition of weapons and on 
</p>
<p>trafficking in arms by personnel is a clear gap in regulation. 
</p>
<p>32. In France, employees of public security companies that carry out surveillance 
</p>
<p>activities or guard property or goods can be armed as long as they adhere to the conditions 
</p>
<p>laid down in a Council of State decree. Similarly, in Hungary security guards can carry 
</p>
<p>firearms, but these can be used only for self-defence and in an exigency.21 
</p>
<p><i>  Use of force and firearms  
</i></p>
<p>33. In Switzerland, personnel of public security companies cannot be armed abroad,22 
</p>
<p>but if the situation exceptionally requires that personnel bear arms in cases of legitimate 
</p>
<p>self-defence or necessity, the contracting authority must stipulate it in the contract. In 
</p>
<p>contrast, in the United Kingdom there are no legislative provisions on the use of force and 
</p>
<p>firearms by private military and security company employees.  
</p>
<p><i>  Accountability for violations and remedies for victims 
</i></p>
<p>34. None of the legislation reviewed contained provisions on reporting obligations for 
</p>
<p>violations of the law committed by public security company personnel or on effective 
</p>
<p>remedies for victims of human rights violations committed by such personnel.  
</p>
<p>35. Furthermore, laws regulate the monitoring of private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies differently. In France, a permanent control of such companies is exercised by 
</p>
<p>police officers and gendarmes.23 In Switzerland, it is the authorizing competent authority 
</p>
<p>that controls the activities of such companies abroad.24 Swiss law stipulates specific 
</p>
<p>sanctions, including fines and imprisonment, for violations such as direct participation in 
</p>
<p>hostilities and serious human rights violations. The law requires civil liability insurance for 
</p>
<p>risks related to the activities of the company. These may be deemed good practices. 
</p>
<p>36. In Hungary, companies carrying out private security services are controlled by the 
</p>
<p>police, who monitor the lawfulness of the companies&#8217; activities.25 In the United Kingdom, 
</p>
<p>there are no legal provisions at the national level to address reporting requirements for 
</p>
<p>alleged offences and violations, but it is understood that the liability that international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law applies to soldiers committing war crimes would also apply to employees 
</p>
<p>of private military companies who become involved in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>37. The monitoring mechanisms vary in form and content and, with the exception of 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, the laws contain no provisions on a company&#8217;s or its personnel&#8217;s compliance 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20  Export Control Act of 2002, provisions 1-4. 
</p>
<p> 21  Act No. CXXXIII of 2005, art. 27 (4). 
 22  Federal Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad of 2013, art. 34 (1). 
</p>

<p>with international human rights standards. It is essential to ensure the accountability of 
</p>
<p>private military and security companies and their personnel to the Government of their 
</p>
<p>country of origin, registration or operation. Standardized and effective accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms need to be established to ensure the enforceability of regimes regulating the 
</p>
<p>activities of private military and security companies, as well as the necessary penal 
</p>
<p>accountability and civil liability of both individuals and corporate actors26 for human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. 
</p>
<p><i>  Ratification of conventions on mercenaries 
</i></p>
<p>38. While none of the four countries have signed or ratified the International Convention 
</p>
<p>against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, all are party to the 
</p>
<p>Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), article 47 of which 
</p>
<p>defines the term &#8220;mercenary&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Central America 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Scope of the legislation 
</i></p>
<p>39. The relevant laws are applicable only within the country (none provide for 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application).  
</p>
<p>40. Certain activities are stipulated in all legislation, such as the guarding and protection 
</p>
<p>of property and persons, the maintenance of order at public events, the provision of 
</p>
<p>bodyguard services, the provision of secure transportation, the manufacture and marketing 
</p>
<p>of security equipment and systems, and the provision of security advice.  
</p>
<p>41. With respect to human rights references, in the law of Guatemala human rights are 
</p>
<p>to be protected together with personal and collective security rights. This is also a major 
</p>
<p>focus of public security in El Salvador.  
</p>
<p>There is no mention of international humanitarian law in any of the regulations reviewed. 
</p>
<p>International human rights treaties are referenced in Guatemalan law, while Costa Rican 
</p>
<p>law mentions international treaties in the context of the security of diplomatic 
</p>
<p>representations.  
</p>
<p><i>  Licensing, authorization and registration  
</i></p>
<p>42. Although all countries have provisions for obtaining authorization and operating 
</p>
<p>permits, most do not make reference to specific human rights law as a prerequisite for 
</p>
<p>obtaining them. Exceptions are Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala, which do not, 
</p>
<p>however, include human rights violations in the list of infractions. 
</p>
<p>43. Supervisory authority is exercised by the ministries responsible for public security 
</p>
<p>and, in a few cases, by the police. These entities are responsible for ensuring compliance 
</p>
<p>with the laws that regulate the activities of private security companies. They generally 
</p>
<p>monitor compliance with requirements, grant authorizations and issue permits. In the event 
</p>
<p>of non-compliance, they apply sanctions, which range from a warning and a fine to the 
</p>
<p>suspension or cancellation of a permit. They also renew authorizations and permits. In 
</p>
<p>certain cases, they define and authorize training programmes and curricula (Guatemala). 
</p>
<p>They also carry out periodical inspections and keep records submitted by private security 
</p>
<p>providers. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26  See the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. </p>


<p>44. All reviewed countries require a written request to be made to the competent 
</p>
<p>authority and the submission of documentation, depending on the type of service and 
</p>
<p>whether it is for an individual or a company. A company&#8217;s charter, background information 
</p>
<p>on employees and management, the type of proposed activities and personnel, are all 
</p>
<p>required to obtain a permit. All regulations include the payment of fees, insurance for 
</p>
<p>damages to third parties and health insurance for staff. If a private security company has 
</p>
<p>firearms, it must have a secure place for storing them and certify that staff have completed 
</p>
<p>the required training. Additional information must be submitted regarding the company&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>installations, equipment and firearms. Operational manuals must be approved by the 
</p>
<p>authority. Permits are renewable for prescribed periods (two years in Nicaragua and 
</p>
<p>Honduras, three years in Guatemala and El Salvador and five years in Costa Rica and 
</p>
<p>Cuba) and can be denied, suspended, revoked or cancelled for non-compliance with legal 
</p>
<p>requirements and obligations.  
</p>
<p>45. Cuban law differs in important ways from the other regulations. In particular, article 
</p>
<p>3 of Act No. 186/1998 establishes and regulates the system of security and the services that 
</p>
<p>can be provided in this sector. 
</p>
<p>46. Panama requires that nationals be the owners of companies (Act No. 21/1992, art. 4) 
</p>
<p>and foreigners require special authorization from the Ministry of Government and Justice. 
</p>
<p>Mexican federal law requires Mexican nationality for individuals who want to operate 
</p>
<p>companies (art. 25, I and VI). Costa Rica allows resident foreigners to provide services as 
</p>
<p>guards, while foreign companies in Honduras requesting authorization must join with 
</p>
<p>Honduran companies involved in the same activity and name a Honduran-born manager 
</p>
<p>(art. 138). 
</p>
<p>47. All the reviewed countries have a supervisory authority that maintains a register of 
</p>
<p>private security service providers with information on their activities and personnel.27  
</p>
<p><i>  Selection and training of private military and security company personnel 
</i></p>
<p>48. Generally, there is no description of the selection processes in the countries 
</p>
<p>reviewed but there are requirements for management and personnel. These differ depending 
</p>
<p>on whether the staff is armed or unarmed, and on the services involved.  
</p>
<p>49. Private military and security company personnel must be adults with a minimum 
</p>
<p>level education, usually primary or basic education. In Cuba and Honduras, regulations do 
</p>
<p>not mention this element. Staff need to be nationals in Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.28 
</p>
<p>In Cuba, they must be resident in the country. In Costa Rica and El Salvador, personnel of 
</p>
<p>such companies may be resident foreigners, while Guatemalan law makes no reference to 
</p>
<p>nationality. Resident foreigners must be registered in their country of origin and have 
</p>
<p>resided in the country during the past five years. 
</p>
<p>50. A common criterion for the eligibility of personnel is suitability and good moral 
</p>
<p>character, as confirmed by a clean police record. Costa Rican law requires candidates to 
</p>
<p>have had a clean record for the previous 10 years,29 Salvadoran law requires guards to not 
</p>
<p>have police records and Guatemala is the only country that requires candidates to prove that 
</p>
<p>their previous work contract was not terminated because they committed a crime or a 
</p>
<p>human rights violation. In Panama, candidates must not to have been expelled from a public 
</p>
<p>agency for committing a crime or a serious administrative infraction.30 
</p>

<p> 29 Act No. 227/2000, art. 14 (c). 
</p>
<p> 30 Executive Order No. 21/1992, arts. 1 and 9. </p>


<p>51. Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala require a psychological and a physical 
</p>
<p>exam. El Salvador and Nicaragua require the person to be of sound mental and physical 
</p>
<p>health. 
</p>
<p>52. Cuban regulations do not spell out the requirements with which operational 
</p>
<p>personnel must comply. The requirements are regulated by the Ministries of the Interior, 
</p>
<p>Labour and Social Security. 
</p>
<p>53. In general, there are no requirements linked to human rights in the regulations of 
</p>
<p>these countries, except in Guatemala, where candidates who have served in the army, the 
</p>
<p>national civilian police, the government intelligence services or another private security 
</p>
<p>company must prove that if they were dismissed it was not because they committed a crime 
</p>
<p>or a human rights violation. 
</p>
<p>54. Most regulations require passing courses provided by an institution recognized by 
</p>
<p>law. However, the laws and the regulations do not indicate what should be included in the 
</p>
<p>curriculum or its duration, except in a few cases, where such information is mentioned in 
</p>
<p>general terms. There are no established standards or supervision concerning the quality of 
</p>
<p>the training, although there are some requirements for the use of firearms.  
</p>
<p>55. Nicaragua prohibits the use of firearms considered to be combat weapons. Panama 
</p>
<p>requires training on the administration and use of firearms and at least two shooting range 
</p>
<p>practices per year.31 Costa Rica requires private security personnel to pass a course given by 
</p>
<p>the national police academy. 
</p>
<p>56. Most countries do not mention curricula relating to human rights, except El 
</p>
<p>Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico. Mexican regulations require a service provider to offer 
</p>
<p>courses to its personnel that follow an authorized model with content on human rights at 
</p>
<p>least once a year. Salvadoran legislation gives certain details about the contents and 
</p>
<p>mentions courses covering procedures for private agents on human rights. Guatemala 
</p>
<p>requires theoretical and practical training on human rights in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>standards and on the use of force and firearms.32 
</p>
<p>57. The weakness in the requirements regarding training content and its duration 
</p>
<p>constitute a risk for the respect and protection of human rights, especially when only a 
</p>
<p>relatively low level of education is required for personnel. It is essential to have minimum 
</p>
<p>standards in both respects, which ensure that personnel acquire basic knowledge and 
</p>
<p>internalize human rights standards as the ethical and legal framework for private security 
</p>
<p>activities. They must act responsibly in situations involving possible legitimate use of force, 
</p>
<p>especially since all regulations permit the use of weapons. 
</p>
<p><i>  Permitted and prohibited activities  
</i></p>
<p>58. Permitted activities include the guarding and protection of property, persons and 
</p>
<p>public events, the provision of body guard services, the provision of secure transportation 
</p>
<p>services, the manufacture and marketing of security systems and the provision of security-
</p>
<p>related advice. All countries but Nicaragua mention private investigations. Mexican federal 
</p>
<p>law covers security services for obtaining information, including background reports, as 
</p>
<p>well as the installation and sale of armour systems. 
</p>
<p>59. Private companies are limited to operating only in the places or buildings for which 
</p>
<p>they have been contracted. In exceptional cases, for example in Nicaragua, private security 
</p>
<p>personnel are permitted to work in public places. To avoid confusion, uniforms, credentials, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 Executive Order No. 22/1992, art. 3. 
</p>
<p> 32 Act No. 52/2010, art. 51 (c). </p>


<p>logos and vehicle colours similar to those used by the police or armed forces cannot be 
</p>
<p>used. Using and carrying weapons without proper authorization are also prohibited. 
</p>
<p>60. A common prohibition concerns activities reserved for the police and armed forces. 
</p>
<p>Costa Rican law prohibits the act of &#8220;appearing to or replacing the role played by the 
</p>
<p>administration or judiciary, or interfering in their work&#8221;, as well as the provision of services 
</p>
<p>in prisons.33
 
El Salvador prohibits investigations that are the exclusive competence of the 
</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office or the national police.34 Guatemalan law is the most detailed and 
</p>
<p>provides that private security cannot assume functions that are the tasks of the 
</p>
<p>Government.35 Mexican law prohibits private security personnel from doing work entrusted 
</p>
<p>to the public prosecutor and the police, such as obtaining background information on 
</p>
<p>persons.36
 
Honduras prohibits the use of installations or equipment of the national police for 
</p>
<p>training persons or companies providing private security. 
</p>
<p>61. Several countries include prohibitions that could be related to activities of a military 
</p>
<p>nature or to militias or mercenaries. In Costa Rica and El Salvador, the law prohibits the 
</p>
<p>existence or functioning of any type of armed private group that is unauthorized and does 
</p>
<p>not comply with legal requirements.37 Honduras prohibits  Hondurans or foreigners from 
</p>
<p>training or conducting drills for the purpose of providing private security services abroad.38
 
</p>
<p>Costa Rican law prohibits detaining, interrogating, requisitioning or sequestering, violating 
</p>
<p>a person&#8217;s honour and physical integrity, intercepting correspondence and interfering with 
</p>
<p>communications. Mexican law, which contains a prohibition linked to compliance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards, provides that security services must avoid, at all 
</p>
<p>times, committing, tolerating or permitting acts of torture and mistreatment, as well as 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading acts, even when in execution of an order of a superior or in 
</p>
<p>supposedly special circumstances, such as threats to public security.39 Similarly, Costa 
</p>
<p>Rican regulations state that in no circumstances may simple obedience be invoked as 
</p>
<p>justification or impunity for torture or other treatment or cruel, degrading or inhuman 
</p>
<p>punishment.40 
</p>
<p>62. Costa Rica and Honduras have specific regulations that limit the number of staff 
</p>
<p>employed by private security companies. Costa Rica prohibits such companies from 
</p>
<p>maintaining a number of security guards that equals more than 10 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>membership of the police force, by type of service.41 Honduran law states that the number 
</p>
<p>of guards they employ cannot be more than 6 per cent of the national police force. 
</p>
<p>Considering the growth of private security activities in the region and the high number of 
</p>
<p>security personnel compared to the police, this law is considered to be a good practice. 
</p>
<p><i>  Rules on the acquisition of weapons  
</i></p>
<p>63. There are no special provisions on the origin and acquisition of weapons in most of 
</p>
<p>the countries reviewed. In seven of the countries, the acquisition by private security 
</p>
<p>companies of weapons in illegal national or international markets is not regulated, while 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 33 Act No. 8395/2003, art. 45 (h) (I).

</p>
<p> 41 Act No. 8395/2003, art. 19. </p>


<p>Act No. 21 of Panama states that firearms can be purchased only on the domestic market.42
 
</p>
<p>The lack of regulation in this area is one of the gaps observed in this region. 
</p>
<p><i>  Use of force and firearms  
</i></p>
<p>64. All legislation permits the carrying and use of firearms by private security personnel, 
</p>
<p>within limits. There are differences not only with regard to the type of weapon authorized 
</p>
<p>but also to the requirements for ownership and use. For example, Panama requires each 
</p>
<p>firearm to be assigned to a specific security guard; failure to do so is an infraction.43 El 
</p>
<p>Salvador permits private security agents to use of their own firearms after informing the 
</p>
<p>national police.44 
</p>
<p>65. Generally, authorized firearms are to be used by personnel when they are on duty. 
</p>
<p>Panama permits the carrying of firearms exceptionally during travel. In Cuba, firearms may 
</p>
<p>be carried in public only with authorization of the Minister of the Interior.45
 
 
</p>
<p>66. Most regulations do not cover the calibre of firearms. Mexican law obliges a 
</p>
<p>provider to use only registered firearms while Cuban law does not specify the calibre that is 
</p>
<p>authorized by the Ministry of the Interior.46
 
 
</p>
<p>67. Nicaraguan regulations provide that persons guilty of a crime against the public 
</p>
<p>order or State security or involved in a terrorist act, narcotic trafficking, domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>human trafficking and sexual crimes cannot own or carry firearms for civilian use.47 In 
</p>
<p>Panama, in the case of domestic conflict or a declaration of war, firearms belonging to 
</p>
<p>private security companies come under the direct supervision of the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Government and Justice.48 In El Salvador, in the event of a strike or legal stoppage of 
</p>
<p>private security services, the supervisory body will make weapons, ammunition and other 
</p>
<p>equipment available to the national police and will then return them once the situation has 
</p>
<p>returned to normal.49 This type of restriction is considered to be good practice, as it aims to 
</p>
<p>decrease the risk of carrying and using firearms in unstable situations. 
</p>
<p>68. It is prohibited in Guatemala to use undue force, and steps must be taken to prevent 
</p>
<p>harm to life and physical integrity and the violation of other rights of individuals.50
 
In Costa 
</p>
<p>Rica, the ethical-legal principles governing police activities, including the principle of using 
</p>
<p>force only when strictly necessary, apply to private security companies.  
</p>
<p>69. The lack of regulations governing the use of firearms and provision of sanctions is a 
</p>
<p>gap that places persons at risk. In the light of permitted use of firearms by private security 
</p>
<p>personnel, consideration should be given to addressing this. 
</p>
<p><i>  Accountability for violations and remedies for victims 
</i></p>
<p>70. Concerning sanctions against human rights violations, there are differences in the 
</p>
<p>laws reviewed. Guatemala considers it a serious infraction to infringe on the right to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 Act No. 21/1992, art. 8. 
</p>
<p> 43 Executive Order No. 21/1992, art. 27 (d). 
</p>
<p> 44 Act No. 227/2000, art. 27. 
</p>
<p> 45 Decree No. 186/1998, art. 34.

<p> 50 Act No. 51/2010, art. 59 (j). </p>


<p>dignity, personal and family intimacy and confidential communications, or any other right 
</p>
<p>protected by the Constitution and international human rights treaties.51 
</p>
<p>71. Guatemala is the only reviewed State that prohibits private security companies from 
</p>
<p>recruiting a person who has worked for another such company and was dismissed for 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. Costa Rica sanctions an individual or a company that violates the 
</p>
<p>prohibition on detaining someone and depriving him or her of his or her freedom. 
</p>
<p>72. Mexican law provides criteria to determine the appropriate sanction applicable to an 
</p>
<p>infraction. Guatemala has established the crime of &#8220;illegal provision of private security 
</p>
<p>services&#8221; when such services are provided without authorization and made it punishable by 
</p>
<p>a 6&#8211;12 year prison sentence and a fine.52 In Costa Rica, private security personnel who 
</p>
<p>operate with suspended or cancelled permits can receive a prison sentence of between three 
</p>
<p>months and two years.53 
</p>
<p><i>  Ratification of conventions on mercenaries 
</i></p>
<p>73. Only three of the eight countries studied have ratified the International Convention 
</p>
<p>Against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries: Cuba (2007), Costa 
</p>
<p>Rica (2001) and Honduras (2008). This convention has not been referred to in the laws 
</p>
<p>reviewed. 
</p>
<p><b>  South America 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Scope of the legislation 
</i></p>
<p>74. For Argentina, which has a federal system wherein regulations are implemented by 
</p>
<p>each province, the regulations of the Province of Buenos Aires are analysed.  
</p>
<p>75. All regulations reviewed cover the provision of private security within that country. 
</p>
<p>There are no laws applicable beyond national borders and no reference to extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>application. The export and import of private security services are not regulated. 
</p>
<p>76. The rules do not regulate private military security services or mention military and 
</p>
<p>private security companies.  
</p>
<p>77. In general, private security services are provided for guarding property and persons, 
</p>
<p>including at public events, by personal body guards, detectives or private investigators, 
</p>
<p>through consulting services, technological surveillance and alarm services, the marketing of 
</p>
<p>equipment for guarding and private security and for the transport of valuables. Regarding 
</p>
<p>armoured transportation in Argentina, Act No. 12.297/1999 (Buenos Aires) covers the 
</p>
<p>transportation, guarding and protection of any legal transfer, except the transport of funds. 
</p>
<p>It also covers private services, such as obtaining evidence for civil law suits. 
</p>
<p>78. Several regulations classify private security services as armed or unarmed. 
</p>
<p>Colombian law stipulates that services can be provided by individuals without firearms. 
</p>
<p>Ecuador classifies services as fixed guard duty, mobile guards and private investigation.54 
</p>
<p>Guards cannot carry firearms in the Plurinational State of Bolivia.  
</p>
<p>79. Several regulations, like those of Colombia, also recognize private security services 
</p>
<p>that are part of a company&#8217;s own security provisions.55 There are also special guard services 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 51 Act No. 51/2010, art. 58 (3b). 
</p>
<p> 52 Act No. 51/2010, art. 66.

<p>and private community security services that operate as cooperatives, community action 
</p>
<p>groups or community enterprises, providing security to their members. Chile obliges 
</p>
<p>banking and financial institutions, public entities, armoured transportation companies, 
</p>
<p>strategic companies and public services to maintain their own private guard services.56 
</p>
<p>80. Most legislation does not mention international conventions and treaties on human 
</p>
<p>rights except for in Brazil, Colombia and Peru.57
 
Peru prohibits mercenary activities. A 
</p>
<p>Brazilian 2012 ordinance mentions human rights, in the annexes covering the training 
</p>
<p>curriculum. Colombian law states that &#8220;citizens must have sufficient legal recourse for the 
</p>
<p>exercise of their constitutional rights that effectively guarantees and preserves observance 
</p>
<p>of &#8230; international treaties and conventions on human rights&#8221;.58 
</p>
<p>81. Colombian regulations require private security personnel to inform the competent 
</p>
<p>authorities when they learn of any criminal act or violation of human rights while carrying 
</p>
<p>out their activities. 
</p>
<p>82. Most of the reviewed countries expressly prohibit active members of the police and 
</p>
<p>armed forces from undertaking private security activities. In Uruguay (Act No. 275/1999), 
</p>
<p>management-level police officers are prohibited from participating as owners, partners or 
</p>
<p>representatives of companies providing security, or from having any link or relationship 
</p>
<p>with private security companies. Ecuadorian law extends the prohibition to the spouses and 
</p>
<p>relatives to the second degree of consanguinity, to active members of the police and 
</p>
<p>officials, employees and civil servants who work for the Ministry of National Defence, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Government, the national police, the armed forces and the Office of Business 
</p>
<p>Oversight. In Colombia, members of the military, police officers in active service, staff of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of National Defence and the Police, the Administrative Department of Security 
</p>
<p>and the Office of Surveillance and Private Security cannot be partners or employees of 
</p>
<p>security guards.59 Buenos Aires extends this ineligibility to security personnel and 
</p>
<p>employees of intelligence and prison services.60
 
Chile and Peru do not have this prohibition. 
</p>
<p>83. The Plurinational State of Bolivia merits special mention, because it prohibits not 
</p>
<p>only the members of the armed forces and the national police from participating in private 
</p>
<p>security services, but also public officials at any level in active service
.61 This is unique, and 
</p>
<p>due to the existence of the so-called battalion of private physical security, which is part of 
</p>
<p>the national police and which hires out police officers as security officers. Criticisms of the 
</p>
<p>battalion are based on the national police being the institution that authorizes, supervises 
</p>
<p>and inspects private security companies, which claim that because they are not authorized 
</p>
<p>to carry firearms, they are at a disadvantage in competing with the battalion.62 
</p>
<p>84. Except for Chile, ex-members of the police and the armed forces who have been 
</p>
<p>discharged for having committed infractions or crimes are prohibited from providing 
</p>
<p>private security services.  
</p>
<p>85. Private security activities are generally limited to the sites, buildings and private 
</p>
<p>spaces specified in the contracts.63 This restriction becomes less precise in activities such as 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 56 Act No. 3.607, art. 3.

<p>community guard services in Colombia and armoured transportation, which cover larger 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>
<p>86. Generally, private security activities are complementary and subordinate to the work 
</p>
<p>of the police. Several regulations establish the duty of private security companies to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the police in cases determined by law. In Colombia, such companies are 
</p>
<p>required to cooperate in crime prevention and to support the police in the event of a 
</p>
<p>disaster.64 Uruguay stipulates that they must support and cooperate with the police, for 
</p>
<p>example by providing them with information.65 Peruvian law requires cooperation at the 
</p>
<p>request of the executive branch in the event of a state of emergency.66 In Ecuador, private 
</p>
<p>security companies must immediately cooperate with the national police and will be under 
</p>
<p>the authority of the armed forces during a state of emergency. In Buenos Aires, providers of 
</p>
<p>private security services must assist the police in its activities67 and make their material and 
</p>
<p>human resources available to the police in the event of a catastrophe or emergency.68 Under 
</p>
<p>Bolivian regulations, private security companies must cooperate with the police when 
</p>
<p>required.69
 
The human rights implications that these provisions have in the sharing of 
</p>
<p>activities with national security forces need to be considered carefully.  
</p>
<p><i>  Licensing, authorization and registration  
</i></p>
<p>87. In most of the countries, the supervisory and inspection authority for licensing 
</p>
<p>private security companies is within the ministry responsible for public security. The 
</p>
<p>exception is Colombia, where the authority is the Office for Surveillance and Private 
</p>
<p>Security, a national technical agency with financial and administrative autonomy that is part 
</p>
<p>of the Ministry of National Defence. 
</p>
<p>88. In all the countries under review, companies require authorization and permits in 
</p>
<p>order to provide private security services. The requirements can be general (Buenos Aires) 
</p>
<p>or specific to the service provided. Security service providers are always required to carry 
</p>
<p>out only the activities for which they are authorized and have a permit, which are stipulated 
</p>
<p>in contracts.  
</p>
<p>89. A certificate of police and court records for private security personnel is a common 
</p>
<p>requirement to ensure suitability and good moral character. Brazil provides full details on 
</p>
<p>requirements for obtaining a permit, including certification of the absence of a police record 
</p>
<p>by the federal, state, military and electoral justice systems. 
</p>
<p>90. Most legislation does not provide specific requirements concerning records of 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights. The exception is Buenos Aires, where private security 
</p>
<p>companies are prohibited from having partners that have benefited from amnesties No. 
</p>
<p>23.492 and No. 23.521 and been indicted for human rights violations. A certificate issued 
</p>
<p>by the competent human rights authorities is required as proof.70 The absence of a police 
</p>
<p>record must be proven with a certificate from the National Registry of Recidivism and 
</p>
<p>Criminal Statistics, a certificate issued by the Ministry of Justice and Security and a sworn 
</p>
<p>declaration of non-involvement in a court case for felonies or misdemeanours related to 
</p>
<p>security activities. These requirements constitute a good practice in vetting the background 
</p>
<p>of employees. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 64 Act No. 356/1994, art. 74 (6) and (12). 
</p>
<p> 65 Act No. 275/1999, art. 2 (2.3). 
</p>
<p> 66 Act No. 28.879/2006, art. 23 (j). 
</p>
<p> 67 Act No. 12.297/1999, art.1. 
</p>

</p>
<p> 70 Act No. 12.297, art.8 (2); Acts No.23.492 and No. 23.521. </p>


<p>91. A common requirement for obtaining a permit is the obligation to contract third-part 
</p>
<p>liability insurance (Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Colombia and Ecuador, and the 
</p>
<p>Province of Buenos Aires) or insurance for employees (Brazil and Chile); submit proposed 
</p>
<p>models of uniforms and credentials, which must be different from those used by the police; 
</p>
<p>and show proof of the availability of offices for deposit of firearms. Authorizations and 
</p>
<p>permits have a fixed duration, which varies among countries. 
</p>
<p>92. Most of the legislation requires a special register for private security companies (not 
</p>
<p>always at the national level) and another for individuals who provide security services. In 
</p>
<p>general, private security companies must keep registers of their staff, contracts, inspections 
</p>
<p>carried out, users and records of issues concerning firearms and ammunition. The exception 
</p>
<p>is the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which only requires registers and records of daily 
</p>
<p>activities, contracts, accidents, hiring and dismissals, transfers and permits. 71 
</p>
<p>93. In Brazil, companies have a register with the federal police and companies 
</p>
<p>specialized in armoured car services must be registered with the army.72 In Ecuador, 
</p>
<p>companies must be registered in a special ledger of the business register.73
 
In Peru, the 
</p>
<p>registry of companies and personnel is kept by the Office for the Control of Security 
</p>
<p>Services, Firearms, Ammunition and Explosives for Civilian Use. In Chile, the prefectures 
</p>
<p>of the <i>carabineros</i> keep a registry,74 while in Colombia, it is the Office for Surveillance and 
</p>
<p>Private Security.75 
</p>
<p>94. Buenos Aires requires the supervisory authority to keep a registry of the persons 
</p>
<p>authorized to provide private security services and also of persons rejected for infractions of 
</p>
<p>Act No. 12.297. The maintenance of such a register is a good practice and, if established at 
</p>
<p>the national level, would result in better monitoring of private security personnel who have 
</p>
<p>committed infractions. 
</p>
<p><i>  Selection and training of personnel 
</i></p>
<p>95. Common requirements for private security personnel include having reached the age 
</p>
<p>of majority and having a clean police record. A certification of physical and psychological 
</p>
<p>aptitude (Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay, and Buenos Aires) is also required. 
</p>
<p>Personnel cannot be an ex-member of the police or armed forces discharged for infractions.  
</p>
<p>96. Several countries require that personnel be a national of that country (Brazil, Chile, 
</p>
<p>Colombia and Ecuador). Peru permits guards to have foreign nationality, while the 
</p>
<p>Plurinational State of Bolivia permits foreign advisers and requires an INTERPOL 
</p>
<p>background certificate. In Colombia, partners of private security companies and members 
</p>
<p>of a private security cooperatives must be native-born.76
 
 
</p>
<p>97. In most cases, guards must have completed basic or primary schooling. In Peru, they 
</p>
<p>are required to have completed secondary education.  
</p>
<p>98. All countries require proof of a clean police record.77 Ecuador excludes anyone who 
</p>
<p>has been sentenced to prison or who has been dismissed by another private security 
</p>
<p>company for proven crimes.78 In Brazil, personnel must have no record of involvement in a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 71 Act No. 222544/2004, art. 26. 
</p>
<p> 72 Act No. 7.102/1983, arts. 17 and 31. 
</p>
<p> 73 Act No. 2003/12, arts. 10 and 11, and Act No. 1181/2008, art. 12. 
</p>
<p> 74 Act No. 1773/1994, art. 23. 
</p>
<p> 75 Act No. 2355/2006, art. 4 (4) and (9). 
</p>
<p> 76 Act No. 356/199, art. 12 (4). 
</p>
<p> 77 Act No. 003/2011, arts. 18 (c) and 41 (d). 
</p>
<p> 78 Act No. 2003/02, arts 4 and 5. </p>


<p>crime or of having been sentenced by a federal, military or electoral court. This, however, is 
</p>
<p>not an obstacle to registration if the person has only been accused or tried for a crime, 
</p>
<p>sentenced to prison and been rehabilitated, when at least five years have passed from 
</p>
<p>completion of the sentence and in cases of conditional suspension of the procedure.79 
</p>
<p>99. All the countries reviewed require a permit to indicate the firearm&#8217;s type and 
</p>
<p>authorise its carriage.  
</p>
<p>100. Reference to human rights is not commonly associated with the vetting of private 
</p>
<p>security personnel, except in Buenos Aires. The violation of basic rights by personnel is not 
</p>
<p>covered, which is a serious shortcoming. 
</p>
<p>101. Authorizations, permits and credentials of guards have varying durations: from two 
</p>
<p>years for special services in Colombia to five years in Brazil. 
</p>
<p>102. Except in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, private security personnel require 
</p>
<p>special training. In Buenos Aires, it is the supervisory authority that authorizes training 
</p>
<p>centres and approves their curriculum.80 The regulations in Chile do not specify the 
</p>
<p>curriculum or duration, and it is the <i>carabineros</i> who provide instructions and approve 
</p>
<p>programmes and content.81
 
Ecuador allows the national police to establish training centres, 
</p>
<p>but human rights is not in the curriculum. 
</p>
<p>103. Peru recognizes specialized private security training centres, which must be 
</p>
<p>authorized by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior. There is no 
</p>
<p>mention of human rights in the training course but specialized training centres are 
</p>
<p>prohibited from training and providing practice for mercenaries, in strict compliance with 
</p>
<p>the obligations contracted by Peru through international treaties and agreements in force. 
</p>
<p>Peru is the only one of the reviewed countries to refer to mercenaries in its law on private 
</p>
<p>security. 
</p>
<p>104. In Colombia, training must place special emphasis on respect for human rights.82
 
For 
</p>
<p>special and community security services, the Government will promote special training 
</p>
<p>programmes on human rights and international humanitarian law along with other 
</p>
<p>subjects.83
 
The term &#8220;human rights&#8221; appears several times in Brazilian legislation.84 The 
</p>
<p>regulations add that training must cover preserving the physical integrity of persons 
</p>
<p>confronted with the use of force in their work, in accordance with the principles of human 
</p>
<p>rights advocated by the United Nations. 
</p>
<p><i>  Permitted and prohibited activities  
</i></p>
<p>105. Activities permitted by law are the surveillance and protection of persons and 
</p>
<p>property as established by regulations. All these activities are permitted if carried out 
</p>
<p>according to law and as defined in the contracts. 
</p>
<p>106. A common limit to private security companies is that they refrain from engaging in 
</p>
<p>activities reserved for public security institutions. The law on the Bolivian national police 
</p>
<p>prohibits activities that are similar to those of the national police.85
 
Uruguay provides that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 79 Ordinance No. 3233/2012, art. 155 (VIII, 4). 
</p>
<p> 80 Act No. 12.297/1999, art. 18. 
</p>
<p> 81 Act No. 93/85, art. 9. 
</p>
<p> 82 Act No. 365/1994, art. 74. 
</p>
<p> 83 Act No. 2974/1997, art. 21. 
</p>
<p> 84 Ordinance No. 3233, annexes; Act No. 7.102/1983, art. 16; and Ordinance No. 3233/2012, art. 155 
</p>
<p>(VI). 
</p>
<p> 85 Act No. 734, art. 135. </p>


<p>the public order attributions of individuals and companies authorized to provide these 
</p>
<p>services are limited to those that the law grants to private individuals. Peru prohibits 
</p>
<p>companies from carrying out the kind of activities that are carried out by the armed forces 
</p>
<p>or the national police.86 In Ecuador, private security activities cannot encroach on the 
</p>
<p>police&#8217;s sphere of action.87 Colombia has a similar regulation.88 
</p>
<p>107. Peru has detailed regulations on prohibited activities, including those that compete 
</p>
<p>with the armed forces or national police.89
 
These prohibitions are possibly the result of the 
</p>
<p>scandal involving the FORZA Company.
 
</p>
<p>The regulation adds a general provision 
</p>
<p>prohibiting such companies from carrying out activities that violate the individual rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the Constitution of Peru.90 Colombia prohibits private security companies from 
</p>
<p>engaging in activities involving special and community guard services, intelligence 
</p>
<p>activities, combat training, confiscations, searches, interceptions or other illicit activity.91
 
</p>
<p>By article 5 of Act No. 3.607, Chile, &#8220;if required by the national interest&#8221;, prohibits all 
</p>
<p>individuals and companies from providing armed guards. 
</p>
<p>108. There are prohibitions covered in the laws of Uruguay and Buenos Aires aimed at 
</p>
<p>protecting constitutional guarantees and rights,92 such that companies cannot intervene in 
</p>
<p>political, labour or religious conflicts and cannot exercise influence over political, trade 
</p>
<p>union or religious opinions. 
</p>
<p><i>  Acquisition of weapons  
</i></p>
<p>109. All seven countries that allow the carrying of firearms require a permit for carrying 
</p>
<p>authorized firearms, both for companies and guards. This covers both the possession and 
</p>
<p>bearing of firearms. Companies must comply with the requirements as to their use and 
</p>
<p>custody. The general rule is that prohibited firearms cannot be used, or that the use of 
</p>
<p>certain firearms is restricted to the police or the armed forces. Identification credentials 
</p>
<p>must always be worn by guards and must indicate the type of firearm that is authorized. The 
</p>
<p>Plurinational State of Bolivia is the only country of those surveyed that does not permit 
</p>
<p>providers of private security services to carry firearms. 
</p>
<p>110. All legislation establishes which services may be carried out with or without 
</p>
<p>firearms; in some cases, an option is given to the provider. For example, the Peruvian 
</p>
<p>regulations prohibit the use of firearms when an individual performs guard services for 
</p>
<p>third parties. Colombia allows individuals to provide private security services, but only 
</p>
<p>unarmed.93 Chile does not allow companies to have armed guards. In Brazil, a guard has the 
</p>
<p>right to carry a firearm while on duty.94 In Peru, Act No. 28.879 establishes that specialized 
</p>
<p>private security companies must have permits for their non-combat firearms and 
</p>
<p>ammunition. In Colombia, the firearms law distinguishes between a permit for possession 
</p>
<p>by individuals and companies and a permit to carry firearms for individuals and guard and 
</p>
<p>private security services. It also stipulates that a private security company can have a 
</p>
<p>maximum of one firearm for personal defence for every three guards in the company&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>employment. In Ecuador, the number of weapons is authorized in proportion to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 86 Act No. 28.878/2006, arts. 24 (c) and 28. 
</p>
<p> 87 General provision No. 9, act No. 2003/12. 
</p>
<p> 88 Act No. 356/1994, arts. 73 and 74 (2). 
</p>
<p> 89 Act No. 28.879, art. 24. 
</p>
<p> 90 Regulations for Act No. 28.879, art. 60 (j). 
</p>
<p> 91 Act No. 2974/1997, art. 22. 
</p>
<p> 92 Act No. 12.297/1999, art. 14. In Uruguay, Act No. 275/1999, art. 4 (4-2). 
</p>
<p> 93 Act No. 2187/2001, art. 2. 
</p>
<p> 94 Ordinance No. 3233/2012, art. 164. </p>


<p>companies&#8217; service possibilities.95 Others, for example Chile, allow one firearm for each 
</p>
<p>private guard. 
</p>
<p>111. Private security companies are commonly required to have adequate infrastructure 
</p>
<p>for storing firearms and ammunition, for example for when guards go off duty. They must 
</p>
<p>also maintain a register of the entry and exit of firearms. 
</p>
<p>112. In the regulations reviewed, there is no mention of firearms acquired illegally or of 
</p>
<p>trade in unregistered weapons. There are also no infractions that sanction the acquisition or 
</p>
<p>carrying of illegally acquired firearms. 
</p>
<p><i>  Use of force and firearms  
</i></p>
<p>113. The possession and carrying of firearms are restricted to those places where security 
</p>
<p>and guard services are provided by contract, and non-compliance with this leads to the 
</p>
<p>confiscation of the firearm and other sanctions as prescribed by law.96 Firearms must be 
</p>
<p>stored while guards are off duty. 
</p>
<p>114. All eight countries require training in the use of firearms, although requirements 
</p>
<p>differ from country to country. Firearm laws complement and provide details on the rules 
</p>
<p>governing the carrying and use of firearms. When laws on private security do not indicate 
</p>
<p>the maximum calibre, they mention general limits, such as &#8220;non-combat weapons&#8221; or &#8220;for 
</p>
<p>civilian use&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>115. Private security companies are subject to mechanisms of accountability like any 
</p>
<p>other entity. There are no norms that sanction the behaviour of their personnel more 
</p>
<p>severely than they do the behaviour of ordinary citizens. This, despite the fact that private 
</p>
<p>security personnel are individuals who are authorized to carry firearms, in most cases, and 
</p>
<p>act within the framework of the delegation of the legitimate use of force. 
</p>
<p>116. In most legislations, there are very few concrete regulations on the use of force and 
</p>
<p>firearms in the light of human rights standards. An outstanding practice is reflected in a 
</p>
<p>Brazilian regulation (2012) that sets out in detail a study plan for private security guards 
</p>
<p>that includes human rights. 
</p>
<p><i>  Accountability for violations and remedies provided for victims 
</i></p>
<p>117. There are no specific procedures for human rights violations in the laws that were 
</p>
<p>reviewed. There is no mention of human rights violations in any of the sections that deal 
</p>
<p>with inspections and sanctions, and no mention of compensation for victims of violations. 
</p>
<p>118. Infractions are classified from less serious to very serious in most of the countries 
</p>
<p>reviewed. Established sanctions can range from a warning to fines, suspension and 
</p>
<p>cancellation of the operating permit. Infractions are primarily associated with non-
</p>
<p>compliance with formalities and requirements regarding permits and authorizations, 
</p>
<p>regulations that govern the possession and carrying of firearms, requirements on the use of 
</p>
<p>uniforms and installations, as well as acts and omissions in duties and non-respect of 
</p>
<p>prohibitions.  
</p>
<p>119. Colombian regulations state that private security providers must respect the public&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>basic rights and freedoms.97 Providers of guard and security services have a duty to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the Office of Surveillance and Private Security in its inspections and must 
</p>
<p>also establish internal control mechanisms. In the case of special services and community 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 95 Act No. 2535/1993, art. 11. 
</p>
<p> 96 Act No. 1181 of Ecuador, art. 4,  and Act No. 365 of Colombia, art. 97 (2). 
</p>
<p> 97 Act No. 365/1994, arts. 72 and 74 (2). </p>


<p>guards, the regulations provide that they must inform the authority of any criminal acts and 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that they learn about during 
</p>
<p>the course of their work. For community services, an oversight council is created, which 
</p>
<p>submits quarterly reports to the Office with recommendations to ensure public security, 
</p>
<p>opens activities to public scrutiny and provides effective monitoring.98 This is a good 
</p>
<p>practice. 
</p>
<p>120. In Brazil, activities are supervised by a department of the federal police. The 
</p>
<p>regulation requires private security companies to communicate immediately to the 
</p>
<p>specialized private security delegations or the inspection commissions in their area about 
</p>
<p>illegal activities in which their guards are involved.99 
</p>
<p>121. In Buenos Aires, the supervisory authority audits and applies sanctions, and must 
</p>
<p>make at least one annual inspection. In Ecuador, the law provides for monitoring and 
</p>
<p>regulation of private security companies by the Ministry of Government and Police together 
</p>
<p>with the Office of Business Oversight, and inspections may take place at any time and 
</p>
<p>under any circumstances, with the Ministry applying sanctions for infractions committed. In 
</p>
<p>the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the national authority responsible for private companies 
</p>
<p>supervises and monitors the operations of such companies and ensures compliance with 
</p>
<p>regulations, efficient and transparent operations, periodically inspects the companies and 
</p>
<p>issues warnings.100 Regulations establish the responsibility for management of the 
</p>
<p>companies and their personnel, for any negligent activities or for the commission of crimes 
</p>
<p>during their work.  
</p>
<p>122. In Peru, the Office for the Control of Security Services, Firearms, Ammunition and 
</p>
<p>Explosives for Civilian Use supervises private security activities and prosecutes those that 
</p>
<p>violate the human rights enshrined in the constitution.101 In Uruguay, the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior is responsible for regulating and inspecting private security companies, and 
</p>
<p>proposes sanctions in the event of infractions. In Chile, it is the prefecture of <i>carabineros</i> 
</p>
<p>that supervises, inspects and regulates companies with armed and unarmed guards.  
</p>
<p><i>  Ratification of conventions on mercenaries  
</i></p>
<p>123. Only two countries have ratified the International Convention against the 
</p>
<p>Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries: Uruguay (1999) and Peru 
</p>
<p>(2007). There are no regional regulations governing the activities of mercenaries. The 
</p>
<p>concept of mercenary activities is mentioned only in the legislation of Peru on private 
</p>
<p>security services.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The research revealed that while all analysed countries have legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulating private security companies, each country approaches the privatization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the security industry differently, which results in patchy and inconsistent regulation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group stresses that the different approaches and regulatory gaps 
</b></p>
<p><b>demonstrated in the study may result in a serious undermining of the rule of law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the accountability of private military and security company personnel for violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the law. Furthermore, regulatory gaps create potential risks to various fundamental 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 98 Act No. 2974/1997, art. 13. 
</p>
<p> 99 Ordinance No. 3233/1012, art. 165. 
</p>
<p> 100 Act No. 222544, art. 7. 
</p>
<p> 101 Act No. 003/2011, arts. 55, 59 and 60 (j). </p>


<p><b>human rights, such as the right to security, the right to life, the prohibition of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrary deprivation of liberty, the prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or 
</b></p>
<p><b>degrading treatment and the right of victims to effective remedies.  
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>Few countries have national legislation that covers the activities of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>military and security companies abroad. Considering the transnational nature of 
</b></p>
<p><b>private security and military services, the insufficient regulation regarding the scope 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the analysed legislation seriously weakens the rule of law. In contexts in which 
</b></p>
<p><b>borders between countries are porous, it is necessary to fill the gaps and promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and subregional agreements for the regulation of private military and 
</b></p>
<p><b>security companies, to effectively protect the rule of law, human rights and exercise of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right of peoples to self-determination.  
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>Another important gap is that these regulations do not directly address 
</b></p>
<p><b>military-like activities or private military and security companies. The transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>and military services provided, in armed conflict and other complex scenarios such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the so-called war on drugs, increase the probability of the use of firearms by 
</b></p>
<p><b>personnel of private military and security companies, and the risk of violation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights. Precise regulations governing the use of force and firearms are thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>required, as is ensuring the possibility of pursuing those responsible beyond national 
</b></p>
<p><b>borders. Brazil has regulations requiring training in the use of gradual and 
</b></p>
<p><b>progressive force in order to preserve the physical integrity of persons confronted 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the use of force during private security activities, in accordance with United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations principles of human rights. The Working Group recommends this as a good 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice.  
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The research also indicates that there are serious regulatory gaps concerning 
</b></p>
<p><b>the illegal acquisition of weapons and trafficking in arms by private military and 
</b></p>
<p><b>security company personnel and their consequences, and there are divergent 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches regarding the use of force and firearms. The example of El Salvador, 
</b></p>
<p><b>involving making weapons, ammunition and other equipment available to the national 
</b></p>
<p><b>police in the event of a strike or legal stoppage of private security services, is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommended good practice at the national level. An international convention would 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide for private military and security company personnel some standard rules and 
</b></p>
<p><b>methods for acquiring, exporting, importing, possessing and using weapons and would 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the staff of private military and security companies are held accountable 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the illegal acquisition of weapons, trafficking in arms and prohibited use of force 
</b></p>
<p><b>in all parts of the world. 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>In general, across regions, legislation lacks references to company or personnel 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with the standards of international human rights law and humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>law, penal accountability and civil liability of individuals and corporate actors, as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as effective remedies to victims. Given the right of victims of human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>to effective remedies, the lack of relevant rules results in ineffective regulation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>private security industry. An international convention would ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability of private military and security companies by providing standardized 
</b></p>
<p><b>and effective accountability mechanisms. Such mechanisms would also ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforceability of the regimes regulating the activities of private military and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies, as well as the necessary penal accountability and civil liability of both 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals and corporate actors for human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>The weaknesses of the systems of selection and background checking, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the training of operational personnel, make more difficult for them a good 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding and internalization of legal norms and principles. In order to deal with 
</b></p>
<p><b>these challenges, standards for evaluating activities that go beyond mere compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with formalities must be established, instilling respect for rights and concrete </b></p>


<p><b>infractions with their respective sanctions. Selection procedures and background 
</b></p>
<p><b>checks must be improved, with specific reference to international human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law in the selection criteria, and training requirements that meet the 
</b></p>
<p><b>minimum standards of duration and with particular content on human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>While in general States have detailed regulations on private security services, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the relevant laws do not include any references to a single dedicated body responsible 
</b></p>
<p><b>for licencing and monitoring the activities of private military and security companies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>or specific rules on the content of monitoring activities and inspections. 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>The Working Group reiterates its view that a comprehensive, legally binding 
</b></p>
<p><b>international regulatory instrument is the best way to ensure consistent regulation 
</b></p>
<p><b>worldwide and adequate protection of the human rights of all affected by the activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>of private military and security companies. The Working Group emphasizes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical need for States to establish minimum international standards to regulate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities of private military and security companies and their personnel in pursuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the realization of these fundamental human rights, in accordance with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and humanitarian law standards. An international convention would 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide a standard regulatory framework and single dedicated body on various 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential issues related to the activities of private military and security companies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the accountability of private military and security company personnel, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee the right to effective remedies of all victims worldwide. The provisions of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>international convention on licensing, authorisation, selection and training of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>military and security personnel would contribute to the establishment of common and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistent regulation that is desirable to ensure effective scrutiny of the conduct of 
</b></p>
<p><b>private military and security companies and the implementation of the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards, as well as to ensure the accountability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>private military and security company personnel for violations of the law. 
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>Further research into national regulatory strategies is clearly needed in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to identify trends, gaps and good practices in regulating private military and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies. To this end, the Working Group encourages Member States that have not 
</b></p>
<p><b>yet responded to its request to share with it laws and regulations relating to private 
</b></p>
<p><b>military and security companies to do so. 
</b></p>
<p>133. <b>In this study, the Working Group observed that only five of the countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>studied have ratified the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Financing and Training of Mercenaries and that only one of them, Peru, prohibits the 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities of mercenaries domestically. The Working Group calls on the countries that 
</b></p>
<p><b>are parties to this convention to incorporate the prohibition of those activities into 
</b></p>
<p><b>their domestic legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>134. <b>The Working Group also encourages Governments in these regions to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>discussion on the role of private security companies in the context of regional security 
</b></p>
<p><b>into the agendas of intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations.
