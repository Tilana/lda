<p>85. On 3 August 2010, the Government of the United Arab Emirates responded to the 
letter of the Special Rapporteur, which contained extensive information on the 
compensation process. It contained a report by the follow-up committee on compensation 
for former child camel jockeys on action taken by the United Arab Emirates in respect of 
former camel jockeys. The report states that the United Arab Emirates has taken necessary 
and appropriate measures to repatriate all former child camel jockeys in the United Arab 
Emirates who are nationals of the countries concerned (Pakistan, the Sudan, Mauritania and 
Bangladesh). All those who were entitled to it received compensation, and rehabilitation 
and social reinsertion programmes were established for them in their home countries. 
Moreover, laws have been formulated and actions and measures have been taken to prevent 
groups such as this from taking part in camel races in the United Arab Emirates in the 
future. In addition, the report by the follow-up committee included the following efforts 
made by the United Arab Emirates in this regard:

<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p> (a) The adoption of Federal Act No. 15 of 2005 which prohibits the participation 
of children under 18 years of age, and accompanying penalties.  
</p>
<p> (b) Measures taken to implement Federal Act No. 15 of 2005: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the establishment of executive monitoring and follow-up mechanisms  under a 
special committee;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the establishment of a field operations unit which stipulates entry permit 
requirements for jockeys in accordance with the relevant Federal Act; undertakes 
surveillance and monitoring of all camel race tracks, in coordination with the 
national camel-racing federation; coordinates with relevant authorities in order to 
check the actual age of each camel jockey, against the information entered on their 
passports; implements an awareness raising campaign to encourage all camel owners 
to use robotic jockeys and to inform them of Federal Act No. 15 of 2005 and the 
penalties prescribed for violations, namely, a term of up to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment 
and a fine of not less than 50,000 UAE dirhams (Dh).  
</p>
<p> (c) Steps taken to implement the agreement with UNICEF and memorandums of 
understanding with the States concerned: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In accordance with the two-phase agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates 
and UNICEF covering the period 2007&#8211;2008 and 2008&#8211;2009, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Interior issued a decision establishing a special follow-up 
committee on implementation of the agreement and compensation procedures and 
the establishment of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes for the 
children concerned.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The special committee formed joint committees, two thirds of the members of which 
represented the States concerned. In line with of the memorandums of understanding 
signed by the Ministry of Interior of the United Arab Emirates with the 
Governments of these States, these joint committees considered all the claims that 
were submitted to them. The special committee followed up on the implementation 
of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes, in coordination with UNICEF 
and other partners. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The compensation committee also made repeated visits to all the States concerned in 
order to ensure that the process whereby compensation cheques were distributed to 
children there was conducted satisfactorily. The final announcement that the 
compensations process had concluded in Pakistan was made on 22 January 2010. 
The conclusion of the compensation process in the Sudan was announced on 4 April 
2010, at a joint press conference with the Sudanese Ministry of Interior which was 
attended by local and foreign media. 
</p>
<p> (d) Consideration of claims: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Claims were received or rejected following close scrutiny and careful consideration 
by local committees which, as mentioned above, were composed of three members, 
two from the States concerned and one from the United Arab Emirates special 
committee. The subcommittees consulted medical and legal advisers and the 
compensation protocol in order to help them with their work.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Furthermore, the subcommittees were fully empowered to conduct investigations, 
ask questions and assess the compensation amounts in the light of the protocol 
drawn up by an adviser to the special committee. In some cases where fatalities had 
occurred, 30,000 United States dollars ($) was paid in compensation. All those 
children who were entitled to it received compensation once the claims submitted in 
the States concerned had been considered. The subcommittees did not reject any </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>claim where the claimant was entitled to compensation. The total compensation 
awarded to the children in the aforesaid States amounted to $11,082,750 and the full 
amount was transferred in coordination with the subcommittees and officials in these 
States. Data on the children who received compensation, the number of claims filed 
and the number that were rejected are set out below.

<p>Mauritania 479 467 12 
</p>
<p> (e) Efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate children into their societies: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Following the promulgation of Federal Act No. 15 of 2005, the Government brought 
together child camel jockeys from all over the United Arab Emirates, placed them in 
shelters, took care of their affairs and started to return them promptly to their 
countries of origin. This initiative, taken in coordination with UNICEF, cost Dh 10 
million. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government also allocated Dh 30 million to help fund rehabilitation and social 
reintegration programmes for children. This amount was transferred to UNICEF in 
order to implement the programmes that had been established in coordination with 
officials in each State. The main committee visited the four States concerned 
(Pakistan, the Sudan, Mauritania and Bangladesh) and also made continuous visits 
to the representatives of each State in order to ensure that the compensation process 
was conducted according to the protocol and that the children&#8217;s rehabilitation and 
social reintegration programmes continued to be implemented. More than 50 such 
visits were made in 2008, 2009 and 2010, punctuated by support coordination 
programmes with UNICEF and the other authorities concerned. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The United Arab Emirates has implemented with care and attention the agreements 
concluded with UNICEF and the memorandums of understanding concluded with 
the Governments of the States concerned. For that purpose, it established a budget of 
Dh 100 million to cover the costs of returning, repatriating and compensating 
children and establishing rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes for 
them. 
</p>
<p> (f) Publicization of the programme: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The United Arab Emirates provided sufficient funding to cover the subcommittees&#8217; 
administrative costs, equip their offices and meet their other needs. It also provided 
funding for media and medical committees and the costs of advisers and other 
support staff. The subcommittees ran intensive advertising campaigns on television 
and radio and in the press to publicize the programme in all the children&#8217;s home 
countries.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Public announcements on the receipt of claims were run for a sufficient period of 
time (from the signature of memorandums of understanding with the States 
concerned in 2007 to the end of 2008). In some States, claims continued to be 
received until early 2009. The States concerned announced the following deadlines 
for the receipt of claims:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pakistan, 31 December 2008 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Sudan, 21 December 2008 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1/Corr.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bangladesh, 15 February 2009 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mauritania, 10 January 2009 
</p>
<p> (g) Receipt of compensation by children: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The sums determined by the subcommittees in the four States concerned were 
delivered to all the children, and the conclusion of the compensation programme was 
announced once the mechanism had completed its work and the subcommittees had 
issued cheques in the names of the children. In Pakistan, cheques for the children 
were delivered to His Excellency Mr. Rehman Malik, Interior Minister of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, in the presence of the United Arab Emirates 
Ambassador to Islamabad, His Excellency Mr. Ali Saif al-`Awani and a 
representative of the Pakistan joint committee. The Pakistani Ministry of Interior 
wrote to inform us of this event, which was covered by the Pakistani press. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Pakistan subcommittee considered all the claims submitted to it and awarded 
compensation to 1,303 Pakistani children. No valid claim for compensation was 
rejected. The main committee reviewed each case file in detail, including the 
decision of the subcommittee. The funds for compensating minors were delivered to 
the authorities concerned, namely, mother and child protection boards, government 
authorities and non-governmental institutions. These authorities deposited the 
money in banks in order to ensure the interest could be spent on the children. This 
arrangement was verified by the special committee when it visited these States. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As mentioned above, funds were transferred through UNICEF to support 
programmes for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the children. The funds 
amounted to Dh 30 million, of which Pakistan received Dh 7.34 million to establish 
rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes and to improve the children&#8217;s 
living conditions. The States concerned and numerous international organizations 
have commended the United Arab Emirates humanitarian programme.  
</p>
<p>85 bis. The report stated that the United Arab Emirates seeks to act in the interest of the 
children concerned and to provide them with compensation, in keeping with the approach 
and policy pursued in the United Arab Emirates. The report refutes the estimate of an 
international NGO that approximately 15,000 children have been trafficked from Pakistan 
as groundless. The precise figures which the United Arab Emirates, in partnership with the 
competent authorities in the States concerned produced, based on available data and 
information, indicate that 4,728 children from Pakistan, the Sudan, Mauritania and 
Bangladesh were trafficked and that there were none from any other State.  
</p>
<p>85 ter. With regard to reports that most of the children were sold to human traffickers by 
their impoverished parents and that some were kidnapped and sold to human trafficking 
rings, the report underscored that these allegations are unfounded and have no connection 
with the situation of former child camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates. Most of the 
children involved in camel racing were present by choice and with the consent of those who 
exercised parental authority over them, who also accompanied them. They worked for 
salaries that were considered generous and were well-treated by their employers &#8211; contrary 
to the allegations claiming that they were kept in farms in poor living conditions, not fed, 
subject to abuse, beatings and electric shocks, and other such far-fetched allegations. Such 
acts, if committed, are punishable by law in the United Arab Emirates. Indeed, Part 7 of the 
Criminal Code promulgated by Federal Act No. 3 of 1987, as amended, concerns all 
offences against the person, in particular offences that endanger human life and limb, 
infringe liberty and endanger or threaten persons. Federal Act No. 51 on the suppression of 
human trafficking is a special law enacted to combat offences such as intimidation, 
abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of authority, exploitation of a situation of vulnerability, 
and other acts involving sexual exploitation, bonded labour, slavery or forced labour. </p>

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Moreover, the law prescribes a penalty of life imprisonment, if the victim is a child, a 
woman or a person with a disability. Offenders are brought to the Office of the Prosecutor 
and before the competent court, as the United Arab Emirates respects human rights 
principles and abides by all the conventions, treaties and protocols that it has ratified.
