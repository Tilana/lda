<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/3, the Human Rights Council noted that 2012 would mark the 
twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging 
to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.  The Council therefore decided 
to convene, at its nineteenth session, a panel discussion to commemorate the twentieth 
anniversary of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities, with a particular focus on its implementation as well as 
on achievements, best practices and challenges in this regard. 
</p>
<p>2. The anniversary offers an important opportunity to examine how the Declaration has 
served the purpose of advancing the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities. Against this background, the panel discussion was 
organized to highlight the positive initiatives and good practices that have proved 
successful in the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities and that could be 
replicated. Although implementation of the Declaration has facilitated positive measures, 
the panel discussion also reflected the fact that further efforts are needed to improve its 
implementation in all countries and regions. In the discussion, the challenges to 
implementation were identified and possible avenues to overcome these challenges shared. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Substantive background to the panel discussion 
</b></p>
<p>3. Adopted by consensus in 1992,1 the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging 
to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities remains the first  human rights 
instrument of the United Nations devoted solely to minorities. In the preamble thereto, the 
General Assembly considered that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons 
belonging to minorities contribute to the political and social stability of States in which they 
live. The Declaration, which was inspired by article 27 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, contains both the rights pertaining to minorities and the 
obligations of States with respect to minorities. In its article 1, the Declaration establishes 
that States are to protect the existence and the national or ethnic, cultural, religious and 
linguistic identity of minorities within their respective territories, and to encourage 
conditions for the promotion of that identity. 
</p>
<p>4. The expert panellists, representing different regions,  recalled in their commentaries 
the fact that a variety of country situations present a range of circumstances and challenges 
to minorities and States. Nonetheless, the Declaration provided all States with guidance and 
inspiration on measures and approaches that could apply to a variety of situations and serve 
to improve protection. The panel discussion contributed by raising awareness and 
increasing understanding of effective practices and the challenges to be faced. In this 
regard, the panel addressed the &#8220;pillars&#8221; on which the Declaration was built:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection of existence 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection and promotion of identity  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Equality and non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Right to effective participation 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General Assembly resolution 47/135, annex. </p>


<p><b> A. Protection of existence 
</b></p>
<p>5. Article 1 of the Declaration stipulates that States are to protect the existence of 
minorities in recognition that minorities are often at a risk of being the targets of violence. 
In situations of unrest and conflict, for example, minorities may be at greater risk of being 
subjected to violence, displacement, expulsion or other human rights violations that, in 
some cases, may include or could lead to the ultimate crime of genocide. The importance 
attached to the protection of the existence of minorities has been well established under the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948, which 
prohibits the destruction of &#8220;a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such&#8221;. The 
protection of existence of minorities requires accommodating diversity supported by 
appropriate frameworks, including those based on their effective participation in decision-
making processes. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection and promotion of identity 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Declaration provides in its article 2 that persons belonging to national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities have the right to enjoy their own culture, to profess and 
practise their own religion and to use their own language, in private and in public, freely 
and without interference or any form of discrimination. Furthermore, States are also 
required to encourage conditions for the promotion of minorities&#8217; identity (art. 1). Hence, 
the conditions for expression of the culture, customs, languages, traditions and institutions 
of minorities are to be created and maintained to affirm and protect the distinctive 
characteristics and collective identity of minorities while rejecting forced assimilation. In 
this regard, the preservation of minority cultures and languages is paramount. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>7. The principles of non-discrimination and equality are fundamental in the enjoyment 
and exercise of all human rights for all. Article 4 of the Declaration elaborates on the 
principle of non-discrimination with regard to minorities, stating that States are to take 
measures where required to ensure that persons belonging to minorities may exercise fully 
and effectively all their human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination 
and in full equality before the law. Many violations of the rights of minorities have a basis 
in discrimination, resulting in exclusion on the grounds of, inter alia, ethnicity, religion and 
language. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to effective participation 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to effective participation is a key component of the protection of minority 
rights, helping to ensure the fulfilment of many other fundamental human rights. Effective 
participation, particularly in decisions that have an impact on minorities, is a precondition 
for the full and equal enjoyment of human rights. Removing barriers to the access of 
minorities to effective participation in economic, social and cultural life is crucial and is 
usually linked to lack of access to education, resulting in lack of formal qualifications.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Format and opening of the panel discussion 
</b></p>
<p>9. The panel discussion was chaired by the Permanent Representative of Austria and 
vice-President of the Human Rights Council, Christian Strohal. The opening statement was </p>


<p>delivered by the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, who stressed the 
importance of the Declaration with regard to the protection of minorities and called for its 
full implementation. She also referred to the decision of the Policy Committee of the 
Secretary-General of March 2012, aimed at bolstering system-wide work in this area 
through a new United Nations network on racial discrimination and minorities. The 
network, to be coordinated by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), would facilitate collaboration among United Nations entities, 
build guidance and help to share effective practices to combat racial discrimination and 
protect minority rights. The Policy Committee had also stressed that the twentieth 
anniversary of the Declaration should be used to raise awareness and to promote its 
implementation, and that staff training initiatives were to be reviewed to ensure that they 
adequately addressed non-discrimination and minority rights issues.  
</p>
<p>10. The panel discussion was moderated by the Director of Minority Rights Group 
International, Mark Lattimer (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). The 
panellists included the Independent Expert on minority issues, Rita Izs&#225;k; member of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and Special Rapporteur on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Women in Africa, Soyata Maiga (Mali); Head of the Law Department at Middlesex 
University (United Kingdom), Professor Joshua Castellino (India); and member of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Pastor Elias Murillo Martinez 
(Colombia). 
</p>
<p>11. The panel adopted an innovative and interactive format, with no presentation other 
than the opening address. The moderator set the framework of the discussion. The 
discussion was organized into two sequences of approximately 30 minutes each, during 
which each of the four panellists would address the questions raised by the moderator. 
During the first sequence, the moderator asked a question common to each of the panellists. 
During the second sequence, the moderator addressed a specific question to each panellist. 
This approach allowed the discussions to address specific issues relating to the 
implementation of the Declaration, its achievements and challenges. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the first sequence, all three panellists were asked the question: &#8220;The 
Declaration provides authoritative guidance and key standards on minority rights ranging 
from non-discrimination to participation in decision-making. However, the visibility of the 
Declaration remains limited and its provisions are rarely invoked by practitioners. What are 
the measures that could be undertaken by different actors, including the Human Rights 
Council, to improve the promotion of the Declaration and encourage its implementation?&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> A. First sequence 
</b></p>
<p>13. In their commentaries, all four panelists recognized that the Declaration could 
indeed benefit from greater visibility and that the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of 
the Declaration provided a great opportunity to draw additional attention to its provisions 
and inspire dialogue on minority rights in all regions. In many countries, some of the 
principles of the Declaration had been incorporated into constitutions, laws, policies and 
practice. Reality had showed, however, that much more needed to be done to ensure that 
persons belonging to minority groups were well integrated and able to take part fully in all 
aspects of society, without hindrance based on their identity.  
</p>
<p>14. The panellists highlighted several initiatives that could be taken by different actors 
to improve the promotion of the Declaration and encourage its implementation. The role of </p>


<p>States was underscored in the light of their legal obligations under international human 
rights law, which laid down the responsibility to protect all human rights and to promote 
and implement the Declaration. States were therefore encouraged to examine their own 
performance on minority rights and to assess the extent to which they were truly fulfilling 
their commitments under the Declaration. They were also encouraged to evaluate their 
legislation and policies to make sure that they were consistent with the Declaration and that 
they worked effectively to protect the rights of minorities. In this regard, they should gather 
and study essential disaggregated data on the situation of minorities, which would allow for 
problems to be identified, and targeted policies and programmes to be adopted and applied, 
where necessary. This strategy was important in that it would allow States to recognize and 
quantify the problems that minorities faced. At the same time, disaggregated data would 
also assist them in their efforts to implement the Declaration and to establish effective 
solutions for minorities. 
</p>
<p>15. The role of education in raising the awareness of minorities regarding their rights 
was also pointed out. Minorities had to know their rights in order to claim them effectively. 
For this reason, efforts had to be strengthened to promote human rights education and to 
ensure that it was included in the curricula of schools in all regions, providing children and 
adults alike with a strong basis of knowledge about the nature of human rights and minority 
rights, and that those rights belonged to them. Equally, in the field of education, the 
curricula and teaching materials of schools should reflect fully the diversity of a nation; 
only then would children belonging to minorities feel that they truly belonged, and children 
from majorities would understand much more about their classmates with different 
ethnicities, religions, languages and cultures, helping to break down the barriers that lead to 
prejudices and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>16. The role of national human rights institutions in promoting human rights and the 
Declaration on Minorities was underscored. Mention was made of the interest in the 
mandates of such institutions, clearly requiring them to monitor and advise Governments on 
minority issues and to actively promote the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>17. Minorities themselves needed to increase their efforts to actively advocate for their 
rights. Minorities and non-governmental organizations working with and on behalf of them 
had a vital role to play in bringing attention to the Declaration and promoting its 
implementation nationally. The minorities active in their own countries and regions in 
support of their rights were frequently the ones who achieved the greatest results and the 
real changes that improve the lives of people in their communities. Therefore, tools, 
resources and recommendations inspired by the contents of the Declaration must be given 
to minorities to enable them to improve the use of the Declaration in their interaction with 
national and local authorities. 
</p>
<p>18. Specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system could 
contribute to the realization of the rights and principles set forth in the Declaration within 
their respective fields of competence. Reference was made to the collaboration of OHCHR 
and the mandate of the Independent Expert on minority issues with the United Nations 
Development Programme in developing a resource guide and toolkit entitled &#8220;Marginalized 
Minorities in Development Programming&#8221;. The toolkit was based on the Declaration and 
other relevant standards, providing a uniquely valuable resource on minority rights issues. 
</p>
<p>19. Reference was made to the importance of new technology in efforts to raise 
awareness of the Declaration. Social networking offered new and creative possibilities to 
inform people about the Declaration and to encourage discussion and the sharing of 
initiatives. 
</p>
<p>20. The Human Rights Council had an important role to play in helping to bring 
visibility to the Declaration. Initiatives of the Council, including the universal periodic </p>


<p>review, for example, offered an important opportunity to draw attention to challenges and 
to promote human rights standards in all countries. The Council had demonstrated its 
commitment to the promotion of the Declaration by establishing the Forum on Minority 
Issues in 2007, to provide a platform for dialogue and cooperation on minority issues, 
which provided thematic contributions and expertise to the mandate of the Independent 
Expert and was required to identify and analyse best practices, challenges, opportunities 
and initiatives for the further implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Second sequence 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the second sequence, the  Independent Expert on minority issues was asked, 
in  her capacity as the recently appointed mandate holder, how she saw her role in 
encouraging more States to take additional measures in the constructive and inclusive 
development of practices and institutional arrangements to protect the existence of 
minorities and accommodate diversity within society. 
</p>
<p>22. In reply, the Independent Expert reiterated the obligation of Governments and, 
sometimes, the international community under international law to act rapidly and robustly 
to protect the physical existence of minorities when it was threatened. She mentioned 
various circumstances that could threaten the very existence of minorities in a State, such as 
forced assimilation rather than integration, which could result in some minorities being 
unable to openly use or learn their mother tongue, or freely practice their religion. Such 
policies impeded the identity and unique characteristics, cultures and traditions of 
minorities, and were contrary to the Declaration as well as to other human rights standards. 
These threats to identity, if left unchallenged, were immensely damaging to minority 
communities and also to inter-community relations, and could lead to tensions and even 
conflict. Implementing the Declaration and protecting the rights of minorities not only 
protected their physical existence and identity but, as the preamble to the Declaration 
stated, also contributed to the political and social stability of the States in which minorities 
live. 
</p>
<p>23. With regard to her mandate, the Independent expert referred to the important 
thematic work on key issues and giving guidance to Governments and other stakeholders to 
help them to protect the existence, identity and rights of minorities. She was particularly 
concerned about the situation of religious minorities in all regions, and would therefore 
address the rights and security of religious minorities as a thematic priority in the period 
2012-2014. 
</p>
<p>24. Ms. Maiga was asked a question about on<b> </b>protection and promotion of identity. It 
was recalled that language was an essential component of personal identity and that, for 
many persons belonging to national minorities, language was one of the main factors of 
their minority identity and identification. The imposition by the State of strict official 
language proficiency requirements and the refusal to permit the use of minority languages 
could disproportionately affect certain minority communities, especially minority women, 
by denying to them the use of their mother tongue in administration, justice, education and 
public life. Ms. Maiga was asked what could be done at the national level to support and 
facilitate the use of minority languages as an essential component of identity. 
</p>
<p>25. In reply, Ms. Maiga stressed that, despite the financial constraints imposed on the 
educational system of many countries, more effort should be made to ensure that primary 
education and adult literacy schooling of national minorities were also conducted in the 
mother tongue. Developing language programmes open to all and of all ages would offer 
the opportunity for society to benefit from the contributions of women belonging to 
minorities. </p>


<p>26. In addressing political issues linked to education as well as in reforming educational 
systems, States should include teaching in the mother tongues of national minorities in 
school curricula. Minorities should have access to legal and public administrative manuals 
in their mother tongue. The right to effective due process could not be secured in a 
language not truly understood. Hence, in the long term, States should invest in developing 
plans of action and strategies that take into consideration the situation of national 
minorities. Such plans should include training courses to strengthen the capacity of 
minorities to claim their fundamental rights, including the right to existence and identity. In 
this regard, non-governmental human rights organizations should support the efforts of the 
State not only in the field of education but also in developing awareness-raising 
programmes facilitating exchanges between persons belonging to the majority with those 
belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>27. Mr. Murillo Martinez<b> </b>was asked<b> </b>a question  on<b> </b>equality and non-discrimination. It 
was recalled that minority rights, inclusion and equality played an important role in 
promoting political and social stability and peace. Addressing the exclusion of minorities 
and promoting the enjoyment of their rights rested on the right to non-discrimination, which 
required combating both direct and indirect discrimination. Mr. Murillo Martinez was 
therefore asked about the role played by special measures, and their effectiveness and that 
of affirmative action in addressing the impact of long-standing and entrenched 
discrimination of minorities. He was also asked about possible additional measures could 
be taken to alleviate the effects of discrimination and exclusion. 
</p>
<p>28. In his reply, Mr. Murillo Martinez addressed special measures and positive 
measures, and referred to general recommendation No. 32 of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in which it defined special measures or measures of 
positive action arising from article 1, paragraph 4, and article 2, paragraph 2, of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
According to the Committee, the obligation to take special measures was distinct from the 
general positive obligation of States parties to the Convention to secure human rights and 
fundamental freedoms on a non-discriminatory basis for persons and groups subject to their 
jurisdiction.2 </p>
<p>29. The legitimacy of special measures or positive action could be established by 
demonstrating factual conditions that justified it, by its reasonable nature, of proportionality 
and temporality. Special measures or positive action had attained constitutional status in 
many countries, from all parts of the world. For instance, in some countries, the right to 
collective reparation in favour of victims of racial discrimination had gained constitutional 
status, which provided for, inter alia, access to State public positions for indigenous peoples 
and Afro-descendants proportional to their population in the country. Other special 
measures had served to facilitate access to higher education by persons who would 
otherwise be excluded. 
</p>
<p>30. Prof. Castellino was asked a question about the<b> </b>right to effective participation. It was 
stated that effective participation in every aspect of public life should give minorities a full 
stake in society. Measures taken to ensure the effective participation of minorities 
contributed to the alleviation of tensions, and thus served the purpose of conflict 
prevention. Hence, creating the conditions for the effective participation of minorities 
should be considered by States to be an integral aspect of good governance. Prof. Castellino 
was therefore asked to indicate some of the good practices that could be replicated to ensure 
effective participation of minorities through, for example, access to education, political life 
and in decision-making on issues directly affecting them, and access to effective 
</p>
<p>  
 2 CERD/C/GC/32, para. 14. </p>


<p>participation in economic, social, cultural and religious life, in line with article 2 of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>31. In reply, Mr. Castellino<b> </b>submitted that minorities were often excluded as a 
consequence of the project to build strong and viable national identities. In that project, any 
deviation from a centrally adopted position was viewed with suspicion and as a threat. 
Nonetheless, it was the diversity of societies that was often the most economically viable 
asset. To embrace the fruits of this diversity, all that had to be done, at a fundamental level, 
was to broaden the collective vision and become more inclusive in how the nation and the 
State were perceived. 
</p>
<p>32. Real progress within society came at the domestic level, and real protection of 
minorities could only come when there were robust legislative, administrative and judicial 
mechanisms to tackle political exclusion at that level. The right to effective political 
participation was one of the most fundamental rights after the protection of existence, as it 
offered the opportunity for the voices of all to be heard.  
</p>
<p>33. At the international level, there were good examples of minority participation. The 
speed and effectiveness with which issues concerning indigenous peoples had come to the 
fore had taught important lessons. The Declaration had breathed fire into the indigenous 
peoples&#8217; movement. Mr. Castellino stressed that similar support for the Forum on Minority 
Issues and consideration for the adoption of a binding international standard would be 
equally appreciated and would most likely succeed in mainstreaming minority issues in 
human rights practice. 
</p>
<p>34. Despite the above-mentioned developments at the international level, victims and 
potential victims of human rights violations remained far removed from such power 
structures as the Human Rights Council. In the current era of globalization, appropriate 
models of political participation that were available to all had to be sought far and wide. 
Failure to do so would entail the risk of passing on a legacy of the denial of rights to all and 
defeat the human rights agenda cherished by all, and in whose service a great many of the 
most inspirational leaders, intellectuals and advocates of current generations had sacrificed 
their lives. 
</p>
<p>35. There were real ideas in the manner in which States had sought to tackle minority 
exclusion, even if their implementation was still a work in progress. Some States had taken 
such measures as establishing universities and schools in regions where national minorities 
lived in order to create access to education; others practiced a policy of reserving places for 
persons from minority communities in access to high-quality education. This system of 
reservation also extended to legislative bodies at the national and regional levels, including 
multi-seat constituencies to bolster minority presence at the national level. Such measures 
had often been less than popular among majorities; however, by keeping these issues on the 
national agenda, States had accepted the challenge to work ceaselessly to build inclusive 
societies for all.  
</p>
<p>36. The few above-mentioned examples of good legislative design were imperfect and 
difficult to replicate. Equally, there were no readily available solutions that could be taken 
off the shelf and copied. The Declaration provided no more than a skeleton for effective 
minority political participation. Flesh could be put on that skeleton only when the need to 
substantiate human rights through lessons learned emerging from society were accepted. In 
order to make the promise of human rights a reality for all, including minorities, the place 
to start was by ensuring that all were fully represented in the human rights project, to build 
viable sustainable societies that will stand the test of time. </p>


<p><b> C. Comments from States and non-governmental organizations on good 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>37. During the first and second segments, approximately 25 States made interventions 
on both good practices and challenges to the implementation of the Declaration. 
Considering that the role of the State in protecting the rights of minorities was crucial, the 
panel discussion benefitted from the diversity of pronouncements made by States on 
policies and actions undertaken and those they intended to adopt in order to resolve 
intolerable conditions of poverty, marginalization and exclusion experienced by some 
minority communities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>38. Speaking on behalf of a State, one delegate expressed the view that discrimination 
stood as the core problem affecting the participation of minorities in decision-making, 
especially decisions affecting them. In the particular State in question, in geographical areas 
where minority communities lived, their representatives held senior posts in State bodies to 
ensure that their voices were heard. 
</p>
<p>39. Another delegate shared the recent developments in the State through special 
measures offering new opportunities to indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant minorities 
to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country. 
</p>
<p>40. One delegate expressed support for the principles of non-discrimination and 
equality, which were duly observed and through which respect for the distinct language, 
cultural traditions and heritage of a particular minority group in the country were respected. 
In the State in question, positive measures to combat discrimination had been taken to 
facilitate the participation of minorities. 
</p>
<p>41. Another delegate asserted that respect for the rights of minorities was founded on the 
elimination of racism and discrimination in all of their manifestations. Respect for diversity 
and the promotion of tolerance to support peaceful coexistence could be achieved through 
awareness-raising. An approach involving the sensitization of the public to tolerance and 
respect for minorities could be achieved through the integration of human rights training in 
schools from a very early stage. In addition to the Declaration, another important document, 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, affirmed that the ethnic, cultural, 
linguistic and religious identity of minorities, where they existed, must be protected, and 
that persons belonging to such minorities should be treated equally and enjoy their human 
rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination of any kind. 
</p>
<p>42. Speaking on behalf of another State, a delegate affirmed that it was in the light of the 
country&#8217;s multiracial, multi-ethnic, multicultural, multi-religious and multilingual character 
that the Ministry of Minority Affairs was created in 2006. The National Commission for 
Minorities, a statutory body established under the National Commission for Minorities Act 
of 1992, handled specific complaints of deprivation of rights of minorities and made 
recommendations for the safeguard and protection of the rights of minorities. The State 
offered minorities education opportunities, including scholarships, an equitable share in 
economic activities and employment, a certain proportion of development projects for 
minorities, as well as reserving 4.5 per cent of government jobs and education places for 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>43. One delegate stated that, under the interim Constitution of 2007, which guaranteed 
equal protection of the law, minorities had the right to participate in State bodies on the 
basis of the principle of proportional inclusion. A reservation and quota system had 
therefore been introduced to ensure fair representation of all communities in all State and 
decision-making bodies. </p>


<p>44. A delegate referred to the robust system of laws of the State being represented, and 
specified that the promotion of civil rights, non-discrimination and equal opportunity were 
fundamental for ensuring universal respect for human rights. Great effort was made by the 
State to promote and protect the rights of minority individuals in many areas, including in 
law enforcement, housing, education, employment and political participation. In this 
connection, the State remained committed to ensuring full political participation through 
the enforcement of its voting rights laws. The State was engaged in resolving allegations of 
widespread patterns or practices of discrimination against qualified minority borrowers, and 
had entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement that resolved allegations of severe 
and pervasive harassment of minorities.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Religious identity 
</b></p>
<p>45. One delegate declared that, as a result of policies and cultural practices in some 
States, the identity of ethnic and religious minorities living in those States were under 
threat. In this regard, the adoption of anti-<i>hijab</i> legislation was cited as an example of a 
violation of the rights of minorities under the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>46. Another delegate affirmed that the existence of minorities was most threatened in 
times of great social changes, as was the case today in several regions of the world. In the 
light of this sensitive situation, the country had launched a project through its foreign policy 
that would pay special attention to religious minorities, while bearing in mind the 
overlapping between religious minorities and ethnic or national minorities. The project 
would be rooted in the rule of law, as human rights protection must be built on law. 
</p>
<p>47. Speaking on behalf of a group of States, a delegate highlighted the view that 
diversity management at the national and international levels was a key factor in addressing 
the challenges faced by national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. Governments 
were to provide minorities with due political, social, economic and cultural space in their 
societies, including access at the decision-making level. Regarding religious minorities in 
particular, stigmatization and negative profiling were hampering the exercise of their 
fundamental human rights to manifest and practice their religions. 
</p>
<p>48. Another delegate expressed deep concerns at the increase in acts of intolerance and 
violence against members of minorities worldwide, and the State being represented 
condemned in particular the attacks against religious communities of any religion and 
belief. The delegate stated that, in a world increasingly intertwined and globalized, societies 
that succeeded in positively integrating minorities often prospered, while those that pursued 
exclusion along national, ethnic, religious or cultural lines were exposed to internal 
conflicts and were likely to decline. The State in question considered minority issues to be 
among its priorities. It was in this vein that it had created a ministry for international 
cooperation and integration. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Language rights   
</b></p>
<p>49. One State referred to its multi-ethnic population and its history of tolerance towards 
minorities. In this regard, cultural autonomy had been granted to all of its national 
minorities, and it provided support for strengthening distinct identities. Speaking on behalf 
of the State, the delegate stressed the importance of education in minority languages as a 
precondition for the preservation of minority cultural identities. The State was taking a 
proactive stance in providing education opportunities for education in minority languages, 
thereby developing the multilingual proficiency of the young. The State financed obligatory 
primary and secondary education in eight national minority languages with the aim of 
creating an education system able to offer equal opportunities in the labour market for 
graduates from both majority and minority schools. </p>


<p>50. One delegate referred to the status of the two national languages as being equal, in 
addition to English, which amounted to the three &#8220;major&#8221; languages being recognized in the 
country. In this regard, the State had adopted a 10-year plan of action to motivate the 
population to acquire language skills in all three, in order to consolidate further the 
implementation of the official languages policy and to make a valuable contribution to 
building bridges between communities and strengthening national unity. The State regarded 
this approach as a key factor in the reconciliation process ongoing in the country. The 
Official Languages Commission conducted audits to monitor the status of implementation 
of the official languages policy and to ensure that public services were provided in all three 
languages. With the aim of protecting the rights of minorities and promoting social 
integration through understanding and mutual respect, the Ministry of National Languages 
organized multicultural programmes and religious festivals with the participation of all 
ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>51. A delegate fully concurred with the view that language was an essential component 
of personal identity and identification. Speaking on behalf of a State, the delegate asserted 
that States had a duty and responsibility to support and facilitate the use of minority 
languages. The State making the intervention had taken several initiatives to protect the 
identity of the various minority groups in the country, including by establishing vernacular 
schools at the primary level. In addition to conducting classes in minority languages at 
public universities, ethnic studies were compulsory for all students to ensure understanding 
of the multicultural environment of the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Further comments by States and non-governmental organizations on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Declaration on Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>52. One delegate stated that, with the minorities in all of its neighbouring States slowly 
disappearing, the State had a real stake in the full and universal implementation of the 
Declaration, which sets the essential principles on which protection of the rights of 
minorities is to be built. In this vein, the State called on all States to take the provisions of 
the Declaration fully into account when drafting legislative and policy measures concerning 
national minorities living on their territories, in particular with regard to article 1 of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>53. A delegate of another State stated that, although at the European level there was 
tendency to neglect the Declaration, the fact remained that, at the international level, it was 
still the text of reference. In this regard, it was very important that, in the work being 
undertaken by the Independent Expert on minority issues and by the Forum on Minority 
Issues, the importance of the Declaration be reinforced in the implementation of its 
principles. 
</p>
<p>54. Reflecting the view of the State, a delegate stated that the commemoration of the 
twentieth anniversary of the Declaration would not be complete if the Human Rights 
Council did not to pay tribute to the work of Professor Asbjorn Eide, the former Chairman 
of the Working Group on Minorities of the Subcommission on the Prevention of 
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities who had prepared the most comprehensive and 
far-reaching commentary to the Declaration. The delegate highlighted some of the most 
important features of the commentary in understanding the application of the Declaration: 
longer existing minorities might have stronger rights; the rights set out were individual 
rights, the duties of States towards minorities were in part formulated as groups and, in 
some cases, could be best implemented by arrangements for different types of autonomy; 
and the linguistic identity of minorities should be preserved by States to the maximum of 
their available resources. The delegate highlighted that these conclusions of the 
commentary should guide the work of States with regard to minority rights. </p>


<p>55. Speaking on behalf of a group of States, a delegate stated that, although the 
Declaration had been adopted 20 years earlier, its provisions were not fully implemented. 
According to the delegate, civil society, non-governmental organizations and 
representatives of minorities had a vital role to play in promoting the Declaration and the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities. In this regard, they should take an active role in 
advocating for their rights. First, however, they need to better organize themselves to 
successfully partner with various decision-makers to express their needs and take the steps 
necessary for the full realization of their rights. 
</p>
<p>56. Another delegate recalled that the Declaration, the main international reference 
document for minority rights, granted persons belonging to minorities the rights to enjoy 
their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, as well as the right to 
participate effectively in decisions that affect them. These rights could only be guaranteed 
by the full and effective implementation of the provisions of the Declaration. In addition to 
granting rights to persons belonging to minorities, the Declaration also provided all States 
with guidance and inspiration regarding measures to improve the protection of their rights. 
</p>
<p>57. A representative of the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and 
Refugee Rights took the floor to stress the importance of the implementation of the 
Declaration with regard to the violation of the rights of minorities. The speaker from the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People raised specific concerns 
pertaining to the participation of minorities in electoral processes.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The panel discussion offered an excellent platform for experts to discuss the 
approaches that, in their view, worked to advance minority protection and for States 
</b></p>
<p><b>to outline the approaches adopted to advance the principles contained in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration</b> <b>on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> The discussion revealed that a number of States had taken new measures to 
combat the exclusion of minorities and to promote their identity, the full enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>of which could be instrumental in tackling contemporary problems obstructing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of the rights of minorities.  
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> The discussion also demonstrated that respect for the principles of the 
Declaration, adopted 20 years earlier against a backdrop of major transitions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe </b>&#8211;<b> remained 
</b></p>
<p><b>crucial in the transition processes today witnessed in many societies. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The discussion participants also pointed out once again that access to quality 
education plays a vital role in combatting discrimination and in building the capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of minorities to participate in the political, social and economic life of the countries in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which they live. The role of the core principles of equality and non-discrimination was 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlighted as a prerequisite to securing minority rights. In this and other areas, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>panel discussion offered an important opportunity to collect good practices that could 
</b></p>
<p><b>be replicated to strengthen the implementation of the Declaration in all regions of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>world.
