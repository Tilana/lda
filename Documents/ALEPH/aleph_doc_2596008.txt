Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
("Nostra Terra" or the "Company")
Completion of $2.1 million sale of Chisholm Trail Interest
Further to the recent announcements by the Company concerning the sale of its interest in the
Chisholm Trail Prospect ("the Sale"), the Board is pleased to announce the US$2.1 million Sale
has completed successfully.
The purchaser of Nostra Terra's interest in the Chisholm Trail Prospect is Staghorn Petroleum
LLC. Nostra Terra was unable to announce this fact prior to completion of the Sale as it was
bound by commercial confidentiality, which has now been lifted.
Nostra Terra intends to deploy the net proceeds from the Sale to accelerate its growth plans and
for general working capital purposes. Nostra Terra continues to evaluate a number of
opportunities across different geographic regions, particularly North America and Egypt.
Future operations reporting
As part of Nostra Terra's cost cutting initiative and wider rationalization of the business, the Board
has decided to extend the suspension of quarterly operations reports. The previous quarterly
reporting policy was at the Board's discretion and is not required pursuant to the AIM Rules. The
Board feel that management time is better directed towards evaluating and securing new assets
for Nostra Terra, as it continues to implement its growth strategy and deliver shareholder value
over the medium term. The Company will continue to report on operations and accounts in the
Annual and Interims per standard reporting requirements.
Matt Lofgran, Chief Executive Officer of Nostra Terra, commented:
"We are extremely pleased to have completed the sale of our interest in the Chisholm Trail
Prospect to Staghorn Petroleum. This sale comes at an important time for Nostra Terra. The
proceeds from the sale allow the Board to advance its plans for introducing new assets to the
portfolio with larger working interests. We look forward to updating shareholders in the near
future."
