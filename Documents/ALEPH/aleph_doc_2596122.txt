Management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of
operations
The following report contains a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of
PJSC LUKOIL as of June 30, 2015 and the results of its operations for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, as well as significant factors that may affect its future
performance. It should be read in conjunction with our interim US GAAP consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto.
References to "LUKOIL," "the Company," "the Group," "we" or "us" are references to PJSC
LUKOIL and its subsidiaries and equity affiliates. All dollar amounts are in millions of US dollars,
unless otherwise indicated. Tonnes of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced are translated
into barrels using conversion rates characterizing the density of crude oil from each of our
oilfields and actual density of liquids produced at our gas processing plants. Tonnes of crude oil
purchased as well as other operational indicators expressed in barrels were translated into
barrels using an average conversion rate of 7.33 barrels per tonne. Translations of cubic meters
to cubic feet were made at the rate of 35.31 cubic feet per cubic meter. Translations of barrels of
crude oil into barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE") were made at the rate of 1 barrel per BOE and of
cubic feet - at the rate of 6 thousand cubic feet per BOE.
This report includes forward-looking statements - words such as "believes," "anticipates,"
"expects," "estimates," "intends," "plans," etc. - that reflect management's current estimates and
beliefs, but are not guarantees of future results.

Business overview
The primary activities of LUKOIL and its subsidiaries are oil exploration, production, refining,
marketing and distribution. The Company is the ultimate parent entity of a vertically integrated
group of companies.
LUKOIL was established in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 1403, issued on November
17, 1992. Under this decree, on April 5, 1993, the Government of the Russian Federation
transferred to the Company 51% of the voting shares of fifteen enterprises. Under Government
Resolution No. 861 issued on September 1, 1995, a further nine enterprises were transferred to
the Group during 1995. Since 1995, the Group has carried out a share exchange program to
increase its shareholding in each of 24 founding subsidiaries to 100%. From formation, the Group
has expanded substantially through consolidation of interests, acquisition of new companies and
establishment of new businesses. Now LUKOIL is a global energy company operating through
its subsidiaries in 34 countries on four continents.
In July 2015, the Company changed its legal form to PJSC (Public Joint Stock Company)
following the requirements of the amended Russian Civil Code.
LUKOIL is one of the world's largest energy companies in terms of hydrocarbon reserves that
amounted to 17.6 billion BOE as of January 1, 2015 and comprised of 13.6 billion barrels of
crude oil and 23.9 trillion cubic feet of gas.
Our operations are divided into four main business segments:
§ Exploration and Production - which includes our exploration, development and production
operations relating to crude oil and gas. These activities are primarily located within Russia, with
additional activities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, the Middle East, Northern and
Western Africa, Norway and Romania.
§ Refining, Marketing and Distribution - which includes refining and transport operations,
marketing and trading of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.
§ Chemicals - which includes processing and trading of petrochemical products.
§ Power generation - which includes generation, transportation and sales of electricity, heat and
related services.
Each of our four main segments is dependent on the other, with a portion of the revenues of one
segment being a part of the costs of the other. In particular, our Refining, Marketing and
Distribution segment purchases crude oil from our Exploration and Production segment. As a
result of certain factors considered in the "Domestic crude oil and refined products prices" section
on page 9, benchmarking crude oil market prices in Russia cannot be determined with certainty.
Therefore, the prices set for inter-segment purchases of crude oil reflect a combination of market
factors, primarily international crude oil market prices, transportation costs, regional market
conditions, the cost of crude oil refining and other factors. Accordingly, an analysis of either of
these segments on a stand-alone basis could give a misleading impression of those segments'
underlying financial position and results of operations. For this reason, we do not analyse either
of our main segments separately in the discussion that follows. However, we present the
financial data for each in Note 19 "Segment information" to our interim consolidated financial
statements.
Changes in Group structure
On April 15, 2014, a Group company entered into a contract with a Sinopec group company, to
sell the Group's 50% interest in Caspian Investment Resources Ltd., an exploration and
production company operating in Kazakhstan. On June 3, 2015, a Group company made a
substitute transaction with a Sinopec group company for the sale at a price of $1,067 million. The
transaction's closing was subject to requisite governmental consents and approvals and was
completed on August 20, 2015.
In April 2015, in line with the strategy to optimize downstream portfolio a Group company sold
100% of interest in LUKOIL Ukraine, a distribution company operating in Ukraine, to AMIC
Energy Management GmbH. Also, in December 2014, Group companies sold 100% of shares in
LUKOIL Slovakia s.r.o., LUKOIL Hungary Ltd. and LUKOIL Czech Republic s.r.o. to Slovnaft
Česká Republica, Spol. s.r.o. and Norm Benzinkút Kft at the price of €98 million (approximately
$123 million).
In March 2015, a Group company closed a transaction to enter a project to develop the Etinde
block offshore the Republic of Cameroon in the Gulf of Guinea. The Etinde project is being
executed under the production sharing agreement. The project partners are LUKOIL (30%
interest), New Age (African Global Energy) Ltd (30% interest, operator), Bowleven Plc (20%
interest), and state-owned Societe Nationale des Hydrocarbures of Cameroon (20% interest).
The license to develop the Etinde area was issued on July 29, 2014 and is valid for 20 years.
In December 2014, LUKOIL sold to Rosneft its 20% share in National oil consortium ("NOC"),
established by Russian oil companies in 2008 within development of economic cooperation
between Russia and Venezuela. In 2010, NOC and PDVSA, Venezuelan state-owned oil
company, established a joint venture, PetroMiranda, to develop the "Junin-6" block in the
Orinoko river basin.
West Qurna-2 project
On December 12, 2009, a consortium of a Group company and Statoil won the tender for
development of the West Qurna-2 field in Iraq, one of the largest crude oil fields discovered in the
world, with estimated recoverable oil reserves of 12.9 billion barrels (1.8 billion tonnes). The
service agreement for West Qurna-2 field development and production was signed on January
31, 2010 and then ratified by the Ministry cabinet of the Iraq Republic. After Statoil withdrew from
the West Qurna-2 project in May 2012, the parties of the project are Iraq's state-owned South Oil
Company and a consortium of contractors, consisting of a Group company (75% interest) and
Iraq's state-owned North Oil Company (25% interest).
The Group launched the "Mishrif Early Oil" stage on the West Qurna-2 field and reached the
planned production of 120 thousand barrels per day in March 2014. According to the service
agreement, costs are compensated after this level of production is achieved and maintained
during any 90 days within a 120-day period. In June 2014, we met this term and from the second
quarter of 2014 started to receive cost compensation.
Accounting for the cost compensation within the West Qurna-2 project in the Group consolidated
statement of comprehensive income is as follows. The crude oil sales revenue is recognized
after the Iraqi party has approved the actual invoice for the spending quarter. The invoice total
amount depends on crude oil production volumes and the market prices for crude oil during the
period. Subsequently, crude oil purchases are recognized based on actual crude oil shipments
by the Iraqi party against its debt for cost compensation. Then this crude oil is either sold to third
parties or supplied to the Group refineries and the respective sales revenues are recognized.
In the first half of 2015, the Group accrued revenue from the West Qurna-2 project in the total
amount of $1,535 million, consisting of cost recovery of $1,475 million and remuneration fee of
$60 million, compared to the revenue of $1,179 million in the first half of 2014. This revenue was
classified as crude oil sales revenue. Attributable amount of 4,412 thousand tonnes, or 30,260
thousand barrels, of crude oil was included in Group's crude oil production for the first half of
2015 (1,781 thousand tonnes, or 12,218 thousand barrels in the first half of 2014) that
represented approximately 52% of total production from the field (65% in the first half of 2014). In
the first half of 2015, we received 4,769 thousand tonnes of crude oil from the Iraqi party as a debt
settlement within the cost compensation. This crude oil at cost of $1,683 million was recognized
in Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products. Subsequently, we sold this crude oil to third
party customers or delivered to our refineries. During the first half of 2015, the cost compensation
increased the Group's EBITDA by $1,072 million ($1,017 million in the first half of 2014).
The project's target production level is 1.2 million barrels per day and the total term of the contract
is 25 years.
The Group is exposed to political, economic and legal risks due to its operations in Iraq.
Management monitors the risks associated with the projects in Iraq and believes that there is no
adverse effect on the Group's financial position that can be reasonably estimated at present.
Sectorial sanctions against the Russian companies
In July-September 2014, the United States ("US"), the
European Union ("EU") and other countries imposed a
number of sectorial sanctions on Russian entities,
including LUKOIL. These sanctions prohibit the US and the
EU companies and individuals from the provision of
goods, services or technology (except for financial services
to LUKOIL) that can be used on the territory of the Russian
Federation in deepwater exploration and production of
crude oil, exploration and production of crude oil in Arctic
offshore and shale projects. The Company considers these
sanctions in its activities, continuously monitors them and
analyses the effect of the sanctions on the Company's
financial position and results of operations.

(1) Compensation oil that represented approximately 52% of production from the West Qurna-2
field in the first half of 2015 and 65% in the first half of 2014.
The main oil producing region for the Company is Western Siberia where we produced 46.3% of
our crude oil in the first half of 2015 (51.1% in the first half of 2014).
Crude oil production in Western Siberia continued to decline due to natural depletion of reserves
and an increase in water cut. Nevertheless, this was compensated for by the development of
greenfields, successful employment of new technologies and an increase in drilling footage.
The increase in our international production was a result of commencement of commercial
production at the West Qurna-2 oilfield in Iraq in the second quarter of 2014 (for details see p. 3).
The increase in our share in crude oil produced by equity affiliates in Russia was due to the
commencement of production at the Trebs and Titov oilfields by Bashneft-Polus, where the
Group holds a 25.1% interest.
In addition to our production, we purchase crude oil in Russia and on international markets. In
Russia, we primarily purchase crude oil from affiliated producing companies and other
producers. Then we either refine or export purchased crude oil. Crude oil purchased on
international markets is normally used for trading activities, for supplying our international
refineries or for processing at third party refineries.

A significant part of our crude oil purchases is for refining. Compared to the first half of 2014, our
purchases for refining at international refineries remained relatively unchanged. At the same
time, our purchases for trading increased significantly compared to the first half of 2014.
Moreover, in the first half of 2015, the Group received 4.8 million tonnes of compensation crude
from Iraq's state-owned South Oil Company as cost compensation within the West Qurna-2
project (in the first half of 2014, the Group did not receive compensation crude oil yet).
Production of gas and natural gas liquids. During the first half of 2015, we produced 10,114
million cubic meters (59.5 million BOE) of gas available for sale (including our share in equity
affiliates), that is 2.9% more than in the first half of 2014.
Our major gas production field is the Nakhodkinskoe field, where we produced 3,731 million
cubic meters of natural gas in the first half of 2015 (4,131 million cubic meters in the first half of
2014). The decrease of production from the field was due to a revision of the development plan.
Our international gas production increased by 17.8%, compared to the first half of 2014, largely
resulting from the increase in production in Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan.
In the first half of 2015, the output of natural gas liquids at the Group gas processing plants in
Western Siberia, Ural and Volgograd regions of Russia was 6.6 million BOE, compared to 7.2
million BOE in the first half of 2014.
Refining, marketing and trading
Refining. We own and operate four refineries located in European Russia and three refineries
located outside of Russia - in Bulgaria, Romania and Italy. Moreover, we have a 45% interest in
the Zeeland refinery in the Netherlands.
Compared to the first half of 2014, the total volume of refined products produced by the Group
(including our share in production at the Zeeland refinery) decreased by 7.4%. Production
volumes decreased by 10.9% at our Russian refineries and increased by 0.5% internationally. In
Russia, the decrease was a result of amendments in the tax legislation that decreased the
refining margins.
Along with our own production of refined products we refine crude oil at third party refineries
depending on market conditions and other factors. In the periods considered, we processed our
crude oil at third party refineries in Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The following table summarizes key figures for our refining activities.

Marketing and trading. Our marketing and trading activities mainly include wholesale and
bunkering operations in Western Europe, South-East Asia, Central America and retail operations
in the USA, Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and other regions. In Russia, we
purchase refined products on occasion, primarily to manage supply chain bottlenecks.
The Group retails its refined products in 23 countries through nearly 5.1 thousand petrol stations
(including franchisees). Most of the stations operate under the LUKOIL brand.

(1) From the first quarter of 2015, our international volumes of small wholesales are included in
retail sales. Figures for 2014 were adjusted accordingly.
In April 2015, in line with the strategy to optimize its downstream operations, a Group company
sold 100% of the Group's interest in LUKOIL Ukraine, a distribution company operating in
Ukraine. Also, in December 2014, Group companies sold 100% of shares in LUKOIL Slovakia,
LUKOIL Hungary and LUKOIL Czech Republic that together operated approximately 140 petrol
stations.

Following the amendments in tax legislation in the Russian oil industry, we increased our exports
of crude oil and decreased the refined products exports. During the first half of 2015, the volume
of our crude oil exports from Russia increased by 24.3%, and we exported 43.1% of our domestic
crude oil production (34.7% - in the first half of 2014), including 794 thousand tonnes of crude oil
purchased from our affiliates and third parties (161 thousand tonnes in the first half of 2014). The
volume of our refined products exports from Russia decreased by 16.4% compared to the first
half of 2014. Primarily, we export from Russia diesel fuel, fuel oil and gasoil. These products
accounted for approximately 81% of our exported refined products volumes.
Substantially, we use Transneft infrastructure to export our crude oil. Nevertheless, during the
second quarter and the first half of 2015, we exported 1,865 thousand tonnes and 3,689
thousand tonnes, respectively, through our own infrastructure (1,483 thousand tonnes and 3,131
thousand tonnes during the second quarter and the first half of 2014, respectively) that
represented approximately 20% of our total crude oil export in each of the periods considered. 
All the volume of crude oil exported that bypassed Transneft was routed beyond the Customs
Union.
In the first half of 2015, the Company exported 765 thousand tonnes of light crude oil through the
Eastern Siberia - Pacific Ocean pipeline. This allowed us to preserve the premium quality of
crude oil and thus increased the efficiency of exports, compared to exports to traditional Western
markets.
During the first half of 2015, our revenue from export of crude oil and refined products from
Russia both to Group companies and third parties amounted to $6,928 million and $4,114
million, respectively ($10,590 million for crude oil and $9,337 million for refined products in the
first half of 2014).
Main macroeconomic factors affecting our results of
operations
Changes in the price of crude oil and refined products
The price at which we sell crude oil and refined products is the primary driver of the Group's
revenues.  Compared to the first half of 2014, crude oil price dropped nearly two-fold and in the
second quarter of 2015, the price for the Brent crude oil fluctuated between $45 and $66 per
barrel and reached its maximum of $66.7 in the middle of May.
Substantially all the crude oil the Group exports is Urals blend. The following table shows the
average crude oil and refined product prices in the first half of 2015 and 2014.

(1) The Company sells crude oil on foreign markets on various delivery terms. Thus, our average
realized sale price of oil on international markets differs from the average prices of Urals blend on
Mediterranean and Northern Europe markets.
Domestic crude oil and refined products prices
Substantially all crude oil produced in Russia is produced by vertically integrated oil companies
such as ours. As a result, most transactions are between affiliated entities within vertically
integrated groups. Thus, there is no concept of a benchmark domestic market price for crude oil.
The price of crude oil that is produced but not refined or exported by one of the vertically
integrated oil companies is generally determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis against a
background of world market prices, but with no direct reference or correlation. At any time there
may exist significant price differences between regions for similar quality crude oil as a result of
the competition and economic conditions in those regions.
Domestic prices for refined products are determined to some extent by world market prices, but
they are also directly affected by local demand and competition.
The table below represents average domestic wholesale prices of refined products in the first half
of 2015 and 2014.

Changes in the US dollar-ruble exchange rate and inflation
A substantial part of our revenue is either denominated in US dollars or is correlated to some
extent with US dollar crude oil prices, while most of our costs in the Russian Federation are
settled in Russian rubles. Therefore, ruble inflation and movements of exchange rates can
significantly affect the results of our operations. In particular, a depreciation of the ruble against
the US dollar generally causes our costs to decrease in US dollar terms, and vice versa. The
appreciation of the purchasing power of the US dollar in the Russian Federation calculated on
the basis of the ruble-dollar exchange rates and the level of inflation in Russia was 29.3% in the
first half of 2015, compared to the first half of 2014, while the nominal ruble depreciation against
the US dollar was 39.1%, compared to the first half of 2014.

The rates of taxes specific to the oil industry in Russia are linked to international crude oil prices
and are changed in line with them. The methods to determine the rates for such taxes are
presented below.
Crude oil extraction tax rate is determined by adjusting the base rate depending on the
international market price of Urals blend and the ruble-dollar exchange rate. The tax rate is zero
when the average Urals blend international market price for a tax period is less than or equal to
$15.00 per barrel. Each $1.00 per barrel increase in the international Urals blend price over the
threshold ($15.00 per barrel) results in an increase in the tax rate by $1.80 per tonne extracted (or
$0.25 per barrel extracted using a conversion factor of 7.33) above the base rate.
During the first half of 2015, the base rate was 766 rubles per metric tonne extracted (493 rubles
in the first half of 2014).
The crude oil extraction tax rate varies depending on the development, depletion and complexity
of a particular oilfield. The tax rate is zero for extra-heavy crude oil and for crude oil produced in
certain regions of Eastern Siberia, the Caspian Sea, the Nenetsky Autonomous District and
some other regions, depending on the period and volume of production.
The Group produces crude oil in the Caspian Sea, extra-heavy crude oil in Timan-Pechora and
benefits from the application of a zero extraction tax rate.
Natural gas extraction tax rate. The mineral extraction tax on natural gas produced by
independent producers in Russia was calculated using a flat rate until July 1, 2014. The rate was
471 rubles per thousand cubic meters during the first half of 2014.
Starting from July 1, 2014, the base rate amounts to 35 rubles per thousand cubic meters and is
adjusted depending on average wholesale natural gas price in Russia, share of gas production
in total hydrocarbon production of particular taxpayer, and complexity of particular gas field. In the
first half of 2015, actual average natural gas extraction tax rate calculated for our major gas field -
Nakhodkinskoe in Western Siberia amounted to 149.86 rubles per thousand cubic meters.
Crude oil export duty rate is calculated on a progressive scale. The rate is zero when the average
Urals blend international market price is less than or equal to approximately $15.00 per barrel
($109.50 per metric tonne). If the Urals blend price is between $15.00 and $20.00 per barrel
($146.00 per metric tonne), each $1.00 per barrel increase in the Urals blend price over $15.00
results in an increase in the crude oil export duty rate by $0.35 per barrel exported. If the Urals
blend price is between $20.00 and $25.00 per barrel ($182.50 per metric tonne), each $1.00 per
barrel increase in the Urals blend price over $20.00 results in an increase in the crude oil export
duty rate by $0.45 per barrel exported. Each $1.00 per barrel increase in the Urals blend price
over $25.00 per barrel resulted in an increase in the crude oil export duty rate no more than by
$0.65 per barrel exported. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, the maximum increase
in export duty rate was reduced to $0.59 per barrel for each $1.00 per barrel increase in the Urals
blend price. From January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, the maximum increase in export duty
rate is $0.42 per barrel for each $1.00 per barrel increase in the Urals blend price.
The crude oil export duty rate is revised monthly on the basis of the preceding one-month period
of crude oil price monitoring.
A special export duty regime is in place for certain greenfields. The list of the oilfields where the
reduced rate is applied includes our Yu. Korchagin and V. Filanovsky oilfields located in the
Caspian Sea and extra-heavy crude oil fields in Timan-Pechora.
Export duty rates on refined products are to be calculated by multiplying the current crude oil
export duty rate by a coefficient according to the table below.

Crude oil and refined products exports from Russia are subject to two steps of customs
declaration and duties payments: temporary and complete. Temporary declaration is submitted
based on preliminary exports volumes and the duty is paid in rubles translated from US dollars
as at the date of the temporary declaration. Complete declaration is submitted after receiving the
actual data on the exported volumes, but not later than six months after the date of the temporary
declaration. The final amount of the export duty is adjusted depending on the actual volumes, US
dollar exchange rate as at the date of the complete declaration (except for pipeline deliveries
when the exchange rate as at the temporary declaration date is used) and the export duty rate. If
temporary and complete declarations are submitted in the different reporting periods, the final
amount of the export duty is adjusted in the period of submission of the complete declaration. The
high volatility of the ruble-dollar exchange rates may lead to significant value of such
adjustments.
Crude oil and refined products exported to the member countries of the Custom Union - Belarus
and Kazakhstan, are not subject to export duties.
Excise on refined products. The responsibility to pay excises on refined products in Russia is
imposed on refined product producers (except for straight-run gasoline). Only domestic sales
volumes are subject to excises.
In other countries where the Group operates, excises are paid either by producers or retailers
depending on the local legislation.
Excise rates on refined products in Russia are tied to the ecological class of fuel. Excise tax rates
for the first half of 2015 and 2014 are listed below. Translation to the US dollars was made using
average exchange rate for the period.

Income tax. The federal income tax rate is 2.0% and the regional income tax rate varies between
13.5% and 18.0%. The Group's foreign operations are subject to taxes at the tax rates applicable
to the jurisdictions in which they operate.
The Company and its Russian subsidiaries file income tax returns in Russia. A number of Group
companies in Russia are paying income tax as a consolidated taxpayers' group ("CTG"). This
allows taxpayers to offset taxable losses generated by certain participants of a CTG against
taxable profits of other participants of the CTG.
Transportation of crude oil and refined products in Russia
The main Russian crude oil production regions are remote from the main crude oil and refined
products markets. Therefore, access by crude oil production companies to the markets is
dependent on the extent of diversification of the transport infrastructure and access to it. As a
result, transportation cost is an important macroeconomic factor affecting our net income.
Transportation of crude oil produced in Russia to refineries and export destinations is performed
primarily through the trunk oil pipeline system of the state-owned company, Transneft, or by
railway transport.
Transportation of refined products in Russia is performed by railway transport and the pipeline
system of Transnefteproduct. The Russian railway infrastructure is owned and operated by
Russian Railways. Both these companies are state-owned. We transport the major part of our
refined products by railway transport.
In Russia, gas is mostly sold at the wellhead and then transported through the Unified Gas
Supply System ("UGSS"). The UGSS is responsible for gathering, transporting, dispatching and
delivering substantially all natural gas supplies in Russia and is owned and operated by
Gazprom. The Federal Service for Tariffs of the Russian Federation regulates natural gas
transportation tariffs. We are not able to sell our gas other than through UGSS.

During the second quarter of 2015, our revenues decreased by $10,101 million, or by 26.4%,
compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our revenues from crude oil sales decreased by $1,635
million, or by 16.6%, and our revenues from sales of refined products - by $8,146 million, or by
30.7%.
During the first half of 2015, our revenues decreased by $22,592 million, or by 30.6%, compared
to the same period of 2014. Our revenues from crude oil sales decreased by $3,348 million, or by
18.3%. Our revenues from sales of refined products decreased by $18,180 million, or by 35.3%.
The changes in ruble-nominated revenues against the first half of 2014 were significantly
affected by the nominal ruble devaluation by 39.1%.
Sales of crude oil
Our international sales revenue decreased by 14.7%, or by $1,234 million, and by 14.8%, or by
$2,275 million, compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2014, respectively. Our
international sales volumes (beyond the Customs Union) increased by 6,339 thousand tonnes, or
by 58.3%, in the second quarter of 2015 and by 13,509 thousand tonnes, or by 68.4%, in the first
half of 2015 as a result of the increase in crude oil exports from Russia, increased volumes of
crude oil trading and commencement of commercial production from the West Qurna-2 field in
March 2014. At the same time, that was offset by the sharp decrease in the international crude oil
prices by 46.1% and 49.4%, respectively.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2015, as a result of the ruble devaluation and the
drop of international crude oil prices, our realized domestic crude oil price decreased by 24.7%
and 29.0%, respectively. The significant increase in exports from Russia was compensated by
the decrease in the throughput of the domestic refineries. Thus, our domestic sales volumes
decreased relatively insignificantly by 29 thousand tonnes, or by 1.1%, and by 246 thousand
tonnes, or by 4.6%, respectively. As a consequence, in the second quarter and the first half of
2015, our domestic sales revenue decreased by 25.5%, or by $243 million, and by 32.3%, or by
$625 million, respectively.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our revenue from crude oil export from Russia
both to the Group companies and third parties amounted to $3,712 million and $6,928 million,
respectively.
Sales of refined products
Compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2014, our revenue from the wholesale of
refined products outside of Russia decreased by $5,580 million, or by 30.6%, and by $12,899
million, or by 35.8%, respectively. The decrease in sales prices by 37.4% in the second quarter of
2015 and by 41.2% in the first half of 2015 was partially compensated by the increase in sales
volumes by 10.9% and 9.2%, respectively, that resulted from the increase in refined products
trading.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our realized retail prices outside of Russia
decreased by 26.5% and 27.8%, and sales volumes decreased by 4.2% and 4.4%, that resulted
in the decrease of retail revenue by $1,209 million, or by 29.6%, and by $2,365 million, or by
30.9%, compared to the second quarter and the first half of 2014, respectively.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our revenue from the wholesale of refined
products on the domestic market decreased by 35.5%, or by $661 million, and by 39.8%, or by
$1,382 million. Our realized prices and sales volumes decreased by 31.0% and 6.5%,
respectively, in the second quarter of 2015 and by 35.7% and 6.4%, respectively, in the first half
of 2015. The decrease in prices was a result of the ruble devaluation and the decrease in
volumes was due to lower production at our domestic refineries.
During the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our revenue from retail sales in Russia
decreased by $696 million, or by 29.8%, and by $1,534 million, or by 34.6%, respectively. Our
average domestic retail prices decreased by 29.8% and by 34.6%, while retail volumes remained
unchanged.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our revenue from export of refined products from
Russia both to Group companies and third parties amounted to $2,228 million and $4,114
million, respectively.
Sales of petrochemical products
In the second quarter of 2015, our revenue from sales of petrochemical products increased by
$12 million, or by 4.4%, largely due to the increase in sales volumes by 56.1% against the
background of low productions as a consequence of the fire at our plant in Stavropol region of
Russia in the end of the first quarter of 2014. In early April 2015, the production at the plant was
resumed. In the first half of 2015, our revenue from sales of petrochemical products decreased by
$193 million, or by 29.2%, largely, due to lower realized prices.
Sales of gas and gas products
Sales of gas and gas refined products decreased by $242 million, or by 29.4%, compared to the
first quarter of 2014 and by $497 million, or by 29.7%, in the first half of 2015.
During the second quarter of 2015, gas products wholesales revenue decreased by $101 million,
or by 40.8%, and by $211 million, or by 43.1%, in the first half of 2015. Average realized
wholesale prices decreased by 44.2% and sales volumes of gas products increased by 6.0%
compared to the second quarter of 2014. Average realized wholesale prices decreased by 47.5%
and sales volumes of gas products increased by 8.6% compared to the first half of 2014. Retail
gas products revenue decreased by $83 million, or by 38.1%, in the second quarter of 2015 and
by $160 million, or by 37.8%, in the first half of 2015, due to the decrease in average realized
prices.
Natural gas sales revenue decreased by $58 million, or by 16.1%, in the second quarter of 2015
and by $126 million, or by 16.6%, in the first half of 2015, also as a result of the decrease in
international hydrocarbon prices.
Sales of energy and related services
Our revenue from sales of electricity, heat and related services decreased by $59 million, or by
18.6%, in the second quarter of 2015 and by $232 million, or by 28.4%, in the first half of 2015.
The decrease in revenue in Russia due to the ruble devaluation was partially offset by the
increase in international sales revenue related to the acquisition of ISAB Energy in the third
quarter of 2014.
Sales of other products
Other sales include non-petroleum sales through our retail network, transportation services,
rental revenue, crude oil extraction services, and other revenue of our production and marketing
companies from sales of goods and services not related to our primary activities.
Revenue from other sales decreased by $31 million, or by 6.8%, in the second quarter of 2015
and by $142 million, or by 15.9%, in the first half of 2015, largely as a result of the impact of the
ruble devaluation on the revenue from sales of other products in Russia. At the same time, since
the second quarter of 2014, we increased the volume of rendering crude oil extraction services
and since the third quarter of 2014, other sales also included revenue from sales of diamonds.

The method of allocation of operating expenses above differs from the approach used in
preparing the data for Note 19 "Segment information" to our interim consolidated financial
statements. Expenditures in the segment reporting are grouped depending on the segment to
which a particular company belongs. Operating expenses for the purposes of this analysis are
grouped based on the nature of the costs incurred.
Compared to the respective periods of 2014, our operating expenses decreased by $495 million,
or by 19.4%, in the second quarter of 2015, and by $996 million, or by 20.5%, in the first half of
2015.
The changes in ruble-nominated operating expenses against the first half of 2014 were
significantly affected by the nominal ruble devaluation by 39.1%.
Hydrocarbon extraction expenses
Our extraction expenses include expenditures related to repairs of extraction equipment, labor
costs, expenses on artificial stimulation of reservoirs, fuel and electricity costs, cost of extraction
of natural gas liquids, property insurance of extraction equipment and other similar costs.
Our extraction expenses decreased by $256 million, or by 20.3%, in the second quarter of 2015
and by $386 million, or by 17.0%, in the first half of 2015. Our extraction expenses included start-
up costs and production expenses related to West Qurna-2 project in the amount of $461 million
in the first half of 2015 and $161 million in the first half of 2014. In Russia, the increase in costs
was offset by the ruble devaluation.
Our average hydrocarbon extraction expenses decreased from $6.13 per BOE in the second
quarter of 2014 to $4.76 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015, or by 22.3%, and from $5.70 per
BOE in the first half of 2014 to $4.50 per BOE in the first half of 2015, or by 21.1%. In Russia,
average hydrocarbon extraction expenses decreased by 29.6% to $3.98 per BOE in the second
quarter of 2015 and by 34.1% to $3.60 per BOE in the first half of 2015 as a result of the ruble
devaluation.
Own refining expense
Our own refining expenses decreased by $133 million, or by 25.7%, in the second quarter of
2015, and by $281 million, or by 28.2%, in the first half of 2015.
Refining expenses at our domestic refineries decreased by 29.4%, or by $80 million, in the
second quarter of 2015, and by $172 million, or by 34.3%, in the first half of 2015, as a result of
the ruble devaluation and the decrease in production volumes that was partially offset by
increased consumption of additives and overhaul costs.
Refining expenses at our refineries outside of Russia decreased by $53 million, or by 21.5%, in
the second quarter of 2015, and by $109 million, or by 22.0%, in the first half of 2015, largely as a
result of depreciation of the euro against the US dollar.
Refining expenses at third party and affiliated refineries
Along with our own production of refined products we refine crude oil at third party and affiliated
refineries both in Russia and abroad.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2015, refining expenses at third party and affiliated
refineries decreased by 7.7%, or by $4 million, and by 15.5%, or by $18 million, respectively, due
to the euro depreciation against the US dollar.
Expenses for crude oil transportation to refineries
Expenses for crude oil transportation to refineries include pipeline, railway, freight and other
costs related to delivery of the Group's own crude oil to refineries for further processing.
Our expenses for crude oil transportation to refineries decreased by $89 million, or by 33.0%, in
the second quarter of 2015 and by $193 million, or by 35.5%, in the first half of 2015, largely due
to the ruble devaluation and the decrease in crude oil refining volumes in Russia.
Petrochemical expenses
During the second quarter of 2015, operating expenses of our petrochemical plants didn't change
significantly. The effect of the increase of domestic production volumes after commencement of
production at our petrochemical plant in Stavropol region of Russia in April 2015 (the plant's
operation was limited since a fire in February 2014) was offset by the ruble devaluation. During
the first half of 2015, our petrochemical expenses decreased by $27 million, or by 24.3%, due to
the ruble and the euro devaluation against the US dollar.
Power generation and distribution expenses
During the second quarter of 2015, power generation and distribution expenses increased by $5
million, or by 2.9%. The decrease of expenses that resulted from the ruble devaluation was
outweighed by the cost of maintenance works at one of our Russian power plants in June 2015.
At the same time, during the first half of 2015, power generation and distribution expenses
decreased by $27 million, or by 7.5%. The decrease in expenses in Russia due to the ruble
devaluation was partially offset by the increase in expenses as a result of the acquisition of ISAB
Energy in the third quarter of 2014.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses include expenses of the Group's upstream and downstream entities
that do not relate to their core activities, namely rendering of transportation and extraction
services, costs of other services provided and goods sold by our production and marketing
companies, and of non-core businesses of the Group.
Other operating expenses decreased by $18 million, or by 7.4%, in the second quarter of 2015,
and by $63 million, or by 13.5%, in the first half of 2015, largely as a result of the ruble
devaluation. At the same time, our other operating expenses in the first half of 2015 included
expenses related to the production of diamonds that commenced in the third quarter of 2014.
Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products
Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products includes the cost of crude oil and refined products
purchased for trading or refining, gas and fuel oil to supply our power generation entities and the
result of hedging of crude oil and refined products sales.
Cost of purchased crude oil, gas and products decreased by $4,007 million, or by 21.2%, in the
second quarter of 2015 and by $10,012 million, or by 27.7%, in the first half of 2015, following the
sharp decrease in hydrocarbon prices, that was partially offset by the increase in crude oil and
refined products trading volumes. Crude oil purchases in the first half of 2015 also included
$1,683 million related to 4,769 thousand tonnes of compensation crude oil received from Iraq's
state-owned South Oil Company within the West Qurna-2 project (in the first half of 2014, we did
not receive compensation crude oil yet).
In the second quarter of 2015, we recognized a $313 million net loss from hedging, compared to
a $182 million net loss in the second quarter of 2014. In the first half of 2015, we recognized a
$462 million net loss from hedging, compared to a net loss of $109 million in the first half of 2014.
Transportation expenses
In the second quarter of 2015, our transportation expenses decreased by $247 million, or by
15.9%, compared to the second quarter of the previous year. In the first half of 2015,
transportation expenses decreased by $497 million, or by 16.0%, compared to the first half of
2014. The decrease of expenses as a result of the decrease in tariffs largely due to the ruble
devaluation and decreased volume of refined products exports from Russia was partially offset
by increased volumes of crude oil exports from Russia and crude oil trading.
Our actual transportation tariffs related to crude oil and refined products deliveries to various
exports destinations, weighted by volumes transported, changed to the first half of 2014 as
follows: crude oil pipeline tariffs decreased by 30.8%, railway tariffs for refined products
transportation decreased by 34.2%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll costs (excluding extraction entities',
refineries' and power generation entities' production staff costs), insurance costs (except for
property insurance related to extraction and refinery equipment), costs of maintenance of social
infrastructure, movement in bad debt provision and other expenses.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $245 million, or by 24.1%, in the
second quarter of 2015 and by $436 million, or by 23.3%, in the first half of 2015. Largely, this
was due to the devaluation of the ruble and the euro against the US dollar.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization
Our depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased by $299 million, or by 12.0%,
compared to the second quarter of 2014, but stayed flat compared to the first half of 2014. Our
depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for the second quarter and the first half of
2015 included $649 million and $1,017 million, respectively, related to the West Qurna-2 field,
where we commenced commercial production in the second quarter of 2014. In the first half of
2014, our depreciation, depletion and amortization included $1,007 million of such expenses, all
recognized in the second quarter of 2014.
Equity share in income of affiliates
The Group has investments in equity method affiliates and corporate joint ventures. These
companies are primarily engaged in crude oil exploration, production, marketing and distribution
operations in the Russian Federation, crude oil production and marketing in Kazakhstan and
refining operations in the Netherlands. Currently, our largest affiliates are Turgai Petroleum and
Tengizchevroil, exploration and production companies operating in Kazakhstan, the Zeeland
refinery in the Netherlands and Bashneft-Polus, an exploration and production company that
develops the Trebs and Titov oilfelds in Timan-Pechora, Russia.
Our share in income of affiliates decreased by $68 million, or by 74.7%, compared to the second
quarter of 2014, and by $196 million, or by 71.8%, compared to the first half of 2014, largely as a
result of the decrease in income of our upstream affiliates in Kazakhstan.

In the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our taxes other than income taxes decreased by
$802 million, or by 23.5%, and by $2,109 million, or by 30.8%, compared to the respective
periods of 2014, which was driven largely by the effect of the decrease in the international crude
oil prices and the ruble devaluation on the mineral extraction tax rate. The decrease in social
security taxes and contributions, property and other taxes in Russia against the second quarter
and the first half of 2014 was mainly due to the ruble devaluation.
In the second quarter and the first half of 2015, application of the reduced rate for crude oil
produced from depleted oilfields and the zero rate for crude oil produced from oilfields with extra
heavy crude oil and from greenfields led to $355 million and $651 million mineral extraction tax
reduction, respectively ($607 million and $1,191 million in the second quarter and the first half of
2014, respectively).

Export tariffs decreased by $2,502 million, or by 64.8%, in the second quarter of 2015 and by
$4,651 million, or by 57.4%, in the first half of 2015, largely, due to nearly three-fold decrease in
export duty rates for crude oil and refined products. Compared to the second quarter and the first
half of 2014, the volumes of crude oil export beyond the Customs Union increased by 24.7% and
27.1%, while the volumes of the refined products exports decreased by 16.0% and 16.4%,
respectively.
Exploration expenses
In the second quarter and the first half of 2015, our exploration expenses increased by $245
million and by $119 million that mostly was a result of the increase in the amount of dry hole
write-offs, compared to the previous year. In the second quarter of 2015, we charged to expense
the costs of dry exploratory well in Romania in the amount of $244 million. In the first quarter of
2014, we charged to expense the costs of dry exploratory well in Cote d'Ivoire in the amount of
$95 million.
Loss on disposals and impairments of assets
In April 2014, a Group company entered into a contract with a Sinopec group company, to sell the
Group's 50% interest in Caspian Investment Resources Ltd. Subsequently, on June 3, 2015, a
substitute transaction was made in regard of this sale. In the first quarter of 2014, the Group
recognized the loss on this expected disposal in the amount of $358 million. In the first quarter of
2015, the Group recognized an additional impairment loss related to this transaction amounting
to $80 million.
Also, in the first half of 2014, the Group wrote off signing bonuses related to projects in Sierra
Leone and Cote d'Ivoire in the total amount of $67 million.
Income taxes
The maximum statutory income tax rate in Russia is 20%. Nevertheless, the actual effective
income tax rate may be higher due to non-deductible expenses or lower due to certain non-
taxable gains. Moreover, quarterly deviations of the effective income tax rates from the maximum
statutory rate may happen due to currency translation losses and gains reported by Russian
Group companies, that decrease or increase taxable income in the respective periods.
In the second quarter of 2015, our total income tax expense decreased by $204 million, or by
43.3%, compared to the second quarter of 2014. At the same time, our income before income tax
decreased by $1,588 million, or by 55.3%.
In the first half of 2015, our total income tax expense decreased by $652 million, or by 57.3%,
compared to the first half of 2014, while our income before income tax decreased by $3,076
million, or by 58.3%.
In the second quarter of 2015, our effective income tax rate was 20.8%, compared to 16.4% in the
second quarter of 2014. In the first half of 2015, effective income tax rate was 22.1%, compared to
21.6% in the first half of 2014.

EBITDA is a non-US GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest,
taxes and depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that EBITDA provides useful
information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business
operations, including our ability to finance capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
investments and our ability to incur and service debt. While depreciation and amortization are
considered as operating costs under US GAAP, these expenses primarily represent the non-
cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed
in prior periods. The EBITDA calculation is commonly used as a basis for some investors,
analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare the periodic and future operating
performance and value of companies within the oil and gas industry. EBITDA should not be
considered in isolation as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure of
performance under US GAAP. EBITDA does not include our need to replace our capital
equipment over time.

Operating activities
Our primary source of cash flow is funds generated from our operations. During the first half of
2015, cash generated from operations decreased by $1,417 million, or by 18.7%, compared to
the first half of 2014, largely, as a result of the decrease in net income. In the first half of 2014, our
cash flows from operating activities were negatively affected by an increase of receivables for
cost recovery related to commencement of cost compensation within the West Qurna-2 project.
Subsequently, after commencement of shipment of compensation crude oil, changes of this
receivable do not affect significantly our cash flow from operating activity.
Investing activities
In the first half of 2015, the amount of cash used in investing activities decreased by 23.4%
mostly due to the decrease in capital expenditures that resulted from the ruble devaluation.
Our capital expenditures, including non-cash transactions, decreased by 31.1% and amounted to
$5,320 million.

In the first half of 2015, our capital expenditures in the exploration and production segment
decreased by $1,864 million, or by 30.2%. In Russia, capital expenditures decreased mostly due
to the effect of ruble devaluation. Outside of Russia, our capital expenditures didn't change
significantly compared to the first half of 2014.
The decrease in capital expenditures in domestic refining, marketing and distribution segment in
Russia was due to approaching completion of construction of a catalytic cracking unit at our
refinery in Nizhny Novgorod. The decrease in the international segment was a result of the
completion of the construction of heavy residue processing complex at our Bulgarian refinery.
The table below shows our exploration and production capital expenditures in promising new
production regions.

Financing activities
In the first half of 2015, net movements of short-term and long-term debt generated an outflow of
$470 million, compared to an inflow of $438 million in the first half of 2014.
In the first quarter of 2014, the Company received the loans from Sberbank in the amount of $500
million maturing in 2021 and bearing interest at twelve month LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum and
from Promsvyazbank in the amount of $300 million maturing in 2019 and bearing interest at three
month LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum.
Overview of PJSC LUKOIL's Basic Business Risks and Uncertainties
PJSC LUKOIL Management pays great attention to the risk management issues in order to
ensure reasonable achievement of the set goals in the conditions characterized by uncertainties
and adverse factors. PJSC LUKOIL is constantly identifying, describing, estimating and
monitoring the potential events that may affect the Company's activities, and is elaborating
measures to prevent them or mitigate their negative impact to the greatest extent possible if such
events do take place.
The Company seeks to actively promote risk management and is presently focusing its efforts on
the improvement of an enterprise-wide risk management system (ERM) based on the best
international practices. The Company is constantly improving the applicable regulatory
methodological risk management base which establishes requirements, uniform for all of the
LUKOIL Group organizations, aimed at organizing the risk management process at all stages,
and defines management standards for certain risk types of utmost importance. The Risk
Committee, a dedicated body under the President of PJSC LUKOIL, was set up and began its
work in 2011. In order to enhance the efficiency of the corporate-wide governance system
through the establishment of a unified information environment, an automated information risk
management system was brought into commercial operation in the LUKOIL Group companies in
Q4, 2014. The introduction of the information system will make it possible to:
·      create a unified information environment for all participants of the corporate risk management
process (at all managerial levels);
·      automate the processes of collection, due diligence, approval and storage of risk information,
thus increasing the risk response rate and risk management efficiency in general;
·      develop a general presentation format for risk data;
·      develop a risk management knowledge base.
Macroeconomic Risks
Among macroeconomic risks, in the Company's opinion, it is worth noting the slowdown in global
economic growth, which may have an adverse impact on the oil consumption growth rate. US
macroeconomic indicators speak for the slowdown of the world's largest economy growth rate.
Besides, the sustainability of growth rates in the developing countries' economies, above all in
China, raises doubts. Early signs of recovery in the EU have to be verified over a longer period of
time. At the same time, the debt crisis in Greece may affect the dynamics of the EU economies.
Oil quotations nominated in USD are under pressure as the USD exchange rate is getting
stronger versus the world currencies. At the present time, management of the US Federal
Reserve System is discussing whether to increase interest rates after holding off the quantitative
easing program. This decision may lead to further strengthening of the US dollar and affect the oil
prices.
The oil prices may also shrink if a considerable increase in the oil supply to the market takes
place. It is the Gulf countries that have a potential for the oil production growth if the oil prices
remain low. The trend for production increase in this region in the mid-term perspective will
persist.
The introduction of sectoral sanctions against Russia has considerably affected the Russian
economy: the ruble has depreciated, the interest rates have rocketed, as well as the inflation rate,
while access of Russian companies to foreign financing and technologies is hindered. The first
half of 2015 showed that the worst predictions for economic development in Russia had not
come true. However the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict and the prolongation of the sanctions
may worsen the negative trends in the Russian economy.
Rapid depreciation of the ruble in Q4, 2014 has contributed to the development of the inflationary
trends in the Russian economy in 2015. A higher inflation rate may lead to a faster growth of the
tariffs of natural monopolies, higher operational and capital expenditures of the Company.
The Company has been employing a scenario approach to forecast macroeconomic indicators.
One of them is defined as a base-case scenario and describes the most likely macroeconomic
development trends in the view of the Company's management. In adition, best-case and worst-
case scenarios are being developed. They assess the potential consequences of changes in
macroeconomic indices for the Company.
The Company is fully committed to minimizing the potential effects resulting from the realization
of macroeconomic risks. The application of the worst-case scenario makes it possible to identify
assets and investment projects that are most vulnerable to macroeconomic changes. The data of
this analysis serve as the basis for managerial decisions to optimize the Company's asset
portfolio.
Country Risks
Among other things, PJSC LUKOIL has operations in a number of countries with high political
and economic risks. Should they be realized, such risks may significantly complicate the
Company's business or even cause the Company to suspend its operations in a certain region. In
particular, the Company has launched a number of projects in Iraq, Egypt, Western African
countries where political risks are deemed high.
Most of PJSC LUKOIL's assets are located in the areas characterized by moderate or low
political and country risks. The Company seeks to diversify its operations and alongside with its
activities in unstable regions has been implementing projects in Europe and the US, where
regional and political risks are considered minimal.
The major part of the Company's development and refining assets is located in the Russian
Federation. The political environment in the RF is characterized by a fair degree of stability and
high support of the population of the policies undertaken by the President and the Government.
The main factors which are capable of affecting PJSC LUKOIL's activities include:
·      Instability of the political situation in the countries where the Company's is implementing its
investment projects, due to regime changes;
·      Excalation of military conflicts in the countries of the Company's presence;
·      Macroeconomic instability in the countries of the Company's presence;
·      Possibility of the Company's assets expropriation;
·      Inefficiency of the legislation regulating economic relations, and of the court system.
When implementing projects with high country risks, the Company applies more stringent return
level requirements to such projects. Besides, should the political or social and economic
situation deteriorate in a region of the Company's presence, PJSC LUKOIL shall implement a set
of crisis response measures, including cost saving, optimization of the investment program based
on the new conditions, equity drawdown, and invite partners to share project risks.
Industry-Specific Risks
Risks Associated with Well Construction and Hard-to-recover Hydrocarbon Field Development
The risk associated with the prohibition of supply of the equipment and materials currently used
for well construction is essential to the Company. The fact that a considerable share of the
materials and equipment required for well construction is purchased today by the Company and
its contractors from western contractors is regarded as a risk factor.
The greatest part of the chemical agents intended for preparation and processing of drill muds, as
well as for preparation of grouting mixtures currently purchased from the EU and the US
manufacturers, can be replaced with the products manufactured by the enterprises of China,
Thailand, the RF, the Republic of Belarus. It is also worth mentioning that the chemical products
currently purchased from the EU and the US manufacturers are low-tonnage.
Based on the information received from the Company's contractors providing maintenance
services during well construction, the Company's projects have now stocked spare parts,
equipment and supplies for 1 eyear.
Due to the sanctions imposed against Russia there is a risk of constraints arising as hard-to-
recover-hydrocarbon fields are developed with application of the multi-zone hydrofracturing
technique. Russia and China produce no analogs of the  multi-zone hydrofracturing equipment
used today as part of the Company's projects.
Risks Associated with the Growth of Tariffs and Suppliers' Prices for Goods/Work/Services in
Operations, except Critical Raw Material
The risk associated with tariff growth is accounted for by the activities of such monopolies as JSC
RZhD, PJSC Gazprom and other monopolies in the countries of the Company's presence, since
the prices for their services grow on a regular basis.
The expenses on product logistics, as the product volumes rise, directly affect the Company's
profit.
There is also a risk of price growth for the services of other suppliers, including motor
transportation, the services of customs brokers, warehouse storage cost, etc.
In order to minimize the risks associated with tariff growth of JSC RZhD, PJSC Gazprom and
other similar monopolies in the countries of its presence the Company:
·    diversifies ways to transport the Company's products;
·    in order to reduce the risks of advanced tariff growth of the above monopolies the Company
participates in the coordinated operations aimed at the prevention of advanced tariff growth
together with other consumers;
·    when suppliers are selected to cooperate with on a long-term basis, the Company holds
bidding procedures.
Risk of Restricted Access to Petroleum Product Transshipment Infrastructure
The risk scenario depends on the price changes for energy carriers, cost of services and the
political situation.
The Company invests great efforts to find ways to reduce these risks:
·      concludes long-term petroleum product transshipment agreements;
·      diversifies petroleum product export lines;
·      increases the volumes of petroleum product supplies to the Company's terminals;
·      expands production capacities of the Company's terminals;
·      conducts systematic work with natural monopolies with regard to pipeline transfer to increase
transportation output through the JSC AK Transneft system;
·      uses river transport to the full to cut railway costs.
Financial Risks
Price Risks
Oil and oil product price fluctuations may significantly affect the issuer's financial performance
and the value of its securities. The issuer has a limited influence on the output prices which
depend a lot on the market situation and measures taken by the regulatory authorities.
The factors that determine the risk of unfavorable price fluctuations on oil and oil products include
uncertainty with regard to the outlooks of the world economic growth, possible oil supply
interruptions, changes in the global oil demand and supply and possible growth of geopolitical
tensions.
The issuer is a vertically integrated oil company which embraces production, refining and
distribution assets. This structure serves as a natural hedging mechanism, where multidirectional
risk factors may partially compensate one another.
The Company uses a number of measures to reduce the negative price risk impact:
·      As long-term programs are developed, several price scenarios are considered, while the
investment project portfolio is formed in view of the tolerance analysis of the project performance
figures to the changes in price parameters;
·      A commodity supply management system has been implemented which makes it possible to
respond to market changes very fast and conduct arbitrary shipments;
In its trading activities, the Company uses hedging operations which help significantly reduce the
negative impact of the price fluctuations on oil and oil product markets as part of the Group
operations.
Liquidity Risks
High volatility of oil prices, exchange rates of foreign currencies to the US dollar, refining margin,
petrochemistry and power generation margin, growth of tariffs and suppliers' prices, as well as
possible economic sanctions against Russia may create an imbalance in the figures included
into the plans, budgets and investment programs of LUKOIL Group, thus leading to the shortage
of liquidity and financing sources.
This risk is managed through sensitivity assessment of the performance figures included in the
plans, budgets and investment programs to the changes in macroeconomic indicators. The
Company also develops proposals related to plan adjustments, possible sequestering of
expenses associated with the transition to the stress scenario, shifting of due dates and project
implementation dates or inclusion of optional projects in the plan in case of improvements in the
macroeconomic situation, as well as the proposals to ensure timely financing of business
activities. Much attention is paid to cost minimization by means of bidding procedures.
LUKOIL Group's liquidity is managed on a centralized basis, but there's also an efficient global
system in place to manage LUKOIL Group's liquidity, which includes an automated system of
concentration and re-distribution of funds, corporate dealing, and cashflow rolling forecasts. The
liquidity indicators are monitored on a continuous basis.
Despite the dramatic deterioration of the market situation for the Russian borrowers, including in
the aftermath of the Ukranian events, EU and US sanctions, a subsequent financial and
economic crisis, the volume of bilateral backup credit lines needed to provide a sufficient level of
liquidity in line with the requirements of the rating agencies was maintained at an adequate level.
Currently, LUKOIL has investment ratings from all three international rating agencies (BBB- from
S&P; Ba1 from Moody's, BBB- from Fitch). The Company is monitoring and ensuring compliance
of its financial indicators with the rating agencies' requirements on a regular basis.
Considering the direct interdependence between the Company's rating and the country's
sovereign rating due to the fact that, as a rule, a company's rating cannot be higher than the
sovereign rating of the country, the forecast for possible rating changes entirely depends on
further political and economic developments.
Foreign Exchange Risks
The fact that the Company's assets are mainly concentrated in the RF makes its financial
indicators dependent on the ruble to dollar exchange rate. The Company's proceeds are mainly
formed by US dollar proceeds from oil and petroleum product sales, while operating and capital
expenses are denominated in rubles. The Company has to sell foreign currency to finance ruble
denominated expenses. When the ruble appreciates, in order to finance ruble denominated
expenses the Company needs to sell an extra amount of its foreign currency proceeds, which will
have an adverse effect on the Company's net profit in rubles.
The Company's foreign-currency revenue mix and expense structure serve as natural hedging.
For instance, the oil price reduction, as a rule, is accompanied by a weaker ruble exchange rate,
which helps partially offset the negative impact of the oil price reduction on the Company's
financial indicators.
In order to mitigate the negative consequences of the changes in the currency exchange rates
the Company takes advantage of its geographic diversification. The Company also applies
hedging tools to its currency proceeds.
Risk of Contractor's Default, Failure to Pay on the part of the Contractor
The risk manifests itself in the possibility of untimely proceeds from the supplied goods. As
related to export sales, untimely and/or incomplete proceeds may require additional funds to
ensure fulfillment of the Company's financial obligations.
This risk is minimized by the contractual terms in view of which the settlements with third parties,
non-members of LUKOIL Group, are either made on a pre-paid basis or secured by letters of
credit or bank guarantees on the part of end buyers. The list of banks issuing letters of credit and
bank guarantees is subject to approval by the Company's corporate center.
Legal Risks
Tax and Customs Regulation Risks
The actions of the RF government focused on making amendments into the taxation and customs
policy are primarily dictated by the state of the RF budget system and the way the domestic
market is regulated. Increased tax burden, unexpected changes in the rates of taxes and customs
duties, cancellation of the effective incentive rates for a number of the Company's fields may
adversely impact the financial performance of LUKOIL Group and its organizations.
Due to considerable fluctuations of the ruble to dollar exchange rate in the recent months and a
persisting trend towards further depreciation of the Russian ruble there is a risk of additional
payments of customs duties accompanied by occasional declaration of energy-carrier export
supplies is excess of the planned amounts (except for supplies by pipeline transport).
At the same time, in accordance with the Russian Law "On Customs Tariff" the Government of
the Russian Federation reconsiders export customs duties for oil and oil products on a monthly
basis. Customs duties are calculated based on what the oil price on the global oil markets is,
therefore, as the oil price falls, the duty rates also reduce, but only starting next calendar month.
Strengthening of the US dollar to ruble exchange rate in January of 2015, and, as a result, extra
export duty charges under full customs declarations in Q1, 2015 for Q4, 2014 shipments were
negated by the increase in the ruble exchange rate in February-March 2015 and reduction of the
customs duties in January-March of 2015.
However, strong ruble-rate volatility continues to bear significant risks and uncertainty in terms of
the amount of the export duties paid in rubles.
To manage the specified risks the Company conducts continuous monitoring of the taxation and
customs policy changes, participates in the discussions of legislative initiatives, promptly
assesses the influence produced by possible changes in the taxation and customs legislation
upon LUKOIL Group performance indicators, and takes respective measures in order to either
mitigate or offset the negative consequences of the changes in the taxation policy and customs
policy, for example, if possible, to be able to submit customs declariations while the ruble to US
dollar exchange rate is growing.
Risks Associated with Changes of the Russian Legislation on Joint-Stock Companies and
Securities Markets
The changes in the Russian regulatory acts in the area of corporate governance (the
amendments to Chapter 4 of the first section of the RF Civil Code regulating provisions on legal
entities that came into effect from September 1, 2014), including those related to the structure and
competences of the regulatory bodies of a joint-stock company, to be introduced in Q3-Q4, 2015,
due to the amendments made into the Federal Law "On Joint-Stock Companies", as well as
transition to practical application of the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code in view of
the recommendations issued by the Bank of Russia (letter No. 06-52/2463 of April 10, 2014) may
lead to changes in the Company's corporate structure and corporate governance procedures,
which in its turn may have an adverse impact on the Company's decision-making process and
performance.
The Company is constantly monitoring legislation changes in this field and participates in
preliminary discussions on the proposed changes initiated by the professional community in
order to provide detailed explanations as to PJSC LUKOIL's attitude towards the risks and
uncertainties associated with the new legislative initiatives.
The Company is taking measures to ensure participation of its representatives in the activities
focused on the development of efficient solutions in the area of practical application of the
effective legislative innovations related to corporate governance and taxation.
Risks Associated with Circulation of the Company's Securities
The Company's securities circulate in regulated markets in Russia and abroad. Changes in the
requirements to the issuers on the part of the regulatory authorities for securities and stock
exchanges, as well as the changes in the listing structure may induce the Company to amend its
corporate governance procedures and assume extra obligations as to information disclosure and
shareholder relations. Should the Company fail to ensure compliance with these requirements
and fulfill the required obligations, it may result in transfer of the Company's securities to lower
listing segments, including delisting, which may have an adverse impact on the liquidity and cost
of the securities.
The Company monitors changes in the listing rules of stock exchanges and other requirements of
stock exchanges and regulatory authorities to the issuers whose securities are allowed to
circulate. The Company's representatives participate in the working meetings and other issuer
events arranged by stock exchanges and other organizations that provide consulting and
educational services to the issuers of the securities circulating in regulated markets. The
Company also seeks to introduce the best global practice in corporate governance and
shareholder relations.
Geological Risks
The Risk of Failure to Discover Geological Reserves or Discovery of the Reserves below the
Initially Expected Level
The Company's business is exposed to the risk that while implementing new projects, and
exploratory drilling, we might not discover any productive (commercially efficient) oil and gas
reserves, and/or that the discovered reserves will be considerably below the initially expected
level. In this event, the Company may have to incur additional expenses or even cease
operations in a number of license areas.
PJSC LUKOIL performs activities to manage this risk at the level sufficient for prompt risk
response, by means of additional geologic exploration.
Risks Associated with Subsurface Use and Licensing
The effective Russian laws on subsurface use and licensing of exploration and production
activities, as well as their practical application expose oil companies to a number of risks. The
most important are the following risks:
·      risk of early termination of the subsoil license;
·      risk of failure to provide the Companies with equal access to the subsoil resources of the
Continental shelf;
·      risk of having no legislative guarantees to grant the right to subsurface use to a legal entity
that discovered a field of federal significance or a field located in the subsurface area of federal
significance (Russian continental shelf, internal and territorial seas of the RF, as well as the
Russian part (Russian sector) of the Caspian sea bottom), including the subsurface users with
the share of foreign investors in the companies' authorized capital);
·      risk of refusal to accept bidding documents for participation in competitive sales/biddings in
view of their formal features from subsurface users of the LUKOIL Group companies;
·      risk of fines imposed for administrative offences for failure to fulfill the terms of license
agreements;
The Company is fully committed to minimizing the potential effects resulting from the realization
of the above risks, including the following:
·      conducts monitoring of the changes in the legislation and in the area of subsurface use and
licensing, forwarding proposals to update the applicable regulatory framework;
·      creates a list of sites associated with the Unallocated Subsoil Stock, which are of interest to
the Company, in the oil and gas production companies, to ensure timely decision-making on
participation of LUKOIL Group in the bidding procedures for subsoil use rights;
·      has established permanent working groups in LUKOIL Group companies to develop the
application documents to participate in the bidding procedures and re-register licenses;
·      holds annual advanced training workshops for specialists in the area of licensing and subsoil
use;
·      monitors the current status of subsoil use, with application of a special information system;
·      the Company interacts with the regulatory authorities in order to mitigate the risk of early
termination of the subsoil license.
Risk of Terrorist Attacks, Wrongful Acts by Third Parties
As the number of terrorist organizations increases, as well as that of terrorist attacks in the
countries of the Company's presence, there is a possibility of terrorist attacks and other wrongful
acts towards the Company's assets.
There are also risks related to wrongful activities on the part of LUKOIL's competitors
(specifically, risks of unfair competition), risks of financial and other abuses on the part of the
LUKOIL Group employees, as well as those related to theft of financial resources and commodity
stocks.
The Company manages this risk in the following key areas:
·      to block the actions of terrorist organizations, participates in the activities of the National Anti-
terrorism Committee of Russia, the RF Federal Security Service, the RF Ministry of Internal
Affairs;
·      traces persons intentionally inflicting harm on the Company's interests for the benefit of
competing and other third-party (including criminal) structures and persons;
·      plans and arranges events aimed at information security improvement;
·      implements the Information Safety Program in the LUKOIL Group Organizations;
·      obtains licenses issued by the RF Federal Security Service to use encryption-based
information security tools.
HSE Risks
The Company is exposed to the risk of failure of technical equipment at hazardous production
facilities, which may result in accidents, shutdown, harmful emissions, negative environmental
impact, fire and occupational injuries, including those occurring as a result of offshore oil and gas
field development. This risk may result in unscheduled shutdowns of the production capacities
and, consequently, failure to receive the expected level of operating income.
In order to mitigate these risks the Company has created and is successfully implementing an
industrial safety system, including:
·      the use of corporate standards, including without limitation those governing environmental
safety matters;
·      production control over the operation of hazardous production facilities;
·      dedicated expert training;
·      diagnostics (non-destructive inspection) and monitoring of equipment parameters;
·      assessment of workplaces based on working conditions;
·      repairs and timely replacement of equipment;
·      building up a reserve for continuous preparedness of emergency response teams and
resources;
·      other measures to minimize accident rates at the Company's production facilities.
The applicable HSE Management System certified for compliance with the requirements of ISO
14001 and OHSAS 18001 international standards ensures prompt detection of discrepancies in
work organization and equipment operation, as well as development and implementation of
corporate target industrial and fire safety programs and plans, training of service personnel and
accident prevention services in emergency response.
Risks of Failure to Implement Investment Program
While implementing investment projects, the Company has to face the risks of higher costs and
untimely commissioning of production assets.
Delays in project implementation, including those due to delays in preparation of design and
estimate documentation, obtainment of approvals, conclusion of contracts, work execution
period, as well as changes in field development plans in connection with the collection of
additional geological information may result in a failure to implement the investment program.
This may lead to the deteriorated performance indicators for the subsequent years, undermined
efficiency of investment projects and the need to raise excessive funds.
The Company pays maximum attention to managing this risk by means of quarterly monitoring of
project implementation progress accompanied by investment program adjustment. As the
investment program is developed, the greenfield development projects without any design and
estimate documentation are excluded from the plans for the coming year.
Risk Associated with Lack of Qualified Personnel
The competence and expertise of the newly recruited employees may prove insufficient for them
to adequately fulfill their duties, which, in turn, may adversely affect the financial performance
indicators of the Company.
To mitigate the negative impact of this risk, the Company focuses on integrated development of
the personnel potential. The Company has created and replenishes the personnel pool
consisting of the most experienced and the most promising employees; it pays special attention
to the recruitment of young specialists and graduates.
