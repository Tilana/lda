<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, to the Human 
Rights Council, pursuant to its resolution 16/23.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present addendum, the Special Rapporteur provides observations, where 
considered appropriate, on communications sent to States between 1 December 2011 and 
30 November 2012 , as well as on responses received from States in relation to these 
communications until 31 January 2013. Communications sent and responses received 
during the reporting period are accessible electronically through hyperlinks. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the receipt of additional responses from 
States through to 31 January 2013 in relation to the joint study on global practices in 
relation to secret detention in the context of countering terrorism (A/HRC/13/42). The 
current report does not comment on the substance of responses received so far to the joint 
study on secret detention. Subject to agreement with the other mandate-holders responsible 
for that joint report, and after more responses are received, a special report on those 
contributions will be issued.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all States which have transmitted responses to 
communications sent. He considers response to his communications an important part of 
cooperation by States with his mandate. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
paragraph 6(a) of the Human Rights Council resolution 16/23 which urges States to 
&#8220;cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her task, to 
supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to fully and expeditiously 
respond to his or her urgent appeals, and urges those Governments that have not yet 
responded to communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur to answer 
without further delay.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>5. The communications and the relevant replies can also be accessed via the 
encorporated links or in the communications reports of Special Procedures A/HRC/23/51 
(communications sent, 1 December 2012 to 28 February 2013; replies received, 1 February 
2012 to 30 April 2012); A/HRC/24/21 (communications sent, 1 March to 31 May 2013; 
replies received, 1 May to 31 July 2013) and A/HRC/25/74 (communications sent, 1 June 
to 30 November 2013; replies received, 1 August 2013 to 31 January 2014). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> JAL 29/11/2013 Case No. AFG 1/2013 State Reply: None to Date <b>Alleged unlawful 
killings and abuse by US military in Nerkh District, Wardak Province, Afghanistan.  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Afghanistan has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. According to allegations, at least 19 Afghan men were 
unlawfully killed by the US Army, 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, known as 
Operation Detachment Alpha (ODA) 3124, in the Nerkh District of Wardak Province, 
Afghanistan in late 2012 and early 2013. Many of those killed were allegedly taken into 
custody by ODA 3124 and were later found dead. It is also alleged that several detainees 
held by ODA 3124 were mistreated, harassed and beaten while in custody. Investigations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>conducted by US and Afghan authorities had reportedly made little progress. The Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government that article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions 
provides that in non-international armed conflicts, all persons not taking an active part in 
hostilities, including persons in custody, shall be treated humanely. Article 3 of the UDHR 
and article 6(1) of the ICCPR guarantee the right of every individual to life and security, 
while paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, the 
Customary Rules compiled by the ICRC and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the 
Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human 
Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law require states to 
investigate grave breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law. Similarly, 
articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture require States to conduct prompt and 
impartial investigations where there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and to prosecute suspected perpetrators. In the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the victims&#8217; rights under international 
standards relating to the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as well as other standards 
of international human rights and humanitarian law, have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Afghan Government to clarify the facts of the alleged incidents, 
undertake a prompt, independent, and effective investigation leading to the prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, provide full redress to the victims and their family 
members, and undertake effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

excessif de la force et d&#8217;arrestations subs&#233;quentes lors d&#8217;une manifestation pacifique 
de familles de disparus</b>. 
</p>
<p>7. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial confirme la r&#233;ception d&#8217;unr&#233;ponse du gouvernement de 
l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie &#224; la communication envoy&#233;e le 20 ao&#251;t 2013 concernant des all&#233;gations de 
l&#8217;usage excessif de la force de la police et des arrestations subs&#233;quentes de MM. Tarek 
Mammeri, Abdallah Benaoum, Yacine Khaldi, Slimane Hamitouche et Islam Tabbouche, 
qui prenaient part &#224; une manifestation pacifique organis&#233;e par la Coordination nationale des 
familles de disparu(e)s (CNFD) &#224; l&#8217;occasion de la journ&#233;e internationale contre la torture. 
Selon les informations re&#231;ues, ceux-ci auraient &#233;t&#233; conduits au commissariat du 11&#232;me 
arrondissement de Constantine suite &#224; leur arrestation, puis au commissariat central de 
Constantine, o&#249; ils auraient &#233;t&#233; insult&#233;s et violemment battus avant d&#8217;&#234;tre lib&#233;r&#233;s en fin de 
soir&#233;e. Selon des all&#233;gations, , &#224; leur sortie du commissariat, MM. Mammeri, Benaoum, 
Khaldi, Hamitouche et Tabbouche se seraient rendus au service des urgences m&#233;dico-
chirurgicales du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Constantine o&#249; des policiers se seraient 
alors interpos&#233;s pour enjoindre aux m&#233;decins de ne pas soumettre les victimes &#224; ces 
examens. Par ailleurs, d&#8217;autres all&#233;gations soutiennent que seul M. Mammeri aurait pu 
b&#233;n&#233;ficier d&#8217;une radiographie qui a permis de diagnostiquer une fracture de l&#8217;hum&#233;rus et la 
pose d&#8217;un pl&#226;tre thoraco brachial.  Bien que le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial confirme r&#233;ception de la 
r&#233;ponse du gouvernement, il regrette que le gouvernement n&#8217;ait pas fourni des r&#233;ponses 
plus d&#233;taill&#233;es aux craintes exprim&#233;es dans la communication. Dans ce contexte, le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial aimerait &#233;galement souligner que tout gouvernement a l&#8217;obligation de 
prot&#233;ger le droit &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et mentale de toutes personnes, tel que stipul&#233; dans la 
D&#233;claration Universelle de droits de l&#8217;homme, dans le Pacte international relatif aux droits 
civils et politiques, dans la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements 
cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants. Nous voudrions aussi attirer l&#8217;attention du gouvernement 
de son Excellence sur le principe 4 des Principes de base sur le recours &#224; la force et 
l'utilisation des armes &#224; feu par les responsables de l'application des lois : &#171; les responsables </p>

ne peuvent faire usage de la force ou d'armes &#224; feu que si les autres moyens restent sans 
effet ou ne permettent pas d'escompter le r&#233;sultat d&#233;sir&#233;. &#187; Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial 
souhaiterait &#233;galement attirer l&#8217;attention du gouvernement sur le fait qu&#8217;en vertu de l&#8217;article 
12 de la CAT les autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes doivent assurer qu&#8217;une enqu&#234;te impartiale aura lieu 
chaque fois qu'il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu'un acte de torture a &#233;t&#233; commis.  
Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial souhaiterait &#233;galement rappeler au gouvernement que l&#8217;Article 7 de 
la Convention demande aux Etats d&#8217;assurer que ceux qui sont suspects de commettre des 
actes de torture soient traduits en justice. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial exhorte le Gouvernement &#224; 
r&#233;pondre au plus vite aux craintes exprim&#233;es dans la communication, notamment en 
fournissant des informations pr&#233;cises sur les enqu&#234;tes men&#233;es afin de traduire en justice les 
auteurs des faits, et veiller &#224; ce que les victimes obtiennent r&#233;paration, y compris une 
indemnisation &#233;quitable et ad&#233;quate, et une r&#233;habilitation aussi compl&#232;te que possible.

incommunicado detention of Mr. Emiliano Catumbela &#8220;Ticreme&#8221;, and alleged 
arbitrary arrests of and excessive police actions against eight other human rights 
defenders during their participation in a vigil in Luanda on 27 May 2013.  
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Republic of Angola for its 
replies, dated 8 July 2013 and 30 September 2013, to this communication in reference to 
the alleged detention and arrest  of nine human rights defenders during their participation in 
a vigil in Luanda on 27 May 2013 and excessive police actions against them. All nine 
persons, namely Emiliano Catumbela &#8220;Ticreme&#8221;, Manuel Nito Alves, Albano Bingo, 
Nicola, Domingos Cipriano &#8220;Aristocrata&#8221;, Adolfo Miguel Campos Andr&#233;, Graciano, 
Ferbern, and Raul Lindo &#8220;Mandela&#8221;, are members of the Movimento Revolucion&#225;rio 
(Revolutionary Movement), which peacefully defends human rights, democracy and 
accountability in Angola. On 27 May 2013 the aforementioned persons took part in a 
protest in Luanda on Largo da Independ&#234;ncia, reportedly to commemorate the one-year 
anniversary of the disappearance of Messrs. Silva Alves Kamulingui (also known as 
Ant&#243;nio Alves Kamulingue) and Isa&#237;as Sebasti&#227;o Cassule. It is reported that the protesters 
encountered a heavy police presence and that several protesters were arrested by National 
Police officers and detained for several hours without charges. It was further reported that 
Mr. Lindo, also known as &#8220;Mandela&#8221;, was arrested by police officers at approximately 
2100 hours and found unconscious by the side of the road some 5 kilometers outside 
Luanda between 2200 hours and 2300 hours. Sources additionally informed that Mr. 
Catumbela was arrested during the vigil and is being detained in the Provincial Directorate 
for Criminal Investigation in Luanda. Sources inform that Mr. Catumbela has been refused 
access to his lawyer while in detention and has been interrogated nonetheless. It has been 
reported that Mr. Catumbela was seen in a cell at a police station and his face allegedly 
displayed serious injuries. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalled paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus 
never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-
derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221;  In its replies, the Government of the Republic of Angola stated that the 
alleged report that Mr. Catumbela&#8217;s face displayed serious injury at the police station was 
not accurate, and that the Government could not verify the allegations of arbitrary arrest or 
excessive police action against the eight other human rights defenders or protesters. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>Government stated that Mr. Catumbela was detained and charged with assault and 
attempted murder of a police Commander of the Municipality during the vigil and was 
released on 25 June 2013 by the Attorney General of the Republic at the National 
Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DNIC) pending his future trial. Although the Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the reply, he would like to remind the Republic of Angola that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. He notes with regret that the Government did not address the allegations 
concerning Mr. Lindo, also known as &#8220;Mandela&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government of its obligation to take persistent, determined and effective measures to have 
all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, competent domestic 
authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an act has 
been committed.

</b>9. El Relator Especial lamenta que, hasta la fecha, el Gobierno de Argentina no haya 
respondido a la comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 17 de enero de 2013. La comunicaci&#243;n expresaba 
preocupaci&#243;n por la posible adopci&#243;n de una nueva legislaci&#243;n a estudio de la Honorable

hace referencia al Gobierno de Argentina al avance significativo que dicho mecanismo de 
registro ha tenido en la prevenci&#243;n y eliminaci&#243;n de actos de tortura en la Provincia de 
Buenos. Asimismo, recalca que su creaci&#243;n respondi&#243; principalmente a las 
recomendaciones del Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas 
(CCPR/C/ARG/CO/4) ante el considerable n&#250;mero de casos  de torturas y malos tratos. Las

and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Azerbaijan for its reply, dated 20 
March 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture and ill-treatment of 
Mr. Hilal Mammadov. It is alleged that during his arrest he was subjected to torture and ill 
treatment, as well as while he was in pre-trial detention. Mr. Mammadov&#8217;s cell mate who 
reportedly suffers from a serious mental disease, has reportedly been beating Mr. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>Mammadov. Mr. Mammadov is reportedly charged with high treason for incitement to 
national, racial or religious hostility, and there is concern these charges are directly related 
to his human rights activities. In its reply, the Government of Azerbaijan explains the 
medical procedures that are meant to guarantee Mr. Mammadov is not suffering from any 
medical conditions and maintained that a thorough investigation has been conducted to 
affirm no torture was committed. The Government also asserts that all necessary actions 
were performed to properly investigate Mr. Mammadov&#8217;s claims that his cellmate was 
beating him. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply, the Government of 
Azerbaijan has not answered what protections for human rights defenders are in place to 
allow them to work without fear of threats or acts of intimidation, harassment, or 
criminalization. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates article 12 of the 
Convention Against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires 
State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur would 
also like to reiterate paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges 
States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and 
impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, 
order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and 
severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the 
prohibited act is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the 
Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in 
efforts to combat torture;&#8221;. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the 
Government of Azerbaijan of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also encourages 
the Government to continue its engagement with the mandate.

</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 5 June 
2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged arrest, detention and torture of Mr. 
Naji Fateel. Mr. Naji Fateel is a board member of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human 
Rights (BYSHR) and an active blogger and social media user who publishes daily messages 
on human rights issues. It is reported that in recent times he has given daily speeches during 
marches in which he stresses the importance of documenting human rights violations and 
encourages people to form monitoring committees. It is reported that he was the subject of 
electrocution to the back, left leg and genitalia; simulated drowning; beatings to the head, 
back and left leg, which reportedly was operated previously in relation to a work injury; 
suspension from the ceiling by hanging him from his hands without his feet touching the 
floor; sexual harassment and threats of rape; being refused permission to sleep, sit or lay 
down; and being made to stand up for prolonged periods of time. Allegedly after requesting 
counsel during his interrogation, he was subjected to more severe beating. It is reported that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the Public Prosecutor charged Mr. Fateel with alleged &quot;establishment of a group in order to 
disable the provisions of the Constitution&quot; and order his imprisonment for a period of sixty 
days pending investigation under the terrorism law. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for the response dated 5 June 2013 where it was stated that Mr. Fateel was 
inciting suspension of the Constitution and violating citizens&#8217; personal freedoms through 
terrorism. Allegedly Mr. Fateel was interrogated only once and a forensic physician was 
charged with investigating any injuries and concluded no ill-treatment was committed. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to remind the government of Bahrain of paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus 
never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-
derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur would also like to remind the Government of article 
12 of the CAT and paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which require 
the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there 
are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, 
which requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The 
government&#8217;s response does not offer satisfactory evidence that the forensic doctor&#8217;s 
examination was conducted with the appropriate guarantees of independence and 
impartiality. In addition, and in regards to any criminal prosecution of Mr. Fateel, article 15 
of the CAT and paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, provide that 
&#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as 
a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur also encourages the government of Bahrain to continue its engagement with the 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>14. On 29 September 2013 Mr. Fateel was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment by 
Branch 4 of the High Criminal Court. The Special Rapporteur notes that the allegations of 
torture have not been investigated and were not considered by the court.

Mr. Nabeel Rajab in Jaw Prison after revealing alleged acts of torture of young detainees by 
police officers. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 24 
June 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged temporary isolation of Mr. 
Nabeel Rajab from his cell in Jaw prison after having witnessed acts of torture of young 
detainees by police officers. Mr. Rajab is the Director of the Bahrain Centre for Human 
Rights (BCHR) and is currently serving a two-year prison sentence in Jaw prison after 
having been convicted on charges of calling for and participating in peaceful 
demonstrations. Mr Rajab has been the subject of several previous communications,  most 
recently a joint urgent appeal sent on 24 July 2012 sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteurs on the protection and promotion of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression; on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association; on human rights defenders; and on the independence of judges and lawyers 
concerning Mr Rajab&#8217;s health and allegations of denial of access to adequate medical 
treatment. No response was provided to these allegations. According to the information 
received, Mr. Rajab made a phone call on 14 May 2013, describing how he had witnessed 
young political prisoners being tortured at the hands of police officers in Jaw prison. 
Allegedly, on the same evening, relatives of Mr. Rajab received a telephone call stating that 
Mr. Rajab would not be allowed to call his family for two weeks, and that he had been 
removed from his prison cell by guards and not returned. Reportedly, his health remains </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>uncertain. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response dated 5 June 
2013 where it was stated that Mr. Rajab&#8217;s complaint regarding the torture of other inmates 
was investigated and it was not found that he had been punished for making the incidents 
known. Regarding Mr. Rajab&#8217;s health, the government of Bahrain asserts that he is in good 
health, and provided him with doctors on 17 June 2013 for his back pain, a broken denture 
and pain in the gallbladder. In relation to the allegations that Mr. Rajab may have witnessed 
the torture and ill-treatment of detainees in Jaw prison and his subsequent temporary 
isolation, including the denial to contact his family, the Special Rapporteur wishes to draw 
attention to the right to physical and mental integrity of the above-mentioned person. In this 
regard, article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, provides that 
&#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the 
restriction of its use, should be undertaken and encouraged&#8221; (adopted by the General 
Assembly by resolution 45/111 of 14 December 1990). In addition, the interim report to the 
General Assembly of 5 August 2011 (A/66/268) of the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, stated that where the physical 
conditions and the prison regime of solitary confinement cause severe mental and physical 
pain or suffering, when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely, 
prolonged, on juveniles or persons with mental disabilities, can amount to cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture. The Special Rapporteur would also 
like to remind the Government of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners (Adopted by the Economic and Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 
31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977). Rule 22 provides that, &#8220;(s)ick prisoners 
who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil 
hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, 
furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment 
of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers. Furthermore, Rule 
25(1) provides that, &#8220;(t)he medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental 
health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, 
and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed&#8221; (approved by the Economic 
and Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 
May 1977). The Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee have 
consistently found that conditions of detention can amount to inhuman and degrading 
treatment. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the government of Bahrain to continue 
its engagement with the mandate. 
</p>
<p>16. On Friday 29 November 2013, Mr. Rajab has served three quarters of his two year 
sentence and became legally eligible for release. On 2 December 2013, the Bahraini court 
of Appeals has rejected his request for early release (see BHR 7/3013).

</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Kingdom of 
Bahrain, dated 29 August 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged 
irregularities in the trials of human rights defenders, including possible acts of reprisals for 
co-operation with the United Nations against one of them, and alleged torture or other 
forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of another while in detention. According to 
the information received, on 25 June 2013, Ms Zainab Alkhawaja was sentenced to two 
further months of imprisonment on the basis of charges of having assaulted two police 
officers while in detention. It is also reported that on 1 July 2013, the Court of Cassation 
rejected the application of Mr Mahdi Abu Deeb to suspend previous convictions against 
him until the completion of investigations of allegations of torture or other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment against him. It is further reported that Mr Mahdi Abu Deeb 
does not receive adequate medical attention in detention, and has possibly been subjected to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>torture. Moreover, Mr Mohamed Al-Maskati reportedly faces trial on charges of 
&#8220;participation in illegal protests,&#8221; after his co-operation with the United Nations during the 
Universal Periodic Review of the Kingdom of Bahrain. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that each government shall guarantee that no persons are deprived 
arbitrarily of their liberty and granted a fair proceeding before an independent and impartial 
tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR).  Further, the Special Rapporteur stresses that each Government has the obligation 
to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons as set forth inter alia in 
the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).  Additionally, the Government of Bahrain is 
reminded that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 condemns all forms 
of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and calls upon 
governments to implement an absolute and non-derogable prohibition of it. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates article 12 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires the 
competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the 
Convention Against Torture, which requires States Parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture.  The Special Rapporteur requests an additional response from the 
Government of Bahrain regarding the aforementioned mistreatments and detentions and 
reminds the government that individual freedoms shall be protected.  The Special 
Rapporteur further request that should the Government&#8217;s investigation find the allegations 
to be correct that any person responsible be held accountable.

of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly following 22 recommendations to 
amend the anti-terrorism Law no. 58 of 2006. 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply dated 4 September 2013 
to allegations regarding harsh new anti-terrorism laws recently passed by the Government.  
According to the information received, the National Assembly endorsed 22 
recommendations on 28 July 2013 and his Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa agreed 
to their implementation on 29 July 2013. It is alleged that some of these recommendations 
have already been adopted, while adoption of the others is imminent. The recommendations 
include provisions for revoking citizenship of those who carry out terrorist crimes; the 
imposition of harsher sentences on anyone involved in acts of terrorism; banning sit-ins, 
public gatherings in the capital; the extension of security forces powers to protect society 
from terrorist acts; the imposition of harsher sentences for anyone propagating illegal 
information in social media networks; the ability for the authorities to take legal action 
against political associations which incite and support acts of violence and terrorism, and 
the ability to take all possible measures to impose peace and security, amongst others. The 
Law no. 58 of 2006 has been the subject of two earlier communications sent on 29 March 
(AL BHR 3/2006) and 30 June 2006 (UA BHR 5/2006), see A/HRC/4/26/Add.1, paras. 14-
15. The government responded to these allegations by stressing the need to respond to 
growing instances of terrorist activities as well as to ensure that not all measures within the 
allegation have been adopted due to reservations about lack of human rights protections.  
The Government further reports that measures that have been adopted provide adequate 
limitations and definitions to criminal sanctions so as to prevent abuse; the Government 
emphasized further its commitment to promote and implement human rights protections 
moving forward.  The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply to the 
concerns expressed, but would also like to stress further that the prohibition of torture is 
absolute and non-derogable.  Thus no grounds of national security concerns can justify 
policies which promote or encourage the use of torture.  Such is expressed in article 2(2) of 
the Convention Against Torture, which provides that no exceptional circumstances </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political in stability or any 
other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture. In this regard the 
Special Rapporteur notes paragraph 2 of Resolution 16/23 of the Human Rights Council, 
which &#8220;Condemns in particular any action or attempt by States or public officials to 
legalize, authorize or acquiesce to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment under any circumstances, including on grounds of national security or 
through judicial decisions, and urges States to ensure accountability for all such acts.&#8221;  The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to maintain its engagement with the 
mandate and urges the implementation of legal provisions which do not serve to encourage 
or promote the use of torture or other ill treatment in the name of national security.

<p> <b>(e) </b>JUA 28/08/2013 Case No. BHR 6/2013 State reply: 01/10/2013 <b>Alleged arbitrary 
detention, torture, and ill-treatment of two female and one male human rights 
activists.</b> 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 3 
December 2013, to this communication in reference to allegations concerning the arbitrary 
detention, torture, and ill-treatment of Ms. Rihanna Al-Musawi and Ms. Nafeesa Al-Asfoor, 
and of the arbitrary and incommunicado detention of Mr. Abas Al-Asfoor. According to the 
information received, Ms. Al-Musawi and Ms. Al-Asfoor, who were protesting the 
imprisonment of two other activists at the time of their arrest and were charged under the 
2006 terrorism law, have been subjected to torture in detention. They were also reportedly 
denied access to counsel and family visits and not extended proper judicial safeguards 
during their trial, which was ongoing at the time of the communication. The Special 
Rapporteur expressed grave concern about these allegations and the possibility that they 
could be related to their activities in defense of human rights and reveal a recent consistent 
pattern of targeting women protesters. In its reply, the Government stated that Ms. Al-
Musawi and Ms. Al-Asfoor were arrested on the premises of the Bahrain International 
Circuit (Formula One) after their suspicious behavior led to a police search, which found 
that Ms. Al-Asfoor had placed a cotton pillow inside her clothes in order to appear 
pregnant. The Government further stated that on the same day, the women confessed to 
having considered detonating a homemade bomb at a Formula One event.  The Government 
submits that two days after their arrest, both women were questioned by the public 
prosecutor in the presence of lawyers, admitted to some of the charges brought against 
them, and were examined by forensic physicians who determined that they showed no signs 
of injury contemporaneous with the time of their arrest. The Government explained that 
they were subsequently detained for a period of 60 days, which was renewed in September 
2013. With regards to Mr. Al-Asfoor, the Government submits that he was also detained 
and charged under the terrorism law after Ms. Al-Musawi and Ms. Al-Asfoor mentioned his 
name during questioning. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the State&#8217;s reply, he 
notes that it does not address the allegations of torture and mistreatment or Ms. Al-
Musawi&#8217;s allegations that her testimony to this effect was not properly recorded in the trial 
record, nor does it explain what investigation, if any, was conducted into them. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation to protect the 
right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur draws attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur 
further reiterates article 12 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the 
Convention Against Torture, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture.  The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a 
thorough, impartial and independent investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment and to take all necessary measures to protect the right of Ms. Al-Musawi and Ms. 
Al-Asfoor to physical and mental integrity.  If the investigation leads to the identification of 
responsible parties, to hold them accountable and to provide full redress to the victims, 
including fair and adequate compensation and as full rehabilitation as possible. The Special 
also encourages the Government of Bahrain to continue its engagement with the mandate.

<p>20. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 5 
November 2013, to this communication in reference to allegations concerning the 
sentencing of Mr. Naji Fateel, a blogger and board member of the Bahrain Youth Society 
for Human Rights (BYSHR), to 15 years imprisonment, reportedly in connection with his 
human rights activism. Mr. Fateel was the subject of a previous communication dealing 
with serious allegations of torture against Mr. Fateel while in detention. The Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the reply received to this communication from the Government on 5 
June 2013 but expresses concern that the allegations of torture were not adequately 
addressed. According to the new information received, Mr. Fateel has been sentenced to 15 
years imprisonment under the Anti-Terrorism law on charges that had been previously 
dropped, and allegations of torture during interrogation in the Criminal Investigations 
Directorate (CDI) have continued, along with reports that photographic evidence of torture 
exists. In its reply, the Government reiterates the charges brought against Mr. Fateel and 
makes reference to evidence, including confessions, in support of his sentence. The 
Government also provides that an appeal in Mr. Fateel&#8217;s case was scheduled to be heard on 
18 November 2013. With regard to the complaint of torture and ill-treatment, the 
Government submits that Mr. Fateel was visited and interviewed in prison after lodging a 
complaint in May 2013, and that the interview revealed that he had previously been referred 
to a forensic physician during his questioning by the public prosecutor, who found no signs 
indicating ill-treatment. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the 
Government, he reiterates article 12 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which 
requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation 
wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and 
article 7 of the CAT, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of 
torture. In this context, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern that the allegations of 
torture and ill-treatment were not adequately addressed and would appreciate more 
complete information concerning the investigation into the allegations and their results. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the 
mandate. He also wishes to remind the Government of its obligation to provide full redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to all 
victims of torture or other ill-treatment.

<p> <b>(g) </b>JAL 26/11/2013 Case No. BHR 8/2013 State Reply: 23/01/2014 <b>Allegations of arbitrary 
detention, torture and ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 23 
January 2014, to this communication in reference to allegations of arbitrary detention, 
torture and ill-treatment. The communication detailed allegations of arrest, detention, ill 
treatment, and intimidation of Ms. X and her sister.  It is alleged that law enforcement 
officers arrested Ms. X and her sister at their home following Ms. X&#8217;s participation in a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>peaceful demonstration at the University of Bahrain. They were charged with &#8220;participation 
in illegal assembly&#8221;, &#8220;illegal possession of weapons&#8221;, and &#8220;destruction of university 
property&#8221;. Ms. X and her sister were taken to an unknown location where Ms. X was 
separated from her sister and was reportedly beaten during interrogations and threatened 
with rape for the purposes of extracting confessions. Ms. X and her sister were 
subsequently released the following morning. Ms. X was later tried by the Criminal Court 
of Bahrain and was sentenced to 40 days in prison and a fine of 200 Bahraini dinar. It is 
also reported that Ms. X was prohibited from presenting evidence of her innocence, 
including eye witness testimony, at her trial.  On at least two occasions, she was reportedly 
expelled from the University of Bahrain, arrested and released shortly afterwards. Serious 
concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. X and her sister. 
Grave concern is expressed at the fact that Ms. X&#8217;s detention may be linked to her recent 
participation in a peaceful assembly.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
recall paragraph  7.c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which reminds States that 
&#8220; [&#8230;] detention in secret places may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such 
treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and 
dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are 
abolished.&#8221;  Also relevant is paragraph 7b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, 
which urges States &#8220;[T]o take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all 
allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, competent domestic 
authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an act has 
been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts 
responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with 
the gravity of the offence [&#8230;].&#8221;  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur recalls article 21 of 
the ICCPR, which provides that &quot;The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No 
restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in 
conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of 
national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health 
or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&#8221;  With regards to the 
subsequent trial of Ms. X, the Special Rapporteur notes article 15 of the CAT, which 
provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have 
been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except 
against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221;  The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to conduct a prompt and independent investigation of the 
allegations of arrest, torture, and continuing intimidation of Ms. X and her sister and hold 
those responsible for these abuses accountable.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government to ensure the identified persons obtain redress, including fair and 
adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

February 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged excessive use of force 
against peaceful demonstrators in January 2013, organized by teachers, employees of 
nongovernmental schools, colleges and technical education institutions, who were

spray, batons, and water cannons to disperse the protestors. It is reported that at least 20 
teachers were injured, 10 were taken to the Dhaka Medical Hospital, and one died.. In its 
reply, the Government of Bangladesh simply acknowledged receipt of the joint allegation 
letter but did not address any of the concerns contained in the letter, nor did the 
Government confirm or deny the facts surrounding the excessive use of force against these 
peaceful demonstrators, or the fact that police repression resulted in serious injury to 
demonstrators.     The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Bangladesh to 
address the concerns surrounding the January 2013 peaceful protests, and encourages the 
Government to continue its engagement with the mandate.

property. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Bangladesh for its reply, dated 7 
May 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged arrest of Mr. Mahmudur 
Rahman, the interim Editor of the Bangladeshi newspaper Amar Desh (Daily Amardesh), 
charged with sedition because of reportedly reproducing a Skype conversation between a 
and a person living abroad concerning an ongoing trial, charged with destruction of 
property, and facing charges relating to having published a letter along with a photograph. 
Mr. Rahman was held in police custody for six days, before the police handed him over to 
judicial remand. It is alleged that on the second day, Mr. Rahman was subjected to torture 
and ill-treatment, including severe beatings, the hammering of iron nails into his body, and 
electric shock. It is further reported that on 18 April 2013, at his court hearing, Mr. 
Rahman, who also suffers from a heart condition that requires ongoing medical attention, 
appeared to have fresh wounds on his legs and bloodstains and had difficulty sitting. It is 
further reported that Mr. Rahman went on a hunger strike to protest the alleged unlawful 
closure of the Daily Amar Desh and the detention of 19 persons who have allegedly been 
arrested for supporting the newspaper. Furthermore, Mr. Rahman's arrest appears to be the 
continuation of large-scale indiscriminate arrests and other forms of state-sponsored threats 
and intimidation against dissenting voices in Bangladesh. This pattern has allegedly 
increased in the past 70 days. The Special Rapporteur would like to remind the government 
of Bangladesh of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur would also like to 
remind the Government of article 12 of the CAT, that the government of Bangladesh 
acceded to on 5 October 1998, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. Also paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8 urges States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have 
all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who 
encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to 
justice and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention 
where the prohibited act is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of 
the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful 
tool in efforts to combat torture.&#8221; Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
reiterate article 14 of the CAT, which provides that victims of torture should have the right </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>to redress and adequate compensation. In this regard, paragraph 6 (e) of Resolution 8/8 of 
the Human Rights Council urges States &#8220;To ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment obtain redress and are awarded fair and 
adequate compensation and receive appropriate socio-medical rehabilitation, and in this 
regard encourages the development of rehabilitation centers for victims of torture.&#8221; The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Bangladesh to continue its engagement 
with the mandate.  In the meantime, and on the basis of the information available to him, 
the Special Rapporteur finds that the government of Bangladesh has violated the rights of 
Mr. Rahman under the international law concerning torture.

</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for its reply dated 20 
June 2013, to an urgent appeal regarding the alleged abduction and possible torture of 
political opposition leader Nazrul Islam.  According to the information received, during the 
night of 11 April 2013, Mr Nazrul Islam, the Joypurhat District Secretary of Jamaat-e-
Islami, a political party belonging to a multi-party opposition alliance, was allegedly 
abducted from his home in Saheb Parha, Joypurhat District, Bangladesh. It is reported that, 
the alleged perpetrators identified themselves as being &#8220;from the administration&#8221; and took 
Mr Islam on a minibus to an unknown location. At the time of the appeal, the fate and 
whereabouts of Mr Islam remained unknown.  While the Government of Bangladesh 
acknowledged receipt of the communication and ensured cooperation, the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that no substantive reply regarding the allegations or the whereabouts of 
Mr Islam has been received.  The Special Rapporteur stresses the Government&#8217;s obligations 
to ensure the physical and mental integrity of Mr Islam and all people.  In this regard,  the 
Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
&#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
expresses concern regarding the appearance that Mr Islam was allegedly abducted as a 
result of his participation in the political opposition.  Accordingly, it is reiterated that article 
22 of the ICCPR, as well as in Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, &#8220;reminds States of 
their obligation to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble 
peacefully and associate freely, online as well as offline, including in the context of 
elections, and including persons espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human 
rights defenders, trade unionists and others, including migrants, seeking to exercise or to 
promote these rights, and to take all necessary measures to ensure that any restrictions on 
the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are in 
accordance with their obligations under international human rights law.&#8221;  The Government 
is encouraged to engage with the mandate and to provide information regarding the 
whereabouts of Mr. Islam or any investigations conducted on this matter.

<p>25. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for its reply dated 27 
June 2013, to an urgent appeal regarding the alleged abduction of university student and 
political activist Mr. Anwarul Islam by government forces to an unknown location where 
he allegedly faces continued risk of torture and extra-judicial execution.  Particularly 
concerning is that these allegations arise in light of reports of recent clashes between Mr.

resolution 21/16, which, &#8220;reminds States of their obligation to respect and fully protect the

human rights law.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur urges the government to take prompt action to 
investigate the whereabouts and ensure the safety of Mr. Anwarul Islam.  It is also urged 
that the Government engage meaningfully with the Special Rapporteur and other human

the Special Rapporteur concludes that Mr. Anwarul Islam has been the victim of very 
severe human rights violations.

</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Bangladesh has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan, 
Secretary of Odhikar, a non-governmental organization that disseminates information 
relating to human rights and human rights abuses through monitoring and training projects. 
It is reported that on 10 August 2013, Mr. Khan was allegedly arrested at his home in 
Dhaka by a group of men in plain clothes who identified themselves as officers from the 
Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police. It is reported that Mr. Khan was taken into 
custody without an arrest warrant and was refused access to a lawyer. According to 
information received, arrests such as Mr. Khan&#8217;s are often accompanied by brutal forms of 
torture and death in custody. It was further alleged that Mr. Khan was at very acute risk of 
torture. Serious concerns were expressed about Mr. Khan&#8217;s physical and psychological 
integrity while in detention and that his charges, arrest and detention may have been linked 
to his legitimate human rights activities.  
</p>
<p>27. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that each Government 
has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This 
right is set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR and the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), which the 
Government of Bangladesh acceded to on 5 October 1998. The Special Rapporteur would 
also like to draw attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States

<p><b> (a)</b> JUA 01/10/2013 Case No. BLR 3/2013 State reply: 18/12/2013 <b>Alleged risk of executions.</b>  
28. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Belarus for its detailed response, 
dated 18 December 2013, concerning the criminal cases against Messrs. Pavel Selyun, 
Rygor Yuzepchuk and Alyaksandr Haryunou, who were sentenced to death in 2013 under 
charges of murder. In relation to Messrs. Pavel Selyun and Rygor Yuzepchuk, the 
Government stated that the court&#8217;s verdict was based on the fact that the above-mentioned 
individuals committed particularly severe crimes and that they posed serious danger to 
society. The Government has further stated that the proceedings in the case of Mr. Selyun 
were held behind closed doors in order to prevent the disclosure of information about 
intimate details of the defendant&#8217;s life and the circumstances of the crime, in accordance 
with the requirements of Article 23, part 2 of the Criminal Procedural Code of Belarus. The 
Government stated that on 17 September 2013 and on 12 July 2013, the Supreme Court 
upheld the regional court&#8217;s sentence to death by firing squad against Mr. Selyun and Mr. 
Yuzepchuk, respectively. According to the Government, both Mr. Selyun and Mr. 
Yuzepchuk have submitted petition for pardon. In relation to Mr. Yuzepchuk, the 
Government stated that on 23 April 2013, the Mogilevskiy regional court has sentenced Mr. 
Yuzepchuk to death penalty by firing squad in a publicly held court hearing. In relation to 
Mr. Haryunou, the Government stated that on 22 October 2013, the Supreme Court of the 
Republic of Belarus has repealed the verdict of the Gomelskiy regional court from 14 June 
2013, in view of incomplete and one-sided judicial investigation, as well as due to 
inconsistency of the court&#8217;s conclusion with the factual circumstances of the case. The 
court ordered the Gomelskiy regional court to reconsider the case with a new composition 
of judges. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court repealing 
the regional court&#8217;s decision in relation to Mr. Haryunou.  However, he regrets that the 
Government did not provide information on the legal grounds for the imposition of the 
death penalty against Mr. Haryunou, who was alleged to have been diagnosed with a 
psycho-social disability.  
</p>
<p>29. With respect to the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to uphold the death sentences against 
Messrs. Selyun and Yuzepchuk, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Belarus to 
take all steps to prevent their execution, which if carried out, would be inconsistent with 
acceptable standards of international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur draws the 
attention of the Government of Belarus to the Rapporteur&#8217;s report submitted to the UN 
General Assembly (A/67/279), in which he called upon all States to reconsider whether the 
use of the death penalty per se respects the inherent dignity of the human person, or instead 
causes severe mental and physical pain or suffering and thus constitutes a violation of the 
prohibitions of torture and of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment (para. 79). Moreover, 
the Special Rapporteur called upon all retentionist States to observe rigorously the 
restrictions and conditions imposed by article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR) and articles 1 and 16 of the Convention against Torture (para. 80).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>That report also called on States to abolish the use of the death penalty for persons with 
mental disabilities; to end the practice of secret executions; and to end the practice of 
executions with little or no prior warning given to condemned prisoners and their families. 
The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the 
mandate.

consecuencias que conlleva la penalizaci&#243;n de dicho servicio de salud sexual y 
reproductiva. En este contexto, hace referencia a su informe tem&#225;tico (A/HRC/22/53), en el 
que concluye que pr&#225;ctica de negar servicios reproductivos cuando el aborto est&#225; 
legalmente disponible incrementa de facto el n&#250;mero de abortos inseguros, exponiendo a 
las mujeres a consecuencias graves y duraderas para su salud f&#237;sica y mental, incluyendo el 
riesgo de muerte y discapacidad. El Relator celebra el proyecto de ley No. 348 y los nuevos 
mecanismos de prevenci&#243;n, protecci&#243;n y reparaci&#243;n a las v&#237;ctimas de violencia sexual; 
violencia contra los derechos reproductivos; violencia contra los derechos y libertad sexual, 
as&#237; como, la violencia en servicios de salud. En el caso particular de los mecanismos en 
contra de la violencia en servicios de salud, el Relator Especial quisiera destacar que el 
Estado define la falta de acceso a la atenci&#243;n eficaz e inmediata y la informaci&#243;n oportuna 
como, &#8220;un acto discriminante, humillante y deshumanizado&#8221;. En este contexto, reitera que 
en los casos en que el aborto es el &#250;nico medio disponible para evitar un peligro contra la 
vida o la salud de la mujer, el requisito de autorizaci&#243;n judicial establecido por el C&#243;digo 
Penal constituye un impedimento real y considerable al acceso de la mujer al aborto. El 
Relator Especial insta al Gobierno de Bolivia a asegurar mayor coherencia legislativa entre 
los mecanismos antes mencionados, facilitando el acceso a servicios de aborto y la atenci&#243;n 
posaborto con el fin de poner fin a la violencia en servicios de salud. El Relator Especial 
expresa complacencia por las conclusiones de la cumbre &#8220;Encuentro Plurinacional para 
Profundizar el Proceso de Cambio&#8221;, en las que se plantea la necesidad de elaborar un

<p>31. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Cambodia has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to events that occurred during a demonstration 
held by the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) in Phnom Penh on 15 September 
2013.  During the course of the demonstration, a group of rioters allegedly became 
frustrated by police roadblocks and spontaneously began to violently attack police forces </p>

<p>and property in the vicinity of the roadblocks.  It is reported that this situation led to the 
firing of smoke grenades and live ammunition by security forces against the crowd, 
including peaceful demonstrators, and that a by-standing construction worker who was 
returning home from work, Mr. Mao Sok Chan, was shot in the head and died at the scene. 
It is further reported that nine other persons, eight of whom sustained bullet wounds, were 
seriously injured and that several others, including juveniles, were severely beaten by 
security forces using truncheons. Six persons who allegedly did not participate in the 
rioting or the aforementioned incident, namely Mr. Ngeang Thy Doek, Mr. Ek Chanu, Mr. 
Taing Chong, Mr. Song Nisay, Mr. Lanh Samoeun, and Mr. Vann Noeun, were reported 
beaten and arrested by police forces, and placed in pre-trial detention, where they remained 
at the time of the communication. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government that the use of lethal force by law enforcement officials is strictly regulated 
under international human rights law, and reiterates Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles 
on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement 
officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms,&#8221; and Basic Principle 9, which further specifies 
that &#8220;Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-
defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to 
prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to 
arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or 
her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives.&#8221;  
The Special Rapporteur concludes that Cambodia is responsible for the cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment of several of its citizens and calls on the Government to undertake a 
prompt and independent investigation into excessive and indiscriminate use of force, 
including lethal force, by law enforcement officials and to provide full redress to the 
victims.

law enforcement officials.  It is reported that on 20 September 2013 a peaceful protest of 
about 30 individuals at Wat Phnom in Phnom Penh was ended by hundreds of military 
police.  It is further reported that on 22 September 2013 a group of 25 individuals from the 
Boeung Kak Lake community, including women and children, gathered peacefully at Wat 
Phnom to begin a hunger strike against election irregularities.  According to the information 
received, a large group of Daun Penh district police, military police, and civilian clothed 
young people headed by Daun Penh district Deputy Governor Sok Penh Vuth arrived at 
Wat Phnom armed with batons slingshots, teasers and electric prods.  It is alleged that the 
security forces and youth broke the torch light of the protesters to prevent people from 
taking photos and proceeded to beat and fire marbles with slingshots at the demonstrators.  
It is reported that at least ten people suffered injuries from light to serious, some were 
admitted to the hospital, and two cars belonging to human rights activists were damaged.  It 
is further alleged that upon arrival, human rights monitors and journalists were similarly 
assaulted and had their material destroyed.  Two civil society human rights monitors, one 
wearing a clearly visible jacket inscribed with &#8220;Human Rights Observer&#8221; and five 
journalists were allegedly among the people attacked.  Based on the information available, 
injuries included: gun shots in the chest and face with marbles, open wounds to the leg and 
chin, and a broken arm.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur express concern for the 
physical and psychological integrity of those seeking to exercise the right to peacefully </p>

<p>assemble.  Specifically the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Cambodia that 
Article 12 paragraphs 2 and 3 of Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides that the State shall take all necessary measures 
to ensure that everyone, individually and collectively, is protected against violence, threats, 
retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action.  
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur references Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on 
the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials to draw the governments attention to the 
requirement that law enforcement officials employ non-violent means, as far as possible, 
before resorting to the use of force and firearms.  Additionally Principle 5 is reiterated to 
emphasize that law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act proportionally to 
the seriousness of the offense, minimize damage and injury, respect and preserve life, 
ensure assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons as early as 
possible, and relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the 
earliest possible moment. The Government is further reminded that Article 4 of the UN 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women creates a State responsibility to 
prevent investigate, and punish acts of violence against women and ensure that women who 
are subjected to violence  are provided access to mechanism of justice and remedies for 
harm suffered.  Lastly, the Special Rapporteur draws the Government&#8217;s attention to general 
recommendation No. 19 (1992) of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women which asserts that &#8220;States may also be responsible for private acts if they 
fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or the investigate and punish 
acts of violence.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur concludes with a request for a response from the 
Government of Cambodia. The Special Rapporteur further requests that that rights of 
involved persons be respected and if the allegations are correct, the person(s) responsible be 
held accountable.

and detention of, and alleged excessive use of force against, peaceful demonstrators in the 
Tibet Autonomous Region. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China 
for its reply, dated 7 February 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged arrest 
and excessive use of force against peaceful student demonstrators from Tsolho Technical 
School in Gonghe (Chabcha in Tibetan) for the release of an official Chinese booklet 
mocking the Tibetan language and that labeled the self-immolations by Tibetans as 
&#8220;stupidity.&#8221; It is reported that security forces fired warning gunshots and tear gas to 
disperse the demonstrators, 20 students were reportedly injured, five of whom were 
hospitalized in critical condition, and four students were arrested in the course of the 
operation. In its reply, the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China explained that the 
students were arrested and dispersed because they did not comply with the proper 
procedure to organize a demonstration. The Government did not however, address the 
current status of the student&#8217;s administrative detention, nor did they answer how the 
measures &#8211; particularly the excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators -- are 
compatible with the mentioned international human rights norms and standards. Although 
the Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply, he would like to remind the People&#8217;s Republic 
of China that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the UDHR and the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). 
On the basis of the information available to him, the Special Rapporteur finds that China </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>has violated its obligations under international law applicable to torture and cruel, inhuman

international human rights laws.</b>  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China 
for its reply, dated 21 March 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged risk of 
imminent execution after proceedings that did not comply with international human rights 
laws regarding fair trial and due process guarantees. According to the information received, 
on 24 August 2011, Ms. Li Yan, aged 41, was sentenced to death by the Ziyang City 
Intermediate People&#8216;s Court for the murder of her husband on 3 November 2010. The 
Supreme People&#8216;s Court in Beijing rejected her appeal and she is reportedly at risk of 
imminent execution. Allegedly, Ms. Li Yan committed the murder after being subjected to 
prolonged domestic violence and the repeated failure of the police authorities to protect her 
and investigate the abuses against her. During the legal proceedings conducted against her, 
Ms. Li Yan reportedly did not receive adequate legal assistance. The evidence of the 
defense was allegedly not given adequate consideration, and the defense witnesses were 
reportedly not invited to testify. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates to the 
Government of China that in countries that have not abolished the death penalty, capital 
punishment may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and due 
process safeguards, as provided in articles 6(2) and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Further, Article 5 of the United Nations Safeguards 
Protecting the Rights of those Facing the Death Penalty provides that &#8220;Capital punishment 
may only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court after a 
legal process which gives all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial, at least equal to those 
contained in article 14 of the ICCPR, including the right . . . to adequate legal assistance.&#8221; 
The Special Rapporteur further recalls that Safeguard 4 stipulates that &#8220;capital punishment 
may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and 
convincing evidence . . . .&#8221; It is reiterated that only full respect for stringent due process 
guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law 
from a summary execution. The Special Rapporteur additionally points to paragraph 18 of 
the General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture which requires State 
authorities to diligently prevent, investigate, prosecute, and punish acts of torture or ill-
treatment committed by non-State officials or private actors or bear responsibility for 
consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts. The Special Rapporteur urged the 
Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Ms. 
Li Yan are respected and, in the event that your investigations support or suggest the stated 
allegations are correct, the accountability of any person responsible is ensured. It is further 
requested, that in the future effective measures are adopted to prevent the recurrence of 
these acts.

<p>in Yushu (Tibetan: Kyegudo) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai province; as well as 
the detention of three Tibetan monks and two lay Tibetan men in Dzachuka area, Serxu 
(Tibetan: Sershul) County, in Sichuan province. According to the information received 
arrests in the Zuogang county, Qamdo Prefecture involved six Tibetans who were arrested 
for allegedly participating in a protest and were reportedly beaten by the security officials 
after their arrest, and their current whereabouts are unknown. Similarly in Mangkang 
County, Qamdo Prefecture monks were arrested for participating in a protest, and currently 
the conditions and whereabouts of six of these detained monks are unknown. Ngawang 
Topden was arrested and convicted in the city of Lhasa, capital of the TAR for storing in 
his mobile phone images of Tibetans self-immolations, the Tibetan flag and other photos 
showing Chinese abuse of Tibetans. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment accusing 
him of being &quot;reactionary, inciting the public and threatening social stability&#8221;. Mr. 
Ngawang Topden is reportedly serving his sentence in a prison or &#8220;re-education through 
labour&#8221; facility, near Duiling Deqing (Tibetan: Toelung) in Lhasa. Mr. Lobsang Jinpa, Mr. 
Sonam Sherab, Mr. Sonam Yignyen, Mr. Ngawang Monlam, and Mr. Kalsang Tsultrimwas 
were arrested and convicted in Chenduo County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture on 
unknown charges after a raid where their personal possessions were confiscated. It was 
reported that Mr. Jinpa and Mr. Tsultrim were beaten and tortured in prison by Chinese 
police; they were severely injured and were hospitalized. Mr. Tsultrim allegedly remains in 
hospital. Mr. Lobsang Samten, Mr. Sonam Namgyal, Mr. Thupten Gelek, Mr. Ngawang 
Gyatso, and Mr. Lobsang Kelsang were arrested in Dzachuka area, Serxu county, Sichuan 
province and their current whereabouts are unknown. An urgent appeal was sent on 9 
August 2012 regarding systematic undermining of the autonomous functions and the rights 
to freedom of religion, culture and expression of the Tibetan Buddhist community, and 
signed by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special 
Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights; Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Special Rapporteur on the right to education; 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; Special Rapporteur on rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association; 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief; and the Independent Expert on 
minority issues. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed response 
dated 28 May 2013 where it is stated there were no &#8220;peaceful protest by monks&#8221; taking 
place in Zuogang and Mangkang counties of Qamdo Prefecture, TAR in February, 2013. It 
is also stated that Mr. Sonam Sherab, Mr. Sonam Yignyen were detained, in accordance 
with law, on a charge of suspected crime to disturb public order by the Public Security 
organ of Chenduo county, Qing Hai Province. Mr. Lobsang Jinpa was detained on a charge 
of a suspected crime to instigate the split of the state and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment 
with 2 years deprival of political rights. Mr. Ngawang Monlam and Mr. Kalsang Tsultrim 
were detained on a charge of suspected homicide of an intentional nature. The beating that 
led to his hospitalization, according to the Government, does not comport with the facts. 
Mr. Sonam Namgyal, Mr. Lovsang Samten and Mr. Thupten Gelek were detained on 
charges of suspected gathering to disturb public order and traffic order and their detention 
is, according to the State, in the process of being reviewed. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to remind the government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China that each Government has 
the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right 
is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). In this context, the Special Rapporteur would also like to draw 
attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading </p>

<p>treatment or punishment.&#8221; The State&#8217;s response does not address most of the allegations of 
mistreatment, nor does it explain what investigation, if any, was conducted about them.   
The Special Rapporteur concludes that the State has failed to live up to its obligations under 
the international law governing torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.  He also encourages the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China to 
continue its engagement with the mandate.

</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of China has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged harassment, interrogation and 
detention on numerous occasions of Ms. Cao Shunli, a high-profile human rights defender, 
who at the time of writing this observation, remained detained on charges of &#8220;unlawful 
assembly&#8221; and &#8220;picking quarrels and provoking trouble.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur expresses 
grave concern for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Cao Shunli while in 
detention, particularly as it would appear she is being held with only intermittent access to 
legal advice and is at risk of ill-treatment due to the alleged deprivation of medical care.  In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Government to the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that, &#8220;Sick prisoners 
who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil 
hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, 
furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment 
of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers.&#8221;  Rule 25(1) provides 
that, &#8220;The medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of the 
prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any 
prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; (Approved by the Economic and 
Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 
1977.) Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur refers to the Basic Principles for the Treatment 
of Prisoners, adopted and proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 45/111, according to 
which &#8220;Prisoners shall have access to the health services available in the country without 
discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation&#8221; (Principle 9). In the absence of

<p> <b>(a)</b> JOL<b> 18/03/2013 Case No. CZE 2/2013 State Reply: 24/05/2013</b> Alleged lack of 
compensation for victims of non-consensual sterilization.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Czech Republic for its reply, 
dated 24 May 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged denial of 
compensation for victims of non-consensual sterilizations. According to the information 
received, on 9 September 2004 a group of Romani women alleged they were victims of 
non-consensual sterilization.  That fact was admitted by the authorities of the Czech 
Republic when they stated publicly on 23 November 2009 that they regretted there were 
sterilizations performed in contravention of domestic and international law. The Council for 
Human Rights recommended a compensation mechanism, but the Government has not 
accepted the Council&#8217;s recommendations. In its reply, the Government of the Czech 
Republic first explains the different domestic laws and protections awarded to women who 
are considering surgical sterilization and how to prevent non-consensual sterilizations 
through education and awareness campaigns. The Government also claims that the 
Ombudsman investigated all the claims of non-consensual sterilization and found that 58 of 
the 88 complaints were legitimate, but after further police investigation it was found there 
were no crimes committed. The Government suggests that the victims of non-consensual 
sterilization seek compensation through the civil court system and names a series of cases 
where claimants of sterilization were able to successfully receive compensation. However, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>the Government also identifies several issues with this approach, including statutes of 
limitation that leave hospitals largely immune to liability and that the victims were only 
able to receive compensation through negotiations with the Government. Nevertheless, the 
Government stated that the idea of an extra judicial ex gratia compensation mechanism is 
not foreclosed, and is considering possible ways to grant compensation to victims of non-
consensual sterilization. The Government also is considering the issue of the statute of 
limitations at the Justice Ministry, and its effects of immunizing hospitals. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Czech Republic for its reply and its efforts to 
investigate the claims of non-consensual sterilizations. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of article 14 of the Convention Against Torture, which 
provides that victims of torture should have the right to redress and adequate compensation. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would also like to remind the Goverment that 
paragraph 7e of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;(t)o ensure that 
victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment obtain 
redress, are awarded fair and adequate compensation and receive appropriate social, 
psychological, medical and other relevant specialized rehabilitation, and urges States to 
establish, maintain, facilitate or support rehabilitation centres or facilities where victims of 
torture can receive such treatment and where effective measures for ensuring the safety of 
their staff and patients are taken.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government 
of the Czech Republic to continue its engagement with the mandate.

of deportation of Mr. X, an asylum seeker, who would be at risk of being tortured and 
killed, if forcibly returned from Denmark to Sri Lanka. </b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Denmark has not responded 
to this communication dated 17 July 2013, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council.  The communication concerned the possible 
return of asylum seeker Mr. X to Sri Lanka where he may be at risk of torture and 
execution.  Mr. X has received a deportation order following the Government&#8217;s denial of 
his asylum application as well as his subsequent appeal, and while at the date of the 
communication Mr. X had not been deported, there is substantial risk he could be at any 
moment.  The Special Rapporteur has received evidence suggesting that Mr. X would be at 
risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment at the hands of the Eelam 
People's Democratic Party (EPDP) or the Sri Lankan military if he is returned, due to his 
past involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to Article 3 of the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, acceded 
to by Denmark on 27 May 1987, which provides that no State party shall expel, return 
(&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. In this context, at 
paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Human Rights Committee states that 
State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of extradition, 
expulsion or refoulement.&#8221;  Additionally, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the 
Government&#8217;s attention to Human Rights Council&#8217;s Resolution 22/1, supported by 
Denmark, which states with concern the ongoing human rights violations present in Sri 
Lanka, including inter alia enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and torture.  The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government not to deport Mr. X and ensure that his rights as </p>

46. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Ecuador por su respuesta, de fecha 6 de 
enero del 2014, a la comunicaci&#243;n conjunta con otros procedimientos especiales, de fecha 4 
de noviembre de 2013. En particular la comunicaci&#243;n expresaba preocupaci&#243;n por la 
posible adopci&#243;n de un nuevo C&#243;digo Penal a estudio de la Asamblea Nacional, que 
buscar&#237;a ampliar las penalizaciones del aborto y tipificar nuevos delitos, como el de 
homicidio por mala pr&#225;ctica profesional. Asimismo se refer&#237;a al actual C&#243;digo Penal que 
penaliza con pena privativa de libertad a la mujer y a la persona que practique el aborto 
(Art&#237;culo 149). Asimismo, permite el aborto si se practica para evitar un peligro para la vida 
o salud en el caso que no pueda ser evitado por otros medios, o si el embarazo es 
consecuencia de una violaci&#243;n, siempre y cuando la mujer padezca de discapacidad mental 
(Art&#237;culo 150). En este contexto, el Relator hace referencia a su reporte tem&#225;tico 
(A/HRC/22/53), en el que concluye que la denegaci&#243;n de facto al acceso a servicios 
autorizados de salud como el aborto pueden causar enormes y duraderos sufrimientos 
f&#237;sicos y emocionales, incluyendo el riesgo de muerte y discapacidad. Asimismo, reitera las 
conclusiones del Comit&#233; contra la Tortura, que establecen que las restricciones en el acceso 
al aborto y prohibiciones absolutas del mismo conculcan la prohibici&#243;n de la tortura y los 
malos tratos.  El Relator Especial expresa gran preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones que 
establecen que cuatro de diez mujeres sufren de violencia sexual en Ecuador y sin embargo 
solamente el 0.95% tienen la posibilidad de acceder al aborto no punible. En base a 
informaci&#243;n recibida, el Relator Especial recuerda al Gobierno de Ecuador que las 
violaciones al art&#237;culo 7 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos tambi&#233;n 
incluyen la denegaci&#243;n del acceso a un aborto en condiciones seguras a las mujeres que han 
quedado embarazadas a ra&#237;z de una violaci&#243;n. El Relator Especial exhorta al Gobierno de 
Ecuador a velar por la integridad f&#237;sica y emocional de las mujeres, permitiendo el acceso a 
servicios de salud reproductiva y sexual legalmente disponibles sin temor a sanciones 
penales o represalias.

</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged attacks 
committed by pro-President Morsi protesters against anti-Morsi protesters and women 
activists on 5 December 2012. It was reported that two groups of President Morsi 
supporters were armed with electric and wooden batons, rocks, and chains. The groups 
allegedly used the Presidential Palace premises to hold the sit-in protesters hostage, and 
severely beat them until their release the following day. Reportedly, these attacks were not 
prevented by the police until more than five hours after the incident began. The Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of Article 12 of the Convention Against Torture 
(&#8220;CAT&#8221;), which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>investigation whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and Article 7 of the CAT, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture. The SRT draws attention to paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8, which requires the competent national authorities to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has 
been committed, and require State parties to hold those who perpetrate acts of torture 
responsible. The Arab Republic of Egypt should take note in this respect of the Principles 
on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to 
combat torture. In addition the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 18 of the General 
Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/GC/2, 24 January 2008), where 
the Committee has made clear that where State authorities or others acting in official 
capacity or under colour of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of 
torture or ill-treatment are being committed by non-State officials or private actors and they 
fail to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State 
officials or private actors consistently with the Convention, the State bears responsibility 
and its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise responsible under 
the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts. The State&#8217;s 
indifference or inaction provides encouragement or de facto permission. The Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Arab Republic of Egypt of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23, which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation 
into the anti-Morsi protesters&#8217; alleged torture while held hostage in the premises of the 
Presidential Palace, and the delayed response by police, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of all those responsible, and to provide full redress to the victims.

that torture. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and ill-treatment of Mr. 
Ahmad Allam Mohamed Hefny, who was tried in absentia and sentenced to life 
imprisonment by the Egyptian Supreme State Security Court for his alleged involvement in 
an attack on the Al-Arish II police station that took place on 29 July 2011. Mr. Hefny was 
allegedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment at the National Security headquarters in Al-
Arish for three consecutive days, through beatings, kicking, punching, raping with a 
wooden stick, and electrocution. Allegedly he was tortured until a confession was extracted. 
It is reported that the court did not open an investigation into these allegations because they 
were raised by the victim but not officially by his lawyer. It is reported that these forced 
confessions constituted the primary evidence against Mr. Hefny during the hearing on 22 
April 2013. It is further reported that Mr. Hefny began a hunger strike in objection to the 
torture and ill-treatment he has received in prison, which has severely affected Mr. Hefny&#8217;s 
health. In retaliation, the prison restricted Mr. Hefny&#8217;s access to bedding and moved him to 
a two-by-one meters cell without ventilation nor access to electricity, water, or toilets for at 
least one week. Mr. Hefny has not been examined by doctors nor sent to the prison hospital 
since his arrest. He reportedly remained without access to medication or medical treatment 
as of the date of the communication, despite being unable to walk due to the torture. On 11 
September 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment had sent a joint urgent letter to the Egyptian 
Government concerning three other individuals addressing the ongoing use of the Supreme 
State Security Courts in Egypt despite the end of the state of emergency and the use of 
evidence obtained through torture, in particular in cases related to terrorism charges. No 
answer has yet been received. In this context, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to 
paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which &#8220;condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; In addition, article 2(2) of the CAT and paragraph 2 of Resolution 16/23 of 
the Human Rights Coucil provide that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a 
state of war or a threat of war, internal political in stability or any other public emergency, 
may be invoked as a justification of torture. With regard to the alleged use of evidence 
obtained under torture before the courts, article 15 of the CAT and paragraph 7c of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 provide that any statement made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture. 
Article 12 of the CAT requires competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and article 7 requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of 
torture. With regard to the deteriorating health condition of Mr. Hefny, the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that &#8220;(s)ick prisoners 
who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil 
hospitals.&#8221; Furthermore, Rule 25(1) provides that &#8220;(t)he medical officer shall have the care 
of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all 
who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; The 
Special Rapporteur reminds the government of article 14 of the CAT, which provides that 
victims of torture should have the right to redress and adequate compensation. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to review any judicial decision rendered against Mr. 
Hefny that may have been based on torture-tainted evidence; to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation of the torture of Mr. Ahmad Allam Mohamed Hefny, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators; and to provide full redress to the victim.

<p>49. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and ill-treatment and the 
subsequent denial of medical treatment of Mr. Alaa Ahmed Mohamed Hussein at the Naga 
Hammadi Police Station, Qena, Egypt. According to the information received, during a 
visit to the Naga Hammadi Police Station where his brother was being detained, an 
argument ensued between Mr. Hussein and two uniformed police officers at the station 
about their disrespect of visitors to the station. Two officers allegedly started hitting and 
beating Mr. Hussein with a baton on different parts of his body, kicking and punching him 
and dragging him on the floor, resulting in severe injuries. It is reported that immediately 
following the incident, Mr. Hussein was detained overnight at the Naga Hammadi Police 
Station, and that he did not receive any medical attention for the injuries he sustained. Mr. 
Hussein reportedly appeared before the Naga Hammadi Prosecution, and was immediately 
released without any charges. A complaint has been filed for the alleged torture, and an 
investigation is supposedly ongoing. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the </p>

<p>government of Egypt of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which

officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should 
daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his 
attention is specially directed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to

<p> <b>(d)</b> JUA 06/08/2013 Case No. EGY 11/2013 State Reply: None to date <b>Alleged excessive use 
of force and killings of demonstrators by police forces. 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. According to allegations, at least 81 protesters and police officers were 
killed and thousands more injured in clashes between pro-Mohammed Morsi/Muslim 
Brotherhood protesters and Egyptian police forces in Cairo in July 2013. While the 
Government reported that police officers were only armed with tear gas, it is alleged that 
most of the protesters killed were shot with live ammunition targeting their head or chest. 
Following the incident, interim Government officials allegedly stated that Muslim 
Brotherhood demonstrations were a &#8220;threat to national security&#8221; and ordered that all 
necessary measures be taken to &#8220;confront these risks and put an end to them.&#8221; Allegedly, 
this statement has led to serious fears that future peaceful protests might be met with 
excessive use of force by police. The Special Rapporteur stresses that each government has 
the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, as set forth 
inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. Articles 3 and 20 of the 
UDHR provide that &#8220;everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person,&#8221; and &#8220;the 
right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.&#8221; Additionally, the United Nations 
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials establish 
that officials shall &#8220;apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and 
firearms,&#8221; and that force and firearms may only be used as a last resort when unavoidable, 
and requires exercising the utmost restraint, minimizing injury and damage, and respecting 
and preserving human life. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that the victims&#8217; rights under international standards relating to the 
prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been 
violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Egyptian Government to clarify the 
circumstances regarding the aforementioned incident, to conduct a prompt, independent and 
effective investigation into the allegations, to prosecute and punish all perpetrators, and to 
provide full redress to the victims and their family members. The Special Rapporteur also </p>

<p>51. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication refers to the alleged arbitrary detention, solitary 
confinement, torture and denial of medical care of Mr. Ahmed Hassan Al-Din who, at the 
time the communication was sent, remained detained in unhygienic conditions in Tora 
prison in Aqrab. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern about the mental and 
physical integrity of Mr. Al-Din in view of allegations that he continues to remain held in 
an unhygienic condition and has been threatened with more beatings as a consequence of 
his hunger strike and refusal to take liquids. In this context, and with respect to the 
allegations according to which Mr. Al-Din was subjected to beating and humiliation while 
in detention, the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of Government to paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus

punishment.&#8221; In view of the allegations according to which Mr. Al-Din was placed in an 
isolated cell, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 
of the Human Rights Committee. It states that prolonged solitary confinement of the 
detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted at the 44th session of the 
Human Rights Committee, 1992). In this regard, he recalls that article 7 of the Basic 
Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of 
solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken 
and encouraged.&#8221; (Adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 45/111 of 14 December 
1990). The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the Committee against Torture and the Human 
Rights Committee have consistently found that conditions of detention can amount to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government that Rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners 
provides that &#8220;Sick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to 
specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an 
institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the 
medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained 
officers.&#8221;  Furthermore, Rule 25(1) provides that &#8220;The medical officer shall have the care of 
the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all 
who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; 
(Approved by the Economic and Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 
1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977) No evidence having been provided to the contrary, 
the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the rights of Mr. Ahmed Hassan Al-Din have 
been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt, 
impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and to provide redress to Mr. Ahmed Hassan Al-Din.  </p>

escapees from the Naboro Corrections Facility, including a possible related video recording 
of torture of prisoners in a separate prison.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Fiji has not responded to this 
communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights 
Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture of escapees of the Naboro 
Corrections Facility outside Suva, Fiji. According to the information received, the men 
complied with the directions of armed military officers and did not resist arrest when they 
were recaptured. It is alleged that armed military officers tortured the men following arrest. 
The men were handcuffed and severely beaten. On the way back to the mainland by boat, 
security officers threw a handcuffed and injured escapee into the sea several times, each 
time hauling him back into the boat. In the Babua military barracks the men were forced to 
take off all their clothes and were left naked in dark cells, kicked, hit with the butt of guns, 
sworn at, spat on and had hot water poured on them. Another suffered rectal injuries after 
military officers pushed the barrel of a gun into his anus. It is further reported that one of 
the prisoner&#8217;s legs was amputated shortly after the recapture. It is alleged that soon 
thereafter, it was announced that the police would not open an investigation into the 
allegations. It is further reported that it remains unclear whether the prisoners have been 
granted access to legal representation. Reportedly there was also a leaked nine-minute 
video that shows a handcuffed man being physically and sexually assaulted, beaten and 
humiliated by a group of men while lying helpless in the back of a pick-up truck. The man 
is repeatedly struck on his feet, legs, body and head with a number of different implements 
including a length of rubber pipe, a metal rod, a stick and a hammer. Subsequently some of 
his abusers force him to expose his genitals, while others film and photograph him. A 
second handcuffed man is shown sitting on the ground nearby and is also struck on his 
body including legs and head with a stick and a rod. A dog is encouraged by its handler to 
seize him by the shirt and drag him several meters across the ground. The police statement 
also alleges that neither of the men in the video is thought to be any of the five prisoners 
who had escaped on 17 September 2012. It is still unclear whether the videotape shows the 
torture of two of the five prisoners or a separate case of police violence and torture where 
the victims remain unknown. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is prohibited in all 
circumstances without exception. This absolute prohibition is a rule of customary 
international law, which binds all nations, irrespective of whether or not they are party to 
relevant treaties. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the government 
of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Under international law and standards, and paragraph 7b of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23, states must also ensure that all reasonable allegations of torture 
are properly investigated, including through medical documentation as elaborated in the 
Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Istanbul Protocol, 1999). This obligation 
reflects both the duty of states to ensure reparations to victims of this serious human rights 
violation, including the disclosure of the truth. In this context, paragraph 7e of Human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;(t)o ensure that victims of torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment obtain redress, are awarded fair and 
adequate compensation and receive appropriate social, psychological, medical and other 
relevant specialized rehabilitation, and urges States to establish, maintain, facilitate or 
support rehabilitation centers or facilities where victims of torture can receive such 
treatment and where effective measures for ensuring the safety of their staff and patients are 
taken.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation of the allegations of torture of these prison escapees, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victims.

migrant detainee, suicides in detention, insufficient access to health care in detention, 
and lack of compensation to migrant victims of shooting.</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply dated 25 October 2013 
to allegations of mistreatment of irregular migrants as well as migrant workers.  According 
to the information received, on 27 July 2013, Mr. Mohammad Hasan, a 28 year-old Afghan 
migrant who had been detained for almost 11 months, died in a hospital in Athens. 
Allegedly, the police authorities at Korinthos detention centre had repeatedly rejected his 
requests to see a doctor. Furthermore, in two recent incidents, in police facilities in Grevena 
and Kozani, two migrants allegedly committed suicide while in detention. It is further 
reported that a 33 year-old Congolese man was awaiting amputation of both legs following 
seven months of detention in Komotini without appropriate access to medical care, and a 
28-year-old Afghan national, suffering from a serious disease, was hospitalized. 
Additionally, a group of Bangladeshi strawberry pickers who were shot at on 17 April of 
this year in Nea Manolada have allegedly received no support from the Greek government 
despite promises of compensation and protective immigration status.  The Special 
Rapporteur expressed concerns in the communication that such accounts further illustrate 
the poor conditions of detention within police stations, border guard stations, and migrant 
detention facilities observed by the previous Special Rapporteur during his visit to Greece 
in 2010.  It was noted that prolonged detention of migrants under the conditions of 
detention described amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment, in violation of articles 7 
and 10 of the ICCPR (Para. 47) and furthermore that reported deaths of persons in state 
custody such as those described could amount to a breach of those individuals&#8217; right to life 
and security as enshrined in article 6 of the ICCPR.  Additionally, in regard to the alleged 
shooting of the Bangladeshi strawberry pickers in Nea Manolada, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed concern that the Government&#8217;s treatment of the victims following the attack, 
including failure to provide adequate compensation and continued detention in poor 
conditions, could amount to a violation of paragraph 18 of the General Comment No. 2 of 
the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/GC/2, 24 January 2008).  In this provision, the 
Committee has made clear that where State authorities or others acting in official capacity 
or under colour of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or 
ill-treatment are being committed by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials 
or private actors consistently with the Convention, the State bears responsibility and its 
officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise responsible under the 
Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts.  The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges and thanks the Government for its reply to these allegations in 
which they stated that ongoing investigations were underway into the circumstances of the 
reported deaths in custody as well as into the treatment of the Bangladeshi migrant workers 
following the attack at Nea Mnolada.  The Government reported further to document the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>various efforts undertaken to improve the conditions of detention for those held in 
immigration facilities.  Additionally, efforts to ensure that police forces were upholding 
human rights in the face of recent conflicts with foreign workers were relayed by the 
Government.  While the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by reports of investigations into 
these alleged violations, it is noted with concern that there is a lack of compensation and 
support for the victims of the Nea Manolada shooting as well as to the families of those 
reported to have died while under police custody.  The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to continue its engagement with the mandate as it moves forward with the 
investigations and reforms detailed above.

execution of Mr. Ajmal Kasab after proceedings that did not comply fully with fair trial and 
due process guarantees and whose family was not informed of his execution.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for its reply, dated 12 
February 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged execution of Mr. Ajmal 
Kasab for his alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attack. Reportedly, Mr. Kasab&#8217;s 
defense counsel was denied several procedural guarantees that resulted in an unfair 
conviction. Mr. Kasab was then allegedly executed in secret without notifying his family or 
attorney. The Indian authorities allegedly announced it to the public after the executions 
had occurred, and justified their actions as necessary to avoid intervention from human 
rights defenders. In its reply, the Government of India simply acknowledged receipt of the 
joint allegation letter but did not address any of the concerns contained in the letter, nor did 
the Government confirm or deny the facts surrounding the secret execution of Mr. Ajmal 
Kasab. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates a confirmation of receipt, he reminds 
the Government of India of his thematic (A/67/279 Paragraph 52) which emphasizes that in 
relation to the enforcement of the death penalty, the Human Rights Committee has 
recommended that families of death row inmates be given reasonable advanced notice of 
the scheduled date and time of execution, with a view to reducing the psychological 
suffering caused by the lack of opportunity to prepare themselves for that event 
(CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5, para. 16). Secrecy is an especially cruel feature of capital punishment, 
highlighting the need for total transparency and avoidance of harm to innocents in the 
whole process. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of India to address the 
concerns surrounding the secret execution of Mr. Ajmal Kasab and to offer appropriate 
remedies to the next of kin.  He also encourages the Government to continue its 
engagement with the mandate.

</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for its reply, dated 6 August 
2013,  to this communication in reference to the alleged execution of Mr. Muhammad Afzal 
Guru based on a conviction reportedly extracted through torture. The communication 
referred to the allegedly then imminent execution of Mr. Muhammad Afzal Guru after 
proceedings that did not comply with international standards of fair trial and due process 
guarantees. According to the information received, Mr. Guru was convicted on charges of 
conspiring in an attack and waging war due to his involvement in the attacks at the Indian 
Parliament in New Delhi on 13 December 2001. Mr. Guru allegedly provided logistical 
support to those involved in the attack, during which nine people were killed. It is reported 
that Mr. Guru did not have legal representation from the time of his arrest until after he </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b>  
</p>
<p>confessed to the offences. The confession, which he subsequently retracted, was allegedly 
obtained through torture. It is alleged that the conviction against Mr. Guru was based 
largely on his initial confession. Furthermore, Mr. Guru&#8217;s legal representative was 
appointed by the Government and his performance was inadequate; he failed to conduct a 
thorough cross-examination of witnesses. The execution allegedly took place in secrecy and 
his family was informed three days after the execution by mail. Mr. Guru&#8217;s wife was 
allegedly denied return of his body and denied the right to perform religious rites. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates article 15 of the Convention against Torture, 
which provides that &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established 
to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221;  Paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 contains a similar 
provision.  In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an 
essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter 
alia, in article 7 of the ICCPR. In countries that have not abolished the death penalty, 
capital punishment may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and 
due process safeguards, as provided in articles 6(2) and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), acceded to by India on 10 April 1979 and article 5 of 
the United Nations Safeguards Protecting the Rights of those Facing the Death Penalty. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent 
investigation of Mr. Muhammad Afzal Guru&#8217;s alleged confession that was extracted 
through torture and a death penalty conviction that rested on that confession, resulting in his 
execution. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to prosecute and punish the 
perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victim&#8217;s family.

rights standards. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for its reply, dated 29 
August 2013, to this communication in reference to the arrests, detention, allegations of the 
use of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment including solitary confinement, 
and the sentencing to death of nine individuals, namely Messrs. Devender Pal Sing Bhullar, 
Meesekar Maidaiah, Gnanprakasham, Simon, Bilavendran, V. Sriharan alias Murugan, T. 
Suthendraraja alias Santhan, A. G. Perarivalan alias Arivu and Saibanna Ningappa Natikar. 
Concern is expressed that the judicial proceedings of the aforementioned individuals did 
not comply with international human rights law standards of fair trial and due process 
guarantees. It was reported that Mr. Devender Pal Sing Bhullar was arrested in 1995 and 
charged with an attempt to assassinate a Punjab Police Officer and the then President of the 
Indian Youth Congress. On 25 August 2001 Mr. Bhullar was tried and sentenced to death 
by a special court designated to hear his case under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities 
(Prevention) Act (TADA). Reportedly, during Mr. Bhullar&#8217;s detention from 19 to 23 
January 1995, the Police of the Special Cell, Lodhi Colony, New Delhi, tortured and forced 
Mr. Bhullar to sign a confession, which Mr. Bhullar later retracted.  It was alleged that Mr. 
Bhullar&#8217;s prolonged stay on death row in solitary confinement had seriously affected his 
health, and that he could be executed at any moment. With regard to Messrs. Meesekar 
Madaiah, Gnanprakasham, Simon, and Bilavendran, it was reported that all four were being 
held in Hindalga Prison, Belgaum, Karnataka state, India, after being sentenced to death by 
the Supreme Court of India in 2004 for their alleged role in the Veerappan&#8217;s militant 
formation. Reportedly, all four individuals have been suffering from serious mental and 
psychological illness due to the prolonged stay on death row in solitary confinement since 
2004. With regard to V. Sriharan alias Murugan, T. Suthendraraja alias Santhan, and A. G. 
Perarivalan alias Arivu, it was reported that these three individuals were arrested along with 
23 individuals in July 1991 in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>of India, Rajiv Gandhi. On 28 January 1998, all 26 individuals were found guilty and 
sentenced to death by a special court in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Allegedly the trial 
was held behind closed doors, in camera, and non-disclosure of the identity of witnesses 
was maintained throughout the proceedings. Reportedly, confessions by the defendants 
formed a major part of the evidence in the trial court judgment against them, which they 
later claimed were taken under duress. Currently, the three aforementioned individuals are 
being held in Vellore Prison, State of Tamil Nadu, India where they might be suffering 
from serious mental and psychological illness due to the prolonged stay on death row in 
solitary confinement since 1998. With regard to Saibanna Ningappa Natikar, it was 
reported that he was sentenced to death in 2005 for the 1994 murder of his second wife and 
daughter. Reportedly, fourteen former Indian judges petitioned the President of India asking 
that Mr. Natikar&#8217;s sentence be commuted because it was imposed in error. Allegedly Mr. 
Natikar has been suffering from serious mental and psychological illness due to the 
prolonged stay on death row in solitary confinement since 2005. The Special Rapporteur 
appreciates the reply of the Government of India, but regrets that the Government did not 
provide sufficient documentation of the investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment in connection with this case, including the alleged detention and death sentence 
of Mr. Devender Pal Sing Bhullar. The Government&#8217;s reply neither explains the Court&#8217;s 
finding nor the measures taken to impartially and independently investigate the allegations 
of torture and ill-treatment. The Government&#8217;s reply does not address the allegations and 
concerns raised regarding Meesekar Maidaiah, Gnanprakasham, Simon, Bilavendran, V. 
Sriharan alias Murugan, T. Suthendraraja alias Santhan, A. G. Perarivalan alias Arivu and 
Saibanna Ningappa Natikar. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to life and the physical and mental 
integrity of all persons. These rights are set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the United 
Nations Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of those Facing Execution of 
1984 (ECOSOC Resolution 1984/50) and the ICCPR, acceded to the Government of India 
on 10 April 1979. As stated in his report to the General Assembly (A/67/279; 9 August 
2012), the Special Rapporteur finds that even if the emergence of a customary norm that 
considers the death penalty as per se running afoul of the prohibition of torture and cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment is still under way, most conditions under which capital 
punishment is actually applied renders the punishment tantamount to torture. Under many 
other, less severe conditions, it still amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. He 
therefore recalls the absolute nature of the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate 
paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which urges States &#8220;To ensure 
that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence 
in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending that prohibition to 
statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as 
evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;Due to the lack of information 
provided by the Government about the allegation that Messrs. Bhullar, Madaiah, 
Gnanprakasham, Simon, Bilavendran, Murugan, Santhan, Arivu and Natikar have spent 
many years on death row in solitary confinement, the Special Rapporteur considers such 
facts to have been proven.  He concludes that the aforementioned individuals have been 
suffering from serious mental and psychological illness due to the prolonged stay on death 
row in solitary confinement and that the Government has not lived up to its obligation to 
investigate the allegations of torture and ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur also 
reiterates that no exceptional circumstances can be invoked to justify torture by the 
Government and that therefore the rights of these individuals have been violated.   </p>

petition on the case of Mr. Bhullar, which included a request to commute his death 
sentence. Mr. Bhullar was reportedly at risk of imminent execution. The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government that the execution of Mr. Bhullar would constitute a violation of 
international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur also reminds the Government of the 
international duties of the Government as mentioned in previous communications, with 
particular regard to the international human rights law provisions on stringent respect of 
due process and fair trial guarantees in cases of the death penalty, prohibition to impose the 
capital punishment against individuals with psycho-social disabilities, and prohibition of 
torture and ill-treatment.

</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Iran for its reply, dated 12 August 
2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged imminent execution of members of 
the Kurdish community following affirmation by the Supreme Court despite reports of 
forced confessions and torture. The communication referred to alleged risk of imminent 
execution of Mr. Zaneyar Moradee and Mr. Loghmun Moradee, both members of the 
Kurdish community. They were reportedly charged with enmity against God (Moharebeh) 
and corruption on earth (Fisad-fil-arz) for allegedly murdering the son of Marivan Friday 
Imam in Kurdistan province in July 2009. Mr Zaneyar and Mr Loghmun were also 
convicted of participating in armed activities of Komala, a Kurdish opposition group, and 
their death sentence was upheld by both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal in 
2011. Allegedly, the two individuals were subjected to torture and physical assault 
including lashing, beating, vulgar insults and threat with sexual violence aimed to 
extracting confession. This case has been the subject of previous communications by the 
Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran also publicly raised serious 
concerns about the death penalty following unfair trial, torture and other allegations of 
physical violence. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 7c of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which urges States &#8220;To ensure that no statement 
established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made, and which calls upon States to consider extending that prohibition to statements 
made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, recognizing that 
adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as evidence in any 
proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the alleged imminent execution of 
Mr. Zaneyar Moradee and Mr. Loghmun Moradee, whose guilt was reportedly basedon </p>

</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to alleged imminent 
execution of five members of the Ahwazi Arab minority in the Islamic Republic of Iran &#8211;
Messrs. Mohammad Ali Amouri, Sayed Jaber Alboshoka, Sayed Mokhtar Alboshoka, 
Hashem Sha&#8217;bani Amouri, and Hadi Rashidi (or Rashedi). Reportedly the five men were 
convicted of &#8220;enmity against God and corruption on earth&#8221;, &#8220;gathering and colluding 
against State security&#8221; and &#8220;spreading propaganda against the system&#8221; and were sentenced 
to death on 9 January 2012. The men were allegedly denied access to a lawyer and their 
families for the first nine months of their detention and they have subsequently been 
transferred to an unknown location in an undisclosed detention facility. It is furthermore 
alleged that all five men have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated in detention. Mr. 
Mohammad Ali Amouri was reportedly tortured during his first seven months of detention. 
Mr. Hadi Rashidi was hospitalized after his arrest, allegedly as a result of torture or other 
ill-treatment, and is said to be in poor health. Sayed Jaber Alboshoka&#8217;s jaw and teeth were 
allegedly broken during his detention and Sayed Mokhtar Alboshoka has allegedly 
experienced depression and memory loss as a result of torture or other ill-treatment. It is 
further alleged that boiling water was poured on Mr. Hashem Sha&#31;bani Amouri. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Islamic Republic of Iran of paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 
8/8, which urges States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all 
allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who 
encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to 
justice and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention 
where the prohibited act is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of 
the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful 
tool in efforts to combat torture;&#8221;. In addition, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008 urges States &#8220;to ensure that 
no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in 
any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement 
was made&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation into the alleged imminent execution and alleged torture of five 
representatives of the Ahwazi Arab minority, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators of the torture, and provide full redress to the victims.

</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to Mr. Saeed 
Abedinigalangashi&#8217;s alleged four week solitary confinement and subjugation to three 
months of a constantly lit cell with a brief glimpse of sunlight once a week. It is also 
alleged that Mr. Abedinigalangashi has been beaten while in detention. The detention is in 
response to alleged charges of national security related issues, despite a past arrest for 
alleged organizing of house churches in Iran, verbally accused of converting to Christianity, 
converting and baptizing other Muslim converts, and conducting conferences and 
leadership training. He was reportedly informed in 2009 that he could continue his 
Christian activities outside of Iran, but nevertheless was arrested in 2012 for what is 
concerned to be related to his past leadership in the &#8220;house church&#8221; movement. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and nonderogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also 
reminds the Government with regard to the alleged use of solitary confinement during the 
initial phase of the detention that paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights 
Committee states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person 
may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate article 7 of the 
Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to 
the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should 
be undertaken and encouraged&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the alleged beating and solitary 
confinement of Mr. Saeed Abedinigalangashi on alleged national security charges, leading 
to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of the torture, and provide full redress to 
the victim.

</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 28 June 2013, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council.  The communication regarded 
the revised Islamic Penal Code (IPC), which was approved by the Parliament and 
subsequently signed by the President on 1 June 2013, it allegedly provides for the use of the 
death penalty for some non-violent acts and also discriminates against women and religious 
minorities. Additionally, it allegedly retains stoning as punishment and provides for the 
death penalty for sodomy; for the non-Muslim party in same-sex relations, insulting the 
Prophet Mohammad; possessing or selling illicit drugs, theft for the fourth time, Moharebeh 
(enmity against God) and Fisad-fil-arz (corruption on earth). The Code also incorporates 
diverse corporal punishments inter alia, amputation, flogging and crucifixion.  The Special 
Rapporteur recalls his interim report (A/67/279) in which he makes clear that stoning, 
hanging, and all forms of corporal punishment constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading 
forms of treatment and punishment and are thereby contrary to paragraph 1 of its 
Resolution 16/23, the Human Rights Council which &#8220;condemns all forms of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus 
never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-</p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221;  Furthermore, these sorts of punishments are contrary to resolution 1996/15, 
paragraph 7, in which the Economic and Social Council urged States to effectively apply 
the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners in order to keep to a minimum 
the suffering of prisoners under sentence of death and to avoid any exacerbation of such 
suffering.  The Special Rapporteur also expressed concern over provisions allowing for the 
death penalty in cases not qualifying as &#8220;the most serious offenses&#8221; as required under 
international norms; this is also specifically contrary to Article 6(2) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by the Islamic Republic of Iran on 
24 June 1975.  With regard to the penal code, it is stressed that States cannot invoke 
provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human rights obligations under 
international law.  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to respond seriously to 
these allegations and relay any attempts made to rectify the inconsistencies of the Islamic 
Penal Code with established international law.<b>

and Mr. Mahmoud Beheshti Langroudi, trade unionist.  
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, dated 18 December 2013, to this communication in reference to the 
arrests and detention of six individuals, namely Messrs. Khosro Kordpour and Massoud 
Kordpour, journalists; Ms. Jamileh Karimi and Messrs. Ashkan Zahabian, and Afshin 
Keshtkari, political and student activists; and Mr. Mahmoud Beheshti Langroudi, trade 
unionist. It was reported that Mr. Khosro Kordpour, editor-in-chief of the Mukrian New 
Agency, was arrested by intelligence officers in March 2013 under an arrest warrant issued 
by Branch 2 of the Revolutionary Court of Mahabad. Mr. Khosor Kordpour&#8217;s brother, Mr. 
Massoud Kordpour, who is a freelance journalist, allegedly went to the Boukan Intelligence 
Office to inquire about his brother&#8217;s imprisonment, where he was reportedly subsequently 
arrested, held in solitary confinement, and transferred to Mahabad Prison in the province of 
Azerbaijan. A few weeks after their arrests in March 2013, both journalists were allegedly 
transferred to a Revolutionary Guards detention center in Orumiyeh and held in solitary 
confinement.  Authorities have reportedly not disclosed the charges against them, their 
family was allegedly prohibited from visiting them until 2 May 2013, and  neither of the 
journalists was initially allowed access to a lawyer. Allegedly, the journalists&#8217; mental health 
was poor. Ms. Jamileh Karimi, a political activist and member of Central Council of the 
Reformists Coalition in Fars Province, worked for the Fars provincial Governor as an 
advisor on women&#8217;s and youth affairs during Mohammad Khatami&#8217;s presidency and was a 
signatory to a letter urging Mr. Khatami to run for the presidency in 2013. It was reported 
that she was arrested by security forces on 10 April 2013 and held in solitary confinement 
at the Ministry of Intelligence detention center in Shiraz. Her charges had reportedly not 
been disclosed. Mr. Ashkan Zahabian, a student activist, was reportedly arrested by 
Intelligence Ministry officials on 27 May 2013.  In 2011, he had reportedly been sentenced 
to an eight-month prison term for &#8220;acting against national security&#8221; and &#8220;spreading 
propaganda against the system&#8221;. He allegedly had not received a written summons 
requiring him to commence serving his sentence but was taken to Babol Prison in 
Mazandaran province to serve the 2011 sentence. Mr. Afshin Keshtkari, a student activist 
and founder of the University of Technology Islamic Student Association in Shiraz, was 
reportedly summoned to appear before the Revolutionary Court of Shiraz on 18 May 2013 
and then committed to Adel Abad Prison to begin serving six months of a pending three-
year prison sentence. Mr. Keshtkari had reportedly been arrested following a student protest 
at the University of Technology in Shiraz on 7 December 2010 and subsequently reportedly </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>convicted of &#8220;forming an illegal group with intent to harm national security.&#8221; He was 
allegedly held at the detention center in Shiraz known as &#8220;No. 100&#8221; until 1 January 2011, 
when he was released on bail. The majority of his sentence was reportedly suspended upon 
appeal. Mr. Mahmoud Beheshti Langroudi, a trade unionist and former speaker of the Iran 
Teachers&#8217; Trade Associations, was reportedly arrested in April 2010 and convicted on 28 
May 2013 by Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran of &#8220;gathering and colluding 
against the national security,&#8221; for which he was sentenced to four years in prison, and of 
&#8220;spreading propaganda against the system,&#8221; for which he was sentenced to an additional 
year in prison. In its reply, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that 
Messrs. Khosro Kordpour and Massoud Kordpour had contacted Western Azerbaijan 
attorneys to collect information regarding ongoing cases involving members of counter 
revolutionary terrorist groups. The Government claims that the Kordpours posed as Kurdish 
human rights activists and were working with terrorist networks. The Government stated 
that the Kordpours will be prosecuted by the city of Mahabad&#8217;s Islamic Revolution court 
and that the dossier containing their charges has been queued for processing. The 
Government further stated that Mr. Afshin Keshtkari has been tried on charges &#8220;of 
engaging in activities that were against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran and in 
favor of counter revolutionary groups,&#8221; as well as establishing &#8220;membership in illegal 
groups with the aim of disturbing national security&#8221;. The Government additionally stated 
that on 18 May 2013, the appeals court dismissed Mr. Keshtkari&#8217;s appeal of his original 
three-year sentence, but that the court suspended two and a half years of the original 
sentence, confirming the remaining six months. Lastly, the Government stated that Ms. 
Jamile Karimi (Jamileh Karimi) was arrested on charges of &#8220;establishing an illegal group 
acting against domestic security&#8221; and &#8220;working against the Islamic Republic of Iran and in 
favor of counter revolutionary groups&#8221;. The Government stated that Ms. Karimi was 
released on 1 July 2013 following the completion of preliminary investigations and 
modification of her temporary arrest order.  The Government did not address any of the 
allegations or concerns regarding Mr. Ashkan Zahabian or Mr. Mahmoud Beheshti 
Langroudi. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, but regrets that the Government did not provide sufficient documentation 
of the investigation into the allegations of solitary confinement and ill-treatment in 
connection to these cases. The Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government of 
paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee, which states that 
prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts 
prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
(Adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). In this regard, he 
would also like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to article 7 of the Basic Principles for 
the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of

with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the alleged death of Mr. Afshin Osanlou while in prison and the ongoing detention of 
numerous other individuals.  According to the information received, Mr. Osanlou, a trade 
union activist, died from a heart attack while serving a five year sentence on 20 June 2013.  
It is reported that the facts surrounding Mr. Osanlou&#8217;s death remain unclear, particularly

of the Iranian judiciary&#8221; and other &#8220;national security&#8221; crimes for representing an alleged 
adulterer and others arrested on sodomy charges, has been beaten, injured, denied medical 
treatment, held in solitary confinement, and lost 12 of his teeth and 50 kilograms of weight. 
The communication also refers to Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi who was

</p>
<p>66. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that each Government that principle 
9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary 
and Summary Executions, which underlines that &#8220;there shall be thorough, prompt and 
impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest 
unnatural death in the above circumstances . . . .&#8221; Further, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
draw attention to paragraph 7b of the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States 
to take effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined and to hold those 
responsible accountable, brought to justice, punished.  The Special Rapporteur additionally 
wishes to recall the absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as reiterated in 
paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited . . . and calls upon all States to 
implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur further reminds 
the Government that paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee 
states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may 
amount to acts prohibited by article 7.  The Special Rapporteur reiterates article 12 of the 
Convention Against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires 
States Parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture.  Lastly, the Special Rapporteur 
points out that Rule 22(2) of Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners 
provides that sick prisoners shall be transferred to the appropriate health facilities and that 
internal facilities be equipped and staffed proper for effective treatment. The Special 
Rapporteur requests a response from the Government of Iran regarding the prevalence of 
custodial deaths and mistreatment.  The Special Rapporteur further request that should the 
Government&#8217;s investigation find the allegations to be correct that any person responsible be 
held accountable.

<p>67. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged risk of 
imminent execution of Messrs. Ghazi Abbasi, Abdul-Reza Amir-Khanafereh, Abdul-Amir 
Mojaddami, and Jasim Moghaddam Payam, members of the Ahwazi Arab minority, 
following proceedings in violation of their right to fair trial, due process guarantees and not 
to be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
Additionally, Messrs. Shahab Abbasi, Sami Jadmavinejad, and Hadi Albokhanfarnejad, 
also members of the Ahwazi Arab minority, are allegedly imprisoned in violation of their 
right to fair trial, due process guarantees, and not to be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. It is reported that on 15 August 2012, Branch 1 of 
the Revolutionary Court of Ahwaz, the capital of Khuzestan province, found the seven men 
guilty of charges of moharebeh (&#8220;enmity against God&#8221;) and ifsad fil-arz (&#8220;corruption on 
earth&#8221;). The seven individuals were allegedly accused of the murders of a police officer and 
a conscripted soldier. The Revolutionary Court reportedly found that the defendants had 
established a &#8220;separatist ethnic&#8221; group that &#8220;used weapons and engaged in shooting in order 
to create fear and panic and disrupt public security&#8221;. Messrs. Abbasi, Amir-Khanafereh, 
Mojaddami, and Payam were sentenced to death, and Messrs. Shahab Abbasi, Sami 
Jadmavinejad, and Hadi Albokhanfarnejad, were sentenced to three years in prison. In 
February 2013, Branch 32 of Iran&#8217;s Supreme Court reportedly upheld the sentences 
pronounced in each case. According to the information received, the proceedings against 
the seven men were conducted in violation of their rights to a fair trial and due process. The 
accused were reportedly held in incommunicado pre-trial detention for months, subjected to 
torture and ill-treatment for the purpose of extracting confessions, and denied full access to 
a defense lawyer. Both the Revolutionary Court and Supreme Court judgments reportedly 
acknowledge that some of the defendants retracted their confessions during the trial, 
claiming that they had been extracted under physical and psychological torture; however, 
the judgments do not acknowledge the validity of those retractions. There is allegedly no 
record of any investigation into the allegations of torture or ill-treatment. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls that, as stated in his report to the General Assembly (A/67/279; 9 
August 2012), the Special Rapporteur finds that even if the emergence of a customary norm 
that considers the death penalty as per se running afoul of the prohibition of torture and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is still under way, most conditions under which 
capital punishment is actually applied render the punishment tantamount to torture. Under 
many other, less severe conditions, it still amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. Due to the lack of information provided by the Government, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that Messrs. Ghazi Abbasi, Abdul-Reza Amir-Khanafereh, Abdul-
Amir Mojaddami, and Jasim Moghaddam Payam, Shahab Abbasi, Sami Jadmavinejad, and 
Hadi Albokhanfarnejad have been imprisoned in violation of their right to fair trial, due 
process guarantees, and not to be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and that the Government did not live up to its obligation to 
investigate the allegations of torture or ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur also reiterates 
that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever can be invoked to justify torture by the 
Government and that therefore the rights of Messrs. Ghazi Abbasi, Abdul-Reza Amir-
Khanafereh, Abdul-Amir Mojaddami, and Jasim Moghaddam Payam, Shahab Abbasi, Sami 
Jadmavinejad, and Hadi Albokhanfarnejad have been violated.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>alternative medicine theories. It was alleged that Dr. Taheri was arrested by the 
Revolutionary Guard in May 2011 after fourteen Shia religious authorities declared that he 
was to be considered an apostate and heretic due to his professional activities, issued a 
fatwa, and requested a death sentence. He was allegedly tried and sentenced to a prison 
term, fine and lashes. Authorities from the Evin Prison, where Mr. Taheri reportedly 
continued to be held at the time of this communication, allegedly informed close members 
of his family in August 2013 that he would soon be executed. The Special Rapporteur 
expressed grave concern over allegations that Dr. Taheri had been subjected to torture 
during his detention, denied access to a doctor despite suffering from serious physical and 
mental conditions, and had attempted to commit suicide multiple times. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to stress that each Government has the obligation to protect 
the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, as set forth <i>inter alia</i> in the UDHR 
and the ICCPR. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the absolute prohibition of torture and ill-
treatment, as reiterated in paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also draws 
attention to paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council resolution 16/23, that urges States &#8220;[t]o 
ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending that prohibition to 
statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. . . .&#8221; 
Additionally, as stated in his report to the General Assembly (A/67/279; 9 August 
2012), the Special Rapporteur finds that even if the emergence of a customary norm that 
considers the death penalty as per se running afoul of the prohibition of torture and cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment is still under way, most conditions under which capital 
punishment is actually applied renders the punishment tantamount to torture. Under many 
other, less severe conditions, it still amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. He 
therefore recalls the absolute nature of the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and urges the Government to commute Mr. Taheri&#8217;s 
death sentence. He also calls on the government to undertake a prompt, impartial, and 
effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture and imposition of corporal punishment, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to ensure that Dr. Taheri 
obtains redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as 
possible.

Messrs. Kamal Malaie, Jahangir Dehghani, Jamshed Dehghani and Hamed Ahmadi, who

<p>71. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication refers to the alleged imminent risk of execution of Mr. 
Ghazi Abbasi, member of the Ahwazi Arab minority. It was alleged that Mr. Ghazi 
Abbasi&#8217;s execution might be imminent given the reported practice in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran to transfer defendants to solitary confinement before the immediate implementation 
in secret of their death sentences. Mr. Ghazi Abbasi was subject of a previous 
communication sent to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 31 July 2013, 
where the Special Rapporteur had expressed serious concerns regarding his alleged torture. 
In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur affirms that Mr. Ghazi Abbasi was in fact tortured to make him confess to 
crimes and that his rights under international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated. The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government to set aside any criminal conviction based on evidence obtained 
under torture. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern and urges the Government to

</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, dated 24 January 2014, to this communication in reference to the alleged 
executions of individuals belonging to minority groups in violation of international human 
rights law.  According to the information received, on 26 October 2013, 16 individuals of 
Baloch origin were executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran &#8220;in response&#8221; to the killing of 
14 border guards the day before. It was publicly announced that those executed were 
Messrs Nazar Mullazahi, Mehrollah Raigi Maherniya, Abdul Wahab Rigi, Habibollah 
Raiginezad Shoraki, Saeed Naroyi, Hamid Wakalat, Soleiman Miayi, Ahmad Behrami 
Zahi, Azam Gorgaij, Dawood Mir Baloch Zahi, Hasan Rezai, Habib Totazahi, Nasser 
Shabakhsh, Ahmad Dehmorda, Hossein Barahowi and Najibullah Bahadori. It is reported 
that there is no proof linking any of those executed on 26 October 2013, to the killings of 
the border guards on 25 October 2013. Furthermore, Messrs Reza Esmaili and Habibollah 
Golparipour (or Gholpari-poor), as well as Mr Shirkoo (or Sherko) Moarefi, who were 
members of the Kurdish minority, were also reportedly executed on 26 October 2013 and 4 
November 2013, respectively, after proceedings that did not comply with fair trial and due 
process standards.  All individuals executed were allegedly sentenced to death for crimes 
which do not constitute &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; under international law. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Iran that article 6(2) of ICCPR provides 
that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may 
be imposed only for the most serious crimes.&#8221;  Further, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
the due process stipulations of ICCPR article 14 and article 5 of the United Nations 
Safeguards Protecting the Rights of those Facing the Death Penalty which provide 
safeguards for those subject to the death penalty.  Further, it is noted that paragraphs 1 and 
6 of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 respectively require the prohibition of torture 
and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, and that any instances of 
the former be effectively investigated and those responsible held accountable.  The Special 
Rapporteur requests a response from the Government of Iran regarding the other 
individuals listed and that the Government take all necessary steps to respect the freedoms 
of individuals.  The Special Rapporteur further request that should the Government&#8217;s 
investigation find the allegations to be correct that any person responsible be held 
accountable.

<p>73. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication refers to the alleged imminent risk of execution of 
Messrs. Zaniar Moradi (or Zanyar Moradee) and Loghman Moradi (or Loqman Moradee), 
both members of Kurdish community. Messrs. Zaniar Moradi and Loghman Moradi were 
the subject of three previous communications where it was alleged that the defendants had 
been subjected to torture and were forced to confess. The Government&#8217;s replies on their 
cases confirmed the sentences to death against Messrs. Zaniar Moradi and Loghman 
Moradi, without however providing details on how the imposition of the death penalty in 
these cases complied with international human rights law standards. The new information 
offered in the current follow-up communication contained details of the allegations of 
torture against the defendants, as well as new allegations of violation of fair trial standards. 
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern about the continuous reports that the 
defendants were subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including with the aim of forcing 
them to confess. Given the irremediable nature of capital punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government not to proceed with the executions and to set aside any 
criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under torture. Furthermore, he calls on the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake a prompt, independent and

</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Iraq has not responded to this 
communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights 
Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and ill-treatment of Mr. Shawki 
Ahmad Sharif Omar by Iraqi officials in the Karkh Prison, Iraq, and the alleged use of 
evidence obtained through torture, incommunicado detention at an unknown location and 
arbitrary detention after the completion of his sentence. According to the information 
received, Mr. Omar and his pregnant wife were arrested as the result of an anonymous 
complaint and held incommunicado for two weeks. During the interrogation sessions, Mr. 
Omar was reportedly questioned about his alleged links to members of the Iraqi insurgent 
movement. He was repeatedly tortured by means such as electric shocks and simulations of 
drowning. Reportedly, he was also beaten in front of his wife and US security personnel 
further threatened to rape his wife in front of him. It is reported that while still being held in 
US-controlled facilities, he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for illegal entry to Iraq 
following an unfair trial before the Central Criminal Court on 24 June 2010. The sentence 
allegedly relied on statements extracted under torture from him and third persons that later 
withdrew their statements made in court. The unfair trial allegations stem from sporadic 
communications with Mr. Omar&#8217;s attorney and the sentencing hearing was scheduled three 
weeks early without an explanation. This change was not communicated to the attorney, 
preventing the attorney&#8217;s presence at this hearing. On appeal, his 15 year sentence was 
reduced to 7 years, and he is now being held arbitrarily beyond the 7 year sentence that has 
already been fulfilled. At the end of November and the beginning of December 2012, Mr. 
Omar was reportedly taken in for new interrogations, again about his alleged implication in 
terrorist networks. He was allegedly subjected to severe beatings and was threatened by 
security personnel that he would be transferred to a secret detention facility for even 
harsher treatment. On 21 May 2013, Mr. Omar was reportedly removed from his cell and 
taken to an unknown location. Family members contacted the prison authorities right after 
the transfer but were reportedly denied further information. Given the alleged previous 
torture, ill-treatment and threats voiced against Mr. Omar, the communication raised 
concerns that he was at high risk of torture and ill-treatment. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the government of Iraq of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, 
article 2(2) of the CAT provides that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a 
state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, 
may be invoked as a justification for torture. In this context, article 12 of the CAT and 
paragraph 7b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, require the competent authorities 
to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. In addition, paragraph 8b of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 reminds States that &#8220;Prolonged incommunicado detention or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b>  
</p>
<p>detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment and can in themselves constitute a form of such 
treatment,&#8221; and &#8220;urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security 
and the dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation 
are abolished.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur reminds the government of Iraq of article 15 of the 
CAT and paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which provide that any 
statement extracted through torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent 
investigation of the alleged torture and ill-treatment of Mr Shawki Ahmad Sharif Omar, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to provide full redress to the 
victim.

<p> <b>(b)</b> UA 11/09/2013 Case No. IRQ 4/2013 State Reply: 11/11/2013 <b>Alleged violent attack 
against the residents of Camp Ashraf. 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its reply dated 11 
November 2013, to an urgent appeal regarding reports of an attack on the residents of 
Camp Ashraf.  According to the information received, on 1 September 2013, the residents 
of the Camp Ashraf were subjected to a violent attack. While the facts were still being 
established, there were allegations that the attack might have been perpetrated by the Iraqi 
security forces. Reportedly, 52 individuals were killed during the attack and others were 
injured. It is alleged that the persons killed did not manifest any signs of aggression. In 
addition, seven residents of the camp, namely Ms. Mahnaz Azizi, Ms. Vajihe Karbalaey, 
Ms. Fatehma Sakhie, Ms. Fatemeh Tahoori, Ms. Lila Nabahat, Ms. Zahra Ramezany, and 
Mr. Mohammad Ratebi, were reportedly abducted during the attack. It is alleged that they 
were held by the Iraqi security forces and at the time of the allegation, were at risk of 
imminent extradition to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Forty-two residents who remained in 
Camp Ashraf were allegedly threatened with a new attack.  In light of these allegations, the 
Special Rapporteur stressed the Government&#8217;s obligation under Article 3 and 6(1) of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR) ratified by Iraq on 25 January 1971.  These provisions 
guarantee the right of every individual to life and security and provide that these rights shall 
be protected by law and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.  Additionally, 
the Special Rapporteur noted principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, (resolution 1989/65 
Economic and Social Council) which underlines that &#8220;there shall be thorough, prompt and 
impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest 
unnatural death in the above circumstances (&#8230;)&#8221;  Lastly, the allegation that those abducted 
were at risk of return to the Islamic Republic of Iran elicits concern that the Government 
could be at risk of violating its obligations of non-refoulement as expressed in paragraph 16 
of Resolution A/RES/65/205 of the UN General Assembly, which urges States &#8220;not to 
expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other way transfer a person to another State 
where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of 
being subjected to torture, and recognizes that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not 
release States from their obligations under international human rights, humanitarian and 
refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges the Government&#8217;s substantive response to these allegations in which they 
detailed the temporary nature of Camp Ashraf and the need to move the residents to another 
camp.  The Government alleged that camp residents were uncooperative and hostile to 
security forces ostensibly sent there to protect them.  While there is evidence of violent 
conflict, the Special Rapporteur welcomes ongoing investigations conducted by UNAMI, 
the judiciary, and the Iraqi Interior Ministry to determine what transpired.  It is urged that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>the Government take the results of these investigations seriously and, should the above 
allegations be substantiated, that all necessary measures are taken to hold those responsible 
accountable for their actions while ensuring full redress and compensation to the victims 
and their families.  The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to continue to ensure 
the safety of those individuals transferred from Camp Ashraf to Camp Liberty.  The 
Government is also encouraged to continue its cooperation with the mandate and release the 
results of investigations which are still ongoing.

<p>76. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its reply, dated 2 
December 2013, by which it acknowledged the receipt of this communication in reference 
to the alleged imminent risk of extradition of Mr. Ayesh Al Harby. However, the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that to date the Government of Iraq has not yet responded to the 
substance of this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. According to the communication, in 2005, Mr. Ayesh Al 
Harby, a political asylum seeker from Saudi Arabia, was reportedly arrested by the United 
States Armed Forces in Baghdad and held in detention for three years without trial or 
charges brought against him. Mr. Al Harby was reportedly subjected to torture and ill-
treatment while in detention. Shortly after his release in September 2008, he was reportedly 
arrested by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior forces and subjected to severe acts of torture. He 
was subsequently tried before Al Rusafa Court in Baghdad and sentenced to 15 years in 
prison on charges of alleged &#8220;terrorism-related activities&#8221; and membership in armed 
groups. In July 2013, Mr. Al Harby was transferred to the section of Al Rusafa Prison in 
Baghdad where he remained detained at the time the communication was sent. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses concern that if extradited to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Al Harby will be 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment and imposition of the death penalty. The Special 
Rapporteur stresses the Government&#8217;s obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons, set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 3 of the 
Convention against Torture holds that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or 
extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the 
person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Furthermore, with respect to the 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment, the Special Rapporteur draws the Government&#8217;s 
attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure a 
thorough and fair assessment to ascertain whether Mr. Al Harby is at risk of being 
subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
urges the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that his rights and 
freedoms are respected. Finally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that diplomatic 
assurances of favorable treatment from the receiving country do not mitigate the state&#8217;s 
obligation to refrain from <i>refoulement</i>.

</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged risk of imminent execution of 
Mr. Ahmad &#8216;Amr &#8216;Abd al-Qadir Muhammad, a Palestinian born in the Republic of Iraq 
who was sentenced to death in 2011 under the Anti-Terror Law No. 3005. Mr. Muhammad 
was the subject of a prior joint communication dated October 11, 2012, and the Special 
Rapporteur thanked the Government for its reply to it, which provided information on a 
temporary stay of execution. Serious concern was however expressed over new allegations 
that Mr. Muhammad was reportedly being held at the Maximum Security Prison (al-
Himaya al-Quswa) at Camp Justice, Baghdad, where executions are carried out. It was also 
alleged that Mr. Muhammad was held incommunicado, tortured, and coerced to confess 
during his detention. The Court of Cassation reportedly rejected the defendant&#8217;s appeal in 
November 2013, although he never appeared before the court in person, and the Court did 
not address his torture and coerced confession allegations.  Given the irreversibility of the 
punishment of the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur expressed grave concern regarding 
the aforementioned individuals, especially in light of allegations that torture was used to 
obtain false confessions and statements. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government of Article 15 of the CAT, which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure 
that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be 
invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government 
of Iraq to undertake a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of 
torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators. Moreover, the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to set aside any conviction based on evidence obtained 
under torture, and ensure that Mr. Muhammad obtains redress, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>78. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iraq has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged risk of imminent execution of 
Ahmad Nuri Badawi 'Abbas who was on death row at the Maximum Security Prison (al-
Himaya al-Quswa) at Camp Justice in Baghdad. It is reported that Mr. &#8216;Abbas was 
convicted in 2010 under the Anti-Terrorism Law (Law 13 of 2005) for the alleged murder 
of security officers in a February 2009 attack on a checkpoint in Baghdad, and that the 
conviction was upheld by the Court of Cassation in July 2011. The Special Rapporteur 
expressed concern about reports that the proceedings against Mr. &#8216;Abbas were conducted in 
violation of international law fair trial and due process standards. In particular, Mr. &#8216;Abbas 
has alleged he was held incommunicado in a facility of the Counter-Terrorism Union in the 
Green Zone in 2009, and that he was subjected to torture, including beatings and electro-
shock, and forced to confess during this time. Although Mr. &#8216;Abbass reportedly later 
retracted his confession, affirming that it was obtained under torture, it was claimed that the 
Court of Cassation accepted the confession, and that the defendant&#8217;s two applications for 
retrial were denied. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of 
Article 15 of the CAT, which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any 
statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that 
the statement was made,&#8221; and to paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
urges States &#8220;[t]o ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of 
torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, 
used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;  In view of the 
irreversibility of the punishment of the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to take all steps necessary to prevent the execution of Mr. 'Abbas which, if 
carried out, would be inconsistent with acceptable standards of international human rights 
law.  The Special Rapporteur also calls on the Government to undertake a prompt, 
impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution 
and punishment of the perpetrators. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to set aside any conviction based on evidence obtained under torture, and 
ensure that Mr. &#8216;Abbas obtains redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as 
full rehabilitation as possible.

Najaf, Basra, and Nassiriya, Iraq. 
79. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Iraq has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged attack in January 
2008 when police forces raided Basra and Nassiriya to destroy a Shi&#8217;a sanctuary for the 
Followers of Imam Ahmed El Hassan El Yamani, as well as other mosques and residencies. 
It was reported that 18 unarmed individuals were executed, and 378 individuals were 
detained. Allegedly, the detainees were subjected to burning, electric shocks, suffocation, 
and other kinds of physical and psychological abuse. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government of its obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. The Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23, which &quot;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot; The Special Rapporteur also 
reminds the Government of Article 15 of the CAT, which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party 
shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture 
shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur additionally 
draws the Government&#8217;s attention to articles 12 and 7 of the CAT, as well as paragraph 6b 
of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which require the competent national authorities 
to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and require State parties to hold those who 
perpetrate acts of torture responsible. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the alleged torture and religious 
intolerance perpetrated against the Followers of Imam Ahmed El Hassan el Yamani group, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the 
victims. </p>

treatment. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Israel has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged imminent extradition of 
Yitzchak Shuchat from Israel to the United States of America for allegedly committing a 
hate crime in New York City, New York. Reportedly, upon extradition he would be placed 
in prolonged solitary confinement on grounds that his safety would be at risk in the general 
population. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind Israel that it has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, set forth inter 
alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate 
paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee that prolonged 
solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by 
article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted at the 44th 
session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). The Special Rapporteur additionally 
reiterates the absolute nature of article 3 of the Convention against Torture, which provides 
that no State party shall expel, return (refouler), or extradite a person to another State where 
there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being 
subjected to torture. The Special Rapporteur requests the Government to reconsider 
extraditing Yitzchak Shuchat to the United States of America for his alleged hate crime 
committed in New York City or seek from the United States assurances that measures to 
protect him in custody will not amount to prolonged or indefinite solitary confinement.

the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Israel has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged arrest and detention of human 
rights defender Mr. Hassan Karajah, the Youth Coordinator at the Palestinian Grassroots 
Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign (Stop The Wall). According to the information received, 
Mr. Karajah was arrested in the early hours of 23 January 2013 during a raid at his family 
home in Saffa, on the West Bank, by around 20 Israeli soldiers. Mr. Karajah was then led 
outside and interrogated, after which he was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to 
Moskobiyyeh interrogation facility in Jerusalem. It is alleged that Mr. Karajah&#31;s family 
was not informed of any formal charges against him, provided with an explanation, or 
informed where he was being taken. Allegedly, he was moved to Jalameh prison on 24 
January, where his detention was extended by 12 days. While in detention Mr. Karajah was 
interrogated in excessively long sessions, lasting up to 14 hours at a time, while tied to a 
chair. Furthermore, it is alleged that after his lawyer lodged an appeal, Mr. Karajah was 
interrogated at very early hours of the morning on several occasions and informed by an 
interrogator that this was a punishment for filing the appeal. Mr. Karajah was reportedly 
denied access to a lawyer during the first twenty days of his detention. At the time of his 
arrest, Mr. Karajah was not permitted to take his medication for an inflammation and a back 
injury as the result of an accident that requires continuous medical attention. The Israeli </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>Prison Service is reportedly providing weaker and less effective medication than was 
originally prescribed. It was reported that Mr. Karajah remained in detention at the time of 
the communication, as the Ofer military court had adjourned hearings until 4 April 2013. 
He is being charged with membership of an illegal organization, apparently on the basis of 
his membership in student organizations that supplied technical equipment to the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He is also charged with contacting an illegal 
organization, which refers to allegations that he had e-mail contact with a member of 
Hizbullah. With regard to the treatment of Mr. Karajah while in detention and during 
interrogation, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be 
justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent 
investigation of the allegations of prolonged excessive interrogation practices, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to provide full redress to the victim.

death of Mr. Arafat Jaradat and reported claim the cause of death was a heart attack, despite 
contrary autopsy reports. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Israel has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and death of Mr. Arafat 
Jaradat during his interrogation in Megiddo prison in Israel, by Israeli Security Agency 
(ISA) officers. According to the information received, Mr. Jaradat was arrested on 
suspicion of throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at settler cars. During interrogation he 
confessed to throwing stones but denied any involvement with firebombs. According to Mr. 
Jaradat&#8217;s lawyer, he was suffering from severe pain in his back and appeared to be 
psychologically and physically weak. He was forced to sit for long hours in stress positions 
with his hands shackled behind his back and the judge ordered his detention extended for an 
additional 12 days without any medical examination of his psychological and physical 
conditions. It is reported that on 23 February 2013, Mr. Jaradat died in a special section of 
the ISA Megiddo prison, the Israeli authorities claiming that he died due to a heart attack. 
According to a Palestinian autopsy report, there were multiple injuries on his body and 
clear signs of torture of the previously healthy man, and no sign of a heart attack. The cause 
of death was determined in that report to be nervous shock resulting from severe pain, 
which was caused by multiple injuries inflicted through direct and extreme torture. Mr. 
Jaradat displayed severe bruising on his upper back, deep bruising along the spine, and 
significant bruising on both sides of the chest. The postmortem also discovered bruising on 
both arms and inside the mouth, blood around the nose and three fractured ribs. It is 
reported that, as of the date of the communication, no further investigation into the death of 
Mr. Jaradat and the surrounding circumstances had been launched by the government of 
Israel. Furthermore it is reported that over 700 Palestinian detainees have filed complaints 
against agents of the ISA for mistreatment during interrogation since 2003, however, no 
criminal investigations have been opened. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds 
the government of Israel of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In addition, the Special Rapporteur 
reminds the government of article 2(2) of the Convention Against Torture, which provides </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b>  
</p>
<p>that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, 
internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a 
justification of torture. In this regard, paragraph 2 of Resolution 16/23 of the Human Rights 
Council condemns any action that authorizes or acquiesces to torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances, and urges States 
to ensure accountability for all such acts. With regards to the obligation to investigate all 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to article 12 
of the Convention Against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 of the Convention, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. In addition, Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 urges States to take persistent, determined and effective measures to investigate 
promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, any torture allegations. 
Furthermore Resolution 16/23 urges States to hold responsible not only those who 
perpetrate torture, but also those &#8220;who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts 
[...], to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with the 
gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the 
prohibited act is found to have been committed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reminds the 
government of Israel that the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, Rule 
22(2) provides that &#8220;(s)ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to 
specialized institutions or to civil hospitals.&#8221; With respect to the subsequent death in 
custody of Mr. Jaradat, article 6 of the ICCPR provides that every individual has the right 
to life and security of the person, that this right shall be protected by law, and that no 
person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation of the torture and death 
of Mr. Arafat Jaradat, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to 
provide full redress to the victim&#8217;s family.

</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Israel has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged severe torture and ill-treatment 
of Mr. X upon arrest, during transport to ISF quarters and during interrogation by members 
of the Israeli Security Forces (ISF). The allegations included: beatings, threats, 
incommunicado detention, solitary confinement, humiliating conditions of detention, denial 
of access to a lawyer upon arrest, and denial of family visits since 17 March 2013. It was 
reported that Mr. X is a 16-year-old minor resident of Hares, Salfit, Palestine; that he was 
arrested by ISF on 17 March 2013 and that his family was neither informed about the 
location he was taken to nor for how long he would remain in custody. Reportedly, in May 
2013, Mr. Xi and four other minors were charged with attempted murder for throwing 
stones and causing an accident on Route 5, a settler road near Hares. According to 
information received, eyewitness accounts indicate that the accident occurred for other 
unrelated reasons and in the absence of any involvement of Mr. X. Mr. X was reportedly 
denied access to a lawyer until 21 March 2013, up until which point neither the lawyer nor 
the family had received any information regarding his fate or whereabouts. It was reported 
that Mr. X remains in detention at the Megiddo Prison in Israel. The Special Rapporteur 
regrets that the Government has not responded to this communication and concerns 
expressed regarding the allegations of torture and ill-treatmen of Mr. X. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that it has the obligation to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading </p>

The treatment alleged in the communication also constitutes a violation of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, which Israel is a party.  Due to the lack of information provided 
by the Government, the Special Rapporteur finds the allegations received credible and 
concludes that Mr. X has been tortured and suffered ill-treatment during transport and while 
undergoing interrogation in Israeli custody, including threats of further abuse, 
incommunicado detention during the first three days of detention, solitary confinement 
during the period of his interrogation, demeaning conditions of custody and denial of access 
to family visits as well as a lawyer.

</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of State of Israel has not 
responded to this communication dated 2 August 2013, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged arrest, harassment, defamation and use of force employed against Mr. Issa Amro, a 
peaceful demonstrator and prominent Palestinian human rights defender on 20 March 2013.  
According to the information received, Mr. Amro was peacefully protesting when Israeli 
Security Forces (ISF) arrested him and other activists.  It is reported that the other activist 
were released without bail and Mr. Amro was arrested on suspicion of inciting others to 
demonstrate and assaulting Israeli soldiers and an Israeli settler; mr. Amro was released on 
bail the following day.  The alleged facts detail multiple occasions when Mr. Amro was 
threatened with death and branded a terrorist, and summoned to court proceedings or for 
police interrogation.   According to the information received, on 23 April 2013 Mr. Amro&#8217;s 
face was spat on by an Israeli settler in the presence of an Israeli soldier that testified that 
Mr. Amro provoked the settler.   It is further alleged that Mr. Amro&#8217;s identity documents 
and those of a French television crew he was guiding around the Old City of Hebron were 
confiscated by Israeli soldiers; everyone&#8217;s documents were returned except Mr. Amro&#8217;s.  
Based on the information received, Mr. Amro complained about the non-return of his 
identity documents, was arrested for obstructing police work and transferred to the police 
station where he was beaten, including blows to the spine, until he collapsed.  The 
information received notes that despite needing urgent medical attention, Mr. Amro was 
handcuffed to a stretcher and left for five and half hours before being taken to the hospital.  
During this time it is alleged that the ISF took pictures of and laughed at Mr. Amro while 
threatening that next time he would be shot.  Additional allegations indicate that Mr. Amro 
and others were shot at with two live bullets which intentionally missed high and Mr. Amro 
was interrogated despite a request for postponement due to his weak condition following 
the police station beating.   
</p>
<p>85. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons as set forth 
inter alia in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CAT.  The Special Rapporteur would like to call the 
Government of Israel&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
(Resolution 16/23) condemns all forms of torture and &#8220;calls upon all Sates to implement 
fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government that Resolution 16/23 paragraph 8 states that &#8220;Intimidation and coercion, as 
described in article 1 of the Convention against Torture, including serious and credible 
threats, as well as death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third person, 
can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221;  Regarding the fact that 
several of the allegations relate to Israeli settlers, the Special Rapporteur refers the 
Government to paragraph 18 of General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>62</b>  
</p>
<p>which asserts State responsibility when the Government fails to intervene in acts of torture 
or ill-treatment committed by non-State officials.  Additionally, the Special Rapporteur 
calls the Government&#8217;s attention to Articles 7 and 12 of the CAT and paragraph 6b of 
Resolution 16/23 which requires competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation of alleged torture and prosecute perpetrators.  The Special Rapporteur also 
reminds the Government that everyone has the inherent right to life and effective protection 
through judicial or other means who are in danger of execution or the subject of death 
threats under ICCPR Article 6(1) and principle 4 of the Principles on Effective Prevention 
and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.  Lastly, The Special 
Rapporteur requests a response from the Government of Israel regarding the harassment 
and torture of Mr. Amro and calls on the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Amro are respected.  The Special Rapporteur 
further request that should the Government&#8217;s investigation find the allegations to be correct 
that any person responsible be held accountable.

response to the joint urgent appeal of 7 June 2013, regarding the deportation of the Kazakh 
national, Ms. Alma Shalabayeva, who is the wife of Mr. Mukhtar Ablyazov a political 
opponent of the current President of Kazakhstan, and their 6-year old daughter on 31 May 
2013.  Ms. Shalabayeva was formally charged for her alleged involvement in a case of 
illegal issuance of passports. The communication referred to the violation of the principle 
of non-refoulment and due process guarantees, based on serious concerns that the 
aforementioned individuals would be at risk of acts of torture or other forms of ill treatment 
upon their return to Kazakhstan. In its response, the Government of Italy provided factual 
information of the administrative investigation issued by the Italian Ministry of Interior on 
16 July 2013 and a detailed description of the &#8220;information flows&#8221; among different levels 
of Italian administrators, aiming to identify the responsibilities of the officers involved. The 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts made by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  
inter alia in Astana, Brussels and Vilnius, in order to protect Ms. Shalabayeva&#8217;s and her 
daughter&#8217;s rights. He welcomes the Government&#8217;s actions to rescind the deportation order 
on 12 July 2013, and assist in the return of the aforementioned individuals to Italy, which 
eventually took place on 27 December 2013. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the 
investigation opened by the Office of Prosecution to inquire into possible illegal behaviour 
and recalls article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to continue its engagement with the mandate and urges the competent 
authorities to conclude the independent investigation, leading to prosecute and punish those 
responsible for the illegal deportation of Ms. Shalabayeva and her child.

that the physical manifestations of the beatings were a result of his own self-mutilation with 
a shaving razor in the shower. The reply does not address what steps are being taken to 
guarantee the safety and physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Kuramshim while he is 
in detention. The reply also does not address what evidence was used to incriminate Mr. 
Kuramshim and whether it was obtained apart from the police findings. Although the 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply, he reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur observes that the reply does not establish conclusively that the origin of the the 
victim&#8217;s wounds was determined in an independent, impartial and scientific inquiry.  He 
reiterates article 12 of the CAT, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur also reminds the 
Government of paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges States 
&#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially 
examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate 
or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely 
punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act 
is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to 
combat torture&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government to continue its 
engagement with the mandate.

trial protections to human rights defender Mr. Vadim Kuramshin by suspending Ms. Raziya 
Nurmasheva&#8217;s license to practice law, and disciplining Mr. Kuramshin&#8217;s other defense 
counsel, Mr. Iskander Alimbayev. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kazakhstan for its reply, dated 26 
March 2013, to this communication in reference to developments in Mr. Vadim 
Kuramshin&#8217;s trial and allegations of legal barriers that prevent Mr. Kuramshim and his 
attorneys, Ms. Raziya Nurmasheva and Mr. Iskander Alimbayev, from receiving a fair trial. 
Mr. Kuramshin had been the subject of three previous urgent appeals, the most recent of 
which also included Ms. Nurmasheva. On 8 October 2010, an urgent appeal (no. KAZ 
2/2010) was sent to the Government of Kazakhstan in which concerns were raised 
regarding the arrest of Mr. Kuramshin while he tried to arrange a visit with a prisoner in his 
capacity as a defender of prisoners&#8217; rights, on the basis of an anonymous accusation that he 
was involved in drug trafficking. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its 
response dated 21 January 2011 laying out details of the investigation, although concerns 
remained as to the trustworthiness of the accusation. The second urgent appeal (no. KAZ 
4/2011) was sent to the Government of Kazakhstan on 3 October 2011 concerning the 
arrest of Mr. Kuramshin on two occasions, and the alleged failure of the Prosecutor&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>64</b>  
</p>
<p>Office to investigate his accusations that the proper procedures were breached during these 
arrests. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response dated 21 February 
2012 but regrets that little information was provided therein responding to these specific 
allegations. The most recent urgent appeal (no. KAZ 1/2013) was sent on 15 January 2013, 
on behalf of the Special Rapporteurs on the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the 
situation of human rights defenders; the independence of judges and lawyers; and torture 
and other cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. The appeal detailed grave concerns 
regarding allegations of a spate of procedural violations that had taken place during the 
trial, concerns that Mr. Kuramshin may have been beaten repeatedly by police and 
threatened with, among other things, sexual violence while in detention, and concerns that 
the ruling to deprive Ms. Nurmasheva of her licence to practice law may have been 
arbitrary. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed response dated 11 
February 2013 where it is stated that &#8220;due to their professional activity this particular 
category of citizens [human rights defenders] is at higher risk of potential violation of their 
rights, threats against their personal life and health and that of their families and relatives, 
the law-enforcement authorities of Kazakhstan attach top priority to all these cases and 
investigation thereof is carried out within the shortest time possible and with thorough 
examination of all the circumstances of a case.&#8221; In recent developments, it is reported that 
Mr. Kuramshim petitioned to be transferred to another prison where he would not be 
subjected to severe risk to his physical and psychological integrity, but was denied after the 
judge failed to even consider facts on procedural violations submitted by Mr. Kuramshim&#8217;s 
attorneys. Ms. Nurmasheva was reportedly prohibited from mentioning alleged misconduct 
and human rights violations by law enforcement officials against Mr. Kuramshin, on the 
grounds that this would &#8220;cause prejudice among the jury.&#8221; Mr. Kuramshin&#8217;s attorneys were 
also allegedly accused of protracting the court proceedings by bringing in motions and 
requesting to examine certain pieces of evidence, despite this being common practice for 
attorneys and essential for due process and a fair trial. The attorneys were also allegedly 
denied access to several documents that constituted evidence as they were reportedly 
classified as &#8220;secret&#8221;, which may have amounted to a violation of minimum standards for a 
fair trial. It is also reported that the decision to strip Ms. Nurmasheva of her license was 
upheld and disciplinary action against Mr. Alimbayev was recommended. In its reply, the 
Government of Kazakhstan denied any allegations of torture, that the mild bruises and 
scratches he received were from the time Mr. Kuramshin was resisting arrest. The 
Government also alleged that he  mutilated himself and a gash on his left arm was inflicted 
in protest of his detention conditions. However, according to the Government&#8217;s response, 
Mr. Kuramshin did not complain to a procurator overseeing compliance with the law in 
correctional institutions regarding his prison conditions. The Government claims that all 
these incidents resulted in proper medical treatment. The court found him guilty because 
there was overwhelming incriminating evidence. Ms. Nurmasheva had her practicing 
license suspended because of apparent misconduct, an inappropriate attitude, and delaying 
the trial unnecessarily. Mr. Kuramshin also allegedly did not want Mr. Alimbayev to 
represent him, so the court assigned its own defense counsel. The Government did not 
address any disciplinary action against Mr. Alimbayev. Although the Special Rapporteur 
appreciates the reply, he notes that it fails to show that the physical evidence of 
mistreatment was independently and impartially investigated.  He reminds the Government 
of Kazakhstan of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reminds the 
Government of article 12 of the Convention against Torture, and other Cruel, Inhuman and 
Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT), which requires the competent authorities to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>65 
</b></p>
<p>undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which requires State 
parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. In this context, paragraph 7b of the 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and 
effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined by the competent national 
authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture 
responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely punished, including the officials

committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the Effective Investigation 
and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or

<p> <b>(c)</b> JUA 17/07/2013 Case No. KAZ 3/2013 State reply: 06/08/2013 and 31/07/2013 
<b>Deportation by the Italian authorities to Kazakhstan and alleged risks of torture 
and/or other forms of ill treatment </b>(refer to related Case No. ITA 1/2013). 
89. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kazakhstan for its reply, dated 6 
August 2013, regarding the deportation of Ms. Alma Shalabayeva and her 6-year old 
daughter on 31 May 2013 to Kazakhstan, in contravention with the principle of non-
refoulement and due process guarantees. The communication made reference to the charges 
under which the individuals were deported, which are allegedly imposed as reprisals against 
Ms. Shalabayeva for the actions of her husband, Mr. Mukhtar Ablyazov, a political 
opponent of Kazakhstan&#8217;s President. It was reported that Mr. Ablyazov was granted asylum 
in the United Kingdom in 2011 on the grounds that he was deemed to be at risk of 
persecution in Kazakhstan. In this context, the return of the aforementioned individuals to 
Kazakhstan also placed them at risk of being subjected to torture or other forms of ill 
treatment. The communication also refered to the official invitation to Ms. Shalabayeva and 
her daughter to return to Italy, issued by the Italian Government on 12 July 2013, in light of 
the cancelled deportation order. In its reply, the Government states that Ms. Shalabayeva 
and her child were protected by the State in accordance to the Article 17 of the 
Constitution, which condemns all forms of torture. While the Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that the Kazakh Constitution reflects the State&#8217;s adherence to the Convention 
against Torture (CAT), he finds that the Government did not provide sufficient information 
about the measures taken to ensure the physical and mental integrity of the aforementioned 
individuals. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government actions to enable the return 
of Ms. Shalabayeva and her child to Italy on 27 December 2013.

<p> <b>(d)</b> UA 22/08/2013 Case No. KAZ 4/2013 State reply: None to date <b>Alleged psychiatric 
detention, forced psychiatric confinement, and ill-treatment of two human rights 
defenders.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged detention 
and forced psychiatric confinement of two human rights defenders, Ms. Zinaida 
Moukhortova, a human rights lawyer, and Mr. Aleksandr Kharlamov, an investigative 
journalist and member of the of the human rights organization &#8220;Secret Service.&#8221; Serious 
concern was expressed at the possibility that Ms. Moukhortova&#8217;s current forced psychiatric 
confinement and Mr. Kharlamov&#8217;s continued detention was related to their work in defence 
of human rights.  In the case of Ms. Moukhortova, it is reported that in the year 2010, she 
was arrested and criminally charged with the &#8220;deliberate filing of a false complaint&#8221; after </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>66</b>  
</p>
<p>she submitted a complaint to the Government alleging interference in the administration of 
justice by a member of Parliament. Shortly after her arrest, Ms. Moukhortova underwent a 
psychiatric examination, was diagnosed with a &#8220;delusional disorder,&#8221; and found guilty of 
the aforementioned charges. From August 2010 to September 2011, Ms. Moukhortova 
continued to be detained in prison facilities and in the Aktas regional psychiatric hospital, 
and was only released in September 2011. In September 2012, Ms. Moukhortova was 
forcibly taken to the Blakhash psychiatric clinic on August 9, 2013.  As of the time of this 
communication, Ms. Moukhortova remained hospitalized against her will and it was alleged 
that her lawyer was refused permission to visit her. In the case of Mr. Aleksandr 
Kharlamov, it is reported that in March 2013 he was arrested and detained on charges of 
&#8220;incitement of social, national, ethic, racial or religious hatred,&#8221; after a determination by the 
Forensic Science Institute of East Kazakhstan that his writings aimed at inciting religious 
hatred. After a psychiatric examination at the Republican Scientific/Practical Center if 
Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Narcology in Almaty found Mr. Kharlamov sane, he was 
moved to a pre-trial detention center (SIZO) and his case was referred for further 
investigations on the basis of article 202 of the Criminal Procedure Code on changing the 
charges/indictment.  Concern was expressed that given the lack of a criminal case against 
Mr. Kharlamov, authorities may have shifted their focus to detaining him on grounds of 
insanity.  Mr. Kharlamov reportedly remained in detention at the time of this 
communication. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that each Government has 
the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, set forth 
<i>inter alia</i> in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Special Rapporteur additionally wishes to recall 
the absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as reiterated in paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23, adopted in April 2011, which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Regarding the alleged temporary psychiatric confinement of Mr. Kharlamov 
and forced psychiatric hospitalization of Ms. Moukhortova, the Special Rapporteur would 
also like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to his 2013 report (A/HRC/22/53) to the 
Human Rights Council, which states in paragraph 64 that both the mandate and United 
Nations treaty bodies have established that involuntary treatment and other psychiatric 
interventions in health-care facilities can constitute forms of torture and ill-treatment 
(A/63/175, paras. 44, 47, 61, 63; Human Rights Committee, communication No. 110/1981) 
and that to the extent that they inflict severe pain and suffering, they violate the absolute 
prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (A/63/175, paras. 38, 40, 
41). The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take all necessary measures to 
safeguard the physical and psychological integrity and fundamental rights of all persons.

</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Libya has not responded to 
this communication dated 12 July 2013, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council.  The communication alleged militias, and in 
some cases ordinary citizens, motivated by xenophobia and misguided fears about diseases, 
detained foreign nationals on an almost daily basis in holding centers. It was further alleged </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>68</b>  
</p>
<p>that the conditions observed in most of these holding centers fall short of international 
standards, and at times amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. It is further 
reported that migrants are being forcibly tested for diseases and then deported, and are 
otherwise particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.  The Special Rapporteur 
expressed concern that these alleged detentions are arbitrary and thus prohibited by ICCPR 
article 9(1).  Furthermore the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the conditions of 
detention reported, alleged forced medical treatment/testing, and allegations of corporal 
punishment all rise to the level of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and are 
violations of the basic human rights of those detained.  In turn the Government is reminded 
of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221;   With regard to the reported lack of an immigration system capable of 
adjudicating asylum claims or granting refugee status to migrants fleeing crisis in areas 
such as Syria, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern that such practices constitute a 
violation of article 3 of the CAT.  This article provides that no State party shall expel, 
return (refouler), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds 
for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. In this regard, 
paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in which the Human Rights Committee 
states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of 
extradition, expulsion or refoulement.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
respond to these allegations and take meaningful action to ensure the basic human rights of 
migrants fleeing to Libya are recognized.

</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Malaysia has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged repatriation of six ethnic 
Uighurs to the People&#8217;s Republic of China, where Uighurs are frequently accused of 
terrorism without substantiating evidence and subjected to torture and other human rights 
violations. Allegedly the Malaysian police secretly transferred the asylum seekers into 
Chinese custody, and they were brought back to the People&#8217;s Republic of China on a 
chartered flight. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 3 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT) provides that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite 
a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture. In this regard, paragraph 9 of General 
Comment 20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, in which the Human Rights Committee states that State parties &#8220;must not 
expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment upon return to another country by way of extradition, expulsion or 
refoulement&#8221;. Furthermore, paragraph 9 of the Resolution A/RES/61/253 of the UN 
General Assembly urges States &#8220;not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other 
way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that 
the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture&#8221;.  The Special Rapporteur also  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>69 
</b></p>
<p>insists that, although Malaysia is not a party to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), it is bound by the 
international customary law rule codified in article 3 CAT that prohibits a State from 
expelling or extraditing a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture, which is is an integral 
part of international human rights protection. Furthermore, paragraph 6d of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 8/8 urges States not to expel, return (refouler), extradite or in any other 
way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that 
the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture; the Council recognizes in this 
respect that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not release States from their obligations 
under international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle 
of nonrefoulement. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt 
and independent investigation into the alleged secret repatriation of the six ethnic Uighurs 
to the People&#8217;s Republic of China, leading to prosecution and punishment of those 
responsible, and to provide full redress to the victims.

to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication refers to the alleged torture and ill-treatment of 
civilians, including Filipino migrants, by the Malaysian military in Sabah. Security forces 
allegedly carried out an attack in Sabah, known as &#8220;Operation Daulat&#8221; against the militant 
group, &quot;Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo.&quot;  It has been 
reported that civilians were among the casualties. Additionally, it is alleged that security 
forces systematically tortured and abused civilians in the area, particularly Filipino 
migrants, before, during and after the operation. Civilians were allegedly arbitrarily arrested 
and detained, subjected to beatings, denied adequate food, water and medical care. 
Additionally, Malaysian forces have allegedly forcibly evicted Filipino in the area and have 
detained them in crowded evacuation camps with lack of access to adequate food and 
supplies. It is also alleged that the Malaysian Government has denied access to human 
rights groups, UN officials and the media from the Sabha region. The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government that the common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions 
provides that in non-international armed conflicts, all persons not taking an active part in 
hostilities, including persons in custody, shall be treated humanely. Article 3 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantee the right of every individual to life and 
security, while paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;condemns all 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; Additionally, paragraph 7b of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 urges States to take prompt and effective measures to investigate, prosecute and 
punish all acts of torture and ill-treatment. Furthermore, General Assembly resolution 
67/172 declares &#8220;the duty of States to effectively promote and protect the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children, regardless 
of their migration status, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the international instruments to which they are party.&#8221; Without any evidence to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the victims&#8217; rights under international 
standards relating to the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as well as other standards 
of international human rights and humanitarian law, have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Malaysian Government to clarify the alleged abuses, to conduct 
thorough and independent investigations, leading to the prosecution and punishment of all </p>

such acts.

<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>JAL 26/02/2013 Case No. MDV 1/2013 State reply: None to date</b> Allegations concerning 
legal provisions that allow sentencing of sexually abused minors on charges of fornication. 
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of the Maldives 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to alleged legal 
provisions in the Maldives that allow sexually abused minors to be charged with provisions 
and punished under penalties such as flogging. This discourages reporting of rape and child 
sex abuse and perpetuates the negative social stigma of revealing past experiences of sexual 
abuse. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of the Republic of 
the Maldives of paragraph 7 (a) of resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council which 
reminded Governments that corporal punishment, including of children, can amount to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture. The Special Rapporteur would 
also like to reiterate that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as stipulated in the 
annual report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment to the 60th session of the General Assembly. The Special 
Rapporteur also notes that States cannot invoke provisions of domestic law to justify 
violations of their human rights obligations under international law, including the 
prohibition of corporal punishment and calls upon States to abolish all forms of judicial and 
administrative corporal punishment without delay (para.28 A/60/316). Both the Human 
Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture have called for the abolition of 
judicial corporal punishment. In paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 (1992), the 
Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for 
a crime or as an educative or disciplinary measure. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the alleged use of 
laws that incriminate victims of sexual abuse, effectively silencing reports of rape and other 
sexual perpetrations, which does not allow for adequate judicial redress for victims of 
sexual abuse.

migrants stranded off the coast of Malta. 
</b></p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malta for its reply, dated 14 
October 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged denial of entry to migrants 
stranded in a boat off the coast of Malta. According to allegations, the Maltese military 
refused to allow a tanker to disembark on Maltese territory after it had rescued 102 
migrants at sea, including four pregnant women, one injured woman and a five month-old 
baby. The Maltese military provided medical assistance, water and food to the stranded 
migrants, but such assistance was not adequate, according to the allegations. The Maltese 
Government alleges that the tanker was originally ordered by Italian maritime authorities to 
disembark at Libya, the nearest port of call, and was duly notified by Maltese authorities 
that it would be denied entrance to Malta&#8217;s territorial waters.  Malta also alleges that it 
provided adequate medical aid, water and other provisions, but that it was not at any time 
legally responsible for the rescued persons. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>71 
</b></p>
<p>the recommendation of the Maltese Government that the migrants be returned to Libya, 
given the alleged risk of exploitation, indefinite detention, torture and ill-treatment that 
migrants face in Libya, and notes that Libya has not adopted adequate legislation and 
administrative structures dealing with asylum and human rights protections. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that article 3 of the Convention against Torture, paragraph 16 of the 
Resolution 65/205 of the UN General Assembly, and General Comment No. 20 of the 
Human Rights Committee provide that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or 
extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the 
person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Furthermore Human Rights 
Council resolution 9/5 &quot;requests States to effectively promote and protect the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children, 
regardless of their immigration status, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the international instruments to which they are party&quot;. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that the rights of all migrants are protected in 
accordance with the international prohibition against torture and ill-treatment and other 
international human rights standards, and to continue to openly engage with the Special 
Rapporteur and other international mechanisms.

</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Moldova has not responded 
to this communication dated 23 September 2013, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate established by the Human Rights Council.  The allegation regarded the alleged 
gang-rape of a pregnant woman and subsequent acquiescence of police officials in failing to 
punish those responsible.  According to the information received, on 17 August 2013, while 
returning home, Ms. X was approached by a young individual who offered to accompany 
her to the village of Y, her hometown. Soon after she accepted, Ms. X was forced to get in a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>73 
</b></p>
<p>mini-bus and was taken to a field outside the village. Ms. X was brutally gang-raped by 7 
men for the entire night. On 22 August 2013, five persons allegedly broke into MS. X&#8217;s 
house and threatened to kill her. It is reported that the alleged perpetrators were only 
apprehended by the police after a relative of Ms. X had filed a formal complaint, and that 
they were released within 72 hours. It is further reported that the parents of the alleged 
perpetrators and a police officer visited Ms. X and her relative at their home and forced her 
to sign a written declaration affirming that she had no complaint of rape against the alleged 
perpetrators. It is further alleged that the police failed to respond quickly and effectively 
after the above incidents were reported and that those officers investigating this case 
colluded with the alleged perpetrators.  The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the alleged 
behavior of government officials in acquiescing to or possibly cooperating with perpetrators 
of crimes and intimidation, such as those reported, may constitute violations of paragraph 
18 of the General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/GC/2, 24 
January 2008). In this provision, the Committee has made clear that where State authorities 
or others acting in official capacity or under colour of law, know or have reasonable 
grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being committed by non-State 
officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, 
prosecute and punish such non-State officials or private  actors consistently with the 
Convention, the State bears responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, 
complicit or otherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in 
such impermissible acts.  The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to engage with 
the mandate and respond to the allegations as well as provide information regarding the 
steps taken to protect victims of violence and intimidation such as Ms. X.

mistreatment of four Bengali men in the Rakhine State by denying medical treatment and 
legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>105. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for its reply, dated 24 
May 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged poor holding conditions of 
Messrs. Zafawr Ahmed, Nawbi Hussein, Mohammed Shawrif and Rahametullah. 
According to the information received, Mr. Zafawr Ahmed, Mr. Nawbi Hussein, and Mr. 
Mohammed Shawrif were reportedly shot by the border security forces (Nasaka) in Ohn 
Daw Gyi village, Sittwe, on 28 February 2013. They were, at the time of the 
communication, in police custody in no. 1 police station in Sittwe, having been discharged 
from Sittwe General Hospital on 2 March 2013. It is reported that the three men had 
wounds that were infected and in need of urgent medical treatment. The men were involved 
in the construction of a camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ohn Daw Gyi 
village. On 28 February 2013, at 1 pm, around 10-12 Nasaka personnel, based near the 
construction site, arrived at the site. Mr. Ahmed resisted and tried to free himself from the 
grip of a Nasaka commander, who took out his pistol and fired, with the bullet scraping Mr. 
Ahmed&#8217;s head and wounding him. Another Nasaka officer allegedly dragged Mohammed 
Shawrif along the ground. The officer then allegedly fired an automatic gun directly at Mr. 
Sharif&#8217;s back. Meanwhile, another Nasaka officer reportedly tried to drag Nawbi Hussein 
along the ground. When the three victims escaped and reached their homes, they were taken 
to Sittwe General Hospital. Rahametullah was also arrested and taken to No. 1 police 
station in Sittwe for allegedly destroying a latrine, which had been constructed despite the 
landowner&#8217;s objections. Rahametullah, Zafawr Ahmed, Nawbi Hussein and Mohammed 
Shawrif have reportedly been charged with attacking Nasaka under article 333 of the 
Myanmar penal code &#8220;Whoever voluntarily causes grievous harm to any person being a 
public servant in the discharge of this duty as public servant or with intent to prevent or 
deter that person or any other public servant from discharging his duty as public servant or 
in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by that person in the lawful 
discharge of his duty as public servant shall be punished with imprisonment&#8230; for a term 
which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine.&#8221; The four men had reportedly 
been verbally abused, denied medication, and not  given enough food in detention. 
Moreover, none of the men hade access to legal counsel. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for the response dated 24 May 2013 which stated that all the allegations of 
withholding medical treatment and denial of access to a lawyer were rejected. Additionally, 
the response described the factual circumstances of the arrests, describing the hostile 
attacks that forced the arrests of the named individuals. The Special Rapporteur would like 
to remind the Government of Myanmar of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment 
of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that, &#8220;Sick prisoners who require specialist treatment 
shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities 
are provided in an institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies 
shall be proper for the medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a 
staff of suitable trained officers. Furthermore, Rule 25(1) provides that, &#8220;The medical 
officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should 
daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his 
attention is specially directed.&#8221; (Approved by the Economic and Social Council by </p>

<p><b>78</b>

<p>resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977.). To the extent 
that the Government&#8217;s response does not address the allegations of mistreatment or 
conditions of detention, the Special Rapporteur finds that the Government has violated the 
rights of these inmates under international law regarding torture and cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment.  He also encourages the Government of Myanmar to continue its 
engagement with the mandate.

Letpadaung copper mine.  
</p>
<p>106. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Myanmar for its reply, dated 1 
July 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged beating and shooting of rubber 
bullets by the police and military against protesting farmers outside the Letpadaung copper 
mine. On 25 April 2013 in the Letpadaung copper mine area, at Sal Tal village, Sagaing 
Region, around 100 riot police and 50 soldiers arrived to remove dozens of farmers who 
had refused compensation from the owners of the Letpadaung copper mine, a Chinese state-
owned company, Wan-Bao. and the military-owned Union of Myanmar Economic 
Holdings Ltd. The farmers reportedly started plowing their fields three days previously and 
the police and military arrived to remove the farmers. The farmers were reportedly beaten 
with batons and had rubber bullets fired at them by the police and military, resulting in 
injuries to ten of the farmers, including one who was allegedly shot in his arm and rib. 
Three activists involved in the protest were reportedly arrested and sent to the Wan-Bao 
company building. Stones were reportedly thrown at police lines by protestors and 15 
police officers were reportedly injured. Subsequently, the commander of the Sagaing 
Region Police Force reportedly announced that the police would lodge charges against 
eight persons for allegedly provoking demonstrations and other alleged illegal actions. The 
Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response dated 1 July 2013 that stated 
that the arrest was not because of a refusal of compensation, but because they were 
trespassing an area that was designated as only for authorized persons. The trespassers were 
equipped with sticks, knives, slingshots, and stones. The Government reported that none of 
the protesters were injured. The Special Rapporteur reminds the government of Myanmar 
of article 20 of the UDHR which provides that &#8220;[e]veryone has the right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and association. No one may be compelled to belong to an association.&#8221; 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government of article 12 
paras. 2 and 3 of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups 
and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedmos.  They provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to 
ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse 
discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her 
legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone 
is entitled, individually and in association with others, to be protected effectively under 
national law in reacting against or opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, 
including those by omission, attributable to States that result in violations of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals 
that affect the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Special 
Rapporteur also draws attention to Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement officials, in 
carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to 
the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use 
of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint 
in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate object 
to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; (c) </p>

detention of seven Muslim community leaders in Sittwe, Rakhine State, between 26 
and 29 April 2013.</b>  
</p>
<p>107. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Myanmar for its reply, dated 26 
July 2013, to this communication in reference to the reported arrest and detention of seven 
Muslim community leaders. The communication referred to the alleged arrest of seven 
Muslim community leaders in Sittwe, Rakhine State, following &#8220;population verification 
exercises&#8221; conducted on 26 April 2013. It is reported that U Kyaw Myint, U Ba Thar, 
Sawlima (female), Mohammed Hashim, U Kyaw Khin, U San Lin, and U Hla Myint, were 
arrested between 26 and 29 April and have subsequently been charged with offences 
relating to a protest against the verification exercise within the Muslim village and IDP 
areas which took place on 26 April. It is reported that on 26 April, the local government of 
Rakhine State began implementation of a &#8220;verification exercise&#8221; among Muslim IDPs and 
villagers with the objective of providing the Government with accurate household 
population data. Reportedly, documentation used in the course of the exercise required 
Muslims to be registered as &#8220;Bengali&#8221; rather than being able to register under their 
preferred identification as &#8220;Rohingya&#8221;. Allegedly some individuals objected to this and 
went into the street where they shouted that they were Rohingya. Observers report that the 
incident was small and involved many children and youth. Reportedly some stones were 
thrown and some members of the verification teams were lightly injured during the 
incidents. It is reported that following these incidents the exercise was suspended and that a 
police operation was initiated, leading to the arrest between 26 and 29 April, of U Kyaw 
Myint, U Ba Thar, Sawlima, Mohammed Hashim, U Kyaw Khin, U San Lin, and U Hla 
Myint in the Thet Kae Pyin area. Unverified reports indicated that those arrested might 
have been subjected to ill-treatment in detention in Sittwe Police Station Number 1 where 
they were reportedly held until 23 May. It was reported that Mohammed Hashim is a 
juvenile, allegedly aged 15 or 16, and that U Ba Thar is in poor health and suffering from a 
serious medical condition, including heart disease for which he requires daily medical 
treatment, to which he reportedly had not received access. U San Lin was also reported to 
have suffered serious injury to his legs as a result of his treatment while in detention.   
According to information received, the arrests are arbitrary and are reportedly based on 
their refusal to register as &#8220;Bengali&#8221;, their presence in the locality in which a demonstration 
took place, or their status as community leaders. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to recall that failure to provide proper medical treatment and permit family visits 
contravenes international law. Additionally, he would like to reiterate that paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be 
justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In 
addition, States are under the obligation to investigate all suspicions of torture or ill-
treatment independently and impartially, with the purpose of establishing the possible use 
of prohibited forms of treatment and bringing those responsible to justice.

</p>
<p>108. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for its reply, dated 22 
July 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged excessive use of force by 
police officers against ethnic Rohingya villagers who were protesting the construction of 
new housing units in Pa Rein village in Rakhine State. According to the allegations, police 
forces fired into an unarmed crowd of protesters, killing three persons and injuring five. 
Investigative authorities allegedly did not arrive at the scene until the following day and 
failed to adequately investigate the incident. In its reply, the Government alleges that 400 
people tried to attack police and construction workers with knives, stones and other 
weapons, and that the police used force in self-defense after firing several warning shots. 
The Government replied that Rakhine State police investigated the case and determined that 
force was properly used for self-defense purposes. The Special Rapporteur stresses that 
article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that &#8220;everyone has the 
right to life, liberty and security of person,&#8221; and article 20 of the UDHR provides that 
&#8220;everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.&#8221; Additionally, the 
United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials establishes that officials shall &#8220;apply non-violent means before resorting to the use 
of force and firearms,&#8221; and that force and firearms may only be used as a last resort when 
unavoidable, and requires exercising the utmost restraint, minimizing injury and damage, 
and respecting and preserving human life.  Additionally, the Basic Principles require the 
state to provide assistance and medical aid to any injured an affected person at the earliest 
possible moment. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government&#8217;s reply did not offer 
details as to the thoroughness, impartiality or independence of the investigation that has 
been carried out, or the reasons for its conclusions.  He calls on the Government of 
Myanmar to continue to investigate and eventually to prosecute and punish those found 
responsible for excessive use of force, and to provide the results of these processes to the 
Special Rapporteur; to provide full redress to the victims and their family members; and to 
undertake effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the mandate.

</b></p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for its reply, dated 18 
December 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged deprivation of liberty, 
torture, and ill-treatment of Mr. Brang Yung, a Myanmar national of Kachin ethnicity who 
was arrested in June 2012 in connection with his reported association with the Kachin 
Independence Army. It was reported that Mr. Yung was being held incommunicado in the 
Myitkyina prison, where he had been subjected to torture and inhuman and degrading 
treatment, including sexual abuses. The Special Rapporteur expressed grave concern about 
reported patterns of arbitrary arrest of Kachin men from Internally Displaced Persons 
camps and subsequent torture in detention to extract confessions. In its reply, the 
Government confirmed Mr. Yung&#8217;s arrest and his detention in Myitkyina, and stated that an 
investigation revealed that Mr. Yung was a lance corporal in the Kachin Independence 
Army and responsible for a car bomb explosion that took place in Myitkyina in December 
2011. The Government further submitted that his trial on charges brought under the 
Explosive Substances Act is ongoing, and that Mr. Yung is allowed to receive family visits, 
is in good health, and has unrestricted access to three lawyers. Although the Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the State&#8217;s response, he notes that it does not address the allegations 
of torture and mistreatment against Mr. Yung. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and 
mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth <i>inter alia</i> in the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights.  The Special Rapporteur draws attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman

b and e of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 adopted in June 2008, which urges States 
&#8220;to take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially 
examined by the competent national authority, to hold persons who encourage, order,

severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the 
prohibited act is found to have been committed [&#8230;]&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Yung have been violated, 
and calls on the Government to undertake all necessary measures to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of Mr. Yung, to exclude any evidence obtained under torture 
from the judicial proceedings against him, to hold those responsible for his ill-treatment 
accountable and to provide full redress to the victim, including fair and adequate 
compensation and as full rehabilitation as possible. The Special also encourages the

</p>
<p>110. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for its reply, dated 29 
October 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture and subsequent 
death of Mr. U Than Htun by police officers of the Pandaung Township Police Station, 
Pyay District, Bago Region, Myanmar. According to the allegations, Mr. U Than Htun&#8217;s 
body showed clear signs of beating and torture by police officers. It is also alleged that the 
police refused to hand over Mr. Than Htun&#8217;s body and clothes to his family. The 
Government alleges that Mr. Than Htun died as a result of self-inflicted injuries suffered 
while in custody. According to the Government, a regional court is currently reviewing the 
complaint lodged by Mr. Than Htun&#8217;s family. The Government also claims that the police 
conducted an investigation of the incident and determined that Mr. Than Htun&#8217;s self-
inflicted injuries were exacerbated by the fact that police officers waited to take him to the 
hospital. The police have taken internal disciplinary measures against the implicated 
officers. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation&#8230; and calls upon all 
States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Additionally paragraph 7(b) of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, urges States to hold responsible not only those 
who perpetrate torture, but also those &#8220;who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such 
acts [...], to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with the 
gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the 
prohibited act is found to have been committed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reiterates that 
article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that &#8220;everyone has the 
right to life, liberty and security of person,&#8221; and that Article 6 of the Code of Conduct for 
Law Enforcement Officials, provides that &#8220;Law enforcement officials shall ensure the full 
protection of the health of persons in their custody and, in particular, shall take immediate 
action to secure medical attention whenever required&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake thorough and independent criminal investigations into the alleged 
incident, leading to the prosecution and punishment of all perpetrators, provide full redress 
to the victim&#8217;s family and undertake effective measures to prevent the recurrences of these 
acts. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to provide an update on the results of 
the investigations and proceedings. </p>

physical attack against human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Nepal has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged threats made in the media 
against members of the Accountability Watch Committee (AWC) and an alleged physical 
attack against human rights defenders. The weekly magazine Lal Rakshak published an 
article containing various allegations against Ms. Sharma, Mr. Subodh Pyakhurel and Mr. 
Dixit, naming them as opponents of the Maoist political agenda and the peace process, as 
well as accusing them of crimes including corruption, labour exploitation and sexual 
violence. The article reportedly also mentioned Messrs. Sushil Pyakhurel, Charan Prasai 
and Kapil Shrestha and stated that &#8220;people&#8217;s action&#8221; should be taken against them. 
&#8220;People&#8217;s action&#8221; is meant to refer to punishment through violent attacks. It is also alleged 
that calls for &#8220;people&#8217;s action&#8221; were repeatedly made on FM radio stations across Nepal 
against the above-mentioned members of AWC. It is alleged that Ms. Sharma received a 
warning implying that the army might hinder Advocacy Forum&#8217;s work. In addition, 
Advocacy Forum reportedly received a letter from the District Administration Office soon 
after the arrest of Colonel Kumar Lama, stating that an investigation would be undertaken 
against the organization. Reportedly, a physical attack against Mr. Yadav Prasad Bastola 
took place as he was walking back from Birendranagar to Vidhyapur Village Development 
Committee (VDC)-04, in Surkhet district, where he resides. In addition, Mr. Bastola was 
stopped by four unidentified persons with covered faces and asked whether he had written 
an article for the local newspaper &#8220;Pahichen Daily,&#8221; accusing him of &#8220;trying to send the 
Maoists to jail.&#8221; They grabbed Mr. Bastola&#31;s hand and neck and beat his back with iron 
rods multiple times. It is reported the police is still conducting an investigation. The Special 
Rapporteur reminds the government of Nepal of paragraph 7b of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23, which urges States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective 
measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold 
those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them 
brought to justice and severely punished.&#8221; In addition, paragraph 8 (a) of Resolution 16/23 
of the Human Rights Council states that &#8220;Intimidation and coercion, as described in article 
1 of the Convention against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death 
threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third person, can amount to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur finds that the 
Government of Nepal has failed to protect these citizens against acts that amount to cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment.  He calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation of the allegations of silencing human rights defenders through 
threats and intimidation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to 
provide full redress to the victims.

a young girl.</b> 
</p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Federal Democratic 
Republic of Nepal has not responded to this communication dated 13 June 2013, thereby 
failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The 
communication referred to the alleged violent dispersal by law enforcement authorities of 
peaceful demonstrations organized by Kamlari activists in Nepal. According to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>83 
</b></p>
<p>information received, from 31 May to 4 June, the police violently dispersed a series of 
peaceful protests held in Kathmandu, Dang, Kailai and Kanchanpur. The reported protests 
were organized by freed Kamlari activists to ensure accountability for the killing of a 12-
year old Kamlari girl in Dang in March 2013. Moreover, Kamlari activists were protesting 
more generally against the Kamaiya traditional system of bonded labour in place in several 
parts of Nepal. In the course of the police operations, police officers injured many and 
sexually assaulted some protestors. The police also detained groups of protestors for several 
hours. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Nepal that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons as set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).  Further, 
the Special Rapporteur reiterates that principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Officials, provides that, &#8220;Law enforcement officials, in carrying 
out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use 
of force and firearms.&#8221; Furthermore, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force 
and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall . . . exercise restraint, . . .act 
proportion[ally] . . . to the seriousness of the offence, . . . minimize damage and injury, and 
respect and preserve human life . . . .&#8221; Additionally, the Special Rapporteur draws attention 
to the Agreed Conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women adopted in March 
2013, whose paragraph 23, expresses deep concern about violence against women and girls 
in public spaces, including sexual harassment, especially when it is being used to intimidate 
women and girls who are exercising any of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
The Commission urges governments to, inter alia: (x) Prevent, investigate and punish acts 
of violence against women and girls. Similarly, the Government of Nepal is reminded that 
articles 1 and 8 of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against 
Women and article 22(2) of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
stipulate that women and indigenous peoples shall not be inflicted with physical, mental or 
sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty by 
public authorities or otherwise.  The Special Rapporteur requests a response from the 
Government of Nepal regarding the aforementioned actions by law enforcement against 
peaceful demonstrators.  The Special Rapporteur further request that should the 
Government&#8217;s investigation find the allegations to be correct that any person responsible be 
held accountable.

medication without informed consent.</b> 
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Netherlands for its response 
dated 13 May 2013 to the Joint Allegation Letter concerning alleged forced psychiatric 
interventions of Ms. Johanna Christina Santegoeds, including seclusion for various periods 
of time, forced medication without informed consent, and frequent forced body cavity 
searches during the period of October 1994 and May 1997.  The Special Rapporteur had 
expressed concern that such forced intervention constituted a violation of Ms. Santegoeds&#8217; 
right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health as 
embodied in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (ratified by the Netherlands on 11 December 1978).  The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges the response of the Government that allegations &#8220;in general terms&#8221; were 
investigated and found without merit.  However, it is regretful that no information from the 
investigations regarding allegations of physical injury resulting from forced medication and 
cavity searches was provided by the Government. If such facts are substantiated, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation to provide full redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to all 
victims of torture or other ill-treatment.  Additionally, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
concern over the alleged use of solitary confinement and other measures which isolated 
those with mental disabilities further from the community.  The Special Rapporteur echoed 
concerns expressed in his 2013 report to the Human Rights Council that prolonged 
seclusion and restraint may constitute torture or ill-treatment (A/63/175, paras. 55-56), 
excepted in the limited circumstances of risk of immediate harm to self or others. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the response of the Government, detailing 
efforts in the Compulsory Mental Health Care Act and through programs such as Assertive 
Community Treatment, which encourage community access as a component of treatment 
and aim to eliminate the use of solitary confinement.  The Special Rapporteur encourages 
the Government to continue in its engagement with the mandate.

</p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the reply transmitted by the Government of 
New Zealand on 2 December 2013; however, he notes that the Government has yet to 
provide substantive information pertaining to the issues raised.  The referenced 
communication concerned information received alleging that, over the course of his 
continued medical treatment of 14 years, Mr. X was allegedly diagnosed with psychosis, 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. He was put on various neuroleptic medications in an 
ad-hoc manner, which allegedly affected his health and quality of life. For the past 10 
years, he allegedly endured compulsory treatment that was not backed by evidence and 
provided for under the 1992 Mental Health Act. Furthermore, despite requests by Mr. X 
and his family, mental health services allegedly refused to supervise a phased </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>85 
</b></p>
<p>discontinuation of the medication.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
draw the Government&#8217;s attention to article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by New Zealand on 28 December 1978, which provides 
inter alia for the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
mental and physical health. This includes the right to be free from non-consensual medical 
treatment.  Additionally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the Government&#8217;s obligation 
under paragraph 19 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
to safeguard the individual&#8217;s ability to exercise informed consent in health, and protect the 
individual against abuses as a fundamental aspect of protecting the right to health.  
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his 2013 report to the Human Rights 
Council, which states in paragraph 64 that both the mandate and United Nations treaty 
bodies have established that involuntary treatment and other psychiatric interventions in 
health-care facilities -except under limited circumstances of immediate risk of harm to self 
or others- are forms of torture and ill-treatment (A/63/175, paras. 44, 47, 61, 63; Human 
Rights Committee, communication No. 110/1981, Viana Acosta v. Uruguay, paras. 2.7, 14, 
15.) and that to the extent that they inflict severe pain and suffering, they violate the 
absolute prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (A/63/175, 
paras. 38, 40, 41).  In turn, the Special Rapporteur notes that paragraph 1 of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23, adopted in April 2011, &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus 
never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-
derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to assess its compliance with 
the above obligations and principles with regards to the medical treatment of Mr.X.  Also, 
where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to adopt community 
integration as a method of treatment to further support the dignity, autonomy, equality and 
participation of persons with mental disabilities.

</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Norway has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged imminent risk of deportation of 
Mr. Mohammad Anwar Baloch, an asylum seeker and human rights defender from 
Pakistan. According to the information received, Mr. Anwar was appointed as a member of 
Baloch/Qaum Dost Committee, which was established for the purpose of negotiating the 
release of a UN official, Mr. John Solecki, who was kidnapped in Balochistan province. 
After the release of Mr. Solecki, the Committee discontinued its existence. Reportedly, five 
of its members were abducted by Pakistani security agents, three allegedly died in custody, 
two are missing, and another four members are in hiding. For fear of being abducted or 
killed, Mr. Anwar fled to Norway. While in Norway, Mr. Anwar continued his political and 
human rights activities including organizing protests and meetings in relation to the alleged 
human rights abuses in Balochistan by Pakistani army and security forces. According to the 
source, if returned to Pakistan, Mr. Anwar would be at risk of enforced disappearance, 
torture and being killed by the Pakistani Security Forces for his journalist, political and 
human rights activities. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the government of 
Norway that article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, acceded to by Norway on 9 July 1986, provides that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2

<p><b>86</b>  
</p>
<p>no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where 
there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being 
subjected to torture. In this regard, in paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 on the 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the 
Human Rights Committee states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the 
danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to 
another country by way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement.&#8221; Furthermore, paragraph 
9 of Resolution A/RES/61/253 of the UN General Assembly, paragraph 16 of the 
Resolution A/RES/65/205 of the UN General Assembly, and paragraph 7(d) of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urge States not to expel, return (refouler), extradite or in 
any other way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.  Those 
resolutions stress the importance of effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard, 
and recognize that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not release States from their 
obligations under international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular 
the principle of non-refoulement. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and independent investigation of the imminent risk of deportation of 
Mr. Anwar to Pakistan.

</p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the de facto authorities in the Gaza Strip have 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged risk of execution 
of Mr. Hani Mohammed Abu Aliyan, the case of Mr. Faraj Abed Rabu, and the execution 
of Messrs. Emad Mahmoud Abu Ghalyoun and Husein Youssef Mohammad El Khatib in 
June 2013. It was reported that Mr. Abu Aliyan was convicted in May 2010 in two separate 
cases of homicide and is at particular risk of execution. Reportedly, the first case involved a 
charge of unintentional homicide, for which Mr. Abu Aliyan is alleged to have self-reported 
at the Khan Younis police station. The second case reportedly involves the rape and killing 
of a six-year-old in 2000; it was reported that Mr. Abu Aliyan was a minor at the time of 
the alleged offence. Mr. Abu Aliyan was reportedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment 
during interrogation, which resulted in a confession to the crimes involved in the second 
case. Mr. Faraj Abed Rabu, sentenced to death for charges of collaboration with an enemy 
entity, was allegedly forced to sign his confession after having been tortured during the 
interrogation process. It was also reported that Mr. Emad Mahmoud Abu Ghalyoun and Mr. 
Husein Youssef Mohammad El Khatib were executed on 22 June 2013 following charges 
of &#8220;collaborating with the enemy&#8221;. Both men were allegedly subjected to torture and ill-
treatment with the aim of forcing a confession. It was reported that at least 35 individuals 
are currently at risk of execution in the Gaza Strip and that the de facto authorities in the 
Gaza Strip have executed at least 16 individuals since 2009. It is further alleged that death 
sentences in the Gaza Strip are frequently imposed by military courts, including the trying 
of civilians, the procedures of which do not comply with international human rights 
standards of fair trial and due process. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that the 
death penalty is imposed and carried out by the de facto authorities of Gaza in 
contravention of international human rights standards. The death penalty is imposed after 
proceedings that do not comply with fair trial and due process safeguards and after 
subjecting the defendants to torture or ill-treatment. As stated in his report to the General </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>87 
</b></p>
<p>Assembly (A/67/279; 9 August 2012), the Special Rapporteur finds that even if the 
emergence of a customary norm that considers the death penalty as per se running afoul of 
the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is still under way, most 
conditions under which capital punishment is actually applied renders the punishment 
tantamount to torture. Under many other, less severe conditions, it still amounts to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment.  Both of those serious violations are involved in capital 
punishment as applied in the Gaza strip. The Special Rapporteur calls on the de facto 
authorities in the Gaza Strip to undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the 
alleged torture and execution of Mr. Emad Mahmoud Abu Ghalyoun and Mr. Husein 
Youssef Mohammad El Khatib, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, 
and to provide full redress to the victim&#8217;s family. The Special Rapporteur also calls on the 
de facto authorities in the Gaza Strip to take persistent, determined and effective measures 
to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, 
competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe 
that such an act has been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or 
perpetrate such acts responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner 
commensurate with the gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of the place 
of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed according to 
paragraph 7b of the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23.

<p>118. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Pakistan has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged detention on blasphemy charges 
and alleged torture of Mr. Hamid Hussain in Pakistan. After his arrest, Mr. Hussain was 
allegedly locked up in a police station 20 kilometers away from his house, where he was 
tortured the entire night and forced to confess that he was involved in publishing a booklet 
depicting unfavorable &#8220;holy personages and companions (Sahaba) of the Holy Prophet.&#8221; 
Mr. Hussain was subsequently kept in police custody for 10 days, in which one night he 
was reportedly kept in an unknown place and tortured by persons other than the police. It is 
believed that he was subsequently sent back to the police jail due to his father, a lawyer, 
pursuing a case against the police. In response, Mr. Hussain was sent to the Karachi Central 
Prison and kept in a five-by-five feet isolation ward, where he was not allowed to receive 
any visitors. Members of Mr. Hussain&#8217;s family have reportedly accused a Judge of the ATC 
of allegedly demanding that they pay Rs 1 million to obtain his exoneration from the 
charges of blasphemy. The Special Rapporteur reminds the government of Pakistan that 
paragraph 7 (b) of Resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council states that &#8220;Intimidation 
and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention against Torture, including serious 
and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or of a 
third person, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221; In 
addition, with regard to the confession extracted through torture, article 15 of the CAT and 
paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urge that statements made as a 
result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made. The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation of the torture 
of Mr. Hamid Hussain, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to 
provide full redress to the victim. </p>

Mr. Ehtesham and Mr. Shafiq Arain.</b> 
</p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the acknowledgement of receipt by the 
Government of Pakistan, received 18 July 2013, but regrets no further response has been 
received regarding this communication in reference to the reported death of Ms.X and her 
sister, Ms. Y and the attacks and death threats to their family members, including Mr. XX 
and MrXY. Ms X was a human rights defender working for women&#8217;s rights with a local 
non-government organization named Social Welfare Organization. On 4 June 2013, Ms. Y 
was brutally attacked in her residence in Hyderabad. It was reported that the alleged 
perpetrators cut off her hands, ears and fingers, gouged both of her eyes and robbed 
valuable jewelry. She was later found in her apartment by a family member, Mr. XX, who 
brought her to a civil hospital where she soon died as a result of her injuries. It was alleged 
that those accused of killing Ms. Y were exonerated based on fabricated grounds and as a 
result the Hyderabad police refrained from launching an investigation. Reportedly, Ms. X 
and Mr. XX received death threats for pursuing the case of Ms. Y. On 29 June 2013, Ms. X 
was fatally killed by three armed men, at least one of whom was allegedly involved in the 
murder of her sister, Y. It was reported that Mr. X, another family member, was also 
receiving death threats for pursuing the case of Ms. X. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 8a of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which 
reminds States that &#8220;Intimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the 
physical integrity of the victim or of a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221; In the absence of other evidence, the Special Rapporteur 
concludes that Pakistan is responsible for the violation of the rights to life and physical and 
psychic integrity of these persons. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the reported death of Ms. Shamim 
Akhter and Ms. Tasleem Akhter, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators.

120. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the acknowledgement of receipt by the 
Government of Pakistan, received 4 September 2013, but regrets no further response has 
been received regarding this communication in reference to allegations of violence and ill-
treatment, including an attempt to kill Ms. X, and threats to journalists and human rights 
defenders working in Sahiwal, Punjab. Allegations of acts of violence, harassment and 
intimidation of women and human rights defenders were the subject of a previous 
communication sent on 12 July 2013. An acknowledgement of receipt for it was sent on 18 
July 2013; however, further response to this previous communication is still awaited from 
the Government of Pakistan. In the present communication it was reported that, on 13 
August 2013, Ms. X was abducted by a group of around six people, beaten, dragged by her 
hair, forced to parade through a busy local market, taken to the group&#8217;s gang leader and tied 
to a tree inside a compound, where she was further subjected to serious acts of violence. 
Reportedly, people in the vicinity heard her cries and contacted the police station. Just as 
she was about to be hanged and killed, Ms. X was rescued by a police officer from the 
Kamir Police Station. Reportedly, X was threatened and harassed a number of times by the 
same group of persons after being asked to sell her home at a price dictated by this group. It 
was also alleged that activists and human rights defenders who provide legal aid to 
individuals victimized by this group are often threatened by the group. It was reported that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>89 
</b></p>
<p>the police did not arrest or detain any suspect, although her attackers were allegedly found 
in the compound attempting to kill her. Allegations suggest that the police accepted a plea 
from the alleged perpetrators that Ms. X went to the compound with the intention to kill 
them. According to reports, on 14 August 2013, journalists and human rights defenders 
visited the police station to inquire about the status of the case. A police officer allegedly 
threatened them indicating that a &#8220;fake encounter&#8221; could be conducted against them for 
interfering in the official work of police. Furthermore, Mr. Y, President of the Press Club, 
and Mr. Z, Director of the International Human Rights Commission, were reportedly 
informed that should they continue reporting the case, they would be &#8220;booked in the open 
FIR.&#8221; In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is 
set forth inter alia in the UDHR and the ICCPR. On the basis of the information available, 
the Special Rapporteur concludes that Pakistan, by the inaction of its institutions, is 
responsible for the severe violation of the physical and mental integrity of Ms. X and the 
threatened journalists.  The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a 
prompt and independent investigation into the alleged violence and ill-treatment of Ms. X, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the 
victim.

murder of Kepari Leniata, a 20-year-old woman accused of sorcery. 
</p>
<p>122. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Independent State of 
Papua New Guinea has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged torture and execution of Kepari Leniata on 6 Februrary 2013, for using sorcery to 
kill a six-year-old boy. It is reported that she was publicly stripped naked, tied up, and 
burned alive, while the crowd prevented the police from intervening. In this context, the 
findings of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women regarding reports of 
disproportionate numbers of executions of women accused of witchcraft and sorcery mirror 
those of the former Special Rapporteur on Torture, who conducted an official visit to Papua 
New Guinea in May 2010, and noted his concern regarding the lack of capacity to prevent 
and investigate crimes relating to domestic violence, tribal fighting and accusations of 
sorcery in his country mission report (A/HRC/15/52/Add.5 at para. 36). In the context of 
the prohibition of torture, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Papua New 
Guinea of paragraph 2 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee, 
which provides that, &#8220;The aim of the provisions of article 7 [on the prohibition of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment] of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (accession of Papua New Guinea on 21 July 2008) 
is to protect both the dignity and the physical and mental integrity of the individual. It is the 
duty of the State party to afford everyone protection through legislative and other measures 
as may be necessary against the acts prohibited by article 7, whether inflicted by people 
acting in their official capacity, outside their official capacity or in a private capacity.&#8221; 
(Adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). The Special 
Rapporteur finds that the Government of Papua New Guinea is responsible for the torture 
and execution of Ms. Kepari Leniata.  He calls on the Government to undertake a prompt 
and independent investigation into her torture and execution,  leading to prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victim&#8217;s family.

123. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Qatar for its reply, dated 12 
February 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged risk of extradition of 
Mishal Al Mutiry, a former diplomat to Saudi Arabia. It is reported that during his tenure at 
the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the Netherlands, Mr. Mutiry was outspoken against the 
activities of Embassy officials financing and supporting extremist groups in the 
Netherlands. In 2004, it is alleged that he obtained political refugee status in the 
Netherlands, but was subsequently kidnapped in Brussels in 2006, and sent back to Saudi 
Arabia where he was tortured in prison. In 2011, it is reported that Mr. Mutiry escaped and 
fled to Qatar where he was seeking asylum, but has since been threatened to be handed 
back over to Saudi officials. In its reply, the Government of Qatar explained that Mr. 
Mutiry was not extradited and that he was sent to Casablanca, Morocco. The Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the reply and its commitment not to extradite Mr. Mutiry to Saudi 
Arabia. He finds that Qatar has complied with its obligations under Art. 3 of the 
Convention Against Torture (CAT) not to expel, return (refouler) or extradite a person to </p>

</p>
<p>124. The  Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Romania has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication refers to the alleged ill-treatment and denial of medical 
and psychological treatment of persons with disabilities, including mental disabilities, at the 
&#8220;Gheorghe Serban&#8221; Centre for Recuperation and Rehabilitation of Neuropsychiatry in 
Bucharest, Romania.  According to the allegations, disabled persons at this center are 
sedated and kept in dark rooms, are occasionally beaten, provided inadequate food, and are 
denied adequate medical and psychological care. The Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government of Romania that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation&#8230; and calls upon all States to implement fully 
the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; Additionally each Government has the obligation to protect the 
right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, as set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the Convention against Torture. The Special Rapporteur also reiterates that article 25 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides that persons with 
disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health 
without discrimination on the basis of disability. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that there can be no therapeutic justification for the use of solitary confinement 
and prolonged restraint of persons with disabilities in psychiatric institutions. Without any 
evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the victims&#8217; rights under 
international standards relating to the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as well as 
other standards of international human rights and humanitarian law, have been violated. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Romanian Government to clarify the alleged facts, to 
conduct thorough and independent investigations, leading to the prosecution and 
punishment of all perpetrators, to provide compensation for the victims and ensure the non-
repetition of such acts.

<p>125. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Russian 
Federation, dated 14 November 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged 
forced labour in prison which does not comply with international standards, threats as a 
consequence of complaint, hunger strike and hospitalization. According to the information 
received, Ms Nadezhda A. Tolokonnikova, a woman held in correctional colony no. 14 
(Mordoviya Republic), and other prisoners in the same facility, were forced to work for up 
to 16 hours per day. It is reported that they were only permitted to sleep 4 hours per night, 
and were not provided their entitled days of rest. It is further reported, the sewing 
equipment used to perform the prison labour, making police uniforms, was reportedly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>92</b>  
</p>
<p>outdated, leading to injuries and the remuneration for the work did not comply with 
standards.  It is alleged that complaints by Ms Tolokonnikova led to retaliation and threats 
against her by the deputy governor of the colony. In protest against the conditions of work, 
Ms Tolokonnikova subsequently went on a hunger strike.  Her health reportedly 
deteriorated and on 29 September 2013, she was transferred from solitary confinement to a 
hospital, where for some time, she was reportedly denied access to visitors, including her 
husband, except for doctors. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons as set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Further, 
the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Government of Russia to the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the  Body of Principles for the 
Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment. The Committee 
against Torture and the Human Rights Committee have consistently found that conditions 
of detention can amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur also recalls article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, ratified on 16 October 1973, which provides for the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; including an 
obligation on the part of all State parties to ensure that health facilities, goods and services 
are accessible to everyone, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the 
population, without discrimination. Lastly, the Russian Government is referred to General 
Comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
provides that, &#8220;States are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, 
refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons, including prisoners or 
detainees, minorities, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, curative and 
palliative health services&#8230;&#8221; (para.34). In the General Comment, the Committee interprets 
article 12.2(b) of the Covenant to include safe and hygienic working conditions, preventive 
measures in respect of occupational accidents and diseases and the minimization, so far as 
is reasonably practicable, of the causes of health hazards inherent in the working 
environment (para.15).  The Special Rapporteur requested that the Government to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the above mentioned 
person are respected and, in the event that the investigation supported the allegation, the 
accountability of any person responsible of the alleged violations be ensured and 
preventative measure be put in place.

</p>
<p>127. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its 
reply, dated 3 December 2013, to this communication in reference to allegations concerning 
the treatment in detention of Ms. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova from September to October 
2013. This communication was a follow-up and update on an urgent appeal submitted on 8 
October 2013 related to allegations of forced labour in prison amounting to slavery, which 
reportedly resulted in retaliation by prison authorities, a hunger strike by Ms. 
Tolokonnikova, and her hospitalization. According to the additional information received, 
after Ms. Tolokonnikova&#8217;s lawyers were denied the right to see her in prison camp hospital 
LPU-21, she was transferred by means of physical force to her former prison camp IK-14 
on 17 October 2013. Three days later, Ms. Tolokonnikova was reportedly taken to the 
transit section of prison camp IK-18, where her lawyers were again denied access, and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>93 
</b></p>
<p>placed on a convict transit train headed to the Eastern part of Russia. At the time of the 
communication, Ms. Tolokonnikova&#8217;s whereabouts, which remained unconfirmed by 
officials, were unknown to her lawyers and her family and serious concern was expressed 
about her health and safety. In its reply, the Government verified the information contained 
in the communication, and stated that on 23 September 2013, Ms. Tolokonnikova was 
transferred from her prison camp, IK-14, to a secure location for a period of 30 days, after 
she submitted a letter stating her intention to begin a hunger strike and containing a request 
to ensure her safety because of threats and physical intimidation on the part of officials and 
prisons in prison IK-14. The Government explained that Ms. Tolokonnikova&#8217;s complaint 
was dismissed on 26 September in a decision not to investigate the allegations or institute a 
criminal case under the Criminal Procedure Code, and safety and security measures were 
discontinued. It is further provided that on 29 October 2013, the dismissal of Ms. 
Tolokonnikova&#8217;s complaint was revoked by regional authorities in the Republic of 
Mordovia, who requested an examination of the reasons behind the decision not to 
investigate or sanction prison IK-14 officials. The Government denied allegations that any 
of Ms. Tolokonnikova&#8217;s visitation requests were refused, and affirmed that she was allowed 
to communicate with her lawyers and a human rights expert from the State Duma on eight 
occasions. The Government holds that Ms. Tolokonnikova was legitimately denied a visit 
with her lawyer on 22 October 2013 under Article 89 of the Criminal and Executive Code, 
which only permits meetings with lawyers on the territory of correctional facilities, because 
at the time she was in transit between correctional facilities. The Government further 
submits that Ms. Tolokonnikova was provided adequate medical care and regular 
examinations whilst in detention, including hospital treatment between 29 September and 
17 October 2013. The Government lastly provides that due to a possible threat to Ms. 
Tolokonnikova&#8217;s life and health in prison IK-14, she was ultimately transferred to the KTB-
1 correctional facility in the Krasnoyarsk Region, that authorities notified her relatives of 
her arrival in accordance with regular procedures, and that her health condition was 
considered satisfactory whilst she continued to undergo appropriate medical treatment and 
examinations. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its detailed response 
clarifying Ms. Tolokonnikova&#8217;s whereabouts at the times referred to in the communication. 
The Special Rapporteur notes that, in late 2013, Ms. Tolokonnikova was pardoned and 
released from prison, for which he commends the Russian Government. Nevertheless, the 
State&#8217;s response did not address the allegations of forced labour in prison amounting to 
slavery, or the mistreatment of Ms. Tolokonnikova by prison authorities in the IK-14 
colony as retaliation for her complaints, nor does it explain the outcome of the investigation 
conducted into these allegations. In this context, the Special Rapporteur expresses 
continued concern for the welfare and rights of persons who may continue to be subjected 
to forced labour in this prison. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to article 4 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 8(1), (3)(a) of the ICCPR, which 
prohibit slavery, and to articles 71-76 concerning prison labour in the Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted in resolutions 663 C and 2076 of the United 
Nations Economic and Social Council, which provide minimum standards related to 
conditions for work and state, <i>inter alia</i>, that &#8220;prison labour must not be of an afflictive 
nature&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation into all such allegations, leading to prosecution and punishment 
of perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victims&#8217; families. The Special Rapporteur 
also encourages the Government of the Russian Federation to continue its engagement with 
the mandate.   </p>

Rizana Nafeek, a 17 year old Sri Lankan domestic worker, who was charged with murder 
for killing a baby in her care in 2005.   
</p>
<p>128. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Saudi Arabia for its reply, dated 
19 January 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged execution of Rizana 
Nafeek, who allegedly committed murder when she was 17 years old.  She was convicted 
and sentenced to capital punishment. During the trial, it is reported that she did not have 
access to a translator to enable her to explain the circumstances that led to the child&#8217;s death, 
and signed a confession under duress. In its reply, the Government of Saudi Arabia 
explained the legal protections guaranteed to Ms. Nafeek, but did not address whether she 
received translations or signed a confession under duress. The reply also contained facts 
surrounding the murder and used her passport as confirmation that she was 21 years old 
when she committed the crime. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply, he 
reminds the Government of Saudi Arabia that article 15 of the Convention against Torture, 
which Saudi Arabia acceded on 23 September 1997, provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall 
ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture 
as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reiterates that 
paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;To ensure that no 
statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made, and calls upon States to consider extending that prohibition to statements made as a 
result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, recognizing that adequate 
corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings 
constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur urges that all rights to a fair 
trial are granted to the accused, and torture is not used as a means of obtaining 
incriminating evidence in trial. The Special Rapporteur finds that the passport of an 
immigrant is not persuasive on the evidence of having reached adulthood and the judicial 
authorities had a duty to establish Ms. Nafeek&#8217;s age beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to 
comply with Art. 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and with the prohibition of 
applying the death penalty to minors, a rule of customary international law.  Under the 
circumstances, the Special Rapporteur finds that Saudi Arabia has violated the right to life

<p><b> (b) </b>JUA 04/03/2013 Case No. SAU 3/2013 State Reply: 30/04/2013 <b>Alleged imminent risk of 
execution of seven individuals who were forced to confess to their crimes through 
torture.</b> 
</p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Saudi Arabia for its reply, dated 
30 April 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged death sentence being 
applied against Messrs. Sarhan b Ahmad b Abdullah Al Mashaikh, Saeed b Hassan b. 
Ahmad Al Omari Al Zahrani, Ali b. Mohamed b. Hazzam Al Shahri, Nasser b Saeed b 
Saad Al Qahtani, Saeed b. Nasser b Mohamed Al Yaala Al Shahrani, Abdulaziz b Saleh b 
Mohamed Al Amri, and Ali b Hadi b Saeed Al Qahtan for an unsubstantiated claim that 
they conspired to organize a criminal group to commit armed robbery and raiding jewelry 
stores. It is reported that the seven individuals did not know each other before being 
arrested so it was not possible for them to have conspired. Allegedly, the seven individuals 
were tortured under various methods. They were reportedly forced to stand for long hours 
in pre-trial detention and told that if they did not confess to the crime their families would 
be harmed. They were denied sleep and warm clothing in their cell and allegedly given </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>95 
</b></p>
<p>hallucinogens in their food. In court, it is reported that they were denied an effective 
defense and received a non-appealable guilty verdict. In addition to the death sentences, it 
was reported that Mr. Al Mashaikh was sentenced to crucifixion and put on public display 
for three days for being the mastermind of the robberies. In its reply, the Government of 
Saudi Arabia denies that there was any torture conducted during their detention, and the 
confessions were given by the defendants on their own freewill. Reportedly other evidence 
like DNA was present at the scene of the crimes, and each defendant was awarded 
procedural protections to guarantee fair trials. The response also denied that any of the 
defendants were sentenced to crucifixion. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
reply, he reminds the Government of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the United Nations 
General Assembly A/67/279 of 9 August 2012. In his report the Special Rapporteur 
observes that the possible safeguards given during legal process to ensure a fair trial in 
cases in which the death penalty might be imposed should be at least equal to those 
contained in article 14 of the ICCPR and that the imposition and enforcement of the death 
penalty following an unfair trial must be considered as particularly cruel, inhuman and 
degrading and in violation of article 7 of the ICCPR and articles 1 and 16 of the Convention 
Against Torture (CAT) (paras. 58, 60 and 61). The Special Rapporteur reiterates article 15 
of the CAT, providing that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur would also like to remind the Government of paragraph 6c 
of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008, which urges States &#8220;to ensure that no 
statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur finds that the Government&#8217;s reply fails to show that a 
serious, impartial and independent investigation was made about the allegations of torture-
tainted confessions. He also encourages the Government to continue its engagement with 
the mandate.

conviction for participating in terrorist activities in Saudi Arabia.</b> 
</p>
<p>130. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has not 
responded to this communication dated 25 August 2013, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate established by the Human Rights Council.  This communication expressed 
concerns over allegations that, on 11 June 2003, Mr. Ahmed Abu Ali was arrested in 
Medina, Saudi Arabia, tortured in prison until he confessed to being a member of an Al-
Qaeda cell. It is alleged that he was then transferred to Riyadh where he was subjected to 
further torture, practices of solitary confinement, and sleep deprivation. Finally, it is 
reported that Mr. Ali was transferred to the United States where the confessions he made 
during the interrogation processes in Saudi Arabia were used against him in a conviction 
for material support to the Al Qaeda network.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to reiterate paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;  Additionally, General Assembly 
Resolution 66/171 and Human Rights Council Resolution 19/19, affirms in paragraph 1 
&#8220;that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their 
obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur would also like to reiterate paragraph 7b of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which urges States &#8220;[t]o take persistent, </p>

an independent, competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable 
ground to believe that such an act has been committed; to hold persons who encourage, 
order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts responsible, to have them brought to justice and 
punished in a manner commensurate with the gravity of the offence, including the officials 
in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been 
committed [&#8230;]&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to conduct a prompt and 
independent investigation of the alleged detention and torture of Mr. Ahmed Abu Ali with 
an aim to hold those responsible accountable.  It is also requested that the Government 
assess the conditions and alleged interrogation practices of the Mabahith, or the Saudi 
security forces.  The Special Rapporteur also calls on the Government to ensure the 
identified person obtains redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible.

rights defenders.</b> 
</p>
<p>131. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council.<b> </b>The communication refered to an alleged pattern of judicial 
harassment, detention, ill-treatment, and sentencing of human rights defenders Mr. Miklif 
bin Daham al-Shammari (Muklif Shammari), Mr. Abdullah bin Hamid bin Ali al-Hamid, 
Mr. Mohamed bin Fahad bin Muflih al-Qatani, Mr. Omar al-Saeed, Mr. Fowzan al-Harbi, 
Mr. Abdulkareem Yousef al-Khoder, Mr. Saleh al-Aswan, Ms. Wajeha al-Huwaider and 
Ms. Fawzia al-Oyouni. Serious concern was expressed about the detention, torture, solitary 
confinement, secret trials, sentences and travel bans reportedly imposed upon the named 
individuals on charges including, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>takhbib</i>, or incitement of a wife to defy the 
authority of her husband; harming public order and the image of the State and questioning 
the integrity of State officials; calling the governing system repressive, oppressive and 
racial, and belonging to an unlicensed group, namely the Saudi Civil and Political Rights 
Association (ACPRA). Serious concern was expressed about the possibility that the 
mistreatment of the aforementioned individuals was the direct result of their human rights 
activities, and about the restrictive effect these allegations have on the environment in 
which human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia must carry out their peaceful and legitimate 
work.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that the Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, a right that is 
set forth <i>inter alia</i> in the UDHR and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur also 
wishes to draw the attention of the Government to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; With regard to the 
allegations of solitary confinement, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of 
article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts 
addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of 
its use, should be undertaken and encouraged&#8221; (adopted by the General Assembly by 
resolution 45/111 of 14 December 1990). The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government 
to conduct prompt and independent investigation into the alleged arrests, detention, acts of 
torture and ill-treatment and provide full redress to the victims, to clarify the circumstances 
surrounding the alleged secret trials and sentences imposed upon the named individuals, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2

<p>and to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the

<p><b> (e) </b>UA 07/10/2013 Case No. SAU 9/2013 State reply: None to date <b>Alleged imminent 
execution in violation of international human rights law standards including due 
process and the right to counsel.   </b> 
</p>
<p>132. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged risk of imminent 
execution of Mr. Mabrook Ali Saleh Al Sai&#8217;ari. Reportedly, Mr. Sai&#8217;ari was convicted of 
murder in 2000 and served his four and a half year sentence in full, before being released 
and re-arrested for the same alleged crime shortly thereafter, in 2005. It is alleged that in 
2012, Mr. Sai&#8217;ari was sentenced to death and that his execution, which was scheduled for 8 
September 2013, was postponed for approximately 70 days. Concern was expressed that the 
proceedings against the defendant did not meet due process standards under international 
human rights law, as he was allegedly unable to appeal his death sentence and could not 
afford and was not provided any legal assistance. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to remind the Government of Sudan of his report to the United Nations General 
Assembly A/67/279 of 9 August 2012. The Special Rapporteur reiterates Safeguard 5 of the 
UN Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death Penalty, 
which provides that &#8220;[c]apital punishment may only be carried out pursuant to a final 
judgment rendered by a competent court after legal process which gives all possible 
safeguards to ensure a fair trial, at least equal to those contained in article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the right of anyone 
suspected of or charged with a crime for which capital punishment may be imposed to 
adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings,&#8221; and that the imposition and 
enforcement of the death penalty following an unfair trial must be considered as 
particularly cruel, inhuman and degrading and in violation of article 7 of the ICCPR and 
articles 1 and 16 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) (paras. 58, 60 and 61). The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to commute Mr. Sai&#8217;ari&#8217;s death sentence, to 
undertake a prompt and independent investigation into the irregularities in the trial, and to 
provide full redress to the victim.

custody of Mr. Koggala Marakkalage Thushara Samanthilake, Mr. M.D. Kalum Priyanath, 
and Mr. Chandrasiri Dasanayaka by police beatings. 
</p>
<p>136. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Sri Lanka for its reply, dated 19 
June 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged deaths in custody of Mr. 
Koggala Marakkalage Thushara Samanthilake, Mr. M.D. Kalum Priyanath, and Mr. 
Chandrasiri Dasanayaka. It is reported that Mr. Samanthilake jumped out of a moving 
police vehicle after being arrested for drug possession. However, it is alleged that the 
injuries he sustained to his head were not caused by jumping out of the police vehicle, but 
by police beatings while in custody. It is alleged that witnesses fear testifying because of 
reprisals by the police. Mr. Priyanath was arrested for possessing marijuana and the police 
alleged that he hit his head, causing his death. However, the only corroborating evidence 
provided was allegedly a falsified statement by Mr. Priyanath&#8217;s sister, while a Judicial 
Medical officer report asserted Mr. Priyanath received lethal injuries from police beatings. 
Mr. Dasanayaka was allegedly arrested for possessing two marijuana cigars, but was a key 
witness in a case against the Officer-in-Charge at the Wadduwa Police Station. Reportedly, 
Mr. Dasanayaka&#8217;s son visited his father while he was in detention, and saw his father had 
sustained injuries to his face. The next day it was reported that he was taken to the hospital 
and was declared dead on arrival.  In its reply, the Government of Sri Lanka explains that 
Mr. Samanthilake died from injuries to the head, and that an internal investigation was 
conducted by a senior police officer.  Disciplinary measures are being issued against the 
responsible officers for &#8220;neglect of duty.&#8221; The Government does not address whether these 
officers beat the detainee, or if the death was caused by the officers. The Government 
alleges that Mr. Priyanath died of cardiac arrest, and after collapsing in his cell he was 
immediately brought to the hospital but could not be saved. The Government accepts that 
Mr. Dasanayaka&#8217;s death was caused by blunt trauma to the chest, and the case has been 
forwarded to the Magistrate&#8217;s Court Panadura, Case b/ 04561/12.  The Special Rapporteur 
thanks the Government for the reply, but notes that it does not show that these 
investigations of deaths in custody were made under conditions of impartiality and 
independence.  In addition, disciplinary proceedings for &#8220;neglect of duty&#8221; do not satisfy the 
State&#8217;s obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish allegations of torture and of deaths in 
custody under alleged mistreatment.  He reminds the Government of Sri Lanka that the 
obligations to investigate, identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise under 
articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, which the Government of Sri Lanka acceded to on 3 January 
1994.  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to carry out an expeditious, 
independent and transparent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths Mr. 
Koggala Marakkalage Thushara Samanthilake, Mr. M.D. Kalum Priyanath, and Mr. 
Chandrasiri Dasanayaka, with a view to taking all appropriate disciplinary and 
prosecutorial action and ensuring accountability of any person guilty of the alleged 
violations, as well as to compensate the victims&#8217;  families. In this respect the Special 
Rapporteur notes that Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, paragraph 7(b), urges 
States to hold responsible not only those who perpetrate torture, but also those &#8220;who 
encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts [...], to have them brought to justice and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2

in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been 
committed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to 
continue its engagement with the mandate.

use of force, including lethal force, during a peaceful assembly, resulting in deaths and 
injured protesters.</b> 
137. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply dated 19 September 
2013 to information received alleging that on 1 August 2013, in Weliweriya, the Gampaha 
District of the Western Province in Sri Lanka, more than 4,000 protesters assembled 
peacefully to demand the Government to take action against a company whose factory had 
polluted the water - the only drinking water resource in about 15 local villages. The police 
reportedly used tear gas to break up the protest, and the military, who were offering 
assistance to the police to disperse the crowd, shot at the protesters. Reportedly, at least 
three people have been killed and many more have been injured and hospitalized, including 
media professionals.  The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that allegations of 
excessive use of force by security officials in response to the protest are contrary to article 
6(1) of the ICCPR, under which the Government of Sri Lanka has the obligation to protect 
every individual&#8217;s right to life and to ensure that no individual on its territory or subject to 
its jurisdiction is arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its response in which it details the steps taken to investigate the use of 
force, and it is encouraging that officials under investigation have been relieved of their 
position while inquiries are made.  The Special Rapporteur further encourages the 
Government to continue its investigation, and prosecute and punish all violations of the 
right to life, in line with the Principles on Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-
Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (adopted by the Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1989/65).  The Government is also encouraged to recall that the families and 
dependents of victims of extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions shall be entitled to 
fair and adequate compensation within a reasonable period of time pursuant to principle 20.  
The Special Rapporteur requests that the Government continue in its engagement with the 
mandate.

61). In addition, taking a prisoner to the gallows three times before issuing a postponement 
of execution qualifies as cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. The 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that Sudan is a signatory of the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which it 
signed on 4 June 1986. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to clarify the 
resentencing of Mr. Bakri Moussa Mohammed, and explain how it is compatible with the 
Convention Against Torture.

<p><b> (b) JUA 16/04/2013 Case No. SDN 4/2013 State Reply: 22/08/2013</b> Alleged torture and 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Hatim Ali Mohammed, as well as the incommunicado 
detention of Mr. Sharf Eldein Tia. 
</p>
<p>139. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Sudan for its reply, dated 22 
August 2013, to this communication in reference to the reported torture and detention of 
Mr. Hatim Ali Mohammed and the incommunicado detention of Mr. Sharf Eldein Tia. The 
communication referred to the alleged torture of Mr. Hatim Ali Mohammed, his 
incommunicado detention and subsequent risk of further torture and ill-treatment as well as 
the incommunicado detention of Mr. Sharf Eldein Tia. Mr. Sharf Eldein Tia is the nephew 
of Ms. Jalila Khamis Koko, a Nuba women&#8217;s rights activist who was detained for 10 
months before she was released last January 2013. Ms. Khamis Koko had been the subject 
of a joint urgent appeal sent on 12 October 2012 by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of human rights while countering terrorism and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences. No response was received from the 
government of Sudan to that communication. According to the information received, Mr. 
Hatim Ali Mohammed was arrested during a peaceful protest, detained for several hours, 
tortured by beating, and then subsequently held in incommunicado detention. The same risk 
applies to Mr. Sharf Eldein Tia, who is also held incommunicado.  As highlighted in 
communications sent to the Government on 6 July 2012 and 3 August 2012, it is reported 
that over the months of June to August of 2012, hundreds of peaceful protesters and civil 
society activists were arrested in response to a wave of demonstrations that affected many 
of Sudan&#8217;s largest cities. The police allegedly tortured and otherwise ill-treated the 
detainees by kicking them; beating them with sticks, rubber hoses and fists; making them 
stand in scorching heat for days at a time; depriving them of food, water and sleep; and 
forcing them to adopt stress positions. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
remind the government of Sudan with regard to the alleged torture of Mr. Hatim Ali 
Mohammed, paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;condemns all forms 
of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; In this regard, we note that paragraph 2 of Resolution 16/23 of 
the Human Rights Council, which &#8220;Condemns in particular any action or attempt by States 
or public officials to legalize, authorize or acquiesce to torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances, including on grounds of 
national security or through judicial decisions, and urges States to ensure accountability for 
all such acts.&#8221; In addition, paragraph 8b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 states 
that &#8220;Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>102</b>  
</p>
<p>perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the 
safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that 
secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation of the torture and 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Hatim Ali Mohammed as well as the incommunicado 
detention of Mr. Sharf Eldein Tia, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators and to provide full redress to the victims.

and the right to life, particularly where defendants face the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p>140. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the amendment of Sudan&#8217;s Armed Forces 
Law of 2007, the extension of the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians and the 
amendment&#8217;s possible incompatibility with the fundamental rights recognized in Sudan&#8217;s 
Interim National Constitution, as well as international human rights standards. The 
amendment reportedly stipulates that every person &#8211; irrespective of their military status or 
connection with Sudan&#8217;s armed forces &#8211; who commits or is suspected of committing any 
act undermining the security of the State is subject to the jurisdiction of Sudan&#8217;s military 
courts, thereby subjecting civilians to the jurisdiction of military courts in relation to a large 
number of broad and vaguely worded offences. It has been reported that under this 
amendment journalists, political opponents, human rights defenders and others have been 
prosecuted for their peaceful activities, particularly for exercising their freedom of 
expression. It is further alleged that a number of those individuals were tried before special 
courts in proceedings that did not meet fair trial standards, including by accepting evidence 
alleged to have been extracted under torture. These courts have reportedly imposed the 
death penalty in several cases. Regarding the allegation that military courts have accepted 
evidence extracted under torture and the allegation that military courts are unlikely to 
investigate torture committed by State agents, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 
15 of the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment (CAT), which the Government of Sudan signed on 4 June 1986, provides that, 
&#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as 
a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur would also like to reiterate that paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;To ensure that no statement established to have been made 
as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person 
accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to 
consider extending that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, 
including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for 
the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;. 
The Special Rapporteur requests that the Government reconsider the amendment of Sudan&#8217;s 
Armed Forces Law of 2007, which extends jurisdiction of the military court over civilians.

against demonstrators resulting 200 deaths  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>141. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to alleged excessive use of force by security 
forces against demonstrators in different parts of the country from 26 September to 6 
October 2013 that resulted in over 200 deaths by gunshot wounds, as well as the subsequent 
arrests of at least 800 people, including human rights defenders, political activists and 
opposition members, and journalists. The Special Rapporteur expressed grave concern 
about the excessive and disproportionate use of force, notably the use of live ammunition 
and the intentional use of lethal force, against the demonstrators. Among those who died as 
a result of the gunshots were 14-year-old Ayman Salah Ibrahim in Khartoum Bahri, who 
died after police prevented other demonstrators from rendering assistance to him; Mr. 
Musab Mustafa, an artist filiming the demonstrations in Omdurman; Mr. Tariq Sediek, Mr. 
Abdulagadir Rabeia, and Mr. Baldr Eldein Ahmed in Hajyousif; and a bystanding 
Ethiopian food-vendor in Khartoum. According to reports, among the more than 800 
persons who were allegedly arbitrarily arrested by police and the National Intelligence and 
Security Services (NISS) were at least 13 known political activists and human rights 
defenders, lawyers, minors, and journalists. It was also alleged that security forces raided 
the homes of and beat and arrested persons not linked to the demonstrators, at least one of 
whom, Mr. Majid Mohamed Ali, was found dead in hospital after his arrest. The Special 
Rapporteur also expressed grave concern about reports that most of the 800 NISS detainees 
remained in custody and were being held incommunicado, denied access to medical care 
and legal assistance, and had not been charged with any criminal offense. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Sudan that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, a right which 
is set forth <i>inter alia</i> in the UDHR and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur also 
reiterates the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and particularly Articles 3 
and 6 (1) that respectively guarantee the right of every individual to life and security and 
provide that these rights shall be protected by law. With regards to reports of 
incommunicado detention, the Special Rapporteur also draws the Government&#8217;s attention to 
paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 of 18 June 2008, which reminds all 
States that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a 
form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, 
security and the dignity of the person.&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the 
Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the aforementioned persons under the 
relevant standards have been violated, and calls on the Government to undertake all 
necessary measures to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all remaining 
victims, to hold those responsible accountable and to provide full redress to the victims, 
including fair and adequate compensation and as full rehabilitation as possible.

</p>
<p>142. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sudan has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the arrest of 35-year-old civil engineer and 
women&#8217;s rights activist, Ms. Amira Osman Hamed, and the charge of &#8220;indecent or immoral 
dress.&#8221; If found guilty, Ms. Osman Hamed might face corporal punishment of up to forty 
lashes. On 27 August 2013, Ms. Osman Hamed was arrested by Public Order Police for 
refusing to wear a headscarf, and charged under section 152 of Sudan&#8217;s 1991 Criminal 
Code with &#8220;indecent or immoral dress.&#8221; It was reported that current public order laws in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>104</b>  
</p>
<p>Sudan do not specify what is covered by immoral or indecent dress, giving the Public Order 
Police broad discretion to judge whether a person has acted in &#8220;an indecent manner, or a 
manner contrary to public morality&#8221; or &#8220;wears an indecent, or immoral dress, which causes 
annoyance to public feelings.&#8221; Reportedly Ms. Osman Hamed&#8217;s court case was postponed 
in order to give the Attorney General time to consider a request made by her defense to 
drop all charges. At the time of the communication, the prosecution was reportedly still 
evaluating how to proceed. It was further reported that this is not an isolated event, and that 
public flogging of women is a continuing practice in the country. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that each Government has the obligation to ensure equality 
between men and women in the enjoyment of all civil and political rights, including the 
right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. This right 
is set forth inter alia in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
the Government of Sudan is a party. Furthermore, both the Human Rights Committee and 
the Committee against Torture have called for the abolition of judicial corporal punishment, 
and the Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment 
must extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as 
punishment for a crime (see paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 (1992).

</p>
<p>143. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Sudan has 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the arrest and prosecution of 
lawyer and human rights activist Ms. Najlaa Mohammed Ali, and human rights activist Mr. 
Amin Senada, allegedly accused of violating Article 152 of Sudan&#8217;s Criminal Code while 
riding together in a vehicle in Port Sudan. If convicted, Ms. Ali and Mr. Senada could be 
subjected to flogging with up to 40 lashes. The Special Rapporteur stresses the 
Government&#8217;s obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, 
set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR and the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Additionally, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 7(a) of resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council and 
paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20 (1992) of the Human Rights Committee declare 
that corporal punishment can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to 
torture.  The Special Rapporteur concluded in his report to the 60th session of the General 
Assembly, as well as his report to the seventh session of the Human Rights Council, that 
corporal punishment violates the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and therefore cannot be invoked by states even under 
the most exceptional circumstances. The Special Rapporteur further reminds the 
Government that paragraph 1 of the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;Condemns 
all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in 
any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement 
fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
take all necessary measures to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of Ms. Ali 
and Mr. Senada, and to ensure that they are not subjected to corporal punishment.

<p>144. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Sweden for its replies, dated 8 
February 2013 and 12 April 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged 
imminent deportation of Abdullah Barahouei to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Reportedly, 
Mr. Barahouei contributed to the Balochistan Sarafaz blog and feared for his life after the 
editor and several blog contributors were arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 
Iran. Allegedly, there are reports of various cases of human rights defenders being 
subjected to arrest, torture, and sentenced to death for speaking out against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. It was reported that the Swedish Migration Board would make a decision 
regarding Mr. Barahouei&#8217;s immigration status on 1 February 2013. In its first reply, the 
Government of Sweden explained that Mr. Barahouei&#8217;s application for asylum was denied, 
but is being appealed because of new circumstances that were not considered. In the second 
reply, the Government of Sweden informed the Special Rapporteur that asylum was granted 
to Mr. Barahouei, and that he would not be deported. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government of Sweden for its commitment to article 3 of the CAT, which provides that no 
State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where 
there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being 
subjected to torture. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its

<p><b> (b) JUA 02/05/2013 Case No. SWE 2/2013 State Reply: 14/06/2013</b> Alleged imminent 
deportation of an Afghan journalist. 
145. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of Sweden for its reply, dated 14 
June 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged imminent deportation of  an 
Afghan journalist who received death threats from the Taliban.  While based in Jalalabad in 
eastern Afghanistan, the journalist reported on the border area between Afghanistan and 
Pakistan for the Daily Wahdat and Khyber TV before fleeing the country with his family to 
Peshawar, in northern Pakistan in August 2008, allegedly due to death threats, including 
life-threatening calls and text messages by the Taliban in retaliation for his journalistic 
activities. In early 2011, he had been reportedly kidnapped by the Taliban and tortured and 
ill-treated while detained for 20 days in Miranshah, Pakistan near the Afghan border. 
Reportedly his family received protection and was relocated to the United States of 
America by the UNHCR in 2009. Also, his brother has been already granted asylum in 
Sweden. It was reported that the Migration Board would meet on 2 May 2013 to make a 
decision whether to deport him to Afghanistan or not. In the response dated 14 June 2013, 
the Government of Sweden stated that since this is a pending asylum case, the identity of 
the applicant should not be disclosed in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s  official report to the 
Human Rights Council. In summary, the Migration Board found that the Joint Urgent 
Appeal contained no new information or evidence in support of the applicant&#8217;s need for 
protection in Sweden. The Migration Court had previously found that the applicant was not 
in need of protection in Sweden and therefore decided not to grant him a residence permit 
in Sweden. However, the Government stated that it is incorrect to say that enforcement of 
an   expulsion order is imminent. The reply adds that the applicant was  awarded sufficient 
due process in his asylum hearings, including an interpreter, public counsel, several 
interviews and hearings by the Migration Court. The Special Rapporteur reminds the 
government of Sweden of article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, acceded to by Sweden on 8 January 1986, 
which provides that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in 
danger of being subjected to torture. In this regard, paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 
20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment declares that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture 
or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by 
way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement&#8221;. Under similar provisions, paragraph 16 of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>106</b>  
</p>
<p>the Resolution 65/205 of the UN General Assembly and paragraph 7(d) of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 urge States not to expel, return (refouler), extradite or in any 
other way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, stressing the 
importance of effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard, and recognizing that 
diplomatic assurances, where used, do not release States from their obligations under 
international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-
refoulement. The prohibition of refoulement under these rules of international law is 
absolute, and it applies even if the risk of torture is attributable to non-State actors like the 
Taliban.  The Special Rapporteur encourages the government of Sweden to continue its 
engagement with the mandate.

has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to Mr. Ayham 
Ghazzoul&#8217;s alleged torture and death in custody while being detained by the Air Force 
Intelligence. It is reported that Mr. Ghazzoul was a defender of human rights in Syria, and 
was kidnapped by the National Students Union and severely beaten. He was allegedly 
handed over to the Air Force Intelligence, where he was subjected to torture and other 
severe forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. According to the information 
received, Mr. Ghazzoul suffered internal bleeding as a direct result of the torture and died 
on 9 November 2012, four days after his arrest. Mr. Ayham Ghazzoul was the subject of a 
previous communication, dated 8 May 2012, by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

military court and had been brought before a military prosecutor (JUA SYR 5/2012, 8 May 
2012). A reply to this communication is still awaited from the Syrian Arab Republic. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons as set forth, 
inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International </p>

on 21 April 1969, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or

Rapporteur draws attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur reiterates article 
12 of the Convention Against Torture, which requires the competent authorities to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, 
which requires States Parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture.  He takes note 
in this respect of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul 
Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture. In the absence of other evidence, the 
Special Rapporteur finds that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the torture and 
death in custody of Mr. Ghazzoul.  He calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation into these events,  leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victim&#8217;s family.

</p>
<p>148. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of Syria has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged disappearance and torture of 
Mr. Omar Mohamed Mamoun Arnous and the incommunicado detention and denial of 
medical treatment of Mr. Khalil Matouk. According to the information received, Mr. Omar 
Mohamed Mamoun Arnous, a member of the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), 
was arrested at his home on 7 October, 2012. He was reportedly last seen in February 2013 
in a military hospital of the Syrian capital bearing serious signs of torture, and would have 
then been transferred to another unknown military hospital. It is reported that so far the 
Syrian authorities have failed to disclose his whereabouts or information regarding his 
health condition. Mr. Khalil Matouk is a human rights lawyer and executive director of the 
Syrian Centre for Legal Studies and Research and has been in detention for over the 
allowed maximum of sixty days of detention for investigative purposes according to Syrian 
law. It is also reported that Mr. Matouk suffers from a serious lung disease, which 
diminishes his lung capacity by 60% and has severe breathing difficulties due to reduced 
lung function. He is reportedly being denied medication, which he took regularly prior to 
his detention to help his condition. With regard to the unknown whereabouts and 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Arnous and Mr. Matouk, the Special Rapporteur reminds 
the Government of paragraph 8b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which 
reminds States that &#8220;Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; With regard to the 
alleged torture of Mr. Arnous, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be

addition, paragraph 7b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 requires the competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the Convention Against 
Torture (CAT) requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. With 
regard to the alleged denial of medical care to Mr. Arnous and Mr. Matouk, Rule 22(2) of 
the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provides that, &#8220;(s)ick prisoners 
who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil 
hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, 
furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment 
of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers. Furthermore, Rule 
25(1) provides that, &#8220;(t)he medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental 
health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, 
and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government to end the incommunicado or unacknowledged detention of these 
persons and undertake a prompt and independent investigation of the circumstances. as well 
as of the denial of medical treatment of Mr. Khalil Matouk, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators; and to provide full redress to the victims.

<p>149. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
incommunicado detention, torture and ill-treatment of Messrs. Mazen Darwish, Hussayn 
Gharir, Hani Zitani, Abdelrahman Alhamade and Mansour Al-Omari, as well as acts of 
reprisal against, and the alleged continued incommunicado detention and deteriorating 
health of, Mr. Khalil Matouk and Mr. Mohammed Thatha. Mr. Mazen Darwish was the 
subject of a previous communication (SYR 5/2012, 8 May 2012), regarding his alleged 
prolonged incommunicado detention, torture and ill-treatment. A reply to this 
communication is still awaited from the Syrian Arab Republic. Mr. Khalil Matouk was the 
subject of several previous communications (the most recent being SYR 2/2013, 12 May 
2013) regarding his alleged incommunicado detention and being denied adequate medical 
treatment despite reportedly suffering from a serious lung condition. A reply to this 
communication is still awaited from the Syrian Arab Republic. In the case of both Mr. 
Mazen Darwish and Mr. Khalil Matouk, new information was received that indicated that 
the concerns raised in previous communications have not been duly addressed. It was 
reported that Messrs. Darwish, Gharir, Zitani, Alhamade and Al-Omari spent over nine 
months in incommunicado detention, during which time the individuals were allegedly 
subjected to practices amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It was 
further reported that detention conditions were squalid and that the detainees were denied 
access to medication, leading them to contract several diseases. Sources informed that on 
27 February 2013, charges of &#8220;promoting terrorist acts&#8221; were issued against the five human 
rights defenders for work conducted under the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of 
Expression&#8217;s work in defense of human rights. It was reported that Mr. Matouk continues to 
be held in incommunicado detention and that Mr. Mohammad Thatha, a colleague of Mr. 
Matouk who was arrested at the same time as Mr. Matouk, allegedly remains detained as 
well. In the absence of information from the Government, the Special Rapporteur concludes 
that the aforementioned individuals have been subjected to prolonged incommunicado 
detention, torture and ill-treatment, and suffer physical and psychological injury. In this </p>

reiterates that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever can be invoked to justify torture by 
the Government and that therefore the rights of  Messrs. Mazen Darwish, Hussayn Gharir,

</b></p>
<p>150. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged enforced 
disappearances of Messrs. Bassam Bahrah and Sameeh Bahrah. Mr. Bassam Bahrah is 52 
years old and works at the al-Mezzeh Military Hospital in Damascus. Mr. Sameeh Bahrah, 
son of Mr. Bassam Bahrah, is a 26-year-old medical student and peaceful political activist. 
On 30 April 2013, Mr. Bassam Bahrah was allegedly seen for the last time when he left his 
place of work. It was reported that the authorities may have arrested Mr. Bassam Bahrah in 
order to use him to locate Mr. Sameeh Bahrah. That evening, unidentified Government 
security service officials allegedly arrested Mr. Sameeh Bahrah at his family home in the 
al-Mezzeh district of Damascus in relation to his peaceful political activities. Since then, he 
has reportedly been held incommunicado at an unknown location. Mr. Sameeh Bahrah has 
reportedly been detained twice before in relation to his political activities. He was first 
arrested in July 2012, and was kept incommunicado for twenty-two days in the Palestine 
Branch in Damascus, a Military Intelligence run detention centre reportedly known for 
torture. Due to the lack of information provided by the Government, the Special Rapporteur 
expresses concern that Messrs. Bassam Bahrah and Sameeh Bahrah may have been 
subjected to enforced disappearance and may be at risk of torture. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that prolonged incommunicado detention can itself constitute a form of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and that paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be

</p>
<p>151. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania 
for its reply, dated 26 March 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged 
killings and attacks on People with Albinism (PWA) in various provinces of Tanzania. It is 
alleged a seven year old boy was killed on 31 January 2013, sustaining lacerations to his 
forehead, right arm, and left shoulder, and his left arm was severed above the elbow. It is 
reported that PWAs body parts are superstitiously thought to bring wealth, as well as 
provide a cure to HIV/AIDS. Allegedly, another seven year old and his mother were 
attacked on 5 February 2013, attempting to kill the boy because of his albinism. Ms. Maria 
Chambanenge, aged thirty nine was also allegedly attacked because of her albinism, and 
had her arm severed. Another victim, a ten year old boy, also had his arm severed at the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>111 
</b></p>
<p>elbow because of his albinism. It is alleged that due to police corruption, there are low rates 
of success in prosecuting the perpetrators, and there is concern for the safety of women and 
girls. In its reply, the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania admitted to its 
knowledge of the incidents against PWAs and asserted its commitment to protecting and 
prosecuting the perpetrators. The Government explained that it put the investigations of 
these cases on fast track, and five murder cases have been heard regarding attacks on 
PWAs. There are also public awareness campaigns as well as specific efforts to protect 
PWAs with shelters and other protections. However, the Government explains that few 
successful prosecutions have been made because they do not want to diminish due process 
rights guaranteed to defendants in their criminal justice system. Several of the convictions 
were overturned on appeal. The Government also explains that the prosecution is not 
willing to bring a case unless they are certain it will result in a conviction, and maintains 
that it has a 100% successful conviction rate. Although the Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government of the United Republic of Tanzania for its reply, he reminds the Government 
that it has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. 
This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of paragraph 2 of General Comment No. 20 of 
the Human Rights Committee, which provides that, &#8220;The aim of the provisions of article 7 
[on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is to protect both 
the dignity and the physical and mental integrity of the individual. It is the duty of the State 
party to afford everyone protection through legislative and other measures as may be 
necessary against the acts prohibited by article 7, whether inflicted by people acting in their 
official capacity, outside their official capacity or in a private capacity.&#8221; (adopted at the 
44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). The Special Rapporteur recognizes 
the clear position of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania condemning 
violent practices against PWA and encourages it to continue its engagement with the 
mandate with a view to both punishing and preventing such acts.

April 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged physical abuse, torture, and 
murder of Private Wichean Puaksom by ten military officers for missing military exercises. 
Reportedly Mr. Puaksom&#8217;s mother brought a suit for damages against the ten military 
officers, but no verdict identifying and bringing to justice the officers has been pronounced 
by the authorities. In its reply, the Government of Thailand denied that any such severe 
disciplinary practices were regularly performed, and disputed the allegation that Private 
Puaksom died from his injuries; instead it affirmed that his poor health was from a lack of 
food and water during a two-day escape. The Government of Thailand also described the 
criminal and civil suits, both with pending verdicts. The military officers have been 
disciplined with measures ranging from a week under house arrest to a month in prison. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2

</p>
<p>The Government of Thailand is also making an effort toward remedial action by providing 
Private Puaksom&#8217;s mother with the names of the military officials who are being 
prosecuted. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply and takes note of the pending 
nature of judicial actions.  He recalls article 12 of the CAT, which requires the competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which 
requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges States 
&#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially 
examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate 
or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely 
punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act 
is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to 
combat torture.&#8221; In this regard, he expresses his concern that the disciplinary sanctions 
imposed on perpetrators are not consistent with the seriousness of abuses that resulted in 
death. The Special Rapporteur transmitted a follow up letter to the Government of Thailand 
on 1 August requesting information on the updated status of the criminal and civil trials, 
and whether any verdict had been reached.  He encourages the Government to continue its 
engagement with the mandate.

<p>153. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the replies of the Government of Thailand, dated 
5 August 2013 and 30 October 2013, to this communication in reference to the conditions 
of detention of more than 1800 ethnic Rohingya migrants and refugees from Myanmar in 
immigration detention centers in Thailand for over five months, under conditions that may 
amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even torture.  The communication 
included information received concerning the death of seven Rohingya men and one boy 
between 19 March 2013 and 22 July 2013 allegedly as a result of poor conditions and lack 
of medical care in the centers. Reportedly, in the Phang Nga detention center near Phuket, 
there are 276 Rohingya men detained in cells meant only for 5-15 persons. The lack of 
exercise is emaciating their leg muscles. The communication also referred to the rape of 
one Rohingya woman living in a government shelter in Phang Nga province and the alleged 
related involvement of a Thai police officer, and the possible refoulement of refugees to 
Myanmar despite substantial grounds for believing that there is a high risk of torture in case 
of repatriation. It was reported that Thai authorities know of the overcrowded detention 
centers and that no progress had been made for a more lasting solution. It was alleged that 
the detention and the conditions in the immigration detention centers were used as a 
punitive measure and as a means to discourage the Rohingya from taking legal measures. 
</p>
<p>154. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of Thailand and its 
details regarding its work with the Ministry of Public Health and the International 
Organization for Migration to address issues of overcrowding in the detention centers, the 
death of seven Rohingya men and one boy, and the rape of one Rohingya woman. The 
Special Rapporteur nonetheless reminds the Government of its obligation to provide full 
redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to 
all victims of torture or other ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur would like to remind the 
Government of paragraph 7d of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which urges 
States &#8220;(n)ot to expel, return (refouler), extradite or in any other way transfer a person to </p>

deportation of Ms. Khadijeh Mohibati to the Islamic Republic of Iran despite her awaiting 
death penalty for converting to Christianity. </p>

<p>156. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Turkey for its reply, dated 9 April 
2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged risk of deportation of Ms. Khadijeh 
Mohibati to the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to the information received, if forcibly 
returned to the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ms. Mohibati is at high risk of being tortured and 
executed, due to the pending death penalty sentence imposed against her in that country. 
Upon her arrival in 2007 at the international airport in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Ms. Mohibati was allegedly arrested by the Iranian State Security officers for converting to 
Christianity, as well as engaging in non-coercive persuasion of others to change their 
religion. Ms. Mohibati was allegedly subjected to physical and mental torture while in 
detention. It is further reported that later in 2007, Ms. Mohibati was prosecuted and tried 
for these crimes, which are allegedly considered criminal offences in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. Reportedly, the applicable law in the Islamic Republic of Iran provides for the 
death penalty as a punishment for those who convert to Christianity. After the first hearing, 
the court in Tehran reportedly released Ms. Mohibati on bail. Ms. Mohibati fled from the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to Turkey in 2008. Shortly after Ms. Mohibati fled to Turkey, she 
was reportedly sentenced to death <i>in absentia </i>in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Government of Turkey for the response dated 9 April 2013 where it 
acknowledged receipt of the joint urgent appeal but did not address the allegations in the 
communication. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Turkey that article 3 
of the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, acceded to by Turkey on 2 August 1988, provides that no State party shall 
expel, return (refouler), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial 
grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. In 
this regard, in paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 on the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Human Rights Committee 
stated that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of 
extradition, expulsion or refoulement.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reminds the 
Government of paragraph 16 of Resolution A/RES/65/205 of the UN General Assembly 
which urges States &#8220;not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other way transfer a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture, and recognizes that diplomatic assurances, 
where used, do not release States from their obligations under international human rights, 
humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government of Turkey to continue its engagement with the 
mandate.

157. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Republic of 
Turkey, received 6 September 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged 
excessive use of force during peaceful demonstrations resulting in the injuries of thousands 
of protesters and the death of at least four individuals, namely Mr. Mehmet Ayval&#305;ta&#351;, Mr. 
&#304;rfan Tuna, Mr. Abdullah C&#246;mert and Mr. Mustafa Sar&#305;. It was reported that on 28 May 
2013 a few hundred protesters gathered in Gezi Park in Taksim, Istanbul, to peacefully 
demonstrate against the municipal urban redevelopment plan for the area. Police reportedly 
dispersed protesters through the widespread and indiscriminate use of tear gas. Since 31 
May 2013, following the reaction of the police in Istanbul, hundreds of thousands of people 
have gathered across the country in support of the protesters. These demonstrations have 
reportedly been met with excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, resulting in 
thousands of people being injured and arrested and the death of Mr. Mehmet Ayval&#305;ta&#351;, Mr. 
&#304;rfan Tuna, Mr. Abdullah C&#246;mert and Mr. Mustafa Sar&#305;. It was also reported that many of 
the protesters arrested were subjected to acts of torture and ill-treatment in detention, and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>115 
</b></p>
<p>were denied prompt access to medical care. In its reply, the Government stated that the 
information in the communication was in part based on inaccurate and incomplete 
information, stating that the protests relevant to Gezi Park exhibit qualities that show that 
terrorist organizations have been involved in the activities and that the incidents have been 
manipulated. The Government stated that proper and proportionate force was used by the 
police to disperse the protesters. The Government stated that allegations of torture and ill-
treatment do not reflect the truth, and that in &#8220;cases where the boundaries of the law were 
exceeded during the Gezi Park demonstrations, judicial investigations have been 
immediately initiated by the judicial authorities,&#8221; including charges of torture against police 
officers. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of the Republic 
of Turkey and its explanation regarding the investigation into allegations of torture and ill-
treatment, although he would appreciate more complete information about such 
investigations, its conditions regarding independence and impartiality, and its results. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the 
mandate.  He wishes to remind the Government of its obligation to provide full redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to all 
victims of torture or other ill-treatment.

confession extracted through torture as a key piece of evidence in Mr. Al-Hadidi&#8217;s trial, as 
well as alleged lack of due process and unfair trial practices. 
</p>
<p>158. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Arab Emirates for its 
reply, dated 24 May 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged trial of 94 
individuals on charges of state security offences in the Federal Supreme Court in Abu 
Dhabi, case number 17/2013, as well as the alleged sentencing of Mr. Abdullah Al-Hadidi 
for his reports on the trial. According to the information received, the 94 individuals were 
arrested at various moments over the year leading up to the start of trial proceedings which 
took place in two hearings on 4 and 11 March 2013. The charges against the defendants 
reportedly included charges of founding and administering an institution aimed at 
overthrowing the government.  The prosecution considers Al-Islah to have a subversive 
agenda and links to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, an organization banned in the 
United Arab Emirates. Sources have informed that no timeframe or schedule has been set 
out for the trial, leading to periods of up to one year spent in pre-trial detention. A 
confession by Mr. Ahmad Ghaith Al-Suwaidi allegedly constitutes a central piece of 
evidence supporting the charges, though it was allegedly extracted through torture. It is 
further alleged that several of the detainees were kept in conditions that, if found to be 
accurate, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Reports allege 
that some detainees were kept in small cells of 2.5 x 3 meters with lights kept on during the 
night, deprived of virtually any clothing despite powerful air-conditioning being on, had 
access to insufficient toilet facilities, were kept in lengthy interrogation sessions while 
blindfolded and in some cases subject to physical abuse including beatings and the 
extraction of fingernails. It is alleged that during court hearings, detainees including 
Messrs. Mohammed Abdulrazzaq Alsidiq, Ahmed Al-Zaabi and Essa Al-Sari reported 
having been targeted for such practices. It is further reported that a number of detainees 
displayed physical signs of torture during hearings, and that at the hearing on 11 March, 
relatives of Mr. Essa Al-Sari were alarmed at the deterioration of his mental health since 
being detained. There are also allegations of irregularities which violated international 
minimum standards for the conduct of a fair trial. The judges are appointed by the ruling 
royal families of the United Arab Emirates, who have reportedly delivered numerous 
statements to national news media condemning the defendants in case 17/2013. There are </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>116</b>  
</p>
<p>also reports of the imprisonment of Mr Al-Hadidi for commenting on the trial on Twitter 
and that international observers were denied access to at least two hearings. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response dated 10 June 2013 affirming that the 
case involved a serious threat to the United Arab Emirates national security by a large 
group of individuals tied to foreign groups who advocate the violent overthrow of the 
regime. The response states that the trial was open to the public and rejects any claims of an 
unfair trial. It asserts that Mr. Al-Hadidi was arrested and charged for assaulting a public 
officer and publishing in bad faith false accounts of the trial. The Special Rapporteur calls 
attention to article 12 of the CAT, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur also reminds the 
Government of paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges States 
&#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially 
examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate 
or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely 
punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act 
is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to 
combat torture.&#8221; Regarding allegations that confessions and statements incriminating others 
were obtained under torture, the Special Rapporteur further draws attention to article 15 of 
the CAT, which provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of the United Arab Emirates to 
continue its engagement with the mandate.

treatment and the denial of access to a lawyer of three British nationals, Mr. Grant

</p>
<p>159. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of the United Arab Emirates has 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued 
by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and ill-
treatment and denial of access to a lawyer of three British nationals, Mr. Grant Cameron, 
Mr. Suneet Jerrh, and Mr. Karl Williams, by police officers of the Dubai Criminal 
Investigation Department (CID). According to the information received, the three 
individuals were arrested on the suspicion of being in possession of illegal drugs. Once 
arrested, the officers beat them, repeatedly kneed them in the testicles and used a taser to 
electrocute them. It is reported that each of the men were beaten by officers upon arriving 
to a deserted location, and that this continued for about 30 to 45 minutes. Upon returning to 
their hotel, it is reported that Mr. Cameron was taken to the front room where he was 
tasered with an electric baton, while another officer pulled out a gun and threatened to kill 
him. It is also reported that Mr. Williams was shown what appeared to be a battery with 
wires on it by the officers, and was told that if he did not give them information, they would 
ensure that &#8220;he could never have kids.&#8221; It is also reported that Mr. Williams was 
blindfolded with a towel, severely kicked, and threatened with death. Furthermore, it is 
reported that Mr. Jeer was taken to the bathroom where he was subjected to beatings and 
shocks with an electric baton. It is reported that following the events at the hotel, the three 
men were brought to the CID headquarters and forced to sign documents in Arabic, which 
none of them understood, and under the threat of further torture. While in police custody, 
they were intimidated by guards and denied food, water, or adequate sleeping space. It is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>117 
</b></p>
<p>alleged that the authorities informed that they had conducted an independent investigation 
finding no evidence of torture, but the report has not been made public. It is reported that 
the authorities provided information indicating that the Human Rights Section of the Dubai 
Police had conducted an investigation into the allegations of torture, but suggest that 
members of the police force engaged in the investigation, and that no statements by the 
victims themselves were considered. During their trial, the &#8220;intent to supply&#8221; charges 
against them were reportedly dropped, but they were sentenced to four years for possession 
and consumption of &#8220;Spice.&#8221; It is alleged that the documents signed by the three men under 
duress have been used as evidence during the trial. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reminds the government of the United Arab Emirates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 and paragraph 8a of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
condemn and prohibit at all times all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, and can never be justified, calling 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In addition, article 12 of the 
CAT and paragraph 7b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 require the competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT requires State 
parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. Regarding allegations that confessions 
were obtained under torture, the Special Rapporteur recalls that article 15 of the CAT and 
paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 prohibit the use of torture as 
evidence in any proceeding except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made. In this context, the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, adopted by 
the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990 require prosecutors to refuse use 
of evidence obtained through torture and to take all necessary steps to ensure that those 
responsible for using such methods are brought to justice. Prosecutors must perform their 
duties fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and 
uphold human rights.  On the basis of the evidence before him, the Special Rapporteur finds 
that the UAE have violated the rights of Messrs. Cameron, Jerrh and Williams and he calls 
on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation of the alleged 
torture and ill-treatment and denial of access to a lawyer of the three British nationals, by 
Dubai police officers, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators and to 
provide full redress to the victims.

</b>160. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Arab Emirates for its 
reply, dated 20 November 2013, to this communication in reference to the arrests, 
detention, allegations of the use of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, 
reported lack of due process guarantees and the reported lack of independence of the 
judiciary. It is reported that many of the individuals referenced are members of al-Islah 
(Society for Reform and Social Guidance), a long-standing civil society organization in the 
UAE, operating in sectors such as education and charity and which calls for the democratic 
reform and greater adherence to Islamic principles in the UAE. The 69 individuals who 
were sentenced on 2 July 2013 allegedly supported a petition that inter alia called for 
reform on social, broadcast and print media. One group was allegedly sentenced in absentia 
to 15 years in prison; a second group was sentenced to ten years imprisonment with three 
years&#8217; probation; a third group was sentenced to seven years imprisonment; and the 
remaining 25 were acquitted.  Sources reported that the defense team for the detained had 
been harassed, had members deported, had been unable to meet freely and privately with 
their clients, or bring materials, including case files, into court. Additionally, international </p>

</p>
<p>observers who had intended to observe the trial on 4 March 2013 were reportedly prevented 
from entering the UAE and other trial observers who had completed procedural requests 
were allegedly denied access to the trial on 11 March 2013. Furthermore, there have been 
allegations of torture, or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, as far back as the defendants&#8217; court appearance in 2012. Medical examinations 
have been ordered by the judge, but it is reported that no investigation has taken place with 
regard to these allegations. In its reply, the Government of the United Arab Emirates stated 
that the case of the 94 detainees, which includes the 69 individuals in this communication, 
is one single case and has been decided by the Federal Supreme Court on 2 July 2013. The 
Government claimed that the communication sets out a version of events related to this case 
that is far removed from the truth and unfounded in many respects, and categorically denied 
the allegations in the strongest terms. The Government stated that the 69 individuals were 
not part of a peaceful association calling for political debate, but were members of an 
organization aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. The Government further stated that the 
charges against the individuals are compatible with international human rights principles, 
which restrict freedoms of expression and association when such activities threaten national 
security, public safety or public order. The Government stated that arrest warrants were 
issued for all the accused and that charges were immediately communicated to them. 
Additionally the Government stated that the accused were entitled to telephone contact with 
their families three times per week and allowed regular family visits. The Government 
claimed that the trial was executed in accordance with due process guarantees and that a 
special chamber was set up by the court to accommodate 500 observers. The Government 
denies allegations of abuse of the individuals mentioned in this communication, and that the 
conditions of the accused were reportedly satisfactory and observed by the Emirates Human 
Rights Association. Additionally, the Government explained that no evidence of any 
mistreatment could be found and that these allegations have been addressed by the Court 
and found to be without merit. 
</p>
<p>161. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not provide sufficient 
documentation of the investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-treatment in 
connection to this case, including the alleged incommunicado detention of Mr. Ahmed 
Ghaith al-Suweidi. The Government&#8217;s reply does not explain the Court&#8217;s findings nor the 
measures taken to impartially and independently investigate the allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment. He urges the Government to take persistent, determined and effective 
measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, 
competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe 
that such an act has been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or 
perpetrate such acts responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner 
commensurate with the gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of the place 
of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed according to

issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture of 
detainees belonging to the &#8220;UAE 94&#8221; group, whose members were the subject of a previous

<p>who are currently serving sentences at Al-Razeen prison; and Mr. Mohamed al-Zumer, who 
was arrested on 5 December 2012, reportedly held incommunicado and in solitary 
confinement for approximately six  months each,  and charged but not sentenced under the 
2006 Cyber Crime Law (amended by Federal Legal Decree No. 5/2012). It was reported 
that Mr. al-Zumer was subjected to torture and ill-treatment in detention. Mr. Waleed al 
Shehhi was reportedly arrested in August 2013 and, like Mr. Zumer, faces charges under 
the Cyber Crime Law for making comments on social media that allegedly insult state 
authorities. It was also reported that 18 of the convicted 69 members of the UAE 94 were 
subjected to beatings and other forms of mistreatment as a result of which they went on 
hunger strike from July or August to 25 October 2013; that the detainees&#8217; health rapidly 
deteriorated due to the hunger strike; that Dr. al-Mansoori, whose shoulder had been 
dislocated by a beating that occurred before his hunger strike, was administered glucose in 
the prison clinic despite refusing medical attention; that Mr. Ali al-Kindi and Mr. Ahmed 
al-Qobaisi were hospitalized; and that Mr. Jumaa al-Felasi, who required medical attention 
after collapsing, was administered glucose but not brought to a hospital. Serious concern 
was expressed at allegations of shortcomings in the judicial system and procedural 
guarantees and poor prison conditions leading to the detainees&#8217; protest in the form of a 
hunger strike, and the possibility that charges were brought against the named individuals 
in connection with their legitimate work defending human rights. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that the Government has the obligation to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of all persons, a right that is set forth <i>inter alia</i> in the UDHR 
and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT).  The Special Rapporteur also draws the Government&#8217;s attention to 
paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment,&#8221; and article 4 of the CAT which requires States Parties to ensure that all acts 
of torture are offences under its criminal law and to make the offences punishable by 
appropriate penalties. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to article 12 of 
the CAT, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which requires States Parties to prosecute suspected 
perpetrators of torture. The Special Rapporteur further reiterates article 15 of the CAT, 
which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established 
to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake all necessary 
measures to protect the aforementioned persons&#8217; right to physical and mental integrity, to 
hold those responsible accountable and to provide full redress to the victims, including fair 
and adequate compensation and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>163. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Ukraine for its reply, dated 30 
April 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged risk of extradition of the 
former Prime Minister of Tajikistan, Mr. Adulmalik Abdullodzhonov, to Tajikistan. 
According to the information received, Mr. Abdullodzhonov, while travelling to Ukraine on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>120</b>  
</p>
<p>a valid travel document issued by the United States of America with a Ukrainian visa, was 
allegedly detained upon arrival at Kyiv&#8217;s Boryspil International Airport on 5 February 
2013, and has remained in detention, pending an extradition request to Tajikistan. On 15 
March 2013, Kyiv&#8217;s Shevchenko District Court decided to continue the detention of Mr. 
Abdullodzhonov for up to twelve months, while the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office continues 
its examination of the extradition request by Tajikistan. While ordering Abdullodzhonov&#8217;s 
continued detention, the Court allegedly acknowledged that the materials provided as 
evidence confirm the existence of his refugee status. It is further alleged that if Mr. 
Abdullodzhonov is extradited to Tajikistan, he will be at risk of being tortured. Mr. 
Abdullodzhonov served as Prime Minister of Tajikistan in 1992-1993 during the civil war, 
and is a prominent opposition leader. He also ran for the Presidency of Tajikistan in 1994, 
and lost to Emomali Rahmon, Tajikistan&#8217;s current president. He started to receive death 
threats and had three attempts on his life in 1995. After fleeing Tajikistan, several of his 
political associates were reportedly killed. Mr. Abdullodzhonov was accused of being 
involved in an assassination attempt against Emomali Rahmon, as well as in organized 
crime and terrorism, though he was no longer living in Tajikistan. Reportedly, Mr. 
Abdullodzhonov denies these charges and was granted political asylum in the United States 
in June 1999. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response dated 30 
April 2013 where it is stated that the Prosecutor General denied the request of extradition of 
Mr. Abdullodzhonov to the Republic of Tajikistan and released him from custody the same 
day. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Ukraine for honoring article 3 
of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and, should there be any further legal developments in the case, encourages the 
Government of Ukraine to continue its engagement with the mandate.

<p> <b>(b)</b> JUA<b> </b>22/07/2013 Case No. UKR 2/2013 State reply: 05/09/2013 <b>Alleged forced 
psychiatric treatment and confinement of human rights defender. </b> 
</p>
<p>164. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Ukraine for its response, dated 5 
September 2013, in reference to the alleged forced psychiatric treatment and confinement 
of a human rights defender. In its reply, the Government stated that on 27 June 2013, the 
Leninskiy district court of Zaporozhya satisfied the petition for forced psychiatric 
examination of Ms. Radchenko, issued by the chief psychiatrist of the Department of 
Health of Zaporozhya Regional Administration. The Government stated that following the 
decision of the Kammunarskiy district court of Zaporozhya from 15 July 2013, to satisfy 
the petition of the chief physician of the Regional Psychiatric Hospital, it was decided to 
hospitalize Ms. Radchenko for forced psychiatric treatment. It is further stated that in 
response to the appeal submitted by the representative of Ms. Radchenko, the Zaporozhya 
region Court of Appeal decided to repeal the above-mentioned decisions of district courts, 
as well as the petitions submitted by the chief psychiatrists. The Government further stated 
that from 24 to 27 July 2013, a commission of clinical experts established under the 
Ministry of Health has conducted a clinical assessment into the legality and quality of the 
medical assistance provided to Ms. Radchenko.  The Commission established that in 
deciding on the need for involuntary psychiatric examination, doctors and hospital 
administration violated the requirements of Article 11 of the Law &#8220;On psychiatric care.&#8221; At 
the same time, the Government reported that no violation of law was found in deciding on 
the need for involuntary hospitalization. The Government explained that during the 
examination of Ms. Radchenko on 27 July 2013, the commission found no grounds for 
continuing her forced treatment and she was subsequently discharged from the hospital. It 
is also reported that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has instructed the Department of 
Health of Zaporozhya Regional Administration to take measures to comply with the Law 
on &#8220;Psychiatric care&#8221;. With respect to the ongoing investigation, the Government responded 
that in relation to Ms. Radchenko, the Leninskiy district court of Zaporozhya has initiated 
criminal investigation into the facts of her alleged involvement in disturbing the public </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>121 
</b></p>
<p>order on 17 June 2013. No measures of restraint were imposed on Ms. Radchenko. The 
Government also stated that in relation to the information submitted by Ms. Radchenko&#8217;s 
lawyer, in accordance with article 365, part 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, a criminal 
case has been launched concerning the use of force against her, her daughter and grandson 
by the law enforcement officers during the implementation of the court&#8217;s decision. The 
investigation is currently ongoing.  
</p>
<p>165. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for detailed information on the steps 
taken into the circumstances of this case. He commends the Government for the correction 
of some of the violations alleged.  Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
Government states that there was no violation of law in subjecting her to involuntary 
psychiatric treatment and confinement.  The response does not address the fact that she was 
forcibly admitted without a document confirming the court decision. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not provide further information with respect to 
the above-mentioned instructions issued by the Ministry of Health concerning measures to 
be taken to comply with the Law on &#8220;Psychiatric care.&#8221;  He would like to be able to 
comment on the substance of those instructions from the perspective of their consistency 
with international standards. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the ongoing investigation 
into physical restraint of Ms. Radchenko&#8217;s daughter and grandson and urges the 
Government to provide the full details of any prosecutions in the event that the alleged 
perpetrators are identified. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take measures 
to ensure that Ms. Radchenko&#8217;s family is protected from violence, threats of violence or 
any form of intimidation and take steps to provide Ms. Radchenko with compensation. The 
Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government to bring the alleged perpetrators to 
account and impose penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions on the alleged 
perpetrators implicated in authorising and executing the forced psychiatric treatment and 
confinement of Ms. Radchenko. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government did 
not provide the full details of the court decision which made possible the alleged forced 
psychiatric treatment and confinement of Ms. Radchenko. Given the information received, 
the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights under the UN Convention against Torture 
of Ms. Radchenko have been violated, and calls on the Government to undertake a prompt 
and impartial investigation of the alleged acts, including prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and to provide appropriate and adequate redress.

Congolese nationals after their forcible refoulement from the United Kingdom (UK) to 
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) committed by Congolese officials. 
</b>166. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its several extensive replies to 
the Allegation Letter dated 7 June 2013 regarding reports of eight Congolese nationals 
facing continuous and pervasive intimidation, harassment, torture and re-arrest upon return 
to the DRC after failed asylum attempts in the UK.  Concern was expressed that the 
conditions they face are allegedly contrary to the Country of Origin Information Report 
(March 2012), the Country Policy Bulletin (November 2012) and the Operational Guidance 
Note (May 2012) developed by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to assess the 
appropriateness of returning failed asylum seekers to their home countries. According to the 
allegations, these documents inaccurately designate the DRC as a safe place to return 
asylees and, on the basis of this designation, many Congolese are returned to unsafe 
conditions.  It was further alleged that DRC officials use immigration information passed to 
them by Government officials to facilitate the arrest, detention, and in some instances </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>122</b>  
</p>
<p>torture, of those returned from the UK.  In light of these allegations, the Special Rapporteur 
requested that the Government provide information regarding the steps taken in verifying 
the Country of Origin reports, whether those returned are monitored to ensure they are not 
subject to torture, whether investigations are conducted once torture is alleged, and any 
other steps taken by the Government to ensure the fulfillment of their obligations under 
Article 3 of CAT.  The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8217;s extensive reply 
to these allegations in which they cited several investigations into mistreatment of asylum 
seekers returned to the DRC.  The Government claims the result of the investigation shows 
little credibility in reports of the DRC targeting asylum seekers, and they use this 
conclusion, along with no substantive reports of abuse made to their embassy in Kinshasa, 
to dismiss these allegations as unfounded.  The Government further provides that country 
conditions are not singularly determined through use of the Country of Information Report, 
but instead are determined through multiple sources of information including civil society, 
past asylum seekers, and local media.  While the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by 
investigations conducted into these allegations and others, he stresses the Government&#8217;s 
obligation under Article 3 of CAT, in particular paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 20 
on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, in which the Human Rights Committee states that State parties &#8220;must not 
expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment upon return to another country by way of extradition, expulsion or 
refoulement.&#8221;  Should the Government encounter credible information indicating that 
asylum seekers returned to the DRC are subjected to mistreatment, the Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government to take corrective action in their return procedures.  Additionally, 
the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to take the utmost care in the 
dissemination of information to immigration officials in DRC, specifically information that 
could allow DRC officials to target returning asylees who may have been politically active 
while abroad.  In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
continue its ongoing engagement with the mandate.

<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>AL 18/03/2013 Case No. USA 3/2013 State Reply: 05/08/2013 </b>Alleged prolonged solitary 
confinement in New York state prisons, compromising prisoner mental and physical health. 
</p>
<p>167. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of the United States for its reply, 
dated 5 May 2013, to this communication in reference to alleged use of solitary 
confinement in New York State prisons. The communication referred to the alleged 
practices throughout New York state prisons that subject thousands of incarcerated persons 
to prolonged solitary confinement, other extreme isolation practices, and inhuman or 
degrading conditions in detention, including the denial of adequate medical treatment. In 
particular, Mr. William Blake, Mr. Stephan Poole and Mr. Kenneth Wright have been 
subjected to prolonged solitary confinement. According to the information received, in 39 
prisons across New York State, nearly 4,500 prisoners are held in isolation cells, or Special 
Housing Units (SHUs). Reportedly, prisoners in SHUs are deprived of all meaningful 
human contact, including telephone calls, recreational activities, or rehabilitation programs. 
It is also reported that inmates in SHUs are frequently deprived of basic necessities such as 
food, exercise, and basic hygiene and that they experience difficulties in obtaining adequate 
medical treatment. Mr. William Blake has been incarcerated in a SHU, held in a barren 
concrete cell with no furnishings other than a steel bed frame for 25 consecutive years. Mr. 
Stephan Poole received a sentence of 36 months in the SHU for allegedly planning an 
escape. In the eight years and nine months prior, he had allegedly received no reports of 
misbehavior. Mr. Poole has reportedly accumulated additional lengthy SHU sentences for 
non-violent prison infractions, including refusing to return a food tray. He has allegedly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>123 
</b></p>
<p>developed insomnia and paranoia and has become increasingly anti-social as a result of his 
confinement. Mr. Kenneth Wright has been repeatedly confined to SHU as punishment for 
using marijuana, despite proactively seeking treatment from the Department of Corrections 
health service. Allegedly, after Mr. Wright&#8217;s latest infraction, authorities subjected him to 
six additional months in SHU and failed to take steps to assess his medical condition and 
provide necessary treatment. It is reported that Mr. Wright has struggled with depression, 
hopelessness and thoughts of suicide during his time in SHU. In addition, isolation in the 
SHU changed his behavior: he became more aggressive and started talking to himself. On 
the basis of the information available to him, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the 
rights of Messrs. Blake, Poole and Wright to be free from torture have been violated, and 
that the practice of solitary confinement in New York State violates the international 
obligations of the United States of America.  He reminds the US Government that 
paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee states that 
prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts 
prohibited by article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to his interim report to the General 
Assembly of 5 August 2011 (A/66/268) stating that where the physical conditions and the 
prison regime of solitary confinement cause severe mental and physical pain or suffering 
amount to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment if the resulting social isolation is 
prolonged or indefinte, whether used as punishment or during pre-trial detention.  Solitary 
confinement of any length of time is similarly a violation of international law when used on 
juveniles, pregnant women or persons with mental disabilities.    On the basis of scientific 
evidence, his report established 15 days as the limit between &#8220;solitary confinement&#8221; and 
&#8220;prolonged solitary confinement&#8221; because at that point, according to the literature surveyed, 
some of the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reminds the US Government that Rule 22 of the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provides that, &#8220;(s)ick prisoners 
who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil 
hospitals. Furthermore, Rule 25(1) provides that, &#8220;(t)he medical officer shall have the care 
of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all 
who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; The 
Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee have consistently found that 
conditions of detention can amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. The Specail 
Rapporteur welcomes the recent positive developments regarding disciplinary segregation 
in New York State prisons. However, he urges the authorities (State and Federal) to 
similarly look into the regime of administrative segregation. Futher, while acknowledging 
recent developments in New York State, the Special Rapporteur urges the United States 
Government and individual State Governmetns to take all measures necessary to ban the 
use of prolonged solitary confinement for juveniles, pregnant women and persons with 
mental disabilities.The Special Rapporteur calls on the US Government to undertake a 
prompt and independent investigation of the allegations of prolonged solitary confinement, 
leading to its immediate termination, and to provide full redress to the victims.

168. The Special Rapporteur thanks the government of the United States for its reply, 
dated 5 May 2013, to this communication in reference to alleged use of prolonged solitary 
confinement in polices in the Florence, Colorado penitentiary. The communication referred 
to the alleged practices at the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility 
(ADX) in Florence, Colorado, that subject between 400 and 500 inmates to prolonged 
solitary confinement and inhuman or degrading conditions in detention, including the 
denial of adequate medical treatment. According to the information received, inmates at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>124</b>  
</p>
<p>ADX are held in prolonged solitary confinement, sometimes for several years, which 
causes severe physical and mental pain and suffering rising to the level of torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Inmates spend 20 to 24 hours per day in individual 
cells measuring 12 by 7 feet (3.6 by 2.1 meters) with virtually no meaningful human 
interaction or intellectual stimulation. It is reported that many ADX inmates suffer from 
severe mental illness due to their isolation and are denied access to adequate psychiatric 
care and treatment. In a similar case involving the ADX and the use of prolonged solitary 
confinement, the Special Rapporteur on torture had sent a communication on 29 November 
2011 (ref. UA G/SO 214 (53-24) USA 21/2011). In its reply, the government of the United 
States explained that under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), solitary confinement 
under so called Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) may only be imposed where 
necessary to protect national security, and may not exceed one year at a time. In this 
context the Government explained that SAMs can only be implemented in two well-defined 
and limited circumstances: if the measures are reasonably necessary to prevent disclosure 
of classified information, e.g., that the unauthorized disclosure of such information would 
pose a threat to national security, and when a danger that the inmate will disclose such 
information  exists. The Special Rapporteur reminds the government of the United States 
that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity 
of all persons under its jurisdiction, as set forth under the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT). In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report to the General Assembly of 5 August 2011 (A/66/268), he 
stated that where the physical conditions and the prison regime of solitary confinement 
cause severe mental and physical pain or suffering, when used as a punishment, during pre-
trial detention, indefinitely, prolonged, on juveniles or persons with mental disabilities, it 
can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture. 
Paragraph 26 of the report states that, &#8220;of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur is 
prolonged solitary confinement, which he defines as any period of solitary confinement in 
excess of 15 days&#8230; He concludes that 15 days is the limit between &#8220;solitary confinement&#8221; 
and &#8220;prolonged solitary confinement&#8221; because at that point, according to the literature 
surveyed, some of the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible.&#8221; 
Furthermore, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provides that, 
&#8220;(s)ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized 
institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their 
equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care 
and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers&#8221; and 
that &#8220;(t)he medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of the 
prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any 
prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; The Committee against Torture and 
the Human Rights Committee have consistently found that conditions of detention can 
amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. The Special Rapporteur has asked the US 
Government to invite him to conduct a visit to ADX prison (and other facilities) in 
accordance to his mandate; that request, formally made in writing in May 2013 and 
repeated several times since, has gone unanswered until now.  He insists that the 
prohibition on torture and on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is absolute, and that it 
recognizes no exception based on any grounds, including national security or states of 
emergency.  On the basis of the information available, the Special Rapporteur finds that the 
solitary confinement regime applied in ADX prison violates the obligations of the United 
States under international law.  He calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation of the prolonged solitary confinement policy at ADX, leading to 
the program&#8217;s termination and to provide full redress to the victims. </p>

<p>169. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the government of the United States of America 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged refusal to

against a private military contractor at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. According to the information 
received, Mr. Rashid, Mr. Al-Zuba&#8217;e and Mr. Al Shimari filed a lawsuit against a private 
military contractor, CACI Premier Technology, Inc., alleging torture and ill-treatment at 
Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Mr. Rashid, Mr. Al-Zuba&#8217;e and Mr. Al Shimari were all granted 
visas to travel to the U.S. during winter 2012/2013 and were able to secure boarding passes 
for their flight from Baghdad, Iraq to the U.S., scheduled for 15 March 2013, but were 
denied boarding onto the flight. All three men have applied for expedited visas to travel to 
the U.S. and no explanation has been given for their initial denial to board the aircraft. Mr. 
Rashid, Mr. Al-Zuba&#8217;e and Mr. Al Shimari risk dismissal of their case if they are unable to 
appear for deposition in the U.S. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
remind the government of the United States of America of paragraph 7e of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23, which urges States &#8220;(t)o ensure that victims of torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment obtain redress, are awarded fair and 
adequate compensation and receive appropriate social, psychological, medical and other 
relevant specialized rehabilitation.&#8221; In addition, one of the foundational principles of the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted by the Human Rights Council 
provides that &#8220;[a]s part of their duty to protect against business-related human rights abuse, 
States must take appropriate steps to ensure, through judicial, administrative, legislative or 
other appropriate means, that when such abuses occur within their territory and/or 
jurisdiction those affected have access to effective remedy.&#8221; In accordance with the United 
States of America&#8217;s obligation and commitment to provide redress to persons who suffer 
human rights violations, such as torture and war crimes, the Special Rapporteur requests 
that the government allow the plaintiffs to travel to the U.S., so that their claims are not 
prematurely dismissed, or at the very least, inform the plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys why their clients 
have been denied entry so that they may contest the decision.

<p>170. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America

army base Camp Bucca close to Umm Qasr in the south of Iraq, and Abu Ghraib Prison 
between October 2004 and July 2011. Mr. Omar was born in Kuwait and has dual Jordanian 
and US citizenship. Reportedly, Mr. Omar was arrested with his then pregnant wife by US 
soldiers in Baghdad in Al Zayouna district. Mr. Omar was reportedly handed over to Iraqi 
authorities in July 2011. Upon arrest, Mr. Omar was allegedly held incommunicado for two 
weeks and during interrogation sessions repeatedly tortured by means, inter alia, of electric 
shocks and simulations of drowning. He was beaten in front of his wife and the US security 
personnel threatened to rape his wife in front of him. According to information received, 
Mr. Omar&#8217;s wife was released after two weeks. Reportedly, while still in US-controlled 
facilities, Mr. Omar was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for illegal entry to Iraq </p>

</p>
<p>171. Mr. Omar was the subject of a previous communication, dated 30 November 2012; a 
reply to this communication is still awaited from the Government of the United States of

protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter 
alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Government of the United States of America ratified 
on 8 June 1992, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT), which the Government of the United States 
of America ratified on 21 October 1994. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that no 
exceptional circumstances can be invoked to justify torture by the Government. Due to the 
lack of further information, the Special Rapporteur finds that the Government of the United 
States is responsible for the torture and ill-treatment to which Mr. Omar was subjected 
while under the control of US military forces, in violation of  international law.

</b>172. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged prolonged 
solitary confinement of Herman Wallace, Albert Woodfox, and Robert King Wilkerson at 
Louisiana State Penitentiary and David Wade Correctional Centre, Louisiana, amounting to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or torture and insufficient medical care received by 
Mr. Wallace before his death. In 1972, Mr. Woodfox and Mr. Wallace were charged and 
found guilty of murdering a prison guard and spent over forty years in solitary confinement, 
reportedly the longest period of solitary confinement of any prisoner in the United States. 
Mr. Wilkerson was convicted of conspiracy to murder a fellow inmate and spent twenty-
nine years in solitary confinement. Mr. Wilkerson was released in February 2001. Mr. 
Woodfox&#8217;s conviction has been overturned and reaffirmed several times, and he remains in 
custody pending a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court. Temperatures in Mr. Woodfox&#8217;s cell 
are reportedly very high, reaching up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It was also alleged that 
prison review boards have not made efforts in good faith to have fair and meaningful 
hearings to assess the necessity of solitary confinement, setting aside consideration of the 
prisoner&#8217;s behavior in the assessment.  Reportedly, evidence used against Mr. Woodfox and 
Mr. Wallace has been questioned, including allegations of bribery. The conditions of 
confinement reported include 23-hour daily confinement, cells measuring 2 to 3 meters or 
smaller, and severely limited social interaction with no access to work, education, or 
rehabilitation programs. The conditions had reportedly had negative psychological and 
physical consequences on the inmates, as acknowledged by a federal judge in 2007. 
Additionally, Congressmen John Conyers, Cedric Richmond, Jerrold Nadler, and Bobby 
Scott had expressed their concern for these constitutional violations and alleged that the 
Attorney General in Louisiana was colluding with the Department of Corrections to 
fabricate violations of prison rules to justify the inmates&#8217; placement in solitary confinement. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not responded to this 
communication but notes that after forty-one years in solitary confinement, Mr. Wallace

Rapporteur reminds the Government of the United States of America that each Government 
has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This 
right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Government of 
the United States of America ratified on 8 June 1992, and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), which the 
Government of the United States of America ratified on 21 October 1994. In this context, 
he draws attention to paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights 
Committee, which states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned 
person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of the ICCPR (adopted at the 44th 
session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). In this regard, he also points to article 7 of 
the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed 
to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, 
should be undertaken and encouraged&#8221; (adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 
45/111 of 14 December 1990). Under the circumstances, the Special Rapporteur finds that 
the United States has violated the rights of Messrs. Wallace, Woodfox and Wilkerson to 
physical and mental integrity.

United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility (&#8220;ADX&#8221;) in Florence, 
Colorado, and the alleged detention without respect for his right to a fair trial and other 
minimum due process guarantees. On 11 June 2003, Mr. Ali, an American citizen born in 
Texas in 1981, was allegedly arrested at Medina University in Medina, Saudi Arabia at the 
behest of the United States. He was beaten and whipped in prison until he admitted he was 
part of an Al-Qaeda cell connected to the May 12 Riyadh bombings. Reportedly, Mr. Ali 
was transferred to Riyadh where he was placed in solitary confinement for 40 days, 
deprived of sleep, and coerced through torture to sign a 40-page statement created by Saudi 
Arabian secret police (Mabahith). It was reported that Mr. Ali has permanently disabled 
hands after being subjected to torture for nearly a month. Mr. Ali was also reportedly 
visited by FBI agents in the detention facility in Riyadh, who threatened to transfer him to 
Guantanamo Bay and label him an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; if he did not give testimony that 
incriminated the defendants at the Royer trial. Mr. Ali had reportedly been placed in 
solitary confinement months at a time. It was reported that Mr. Ali&#8217;s trial was not conducted 
fairly and that a motion to vacate his sentence was pending. During the trial, it was reported 
that the defense brought expert witnesses who testified that the marks on Mr. Ali&#8217;s back, the 
unbearable pain in his hands impeding his ability to hold a pen, and that the psychological 
stress he now experiences are consistent with his claims of being tortured. Mr. Ali is being 
detained in the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility (&#8220;ADX&#8221;) in 
Florence, Colorado. He is allegedly being subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, 
including 23-hour a day lock down in a 7 by 12 foot cell. In 2009, Mr. Ali reportedly was 
involved in a hunger strike protesting poor prison conditions. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and 
mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2

<p><b>128</b>  
</p>
<p>of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and 
Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur reiterates that no exceptional circumstances can 
be invoked to justify torture by the Government and as stated in article 15 of the CAT, 
evidence obtained through torture &#8220;shall not be invoked in any proceedings, except against 
a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; Due to the lack of 
information provided by the Government regarding allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
of Mr. Ali, the Special Rapporteur finds that the Government has violated the rights of Mr. 
Ali under international law regarding torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

prolonged solitary confinement in the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation, poor conditions of detention, and retaliatory measures against 
prisoners protesting through a hunger strike </b>(Update, the hunger strike ended after 60 
days, but many of the prisoners&#8217; demands were not met).<b> 
</b>174. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged excessive 
use of prolonged solitary confinement in the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation (CDCR), poor detention conditions, and retaliatory measures taken against 
prisoners protesting through a hunger strike. It is estimated that California holds nearly 
12,000 prisoners in isolation, including approximately 4,000 &#8220;Security Housing Units&#8221; 
(SHU) prisoners. Conditions reportedly include cells that are 8 by 12 feet and lack 
minimum ventilation or natural light. Prisoners remain in their cells for 22 to 23 hours a 
day, and do not generally have any contact with other inmates. Allegedly, prisoners are held 
in isolation, often for decades, based on alleged gang membership or threats of wrongdoing. 
It is reported that prisoners remain in solitary confinement until they can prove they have 
been &#8220;gang free&#8221; for six years, or agree to become an &#8220;informant.&#8221; Reportedly, current 
informants in SHU give incriminating &#8220;evidence&#8221; of other prisoners&#8217; insubordination and 
that dubious evidence is used to justify solitary confinement as a legitimate disciplinary 
measure. Allegedly, a high percentage of inmates held in solitary confinement have mental 
disabilities and the practice of prolonged solitary confinement has caused irreparable 
physical and mental harm to prisoners without initial mental conditions. It is reported that 
on 8 July 2013, 561 prisoners in nine separate prisons started a hunger strike, beginning in 
the solitary confinement unit of Pelican Bay State Prison in California. Thousands of 
prisoners joined the peaceful hunger strike to protest the use of solitary confinement. The 
demands made by prisoners reportedly included similar demands made during a 2011 
hunger strike, which lasted twenty days. Demands included: authorities&#8217; compliance with 
the recommendations of the US Commission on Safety and Abuse in America&#8217;s Prisons 
and and end to long-term solitary confinement; abolition of the debriefing (informant) 
policy and modification of active/inactive gang status criteria; elimination of group 
punishment and administrative abuse; adequate food and nutrition; and creation and 
expansion of constructive programming. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government of the United States has not responded to this communication and notes that 
although the hunger strike ended after 60 days, many of the prisoners&#8217; demands have not 
been met. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that each Government has the obligation to 
protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons under its jurisdiction. This 
right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (CAT). In this 
context, he reiterates that no exceptional circumstances can be invoked to justify torture by 
the Government. Further, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of paragraph 6 
of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee, which states that prolonged </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>129

<p>solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by 
article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the ICCPR (adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 
1992). And article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides 
that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the 
restriction of its use, should be undertaken and encouraged&#8221; (adopted by the General 
Assembly by resolution 45/111 of 14 December 1990).

medical treatment of Ms. Lynne Stewart for 18 months, resulting in her cancer 
developing to terminal stage 4 and the use of shackles during eventual medical 
treatment </b>(Update-granted compassionate release on 31 December 2013). 
175. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged denial of 
medical treatment of Ms. Lynne Stewart for 18 months, resulting in her tumor 
metastasizing and developing into terminal stage 4 cancer and the use of shackles during 
eventual medical treatment for no justifiable reason. In 2005, Ms. Stewart, a former United 
States attorney, was convicted of providing material support to terrorists while representing 
a client and was sentenced to 28 months in prison. Reportedly on appeal in 2010, Ms. 
Stewart was resentenced to 10 years in prison for an alleged perjury charge during the first 
trial. Ms. Stewart was held at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, in Forth Worth, Texas. 
Reportedly, Ms. Stewart had been diagnosed with cancer and was in remission at the time 
she was sentenced. Ms. Stewart was scheduled for surgery a week after her incarceration to 
remove the remaining cancer and prevent it from metastasizing. It was reported that she 
was subsequently forced to wait 18 months for the surgery, denying her the opportunity to 
eliminate her cancer. Medication was also allegedly withheld and repeatedly delivered late. 
The cancer has since developed to stage 4, has become terminal, and has spread to her 
lymph nodes, shoulder, bones, and lungs. It was reported that while receiving 
chemotherapy Ms. Stewart was shackled to her bed with leg irons, handcuffs, and belly 
chains, contrary to medical advice, without sufficient security justification. It was reported 
that she could not walk without help and had to walk to the physician shackled with 20 lbs. 
of chains and recuperate in an uncomfortable prison bed with her arms and legs shackled to 
the bed. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of 
America has not responded to this communication and reiterates that each Government has 
the obligation to protect the right to life and physical and mental integrity of all persons 
under its jurisdiction. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and 
Punishment (CAT). Despite the lack of any official response from the Government, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that on 31 December 2013 Ms. Stewart was granted a 
compassionate release because of her diagnosis of terminal cancer.

<p> <b>(i)</b> JAL 29/11/2013 Case No. USA 17/2013 State Reply: None to date <b>Alleged unlawful 
killings and abuse by US military in Nerkh District, Wardak Province, Afghanistan. 
</b></p>
<p>176. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. According to allegations, at least 19 Afghan men were 
unlawfully killed by the US Army, 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, known as 
Operation Detachment Alpha (ODA) 3124, in the Nerkh District of Wardak Province, 
Afghanistan in late 2012 and early 2013. Many of those killed were allegedly taken into 
custody by ODA 3124 and were later found dead. Additionally, it is alleged that several </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>130</b>  
</p>
<p>detainees held by ODA 3124 were mistreated, harassed and beaten while in custody. The 
US military reportedly opened a criminal investigation into these allegations, but numerous 
key witnesses had not yet been questioned by investigators. The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government that article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions provides that in 
non-international armed conflicts, all persons not taking an active part in hostilities, 
including persons in custody, shall be treated humanely. Additionally, article 3 of the 
UDHR and article 6(1) of the ICCPR guarantee the right of every individual to life and 
security and provide that these rights shall be protected by law and that no one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. The Special Rapporteur also reiterates that paragraph 
1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8230; and calls upon all States to 
implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, the Customary Rules 
compiled by the ICRC and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights 
Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law require states to investigate 
and respond to grave breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law. 
Similarly, articles 7 and 12 of the Convention against Torture require States to conduct 
prompt and impartial investigations where there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
torture has been committed and to prosecute suspected perpetrators. In the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the victims&#8217; rights under 
international standards relating to the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, as well as 
other standards of international human rights and humanitarian law, have been violated. 
The Special Rapporteur calls on the US Government to undertake a prompt, independent, 
and effective investigation of the facts, leading to the prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, to provide full redress to the victims and their family members, and to 
undertake effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

<p> <b>(j)</b> AL 29/11/2013 Case No. USA 18/2013 State Reply: None to date <b>Alleged prolonged 
solitary confinement of detainee in New York state prisons. 
</b></p>
<p>177. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to detainee Mr. William Blake, 
who has been held in indefinite isolation under &#8220;administrative segregation&#8221; for 26 years in 
a New York state prison. Mr. Blake is allegedly allowed only one hour of recreation per 
day in an empty space surrounded by concrete walls on three sides. New York State 
allegedly places no upper limit on the length of administrative segregation terms. The US 
Federal Government reportedly has oversight of state and local detention practices, and 
seeks to enforce federal safeguards against solitary confinement abuses. The Special 
Rapporteur stresses that under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture, each 
government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. Paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee 
provides that solitary confinement may amount to torture or ill treatment under article of 
the ICCPR. The Special Rapporteur stressed in his 2011 thematic report to the UN General 
Assembly that where the physical conditions and the prison regime of solitary confinement 
cause severe mental and physical pain or suffering, when used as a punishment, during pre-
trial detention, indefinitely, prolonged on juveniles or persons with mental disabilities, it 
can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture under 
CAT, ICCPR and other international standards. According to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
report, prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 days can cause irreversible 
psychological damage on the detainee. Without any evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights of the detainee mentioned above have been violated </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>under international standards relating to the prohibition of torture and ill treatment. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes New York State's recent willingness to look into the use of 
solitary confinement and hopes that other State governemnts will follow suit.  Futher, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the United States Government to take all measures necessary to 
ban the use of prolonged solitary confinement for juveniles, pregnant women and persons 
with mental disabilities. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to cease the 
prolonged isolation of Mr. Blake and to abolish or restrict the use of solitary confinement in 
all detention facilities throughout the United States, including New York State.<b>

</b></p>
<p>178. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States for its reply, 
dated 25 June 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture of Mr. Shaker 
Aamer by U.S. security forces at Bagram, Kandahar and Guantanamo Bay. Since 2001, it is 
alleged that US forces have subjected Mr. Aaner to beatings, have forced him to sit or stand 
in stress positions, have poured cold water on him, have provided inadequate food and 
clothing, have subjected him to sexual abuse, have subjected him to forced feeding, have 
placed him in solitary confinement, have denied him independent medical examinations, 
and have forced him to make false statements and confessions under duress. Mr. Aamer has 
allegedly never been charged with a crime, and has been cleared for release from 
Guantanamo Bay since 2007.  The US Government alleges in its reply that Mr. Aamer&#8217;s 
continued detention at Guantanamo is in accordance with domestic US law, as well as 
international human rights and humanitarian law. The US alleges that prison officials have 
used proportionate levels of force against Mr. Aamer for order and disciplinary purposes, 
and that Mr. Aamer has never been placed in solitary confinement. The US also reports that 
all claims of torture and ill treatment raised by Mr. Aamer have been found to be not 
credible. The US further claims that Mr. Aamer has been provided with adequate medical 
care and the opportunity to challenge his detention in federal court. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and 
mental integrity of all persons, as set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against 
Torture. The Special Rapporteur further reiterates that according to articles 2 and 15 of 
CAT, no exceptional circumstances can be invoked to justify torture, and evidence obtained 
through torture &#8220;shall not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused 
of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; Additionally, articles 9 and 10 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and articles 9 and 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantee the right of all persons not to be 
deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal. Due to the lack of further information, the Special Rapporteur concludes 
that the victim&#8217;s rights under international standards relating to the prohibition of torture 
and ill-treatment, as well as other standards of international human rights and humanitarian 
law, have been violated. The Special Rapporteur urges the US Government to provide 
further information regarding the alleged abuses, to conduct thorough and independent 
investigations, leading to the prosecution and punishment of all perpetrators, and to provide 
compensation for the victim.

</p>
<p>180. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uzbekistan for its reply, dated 11 
November 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged arbitrary arrest, torture 
and ill-treatment of Mr. Sardorbek Nurmetov by police forces in Urgench, Uzbekistan. 
According to allegations, Mr. Nurmetov was detained at the Urgench City Politce Station, 
where he was beaten and kicked by the chief of the station, was refused medical assistance 
and water, and was not allowed to go to the bathroom. It is alleged that police forces 
pressured Mr. Nurmetov not to file a complaint against the chief of police and brought 
administrative charges against him for possessing illegal religious materials. Mr. Nurmetov 
eventually filed a complaint. According to the Uzbekistan Government, Mr. Nurmetov was 
lawfully detained for carrying illegal religious extremist materials. The Government also 
claims that he suffered no bodily harm at the police station, nor was he subjected to any 
other ill-treatment. Additionally the Government claims that police officers did not pressure 
him into withdrawing his complaint, and that the Urgench Prosecutor&#8217;s Office suspended its </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>133

<p>investigation into the alleged abuse after it found there was a lack of evidence. 
Additionally, the Government explains that the Urgench City Court imposed a fine and 
other lawful measures against Mr. Nurmetov for unlawful possession and importation of 
banned religious materials. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that paragraph 
1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation&#8230; and 
calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur also reiterates that Article 6 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement 
Officials, provides that &#8220;Law enforcement officials shall ensure the full protection of the 
health of persons in their custody and, in particular, shall take immediate action to secure 
medical attention whenever required&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur also draws the 
Government&#8217;s attention to article 12 of the CAT, which requires the competent authorities 
to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 of the CAT, which requires State 
parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture.  The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to continue to investigate the alleged acts, to prosecute and punish all 
perpetrators, and to provide adequate compensation for the victim and his family. The 
Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government to continue to engage with his 
mandate and with other UN human rights mechanisms. <b>

detention and torture of Mr. Nguyen Van Hai and Mr. Cu Huy Ha Vu and alleged ill-
treatment of Mr. Nguyen Xuan Nghia. </b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>

<p>184. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of Viet Nam, dated 
11 October 2013, to this communication in reference to the alleged arbitrary detention and 
torture of Mr. Nguyen Van Hai, also known as Dieu Cay, and Mr. Cu Huy Ha Vu and the 
alleged ill-treatment of Mr. Nguyen Xuan Nghia. Mr. Nguyen Van Hai was the subject of 
previous communications; on 15 August 2011, a communication was sent to the 
Government of Viet Nam regarding Mr. Nguyen Van Hai&#8217;s poor prison conditions, alleged 
hard labour and torture. The previous communication alleged that Mr. Nguyen Van Hai lost 
an arm in prison, was being tortured, and arbitrarily detained for exercising his right of 
freedom of expression. The Government of Viet Nam replied in a letter dated 12 January 
2012 that the proceedings against Mr. Nguyen Van Hai were carried out in compliance with 
Vietnamese laws and international standards and that allegations regarding torture were not 
true. On 18 October 2010, upon completion of a previous sentence, Mr. Nguyen Van Hai 
was charged with conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and 
held incommunicado for several months. Reportedly, in September 2012, Mr. Nguyen Van 
Hai was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and five years probation. In June 2013, Mr. 
Nguyen Van Hai was placed in solitary confinement. Reportedly Mr. Nguyen Van Hai had 
conducted multiple hunger-strikes in response to the conditions of his confinement.  It was 
reported that Mr. Nguyen Van Hai&#8217;s health suffers as a result of a prolonged hunger strike, 
and the location of his detention is so remote that he would not have access to urgent 
medical treatment if necessary. It was further alleged that Mr. Nguyen Xuan Nghia is in 
poor health and is suffering from a number of ailments that may be exacerbated by prison 
conditions; also that Mr. Nguyen Van Hai&#8217;s family learned of his hunger strike, solitary 
confinement, and inadequate medical care because Mr. Nguyen Xuan Nghia yelled out to 
his wife, who then informed the family of Mr. Nguyen Van Hai. It was reported that prison 
guards subsequently beat Mr. Nguyen Xuan Nghia brutally to make him stop speaking. 
Additionally, Mr. Cu Huy Ha Vu was reported to be in deteriorating health due to his 
hunger strike and the poor conditions of detention and that Mr. Cu Huy Ha Vu feels 
seriously threatened by one prison guard who is allegedly trying to kill him without the 
prison authorities granting him protection. In its reply, the Government of Viet Nam stated 
that Mr. Hai, Mr. Vu and Mr. Nghia have not been tortured and enjoy &#8220;meal portions, 
relatives&#8217; visits and medical cares, as stipulated by current laws of Viet Nam,&#8221; as well as a 
health check every three months. The reply further stated that the report that Mr. Nguyen 
Van Hai went on a hunger strike was incorrect, and that information regarding Mr. Nguyen 
Van Hai being placed in solitary confinement was untrue. The reply further stated that Mr. 
Nguyn Xuan Nghia&#8217;s health is normal. The Government stated that Mr. Cu Huy Ha Vu&#8217;s 
health has not suffered as a result of his hunger strike and that the clinic sees Mr. Vu daily 
for his blood pressure. Additionally, the Government claimed that the arrest and trial of all 
three individuals was in strict compliance with Vietnamese laws and international norms 
and human rights practices. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not 
provide sufficient documentation of the investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment in connection to Mr. Nguyen Van Hai, Mr. Cu Huy Ha Vu, and Mr. Nguyen 
Xuan Nghia. The Government&#8217;s reply does not explain the Court&#8217;s findings nor the 
measures taken to impartially and independently investigate the allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take persistent, determined 
and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an 
independent, competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground 
to believe that such an act has been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, 
tolerate or perpetrate such acts responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in 
a manner commensurate with the gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of 
the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed according 
to paragraph 7b of the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23. </p>

</p>
<p>185. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Vietnam has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged arrest and ill-treatment of MsX, 
a labour rights defender. Ms. X was the subject of a November 2012 Opinion of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which requested her release. Ms. X was arrested in 
February 2010 due to her involvement in a strike at the My Phong Leather Shoes factory in 
Tra Vinh province,  and was allegedly beaten, subjected to intimidation, pressured to admit 
her guilt, and denied access to counsel during her eight months in pre-trial detention. Ms. X 
was reportedly convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison after a one-day trial in 
October 2010. During subsequent detention in three separate prisons, Ms. X allegedly 
continued to suffer beatings, was subjected to inadequate living conditions, placed in 
solitary confinement, denied access to medical care, and forced to perform hard labor. 
Concern was expressed that her detention and ill-treatment was a result of her work in 
claiming and defending labour rights, and Ms. X remained in detention at the time of this 
communication. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of 
Vietnam of its obligation under paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council resolution 16/23, 
which &quot;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which shall remain prohibited at any time and 
in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to 
implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot; With regard to the alleged solitary 
confinement of Ms. X, the Special Rapporteur would also recalls paragraph 6 of General 
Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee, which states that prolonged solitary 
confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 
7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to article 7 of 
the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed 
to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, 
should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 7b of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which urges States &#8220;(t)o take persistent, 
determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by 
an independent, competent domestic authority&#8221; and &#8220;to hold persons who encourage, order, 
tolerate or perpetrate such acts responsible [and] have them brought to justice and punished 
in a manner commensurate with the gravity of the offence.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur recalls 
Rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides 
that &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized 
institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their 
equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care 
and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers.&#8221; 
(Approved by the Economic and Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 
1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977.)  The treatment to which Ms. X was subjected 
defeats the object and purpose of the Convention Against Torture, which Vietnam has 
signed but not yet ratified. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a 
prompt and independent investigation into the alleged arbitrary detention and ill-treatment 
of Ms. X,  leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full 
redress to the victim.  </p>

incommunicado and secret detention of Mr. Muhammad Ahmad Naji Obayd Al 
Haribi.  
</b></p>
<p>186. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Yemen has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and incommunicado and 
secret detention of Mr. Muhammad Ahmad Naji Obayd Al Haribi in a secret prison in 
Sana&#8217;a and in the Yemeni Intelligence Service&#8217;s National Security headquarters&#8217; Al Qala&#8217;a 
prison. It was reported that on 9 November 2012, Mr. Al Haribi was arrested without 
judicial warrant and that his family was informed of the arrest by a civilian. According to 
the information received, Mr. Al Haribi was never brought before a judge and he was 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment during the 33 weeks he spent in detention. It was 
reported that Mr. Al Haribi is an activist with the Southern Yemeni secessionist movement. 
Reportedly, Mr. Al Haribi suffered physically and psychologically while being detained 
incommunicado for 33 weeks in a secret prison in Sana&#8217;a and the Yemeni Intelligence 
Service&#8217;s National Security headquarters&#8217; Al Qala&#8217;a prison. It has also been reported that 
most of those detained in the Al Qala&#8217;a prison leave with serious and permanent injuries; 
some have allegedly even lost their mind as a result of long periods of detention, torture and 
other cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment. Additionally, it was reported that Mr. 
Haribi&#8217;s detention was arbitrary. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. Due to the lack of information provided by the Government, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that Mr. Al Haribi has been subjected to torture, ill-treatment and 
incommunicado detention and that his rights have therefore been violated.

executions and two executions carried out in 2012 against individuals who were minors at 
the time of the alleged offence. 
</p>
<p>187. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of the Yemen 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to alleged execution of 
two minors, and the imminent execution of twenty three individuals reported to be minors 
at the time of the offense. Ms. Hind al-Barti was reported to be 16 years old at the time of 
her offense, and Mr. Fuad Ahmad Ali al-Sayyid was reportedly a minor as well, yet both 
individuals were executed. Mr. al-Sayyid was the subject of a past communication made by 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on 23 December 
2010, where concern was expressed that he was awaiting execution despite being a minor at 
the time of his offense. A reply regarding this communication is still awaited. In addition to 
these executions, 23 other individuals who were allegedly minors at the time they 
committed their offense are at risk of execution. Three of them, namely Messrs. 
Muhammad Taher Samoum in Ibb, Waleed Hussein Haikal in Sana&#8217;a and Muhammad 
Abduh Qasem al-Taweel in Ibb, are believed to risk imminent execution, due to the fact 
that their death sentences have been ratified by the President. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of Yemen that sentencing a person to death for having 
committed a crime when under eighteen years old amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading 
punishment, which is prohibited inter alia in the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(CRC), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur reiterates in his recent report to the General 
Assembly that &quot;not only is the enforcement of the death penalty in these cases [juveniles] </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/60/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>138</b>  
</p>
<p>considered a violation per se of the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment and punishment but the related State practice has led to the emergence of a jus 
cogens provision regarding the execution of juveniles&quot;. (A/67/279, para 64). The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and independent investigation 
into the alleged execution and imminent executions of minors, and to provide full redress to 
the victims.
