<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In Human Rights Council Resolution 8/7 concerning the mandate of the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises (&#8220;the Special Representative&#8221;), the Human 
Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;to organize, within the framework of the Council, a two-day 
consultation bringing together the Special Representative, business representatives and all 
relevant stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations and representatives of 
victims of corporate abuse, in order to discuss ways and means to operationalize [the 
Special Representative&#8217;s] framework, ...&#8221; (OP. 6). 
</p><p>2. The present report contains a summary of the proceedings from the consultation 
which took place on 5&#8211;6 October 2009 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Given that the 
aim of the consultation was to provide broad input to the process of operationalizing the 
&#8220;Protect, Respect, Remedy&#8221; framework for business and human rights, the report does not 
contain specific conclusions or recommendations. Recommendations from participants are 
instead given throughout in relation to the sessions during which they were made. 
</p>
<p>3. Following the Human Rights Council&#8217;s emphasis on inclusive participation of all 
relevant stakeholders in the consultation, OHCHR engaged in consultations with 
Government delegations, civil society organizations, business representatives, inter alia, 
about the agenda and the identification of relevant speakers for the consultation. A 
dedicated website was created five months in advance of the event, inviting all interested 
parties to register. A particular effort was made to facilitate the participation of 
representatives of victims of corporate abuse through outreach to relevant civil society 
networks and other channels. All national human rights institutions were notified about the 
consultation and invited to participate. In the end, more than 250 participants from all 
stakeholder groups registered for the consultation, not counting Government delegations. 
The list of participants is available on the consultation website. 
</p>
<p>4. The agenda for the consultation was structured around the three pillars of the 
framework, with multi-stakeholder panels in different sessions addressing a range of issues 
arising from efforts to operationalize the framework. Both the agenda and the panellist 
presentations are available on the consultation website. Each session allowed time for 
extensive discussion from the floor. An effort was made to allocate time for comments from 
representatives of States, civil society, business and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>5. The consultation was chaired jointly by Her Excellency Bente Angell-Hansen, 
Ambassador of Norway, and His Excellency Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, Ambassador of 
Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>6. All stakeholders were invited to make written submissions on issues related to the 
consultation both before and after the event. A total of 30 written submissions were 
received, which have been posted on the consultation website. A list of the contributing 
organizations and individuals are contained in the annex. 
</p>
<p>7. Stakeholders were also invited to organize side events during the two days of the 
consultation. A summary of the proceedings from the side events is contained in an 
Addendum to the present report (A/HRC/14/29/Add.1). </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statements 
</b>8. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, 
opened the consultation by stating that the issue of business and human rights has evolved 
significantly over the past years. The High Commissioner recognized that placing business 
and human rights firmly on the agenda of the Human Rights Council is in no small part due 
to the important advocacy and campaigning role played by civil society. While not all 
allegations made against companies for human rights violations may be true or justified, 
there are sufficiently well-founded examples from around the world of human rights being 
infringed as a result of corporate activity. The High Commissioner also recognized that 
many companies have acknowledged the link between business activity and the enjoyment 
of human rights, including through signing up to the United Nations Global Compact, 
which asks companies to respect and promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The High Commissioner stated that the framework for business and human rights 
provided a much-needed clarification of the roles and responsibilities of States and 
corporations respectively with regard to human rights in a corporate context. After more 
than a decade of discussion, the affirmation of a corporate responsibility to respect human 
rights both set a new and clear benchmark and represented an important milestone in the 
evolving understanding of human rights in our societies. The High Commissioner stated 
that importantly, the framework also kept the focus on those who feel their rights have been 
impacted by corporate activity by emphasizing the need for access to more effective 
remedies, both judicial and non-judicial, for victims of corporate-related human rights 
abuse. In other words, the framework highlighted the fact that there are three parties to any 
corporate-related human rights issue: States that fail to protect; companies that fail to 
respect and individuals and groups whose right or rights are infringed. It is therefore 
necessary to focus on all pillars of the framework when discussing business and human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The High Commissioner invited all participants to present stories of their own 
experiences of corporate-related human rights violations and examine ways to make the 
framework operational. She also expressed the hope that the discussions would give all 
actors &#8212; States, companies and civil society &#8212; a better understanding of what is required 
in operational terms to secure respect for human rights in a corporate setting. 
</p>
<p>11. In his opening statement, the Special Representative described some key challenges 
in addressing the issue of business and human rights. Firstly, because companies can affect 
the entire spectrum of internationally recognized rights, and not only a limited subset, the 
quest to construct ex ante a delimited list of business-specific rights for which companies 
would have some responsibility is unrealistic. This fact needs to inform the policies of 
States and companies alike. 
</p>
<p>12. Governments currently lack adequate policies and regulatory arrangements for fully 
managing the complex business and human rights agenda. Although some States are 
moving in the right direction, overall their practices exhibit substantial legal and policy 
incoherence. The most widespread is &#8220;horizontal&#8221; incoherence, where economic or 
business-focused departments and agencies that shape business practices conduct their 
work in isolation from and largely uninformed by their Government&#8217;s human rights 
agencies and obligations, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Representative went on to note that, with rare exceptions, even large 
multinational companies lack fully fledged internal governance and management systems 
for conducting adequate human rights due diligence. Businesses tend to focus on the 
requirements of their legal licence to operate, only slowly discovering that in many 
situations meeting legal requirements alone may fall short of the universal expectation that </p>


<p>GE.10-12935 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>they operate with respect for human rights &#8211; especially, but not only, where laws are 
inadequate or not enforced. 
</p>
<p>14. Similarly, most companies lack grievance mechanisms whereby affected individuals 
and communities can raise concerns, because this is not required by the law. Companies 
thereby deny those who are adversely affected by their activities an opportunity to resolve 
issues that may be readily remediable and at the same time deny themselves an effective 
early-warning system. 
</p>
<p>15. The incidence of corporate-related human rights abuse is higher in countries with 
weak governance institutions. The worst cases occur, usually, in armed conflict-affected 
areas. In those situations, access to justice by victims can be particularly difficult and the 
use of extraterritorial jurisdiction might be one way to close such impunity gaps. 
</p><p>16. The Special Representative affirmed that victims of corporate-related abuses need 
change now and that neither a strictly voluntary approach nor pursuing lengthy negotiations 
on an international treaty or court for legal persons would deliver the necessary change 
within an acceptable time frame. However the &#8220;Protect, Respect, Remedy&#8221; framework 
represents a solid foundation for achieving cumulative progress. It spells out differentiated 
yet complementary roles and responsibilities for States and companies, including the 
element of remedy. 
</p>
<p>17. Finally, the Special Representative noted that numerous national bodies, regional 
organizations and other United Nations Special Procedures have invoked the framework in 
their policy assessments and how this might be a sign that the mandate is heading in the 
right direction. 
</p>
<p><b> III. State duty to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic policy coherence 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>18. Jody Kollapen (former Chairperson of the South African Human Rights 
Commission) gave an overview of the causes of policy incoherence and proposed ways in 
which States could overcome it. He started by saying that the State duty to protect requires 
States to prevent violations of human rights by third parties. According to Mr. Kollapen, 
policy incoherence is due to a range of factors, including the tendency by Governments to 
view human rights narrowly; the lack of a human rights focal point at the governmental 
level; a contradictory regime for national and multinational enterprises and the inability or 
the unwillingness of States to meet their duty to protect against human rights abuses by 
third parties such as corporations. He suggested that to achieve policy coherence, States 
should establish mechanisms to ensure alignment between international human rights 
obligations and national laws and policies. Moreover, States should intervene in areas such 
as corporate, contractual and private law, mainstreaming human rights. He suggested that 
States could impose a fiduciary duty on directors to act with due care and skill to operate 
with respect for human rights and to include non-financial reporting in the statutory duties 
of companies. He added that national human rights institutions could play an important role 
in facilitating discussion among Government, civil society and the private sector. Mr. 
Kollapen concluded by suggesting that the Human Rights Council should urge 
Governments to establish national human rights institutions, adequately resourced, with a 
mandate to work on business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>19. Hannah Ellis (Coordinator of the Corporate Responsibility Coalition) proposed 
measures for Governments to improve their domestic policy coherence. Acknowledging </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p>that lack of clarity in legislation and policy is the major obstacle to holding companies 
accountable for their human rights impacts, a range of human rights principles should be 
embedded in company law. Precise requirements with regard to transparency, disclosure, 
monitoring, and auditing requirements can be embodied in regulations governing financial 
markets to curb corporate misconduct. Governments should also monitor compliance with 
human rights obligations by corporations located on their territory, for example in relation 
to their overseas impacts. This could be achieved through the creation of an independent 
body mandated to undertake the monitoring function. The Corporate Responsibility 
Coalition proposed a United Kingdom Commission for Business, Human Rights and the 
Environment, a body mandated to ensure compliance by United Kingdom companies with 
human rights standards and with the power to investigate, sanction and provide remedy to 
victims. Furthermore, Governments can influence companies&#8217; behaviour by making their 
support subject to companies&#8217; compliance with human rights standards. A rigorous 
verification of the company&#8217;s human rights records should be carried out by the 
Government, especially when public funds are used to support companies, as in the case of 
export credit agencies. 
</p>
<p>20. Ed Potter (Director, Global Workplace Rights, The Coca-Cola Company) observed 
that the precondition for policy coherence is to close the gaps between the application of 
human rights and respect for the rule of law in theory and in practice. On the basis of an 
analysis of national corporate law conducted under the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate, it 
emerged that most countries are signatories to major human rights instruments but few 
translate human rights into national law directly applicable to businesses. Mr. Potter 
suggested that to achieve policy coherence, it is essential that Governments put in place 
cross-departmental human rights and business strategies. He gave an example of this 
approach, mentioning the negotiation of bilateral trade agreements by the Government of 
the United States where trade, State, labour, commerce and other departments worked 
together. On the matter of States&#8217; extraterritorial obligations, he stressed that, on the one 
hand, home States should guide and inform companies as they invest in places where 
policies may be less rigorous and engage with companies on the challenges of working in 
those areas. On the other hand, host States should have clear and comprehensive legal 
guidelines that are equitably applied and invest in labour inspection and judiciary systems 
to help ensure a level playing field. 
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussion 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the discussion from the floor, participants underlined the causes of domestic 
policy incoherence and proposed complementary and creative solutions. Representatives 
from national human rights institutions (NHRIs) noted that, as independent and impartial 
promoters of the respect for human rights, NHRIs could play an important role in ensuring 
compliance by the State with its duty to protect, although reform is needed in the legal 
mandates of some NHRIs to ensure that they are not restricted in their ability to take 
effective action on corporate-related human rights issues. NHRIs were described as 
uniquely placed to promote policy coherence and facilitate dialogue. It was also noted that, 
collectively, NHRIs are building capacity for effective engagement in business and human 
rights through the establishment of a working group on business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>22. Another NHRI representative expressed the view that the real cause of governance 
gaps is the doctrine which is based on the assumption that States should not intervene in 
control and supervision of the market or ensure that human rights are observed. States 
should assume their proper role in providing services and goods in a manner that ensures 
the observance of fundamental rights. States should monitor what companies are doing with 
regard to human rights, and human rights instruments should be used to make sure that 
companies can be held accountable for human rights violations. </p>


<p>GE.10-12935 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>23. Some civil society representatives pointed out that States, when entering into trade 
agreements, should preserve and enforce labour rights, indigenous peoples&#8217; and women&#8217;s 
rights, but are often unable to do so. It was suggested that, at the international level, there 
are two parallel and mutually exclusive architectures: one for human rights and one for 
trade whereby States&#8217; capacity is significantly diminished. Therefore States, in an attempt 
to attract foreign investment, enter into trade or investment agreements that lead them to 
relax labour laws or fail to implement them. One of the proposals to overcome this impasse 
was that the United Nations formulate a code of norms, such as the draft Norms on the 
responsibility of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to 
human rights, developed by the then Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights, directly applicable to business and establish a tribunal to ensure the 
enforcement of those norms. Other specific proposals included a suggestion that States 
must proactively seek to avoid support for investments that will breach human rights 
through their export credit agencies. States should establish a potential client&#8217;s track record 
and screen clients based on compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. States should also include human rights standards in investor-State agreements 
to ensure that these agreements do not impinge on host Governments&#8217; ability to regulate the 
activities of multinational enterprises. 
</p>
<p>24. It was also suggested by civil society representatives that States should include 
human rights as an integral part of every activity or role that they undertake with regard to 
business. This would include all relationships and functions, be it as a partner, a consumer, 
a public procurer, a shareholder, an investor, an insurer or a risk bearer and a regulator and 
through trade and investment agreements, export credit agencies, aid funds, public-private 
partnerships, export credit insurance, subsidies, loans and investments. Moreover, States 
should proactively seek to prevent any public support or export credit from contributing to 
or being complicit in human rights abuses. When the State has a role in facilitating or 
supporting investments by its companies abroad, such as through export credit agencies or 
providing guarantees for exports or investments, the State should establish a potential 
beneficiary&#8217;s human rights and environmental track record and make a screening based on 
the company&#8217;s compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, for 
example. In this way, States and State bodies can use the Guidelines as a preventive 
measure for averting human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>25. Some civil society representatives insisted on the importance of the extraterritorial 
dimension of the State duty to protect. Home and host States have an obligation to regulate 
the activities of the companies operating from or within their territory. When the host State 
is unable to enforce national law on the company then the home State should adjudicate the 
behaviour of the company and offer a remedy to the victims of corporate abuse. On this 
point, a business representative said that States should refrain from exercising jurisdiction 
outside of national borders unless there is a clear, demonstrable and substantive link to the 
territory. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of participants also raised the issue of violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights in cases where they have not consented to the exploitation of resources on their 
territories. Due to corruption, some Governments fail in their duty to protect indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>27. According to some business representatives, business does not consider human 
rights an issue for voluntary mechanisms. It requires national law and effective 
implementations of that law, so the highest priority is to close the gap between what the law 
sets as a standard and general practices. There is no country where corruption is legal but it 
exists everywhere and sometimes excessively affects all aspects of human rights. Contrary 
to what people might think, business needs non-discriminatory application of national law, 
predictability and stability of the system. It was also noted that bilateral investment treaties </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p>aim at balancing rights and responsibilities, including those of business. Business has 
fundamental problems with the concept of extraterritoriality and believes that States should 
refrain from attempts to exercise jurisdiction outside of national borders unless there is a 
clear, demonstrable and substantive link to the territory. 
</p>
<p>28. States representatives stressed the primary obligations of States with regard to 
human rights. It was proposed that human rights treaty bodies should guide States on how 
to discharge their duty to protect in a comprehensive and coherent manner and that civil 
society should trigger the monitoring function of the treaty bodies by presenting specific 
cases. Other stakeholders added that States should report to human rights treaty bodies and 
the Human Rights Council, through the Universal Periodic Review and regional bodies, 
such as the African Commission on Human Rights, the measures put in place to protect 
against business-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Guidance from international mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>29. Luis Gallegos (Ambassador of Ecuador to the United States of America and member 
of the Committee against Torture) described the type of guidance international mechanisms 
provide to States. He started by noting that a treaty body is a mechanism to assess and 
monitor how a State complies with the obligations undertaken by ratifying the treaty. He 
highlighted that the treaty bodies have spelled out clearly what the State&#8217;s duty to protect 
entails: States are responsible for ensuring adherence to the Convention by third parties. 
Therefore, if a violation has occurred, the State has to provide remedy and reparation for 
the victims. He added that the most recent human rights treaties, such as the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities refer 
directly to the issue of remedy. Mr. Gallegos concluded by suggesting that treaty bodies 
should have in place procedures to evaluate and assess the performance of both States and 
companies in relation to the rights protected by the Conventions. 
</p>
<p>30. Julie Cavanaugh-Bill (Western Shoshone Defense Project) outlined how the Western 
Shoshone, an indigenous people living in the United States, have used the international 
mechanisms to protect their ancestral land against the United States Government, which 
claimed their territory as public property. Ms. Cavanaugh-Bill explained that numerous 
mechanisms were employed, ranging from the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights, the Working Group on the Indigenous Populations, the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the offices of several of the United Nations 
Special Rapporteurs. She particularly mentioned the decision of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which had issued an Urgent Action recommending 
the State party to &#8220;freeze, desist and stop&#8221; all harmful activities against the Western 
Shoshone and their lands until a good faith resolution of the dispute was achieved. 
However, the State did not comply with the Committee&#8217;s decision and granted some 
important, spiritual and cultural areas to be mined by a gold mining company. She 
concluded by pointing out that the human rights bodies provided adequate guidance to the 
State but the State failed to incorporate that guidance domestically. To increase 
effectiveness and implementation of this guidance, she suggested that the United Nations 
and regional human rights bodies should conduct site visits that would allow for outreach 
and education to impacted communities on the role of these mechanisms and an exchange 
of information. Finally, States and companies should operate on the basis of the free, prior 
and informed consent of indigenous people. </p>


<p>GE.10-12935 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>31. Victor Ricco (Strategic Advisor to the Executive Director of the Centre for Human 
Rights and the Environment) presented and discussed the weaknesses of the international 
mechanisms. He referred to the lack of integrated strategy for communication between 
different United Nations agencies and other international bodies, such as the Inter-
American Human Rights Commission and the Ombudsman of the International Finance 
Corporation, and how this gives rise to fragmented and contradictory guidance from the 
international mechanisms. He called for the revision of the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises to include elements to verify and strengthen guidelines for 
companies with regard to human rights. Moreover Mr. Ricco pointed out the structural 
problems States face in complying with their duty to protect. In Latin America, for 
example, many States have ratified the major human rights treaties but then there is a lack 
of implementation of those obligations at the domestic level. He called for better access to 
information from United Nations and regional human rights bodies in order to better 
facilitate input and participation from civil society in corporate-related human rights cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussion 
</b></p>
<p>32. Participants outlined the main obstacles for States to comply with their duty to 
protect and mentioned, in particular, the stabilization clauses in investment agreements and 
the fact that not all States have ratified all the United Nations international human rights 
treaties. It was also suggested that United Nations treaty bodies should consider all human 
rights issues linked to business and provide better guidance to States. In this context, some 
civil society representatives reiterated the importance of creating a binding human rights 
treaty for companies and a mechanism that would both follow up and monitor companies&#8217; 
compliance with the treaty and also provide remedy and reparation to victims. It was also 
pointed out that the accountability mechanism of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises &#8212; the National Contact Points (NCPs) &#8212; is less used than in the past and that 
this might be an indicator of the lack of effectiveness of this mechanism. A way to improve 
it could be to provide NCPs with the necessary tools to comply efficiently with their 
function. 
</p>
<p>33. State representatives pointed to the difficulty arising from the fact that not all treaties 
are ratified by all countries. This limits the possibility of corporate-related complaints 
reaching the relevant treaty bodies. This in turn enhances the importance of regional 
procedures. They also pointed to the fact that with the changing global economic landscape, 
many transnational corporations are now from continents other than Europe and North 
America and that there is a need to consider how to better engage these companies as well 
as their countries of origin in the discussion about business and human rights. French-
speaking countries have engaged in dialogue on improving governance and corporate social 
responsibility, which is a matter to which both States and other parties should give high 
priority. Reference was also made to the issue of stabilization provisions in host 
Government agreements in limiting a State&#8217;s ability to meet its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Corporate responsibility to respect 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights due diligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>34. Marietta Paragas (Chief Executive Officer, Shontoug Foundation, the Philippines) 
discussed the relation between due diligence mechanisms in the mining sector and the 
importance of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of indigenous people. She outlined 
how large-scale mining has impacted civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples without contributing to the wealth and development of the country as a 
whole. She also stressed that while the Constitution of the Philippines recognizes the rights 
of indigenous peoples and FPIC is required under national law, the Indigenous Peoples 
Rights Act, those norms are neither respected nor enforced. While human rights due 
diligence is a good concept, it is her experience that it is not being applied in the context of 
mining activities in areas with indigenous peoples. She recommended that companies, 
exercising their due diligence, should take more time to consult with and understand 
indigenous peoples and their customs, written and unwritten; respect their ancestral 
domains; ensure transparency; and conduct the FPIC processes in local languages. She 
called on the Special Representative to elaborate on the concept of FPIC and recommended 
that the United Nations establish a mechanism to hold corporations accountable at the 
international level, where national mechanisms are insufficient.  
</p>
<p>35. Adam Greene (Vice-President, Labour Affairs and Corporate Responsibility, United 
States Council for International Business) highlighted the characteristics and the limitations 
of the due diligence process. Firstly, he pointed out that it is an effective approach because 
it builds on existing business processes and helps integrate human rights into company 
operations. Secondly, he stressed that it assists companies in meeting the responsibility to 
respect human rights by proactively looking at issues and managing factors, including 
internal governance systems, risks from third parties, political, financial, operational and 
ethical risks. The due diligence process has to be dynamic to allow examination of new 
issues as they arise. While due diligence can make companies understand their human 
rights risks, it cannot change the broader context or resolve underlying human rights issues 
in the countries of operation. He noted that legal compliance is not voluntary for 
companies, but that there is often a huge gap between legal standards and practice. He 
stressed that compliance with the law is necessary even when the laws are not enforced. Mr. 
Greene concluded by noting that the due diligence process can only work as part of the 
broader framework of the State duty to protect and provide access to remedies and that 
there is a need for continued collaboration between stakeholders to address the root causes 
of human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussion 
</b></p>
<p>36. Participants raised the issue of due diligence in relation to corporate complicity in 
human rights violations. It was suggested that corporate complicity is based on causation, 
knowledge and proximity. It was noted that the closer the company is in geographical terms 
to the abuser, the more likely a company will be found to be complicit and therefore the 
greater is its due diligence obligation. Other participants found assigning responsibility on 
the basis of proximity to be problematic, especially in light of the technological advances of 
society where a corporation may act and influence activities far beyond its physical 
presence. It was recommended that the due diligence process to avoid complicity should 
involve considering the track record of potential business partners, examining publicly 
available information to gain an understanding of human rights risks and obtaining expert 
advice. Once a company becomes aware that it risks being complicit in human rights 
abuses, the risk should be mitigated.  
</p>
<p>37. One participant pointed to the human rights due diligence process of the financial 
sector, which is often not well developed but can play an important role in preventing 
corporate human rights abuse. The effort by the Special Representative to clarify the role of 
investors and other financial institutions was welcomed.  
</p>
<p>38. Participants raised the challenge of ensuring due diligence in the context of supply 
chains. It was pointed out that there is often a gap between the corporate responsibility 
policies of headquarters and actual practices along the supply chain. It was noted that 
human rights violations are often found far down the supply chain and that there is a need </p>


<p>GE.10-12935 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>for a transparent and thorough overview of supply chains, an issue which could be 
addressed at the upcoming OECD Guidelines review. Some participants noted that labour 
standards along the supply chain are particularly relevant in sectors such as toys, 
electronics, agriculture and cotton and that supply chain management is a way to deal with 
the issue but it is unable to resolve the lack of national institutions and processes on basic 
labour inspections.   
</p>
<p>39. Other participants raised the issue of how to conduct consultations as part of due 
diligence. Companies often choose the consultants who perform the consultations and also 
decide on the aspects of the consultations that may not correspond to the needs of the 
community. It was recommended that the Special Representative encourage companies to 
ensure that they are talking with the right people and about the right issues when 
undertaking community engagement and consultation.  
</p>
<p>40. Some participants stressed the need for the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) 
of indigenous peoples, as a precondition for business operations, especially in the mining 
sector. It was emphasized that companies should consult with indigenous people and start 
to operate only once they have their FPIC.  
</p>
<p>41. It was suggested that the notion of stakeholder dialogue should be changed to that of 
rights-holder dialogue. This is an important distinction, since stakeholders are often 
powerful groups whereas rights-holders are often the most vulnerable.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Conceptual issues and challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>42. Ebele Okobi-Harris (Director, Business and Human Rights Program, Yahoo! Inc.) 
presented the operational challenges companies may face when confronted with potential 
conflicts between national laws and international human rights norms and how her 
company has addressed those challenges. She noted that Internet communications and 
technology companies are powerful platforms that play a critical role in promoting and 
protecting the freedom of expression and privacy and, as a result, certain States try to 
control the dissemination of information. Companies therefore face a challenge because 
they, like citizens, are subject to domestic law. In response to this challenge, Yahoo! 
participated in the creation of the Global Network Initiative (GNI), which is a multi-
stakeholder dialogue in collaboration with industry counterparts, NGOs, socially 
responsible investment firms, academics and other interested stakeholders. The initiative 
created an accountability and public reporting framework that included collaborative and 
multi-stakeholder approaches to solving business and human rights issues, tools and 
guidance for companies on how to engage with communities, guidance for NGOs that wish 
to collaborate with companies, and guidance for companies on how to overcome conflicts 
between domestic law and international human rights norms. Ms. Okobi-Harris concluded 
by stressing that the option of just &#8220;leave the country&#8221; that is sometimes proposed to 
companies when they operate in situations where there is a conflict between national law 
and international human rights norms is not necessarily shared by citizens who depend on 
the services provided by IT companies, and it overlooks the challenges faced by national 
companies operating in those circumstances.  
</p>
<p>43. Mads Holst Jensen (Adviser, Danish Institute for Human Rights) discussed the 
different approaches a company may take in promoting human rights when there is a 
conflict between national laws and international laws. He suggested that a company should 
consider whether the rights at stake are fundamental, e.g. threatening physical security. If 
that is the case and if there are no national mechanisms to address the situation, the 
company should consider disinvesting if it cannot avoid being connected to a possible </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p>violation. However, outside of such situations he recommended that companies seek to 
commit themselves to fostering change. He outlined a combination of two basic 
approaches: a top-down approach whereby companies engage in a critical dialogue at the 
national, international and multi-stakeholder level, and a bottom-up approach whereby in 
their operations companies proactively build awareness and capacity to respect the human 
rights principle behind the standards conflicting with national law. Mr. Jensen concluded by 
stressing the importance of engaging with stakeholders, especially national Governments, 
to resolve the conflict between national and international law.  
</p>
<p>44. Auret van Heerden (President and Chief Executive Officer, Fair Labor Association) 
discussed ways in which companies can challenge national laws that violate fundamental 
human rights as the &#8220;art of the possible&#8221;. He described companies&#8217; practices that were 
contrary to national laws but upheld international principles in South Africa&#8217;s former 
apartheid regime. He observed that the private sector had created a post-apartheid system in 
the workplace while on a national level apartheid continued. He stressed that, for example, 
the conventions of the International Labour Organization are legal instruments with which 
companies should comply. He concluded with a provocative question asking what country 
would ever sue a multinational corporation for abiding by international conventions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussion 
</b></p>
<p>45. Some participants emphasized that companies should respect human rights, even if 
States do not.  
</p>
<p>46. Participants discussed various strategies for applying the framework for business 
and human rights when facing the dilemma of conflict between national law and 
international human rights norms. Some participants suggested that companies should: 
assess whether their current policies and activities are in line with the framework, exchange 
information on due diligence mechanisms and access to remedy, and develop good human 
rights practices. It was stressed that transparency, accountability, and multi-stakeholder 
dialogues are critical factors in the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. It was 
suggested that in the event of conflict between national and international law, companies 
should be creative and respect the principles of international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>47. Business representatives underlined that the business objectives of companies 
should be recognized. It was stressed that companies would have to comply with the core 
labour standards of the International Labour Organization but that companies should not be 
charged with public functions that pertain to other institutions and that an important goal 
for companies is to remain competitive.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Access to remedies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Judicial remedies 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>48. Audrey Gaughran (Head of Business and Human Rights, Amnesty International) 
presented the findings of an Amnesty International research project on effective remedy in 
cases of corporate-related human rights abuses and proposed some recommendations. The 
first obstacle to effective remedy appeared to be the significant influence companies exert 
in defining the legal framework for action in their favour. The second systemic obstacle is 
the lack of access to information on, for example, the social and environmental impacts of 
corporate activity or the exact cause of those impacts. She stressed that companies 
frequently, given their extensive technical knowledge, provide misleading data that </p>


<p>GE.10-12935 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>obscures the real source of the negative impacts. Lastly, the State may have a conflict of 
interest in some contexts, for example when it is a partner in the industry, or may abandon 
people to deal with and seek remedy from the company failing to comply with its duty to 
protect. Ms. Gaughran proposed that the Special Representative give detailed guidance to 
States and companies to address the systemic obstacles to effective remedies by tackling the 
issue of access to information and by recommending that some elements of human rights 
due diligence should be required by law.  
</p>
<p>49. Martyn Day (Senior Partner, Leigh Day Solicitors) gave an overview of the main 
obstacles communities face when looking for redress. He pointed out that the lack of local 
legal representation pushes the communities to seek remedy internationally through lawyers 
from the home State. Mr. Day stressed that there should be a system whereby justice can be 
brought forth simply and quickly. He added that another obstacle, in the case of 
multinationals, is the unclear relationship between parent company and subsidiaries. In 
order to facilitate access to remedy, the parent company should be considered liable for the 
activities of its subsidiaries. Finally, Mr. Day suggested that companies should be proactive 
and solve conflicts as they arise to avoid legal action and a lengthy court battle.  
</p>
<p>50. Salvador Quishpe (Saraguro Community, Ecuador) presented the difficulties that the 
indigenous people whom he represents face in Ecuador in seeking redress for corporate 
abuses. He stressed that defending the land is an integral part of defending indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights and identity. Mr. Quishpe stressed that in cases involving extraction of 
natural resources, communities have had to approach the companies involved directly and 
ask them to respect human rights and engage with the community. He noted that companies 
often have greater political influence with the State than the State&#8217;s own citizens. This was 
evident when the community asked the State for protection but the State agreed to open the 
dialogue only when, during demonstrations, a death occurred. He concluded by saying that 
free, prior and informed consent should be a condition for companies&#8217; operations.  
</p>
<p>51. Jan Eijsbouts (Former General Counsel of multinational Akzo Nobel, International 
Mediator) submitted that litigation (particularly extraterritorial) is an unsatisfactory tool for 
conflict resolution and that mediation, being mutual-interests based, is the best way 
forward. He pointed out that proactive conflict-management policies, including mediation, 
are an essential risk-management tool for responsible corporate governance, also where 
(potential) human rights issues are at stake. He supported the Special Representative&#8217;s 
stated view that companies should offer stakeholders a consensual, de-escalating and 
neutrally led professional conflict resolution method.  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussion  
</b></p>
<p>52. Some participants stated that negotiating human rights is not possible, given their 
very nature, and that mediation might not always be the best way forward. Others stressed 
that international cooperation should support rule of law, good governance and the 
development of lawyers in host States who could legally represent victims and seek redress 
on their behalf.  
</p>
<p>53. One participant brought to the general attention an example of aerial spraying of 
banana plantations in the Philippines as a case where the access to judicial remedy was 
particularly difficult. In this case, the plantation workers were provided with protection 
while the residents in nearby communities have been left unshielded. The legal and 
procedural barriers were enormous and communities could not afford the necessary legal 
and technical support to bring their case. Moreover, civil society participants stressed that 
compensation does not prevent further harm to communities and that a study on preventive 
measures should be conducted.  </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p>54. Business representatives stated that transparency is important but cannot be absolute 
since companies are also bound to commercial confidentiality. They also suggested that to 
determine a parent company&#8217;s liability, it is necessary to check whether the parent company 
is in control of the subsidiary.  
</p>
<p>55. Some participants suggested that the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank could play a role in protecting human rights. It was pointed out that the two 
institutions tend to use external debt to force poorer countries to open up their markets and 
embrace policies that can be harmful to human rights. They called for a human rights treaty 
which would be binding on companies and an international court to which victims of 
corporate-related abuses can bring their claims.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-judicial remedies 
  Summary of expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  The Tintaya Copper Mine case 
</i></p>
<p>56. Rocio Avila (Extractive Industries Program Officer, Oxfam America, South 
America Regional Office, Peru) presented the case of the Tintaya Copper Mine in Peru, in 
which the company Xstrata and the local communities had initiated a dialogue to resolve a 
long-standing conflict. The dialogue process brought about communication and trust 
between the community and the company. She also emphasized that the involvement and 
legal and technical advice of non-governmental organizations and local grass-roots 
networks were key factors that contributed to the success of the process. International 
NGOs also played a key role at the outset by raising concerns with top officials at the 
company headquarters. Ms. Avila stated that the dialogue process took a considerable 
amount of time before a consensus could be reached among NGOs, the mining company 
and the communities. It was pointed out that the Peruvian Government was not involved in 
the dialogue because there was distrust amongst the local communities towards the 
Government. Ms. Avila concluded by saying that the overall result of the dialogue was that 
it led to agreements and company policies that addressed the needs of local communities 
and fostered better relations between the company and the communities.  
</p>
<p>57. Enrique Velarde (Xstrata Peru) discussed Xstrata&#8217;s experience during the Tintaya 
dialogue and consultation process, specifically the operational mechanisms that were 
implemented, the non-participation of the State and the challenge of establishing trust 
between the parties. Mr. Velarde specified that, in order to address various issues, such as 
the expropriation of land, a consultation period was established in order to create solutions 
that were acceptable to all stakeholders. He pointed to the role of an independent 
ombudsman and stressed that it was determined by consensus that there should not be any 
State intervention. He described how the dialogue process created separate commissions for 
each issue, such as land, the environment, human rights and sustainable development. Mr. 
Velarde concluded by saying that the major challenge at the outset of the dialogue process 
was the mistrust among the parties and the major success was that this mistrust was finally 
overcome.  
</p>
<p><i>  Renegotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding between Chevron and Surrounding 
Communities in the Niger Delta 
</i></p>
<p>58. Silvia Garrigo (Manager, Global Issues and Policy, Chevron Corporation) presented 
the objects and purposes of the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMOU) between 
Chevron and the surrounding communities in the Niger Delta as an example of how a non-
judicial mechanism can be applied to address situations of conflict between a company and 
surrounding communities. The GMOU&#8217;s systematic focus on participatory partnerships, </p>


<p>GE.10-12935 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>transparency and accountability, conflict mediation, a grievance and claims process, and a 
monitoring mechanism across 425 communities is instrumental in helping communities 
which were historically in conflict with industry and themselves work together for socio-
economic progress. Ms. Garrigo explained that Chevron&#8217;s objective was that development 
in the region should be achieved <i>with</i> the people, rather than <i>for </i>the people. 
59. Austin Onuoha (Executive Director, Africa Centre for Corporate Responsibility 
(ACCR), Nigeria) highlighted some of the aspects of Chevron&#8217;s current Global 
Memorandum of Understanding (GMOU) in Nigeria from a civil society perspective. He 
emphasized that the GMOU has focused on qualitative factors, such as community 
responsibility, inclusiveness and development. He stated that the GMOU process began in 
2004, involved 5 States of the Niger Delta (425 communities) and had a strong governance 
structure and participatory partnerships. He noted that what had made the GMOU process 
successful was that it had been a flexible process that had been inclusive, sustainable and 
principles-driven. Elements to look out for in similar processes included whether there is 
explicit provision for non-judicial remedies; whether the people are aware of the 
mechanism; whether it has actually been constituted; whether the parties are using it; and 
whether the personnel have been trained in using it and had their performance evaluated.  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of discussion 
</b></p>
<p>60. Participants discussed the effectiveness of non-judicial mechanisms, such as 
dialogues between stakeholders. It was noted that dialogue processes are democratic 
processes able to bring together stakeholders with different interests. Participants expressed 
their concern over certain business practices, such as tax evasion, that occur in spite of the 
non-judicial mechanisms and dialogues in general. It was pointed out that even though non-
judicial mechanisms have been effective in many ways, there is still much to be done. It 
was also recognized that certain dialogue processes have succeeded in attaining stability in 
areas where basic infrastructure has been lacking.  
</p>
<p>61. Participants expressed the view that while non-judicial mechanisms are important, 
they are not substitutes for judicial mechanisms. It was stressed that both judicial and non-
judicial mechanisms are needed and they should be solid, independent and effective at the 
national and international level. Some participants emphasized that the scope of the right to 
remedy hinged on the State&#8217;s obligation to provide access to remedy. Similarly, it was 
suggested that there should be international redress and accountability mechanisms, since 
an international mechanism would ensure that individuals and communities could seek 
remedies, even if their home State does not provide such a mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Closing remarks by the Special Representative 
</b>62. In his closing remarks, the Special Representative expressed his gratitude to the 
outstanding set of panellists who had all made invaluable contributions to the discussion.  
</p>
<p>63. While much progress has been achieved in developing shared meanings and shared 
understandings, the process is still fragile and fluid, with even what he considered the most 
solidly based principle of the framework &#8212; the State duty to protect &#8212; being questioned by 
some Governments. This illustrates how difficult the situation is and how continued 
progress is not a given but an objective.  
</p><p>64. The Special Representative went on to outline his plans for what he wishes to 
achieve in the final phase of his mandate:  
</p>
<p> (a) Present to the HRC a set of guiding principles in relation to all three pillars of 
the framework for States and companies; </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-12935 
</p>
<p> (b) Clarify some of the key dilemmas, such as how to respect human rights in 
situations where national law conflicts with international human rights norms; 
</p>
<p> (c) Make recommendations about how to continue the work on business and 
human rights, building on the framework that has already been accepted by the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>65. Continued progress requires a clear understanding of the context within which the 
business and human rights debate is taking place coupled with a clear strategic vision. 
</p>
<p>66. In relation to context, the Special Representative said it is important to note that we 
are no longer at the crest of the latest wave of globalization. We have gone beyond it and a 
backlash has set in. Emerging powers have different views about the relationships between 
markets and authority, and they have their own traditions and policy preferences. Populism 
has re-emerged, in developed and developing countries, on the political right and left. It is 
necessary to take such factors into account when moving forward because the process needs 
the support of all Governments.  
</p>
<p>67. In relation to strategic vision, the Special Representative noted that change agents 
currently in the business and human rights domain may have various different strategic 
visions. They may all aspire to the same ultimate goal but involve different strategies to 
reach it. For example, some participants in this debate have as their main objective to 
advance the long-term promotion of international human rights law, no matter how long it 
takes. This is not necessarily the same vision held by those who wish to vindicate the rights 
of specific individuals here and now with any mechanisms available. The first category 
includes human rights organizations, law professors et al. The second includes grass-roots 
organizations and plaintiff lawyers. The Special Representative&#8217;s vision falls into yet a third 
category, which aims to reduce corporate-related abuses to the maximum extent possible in 
the shortest possible period of time. To cite but one difference among them concerning 
interim steps: effective alternative dispute resolution mechanisms play a significant role in 
the second and third visions, but they may not necessarily help &#8212; and may actually reduce 
the need for &#8212; the long-term evolution of some aspects of human rights law. It is necessary 
to be sensitive to these differences. They have nothing to do with favouring either voluntary 
or mandatory approaches, or with being bold or not; they are simply different.  
</p>
<p>68. Many views expressed during the consultation draw on different strategic concepts, 
but one needs to realize that they are not identical. For example, alternative dispute 
resolution does not necessarily help long-term evolution of human rights law. One needs to 
be sensitive to the idea of vision and strategic mission being different while in the long run 
they all have the same aim. This has nothing to do with favouring either voluntary or 
mandatory approaches, or with not being bold; it is just different.  
</p><p>69. The nature of the framework reflects the Special Representative&#8217;s strategic vision. 
There is no single silver bullet solution to the question of business and human rights. It is 
too complex and requires all of us to learn to do many things differently. This is a complex 
systems design challenge: developing the components of an interrelated, dynamic system 
and structuring them in such a way that they interact in a cumulative process to induce 
progress.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Representative expressed his firm commitment to making this task 
work. The challenge is huge; time is short but the cause is just and the word impossible has 
no meaning.  </p>
