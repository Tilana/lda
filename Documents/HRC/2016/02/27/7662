<p> <b>I. Introduction 
</b>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 68/184, in 
which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report to it at its sixty-ninth 
session, and to submit an interim report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth 
session. The report provides information on progress made in the implementation of 
resolution 68/184, focusing on the concerns identified in the resolution, while also 
highlighting issues affecting economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The report draws upon observations made by the United Nations treaty monitoring 
bodies, the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, various United Nations 
entities and international non-governmental organizations. It also refers to information from 
official State media. 
</p>
<p>3. Since the latest report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly (A/68/377), 
the Government has taken some commendable steps in the area of human rights. These 
include the release of high-profile political prisoners who had been arrested following the 
2009 post-election unrest; the reinstatement of some university students and lecturers who 
had been banned from higher education for their alleged role in the above-mentioned 
unrest; and the drafting of a Citizens&#8217; Rights Charter for public consultation. The 
Government also made pledges regarding the elimination of discrimination against women 
and ethnic minorities and the promotion of freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>4. The Islamic Republic of Iran engaged productively with the United Nations 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which reviewed the country&#8217;s second 
periodic report in May 2013. Unfortunately, the Government has not engaged substantively 
with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. No mandate holder, including the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, has 
been admitted to the country since 2005, and the number of replies to the large amount of 
communications transmitted by the special procedures remains very low.  
</p>
<p>5. The United Nations human rights mechanisms continue to raise concerns about 
amputations, floggings, increased application of the death penalty, arbitrary detention and 
unfair trials. Freedom of expression remains curtailed, with a large number of journalists 
still in prison and social media being blocked. Human rights defenders and women&#8217;s rights 
activists continue to face arrest and persecution. Women are subject to discrimination, 
entrenched both in law and in practice. Discrimination against minority groups persists, in 
some cases amounting to persecution. Lack of access to timely and appropriate health care 
in prisons remains an issue. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of the human rights situation in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights  
</b></p>
<p>6. The international community, including the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations, greeted the high turnout in the June 2013 elections. The process was, however, 
marred by the disqualification of a large number of candidates, including all women 
candidates, the reported intimidation of political activists, journalists, trade unionists and 
student activists, and restrictions on freedom of expression.1 The President made pledges 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A group of special procedures mandate holders expressed serious concerns about the large-scale 
</p>
<p>disqualification of candidates, including all women by the Guardian Council, which vets presidential 
candidates. Of the 686 individuals registered, only 8 were approved. </p>


<p>during the election campaign to address serious human rights concerns, including by 
introducing a Citizens&#8217; Rights Charter, eliminating discrimination against women and 
ethnic minorities, promoting freedom of expression and alleviating censorship. Although 
the draft Charter has been presented for public comments, it falls short of international 
human rights standards and fails to address concerns persistently raised by the United 
Nations human rights mechanisms. On 15 June 2013, the Secretary-General expressed his 
wish to engage with the President-elect and the Iranian authorities on issues of importance 
to the international community and the welfare of the Iranian people. He also expressed 
hope that the Government would take steps to fulfil the promises made by President 
Rouhani during the electoral campaign.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Executions 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Secretary-General is alarmed at the sharp rise in executions in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. The new Government has not changed its approach regarding the 
application of the death penalty and seems to have followed the practice of previous 
administrations, which relied heavily on the death penalty to combat crime. On 
11 December 2013, the chief of the judiciary noted that from a religious point of view, 
opposition to the death penalty challenges the decrees of Islam.2 In recent years, senior 
Iranian officials have acknowledged the ineffectiveness of the death penalty in addressing 
crime and suggested the need to review relevant laws. The revised Islamic Penal Code 
provides capital punishment for a wide range of offences that do not qualify as the &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221; under international law, including for drug-related offences, and retains 
stoning as a punishment.3 On 2 December 2013, at a press conference, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed alarm at the reported spike in executions 
of political prisoners, including in public, and the use of the death penalty for drug-related 
offences. She urged the Government to restrict and/or abolish the use of the death penalty 
in law and practice or to institute a moratorium.  
</p>
<p>8. An escalation in executions, including of political prisoners and individuals 
belonging to ethnic minority groups such as Baloch, Ahwazi Arabs and Kurds, was notable 
in the second half of 2013. At least 500 persons are known to have been executed in 2013, 
including 57 in public. According to some sources, the figure may be as high as 625. Those 
executed reportedly included 27 women and two children. The majority of the executions 
were carried out in relation to drug-related offences. In their comments on this report, the 
authorities attributed the increased number of executions to drug-trafficking and stressed 
that the death penalty was only considered for the most serious offences and only criminals 
that had perpetrated serious crimes were subject to capital punishment. The spike has 
continued in 2014. Over 40 persons are reported to have been executed during the first half 
of January. In a report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions expressed serious concerns about the surge 
in executions, following proceedings that did not meet international human rights standards 
on fair trial and due process guarantees, provided in article 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. He urged the Government to bring its domestic legislation 
and practice in conformity with international law.4

<p>3
 The Code provides the death penalty for adultery, incest, rape, sodomy, a non-Muslim party in same-
</p>
<p>sex relations, insulting the Prophet Muhammad and other great prophets, possessing or selling illicit 
drugs, theft for the fourth time, muharaba (enmity against God), fesad-fil-arz (corruption on earth), 
espionage and crimes against national security (A/68/377, para 14). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 A/HRC/23/47/Add.5. </p>


<p>9. On 1 November 2013, the Secretary-General expressed serious concern about the 
reported hanging of 16 people on 26 October 2013, in the city of Zahedan, and called on the 
Government to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty. The 16 individuals, 
belonging to the Baloch community, were reportedly executed in response to the killings of 
14 border guards by an armed group at the border with Pakistan. There is no reported proof 
that those executed were involved in the incident, as all 16 individuals had previously been 
tried, convicted and sentenced to death well before the incident took place. Eight out of the 
16 individuals were sentenced to death for drug-related offences. The public prosecution 
service confirming the executions stated that they were carried out in response to the 
attack.5 On the same day, Habibullah Golparipour and Reza Esmaili, both Kurdish 
prisoners, were allegedly executed after having been sentenced to death for charges 
including fesad fil-arz (corruption on earth) and muharaba (enmity against God), and for 
alleged links to the armed Party for a Free Life of Kurdistan, or PJAK.6 On 4 November, 
Shirko Moarefi, a Kurdish political and civil activist, who was sentenced to death on the 
charge of muharaba, membership of the Komalah Party, and acting against national 
security, was also executed.7  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>10. The recurrence of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, such as amputation of 
limbs and flogging remains a cause for concern. The judiciary has frequently applied 
punishments which are prohibited by the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a State party. The revised Islamic Penal 
Code provides for limb amputations for offences including muharaba and theft, and 
flogging for drinking alcohol, theft and certain sexual offences. On 7 January 2013, the 
head of the Supreme Court of the Islamic Republic of Iran defended punishments such as 
amputation, arguing that the proper implementation of Islamic law could prevent crimes. 
He stressed that amputation of the hands of a robber or of the limbs of a mohareb was in the 
interest of society and effective in crime reduction.8 On 31 July 2013, the judiciary in 
Abadan issued amputation and flogging sentences for a group of people accused of theft. 
According to the chief of the judiciary in Abadan, one of the group was sentenced to 
amputation of fingers and 99 lashes for theft and illegitimate sexual relations, whereas the 
others were sentenced to 74 lashes each for illegitimate sexual relations, along with prison 
sentences for theft.9 On 29 August 2013, a man accused of drug trafficking was publicly 
punished with 70 lashes in the city of Saveh. The General and Revolutionary Prosecutor 
announced that the accused was involved in drug trafficking.10  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Secretary-General is concerned about the lack of access to timely and applicable 
health care inside prisons and the conditions in which prisoners are held. The prison 
authorities reportedly deny health care to individuals who are in urgent need of external 
medical care. Various special procedures sent a number of communications to the

<p>Government regarding the deteriorating health conditions of prisoners, lack of medical 
attention and the risk of death faced by several prisoners. On 20 June 2013, Afshin 
Osanloo, a trade unionist, who was serving a five-year prison term, reportedly died from a 
heart attack in prison.11 On 1 November 2013, Abdolfattah Soltani went on hunger strike, 
protesting against the lack of external medical care for some prisoners. The hunger strike, 
joined by other prisoners, ended on 10 November. However, the protesters warned that they 
would resume the hunger strike if the Government maintained its refusal to grant 
specialized health care to prisoners who needed medical attention.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Restrictions on freedom of expression and opinion  
</b></p>
<p>12. The new administration has not made any significant improvement in the promotion 
and protection of freedom of expression and opinion, despite pledges made by the President 
during his campaign and after his swearing-in. Both offline and online outlets continue to 
face restrictions including closure. Individuals seeking to exercise or promote freedom of 
expression and opinion through dissenting views or beliefs continue to face arrest, 
prosecution and sanctions by the State. The 1986 Press Law, the 2009 Computer Crimes 
Law and the 2010 Cybercrime Law contain provisions which seriously limit freedom of 
expression. In his report to the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed 
serious concerns at the restrictions imposed on freedom of expression and opinion, 
including online. He noted that up to 5 million websites were blocked, including Wikipedia 
sites by topic.12 With the exception of some Government officials who have access to 
Facebook and Twitter, the general population is barred from engaging in these online 
activities. Any individual found engaged in an online activity that is considered 
inappropriate by the authorities can face arrest and prosecution.  
</p>
<p>13. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 35 journalists were held in prison 
across the country as at 18 December 2013.13 Compared to the same period in 2012, this 
number has dropped from 45, partially due to the Government&#8217;s policy of releasing some 
journalists on furlough. In December 2013, 16 Internet activists were arrested on charges of 
providing contents and developing websites for foreign elements. Some of those arrested 
were reportedly the administrators of popular cultural and social pages on Facebook. They 
had occasionally posted news about the imprisonment of political prisoners. Seven others 
were allegedly working for an Iranian website, Narenji.ir, specialized in new technology.14 
These individuals had their houses searched and personal items confiscated before being 
taken to an unknown location.  
</p>
<p>14. On 23 November 2013, judicial authorities in Rafsanjan confirmed the arrest of 
seven individuals for allegedly insulting sacred beliefs and Islamic values online and 
warned that the intelligence apparatus was monitoring the Internet closely and would take 
all possible actions to prevent certain online breaches.15 Journalists affiliated to minority 
groups and reformists also continue to face imprisonment. In November 2013, Khosro 
Kordpour and Masoud Kordpour were sentenced to six and three-and-a-half years

<p>respectively, on charges of gathering and colluding against national security and 
propaganda against the system. Their conviction was allegedly chiefly motivated by their 
work as journalists, including reporting on the human rights situation in Kurdistan 
Province.16 On 7 December 2013, Fatemeh Ekhtesari and Mehdi Mousavi, both poets, were 
arrested and transferred to Evin prison. They were allegedly incarcerated for their critical 
writing and dissenting views. They were reportedly released on bail after a month in 
detention.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>15. Since mid-September 2013, the Government has released over 80 political prisoners 
including women&#8217;s rights activists, political activists and journalists. Amongst those 
released were Nasrin Sotoudeh, an internationally recognized human rights activist and 
recipient of the European Parliament&#8217;s 2012 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought; 
Mahboubeh Karami, human rights activist and member of the One Million Signatures 
campaign; and Jila Karamzadeh-Makvandi, supporter of the Mothers of Laleh Park. The 
Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
welcomed the release of political prisoners and urged the Government to take further steps 
to ensure the release of all other political prisoners.  
</p>
<p>16. Hamid Ghassemi-Shall, an Iranian-Canadian citizen, who was arrested in May 2008 
and sentenced to death on charges of muharaba and espionage, was released on 
23 September 2013, after a retrial the previous August, when the court commuted his death 
penalty to five years of imprisonment.17 The Government also overturned the death 
sentence imposed on Saeed Malekpour, a blogger, who had been sentenced to death in 2010 
on charges of management of pornographic websites.18 The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed the commutation of Mr. Malekpour&#8217;s sentence 
and encouraged the Government to release all those held for exercising their legitimate 
rights to freedom of expression and association.  
</p>
<p>17. Despite these welcome developments, a large number of political prisoners, 
including high-profile lawyers, human rights activists, women&#8217;s rights activists and 
journalists, continue to serve sentences for charges that are believed to be linked to the 
exercise of their freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly. The Special 
Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, in his latest 
report to the Human Rights Council,19 noted that the Government, similar to those of 
several other countries, repressed peaceful assemblies because the messages conveyed did 
not please them, and their organizers and participants were often charged with sedition and 
rioting. This was the case for the two former presidential candidates, Mehdi Karoubi and 
Hossein Mossavi, who remain under house arrest for, in February 2011, staging a rally in 
solidarity with protesters in Egypt, for which they had sought permission from the 
authorities. Since their arrest, neither has been formally charged or brought before a judge 
to contest the legality of their detention. On 7 January 2014, Mohammad Javad Larijani, 
head of the High Council for Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran was quoted as 
saying that, after a prolonged wait, a dossier against the opposition leaders was being 
processed.20 On 17 January 2014, Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi, Minister of Justice, stated

<p>that the trial was not in the best interest of the Government and that they should remain 
confined.21 The Secretary-General and the special procedures have repeatedly called for the 
immediate release of the two opposition leaders, declaring their detention arbitrary and in 
violation of the international obligations and national laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.22  
</p>
<p>18. The two opposition leaders have been denied regular contacts with their relatives 
and their access to adequate medical care has been limited, despite their having serious 
health complications including high blood pressure and worsening heart conditions. The 
authorities reportedly only allow pre-approved visits from immediate family members and, 
in some instances, the security forces have allegedly physically assaulted visitors. For 
example, on 24 October 2013, the daughters of Mr. Mossavi complained of physical assault 
at the hands of security agents during a visit to their parents.23 The Secretary-General urges 
the President to consider the immediate release of the two opposition leaders, and to 
facilitate their urgent and adequate access to medical care.  
</p>
<p>19. Prominent human rights activists and lawyers, such as Abdolfattah Soltani, 
Mohammad Ali Dadkha and Mohammad Seifzadeh, are serving prison terms for charges 
that are believed to be linked to their legitimate professional work. Mr. Soltani is serving a 
13-year sentence imposed by the Revolutionary Court for establishing and managing an 
association that endangered national security, propaganda against the system, unlawful 
association and conspiracy with the intention to disturb public security, and acquisition of 
wealth through illegitimate means. The court also banned him from practising law for 
20 years. In an opinion issued on 7 August 2013, the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention found the imprisonment of Mr. Soltani arbitrary and sought his immediate 
release.24 The Working Group concluded that: &#8220;[T]he detention of Mr. Soltani is motivated 
exclusively by his human rights and/or political activities, activities constituting the 
peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which the Islamic Republic of Iran 
is party.&#8221;25 Furthermore, in November 2013, the Appeal Court upheld a one-year prison 
sentence for Ms. Massumeh Dehghan, the wife of Mr. Soltani. She was charged with 
propaganda against the system for travelling abroad and receiving the Nuremberg 
International Human Rights Award given to her husband.  
</p>
<p>20. In September 2013, the Appeal Court upheld a six-year sentence against Mohammad 
Seifzadeh, a prominent human rights lawyer and member of the Defenders of Human 
Rights Centre, founded by Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi. The sentence was initially imposed 
on Mr. Seifzadeh on charges of collusion to take action against national security and 
spreading propaganda against the system. Since 2011 Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, another 
prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Centre, has been serving a nine-year prison 
sentence coupled with a 10-year occupation ban on charges including membership of the

 Ibid. In their comments on this report, the authorities claimed that Mr. Soltani enjoyed access to legal 
</p>
<p>services and had frequent visits to medical doctors for treatment. They accused Mr. Soltani of having 
contributed to the establishment of the Society of the Defenders of Human Rights without obtaining a 
legal permit, suspicious interaction with certain foreign embassies in Tehran, receiving money from 
foreign intelligence agencies and having ties with the Mujahideen-e-Khalq organization (MEK).  </p>


<p>Centre and propaganda against the system. Stressing the important role human rights 
defenders and lawyers could make in improving human rights protection and promotion in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Secretary-General urges the Government to release human 
rights lawyers and human rights defenders and allow them to exercise their activities 
without risk to their physical and psychological integrity or any other form of restriction, 
harassment and intimidation.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Women&#8217;s political participation 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Secretary-General welcomes the Government&#8217;s efforts to appoint women to 
senior level government positions, including as Deputy President, head of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, Deputy President for Legal Affairs, head of the National 
Standards Organization, and spokeswoman for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The 
Secretary-General also welcomes the Government&#8217;s pledges to increase the number of 
women serving as ambassadors.26 However, no woman has been named to the Cabinet, 
thereby continuing women&#8217;s underrepresentation at the highest decision-making levels. The 
World Economic Forum, in <i>The Global Gender Gap Report 2013</i>, ranked the Islamic 
Republic of Iran at 130 out of 136 countries, three places down from the previous year.27 
According to the report, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the lowest female representation 
in the labour forces and the lowest estimated female income in the region. The Secretary-
General encourages the Government to adopt laws and policies that promote the 
participation of women in public, political, economic and professional life.  
</p>
<p>22. Laws that permit gender discrimination and promote violence against women 
continue to be introduced in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The revised Islamic Penal Code, 
which came into force in June 2013, retains provisions that are discriminatory towards 
women. For instance, it values women&#8217;s testimony in a court of law as half that of a man&#8217;s, 
and a woman&#8217;s life half that of a man&#8217;s. The Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
provides for the marriage of girls at age 13.28 However, with the permission of a competent 
court, girls can be married at the age of nine.29 The 2013 Family Protection Law reportedly 
allows for full or temporary marriage and legalizes polygamy.30 The Unsupervised or Ill-
Supervised Children and Youth Protection Bill, which was adopted by Parliament in 
September 2013 and came into force on 23 October 2013, allows marriage between a child 
and legal guardian31 when a child has reached maturity, and marriage with the guardian is 
in the child&#8217;s best interest. This would mean that a girl as young as nine can be married to 
her guardian, which is a threat to her physical and mental integrity and runs counter to 
fundamental human rights guarantees stipulated in the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a State party. This may also contribute to 
forced and early marriages, a phenomenon that the Islamic Republic of Iran is currently 
seeking to eradicate. In May 2013 the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights urged the Government to take measures to prevent forced, early and 
temporary marriage of girls, to ensure women&#8217;s right to employment and to remove all 
restrictions on women&#8217;s equal access to all aspects of university education.

<p><b> 7. Situation of ethnic and religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>23. There have been no improvements in the situation of religious and ethnic minorities, 
which continue to suffer severe restrictions in the enjoyment of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights. Religious minorities such as Baha&#8217;is and Christians 
face violations entrenched in law and in practice. Harassment, home raids and incitement to 
hatred are reportedly commonly applied by the authorities to suppress the Baha&#8217;i 
community. The authorities claim that ethnic minorities enjoy equal rights before the law 
and that no discrimination is practised against religious minorities. The authorities also 
declared that the new Government paid significant attention to the affairs of religious 
minorities. In this respect, the Secretary-General notes as positive information that the 
President has appointed a special assistant to address the situation of ethnic and religious 
minorities. The United Nations human rights mechanisms have repeatedly expressed 
concerns about the discriminatory laws and policies that restrict religious minorities, 
including Baha&#8217;is, from forming religious institutions and accessing universities and public-
sector employment. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran32 noted that members of the Baha&#8217;i community were increasingly 
subjected to arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, restrictions on religious practice, 
denial of higher education, obstacles to State employment and abuses within schools. He 
also reported that 109 members of the Baha&#8217;i community were being held in prisons as at 
May 2013.33 That number had reached 136 by December 2013, indicating an increase in 
their arrest and persecution. In its concluding observations, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights expressed concerns about widespread and entrenched 
discrimination against the Baha&#8217;i community, including denial of access to employment in 
the public sector and institutions of higher education, as well as to benefits of the pension 
system, and recommended a series of safeguards against legal and practical discrimination, 
including in their access to social programmes and education.34 The Secretary-General 
renews his call on the Government to release the seven Baha&#8217;i community leaders, who are 
serving 20-year sentences for managing the religious and administrative affairs of their 
community, after trials which did not meet the guarantees for fair trial established by 
international law. The Secretary-General also encourages the Government to remove 
limitations imposed on the ability of the Baha&#8217;is to worship and to allow them to practise 
their beliefs without hindrance and fear.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Refugees and migrants 
</b></p>
<p>24. The situation of Afghan refugees is of concern as was highlighted by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran in his report to 
the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.35 The Special Rapporteur noted that, as 
the Government does not recognize marriages between illegal migrants and Iranians, many 
children born out of such marriages do not possess a birth certificate and are deprived of 
educational opportunities and health care. In addition women married to illegal migrants 
cannot transfer their nationality or citizenship to their husbands or children. Afghan 
refugees are also subjected to movement restrictions and are banned from residing in 
various provinces. On 22 December 2013, the head of the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign 
Immigrants&#8217; Affairs was quoted as saying that Afghan children, who are not in possession

<p>33
 The seven Baha&#8217;i community leaders, who have been in prison since March 2008, received 20-year 
</p>
<p>prison sentences in August 2010 on charges of espionage, propaganda against the system, collusion 
and collaboration for the purpose of endangering national security, and spreading corruption on earth. 
Their sentences were reportedly reduced to 10 years the following month. However, in March 2011, 
the court reinstated the original prison sentence of 20 years.

<p>of legal documents, would not be registered in schools. Concerns further remain about the 
manner in which Afghan refugees are subjected to deportation. According to Human Rights 
Watch, thousands of Afghan refugees are arbitrarily deported, with no opportunities to 
legally challenge their deportation. Newcomers are denied the opportunity to seek refugee 
status, even if they are at risk of persecution and serious harm in Afghanistan. Some 
Afghan refugees also reportedly experienced physical mistreatment and confiscation of 
property during deportation. Families are reportedly often separated, leaving children more 
vulnerable to physical and mental abuse.36  
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>25. The Islamic Republic of Iran has made notable progress in human development. 
Having one of the youngest populations in the world (54.8 per cent of its people are 
under 30), it enjoys a demographic window of opportunity with important development 
implications. The country is also on track to achieve most of the Millennium Development 
Goals &#8211; notably Goal 1 (eradicating extreme poverty), Goal 2 (achieving universal 
education), Goal 4 (reducing child mortality) and Goal 5 (reducing maternal mortality). The 
Government is committed to reducing both income and capability poverty and the country 
has witnessed a decline in extreme income poverty (US$1 a day) to around 1 per cent, 
which was noted as positive by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
during its review in May 2013. 
</p>
<p>26. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted as positive the 
Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s significant improvement in narrowing the development gap. 
Iran&#8217;s human development indicators have substantially improved, and the human 
development index value of 0.742 for 2013 places it in the high human development 
category. This represents an average annual increase of about 1.4 per cent since 1985 
(although the human development index growth rate for the period 2000&#8211;2011 has been just 
under 1 per cent).37 Life expectancy at birth has risen for both men and women; more 
people have access to safe drinking water; maternal mortality has fallen from 150 per 
100,000 live births in 1990 to 21 in 2013;38 under-five mortality fell from 54 per 1,000 live 
births in 1990 to 22.5 in 2010; a total of 96.4 per cent39 of all births are attended by skilled 
birth attendants; and primary health-care coverage in rural areas stands at more than 98 per 
cent. 
</p>
<p>27. The Islamic Republic of Iran has made noticeable progress in women&#8217;s education 
and health. The literacy rate among women aged 15 to 24, as compared to men of the same 
age, increased from 96.1 per cent in 2000 to 99.2 per cent in 2012.40 The ratio of girls to 
boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education increased from 79.2 per cent in 1990 to 
98 per cent in 2012.41 Access of poor communities to basic services has also substantially

<p>increased: during 1991&#8211;2009 access to electricity in the poorest rural areas increased from 
66.6 per cent to 93.2 per cent and to piped water from 55.1 per cent to 83.6 per cent.42  
</p>
<p>28. Although the main components of human development have improved significantly 
in economic terms, the country still faces challenges of unemployment, low labour 
productivity growth rates and sustained income inequality.43 The Gender Inequality Index, 
as reported in the <i>Human Development Report 2013</i>, was 0.496 (ranking the Islamic 
Republic of Iran 107th). In May 2013 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights raised serious concerns about the high unemployment of women and young people, 
lack of universal health insurance coverage, high levels of poverty in certain 
underdeveloped regions, and legislation and policies on cultural freedom. 
</p>
<p>29. Much of the income and non-income poverty is in areas such as informal urban 
settlements, the informal sector of the economy, remote rural areas, among refugees, and 
encompassing groups such as people with disabilities, and female-headed households. The 
overall distribution of income constrains overall access to improved quality resources and 
services. The Gini coefficient of income inequality, for instance, has stood above 0.4 for 
many years, with significant disparities between provinces, districts, urban centres and rural 
areas recorded.44 The Government is at present seeking to reduce inequality to a Gini 
coefficient level of 0.3 by 2014, marking the end of the period covered by the fifth Five-
Year National Development Plan. 
</p>
<p>30. Disparities among provinces and between rural and urban areas persist. The 
percentage of poor underweight children under five is higher in rural areas (13.7 per cent) 
than in urban areas (9.6 per cent). Furthermore, security issues exacerbate regional 
disparities in social development. Areas bordering Afghanistan and Iraq are affected by 
drug and arms trafficking and illegal migration. Some of those areas suffer from poor 
communications and a shortage of staff in the health and welfare sectors.45  
</p>
<p>31. Women&#8217;s economic participation and employment have decreased. Only 14.5 per 
cent of the female population is economically active, of which 16.8 per cent are either 
unemployed or seeking jobs. During its review of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed serious concerns about 
restrictions on access to university education, including bans on female and male 
enrolment, limited quotas for women in certain fields, as well as gender segregation in 
classrooms and facilities. The Committee also noted with concern the low participation of 
women in the labour force, which has been further declining, and the possibility for a 
husband to prevent his wife from entering employment upon receipt of a court order under 
the Family Protection Law. The International Labour Organization (ILO) Committee of 
Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in a recent observation, 
noted with regret the Government&#8217;s inaction on repealing section 1117 of the Civil Code, 
which provides that a husband can prevent his wife from taking up a job or profession.46  
</p><p>32. The Islamic Republic of Iran is experiencing rapid socioeconomic and demographic 
changes; and in 2013 its population surpassed 75 million. According to the 2011 census, the 
annual population growth rate is 1.3 per cent, the overall sex ratio is 1.02. Among other 
factors, the expansion of health facilities, the increased literacy rate and improved living

<p>standards contributed to a rise in life expectancy for both women and men, to 73.2 and 
70.5, respectively.47 A need to absorb the younger generation into the labour market has 
placed pressure on the economy and resulted in an estimated overall unemployment rate of 
12.4 per cent (19.6 per cent for women) in 2013. Official unemployment rates are much 
higher for young people (22.3 per cent for young men, 42.7 per cent for young women early 
in 2013). The search for better job opportunities underlies the increasing challenge of 
migration and rapid urbanization among the population.48  
</p>
<p>33. The birth rate has decreased within a short time, dropping from 6.6 births per 
woman in 1977 to 2 births per woman in 2000 and to 1.8 births per woman in 2011 &#8211; that 
is, to under replacement level. Alarmed about this decrease in fertility, which is leading to 
an ageing population, the Supreme Leader encouraged families to have more children. He 
also called for mechanisms which would encourage procreation in the country. In a reaction 
to the Leader&#8217;s speech, the Ministry of Health announced that contraceptives, which used to 
be given out free of charge, would no longer be procured. 
</p>
<p>34. The Secretary-General provided a detailed account of the impact of sanctions on the 
general population in his report to the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. 
Developments regarding the recent lifting of some economic sanctions imposed on the 
Islamic Republic of Iran are being followed closely, with the hope that these steps will ease 
the impact of sanctions that chiefly affect the general population, particularly the 
distribution of medical and pharmaceutical supplies. The Secretary-General will assess 
recent developments further and will report on this in detail in his report to the sixty-ninth 
session of the Assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation with international human rights mechanisms 
and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation with the United Nations human rights treaty system 
</b></p>
<p>35. As a State party to five core international human rights treaties49 and a signatory to 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict, the Islamic Republic of Iran has improved its cooperation with 
treaty bodies in recent years. It was examined by the Committee on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination (August 2010), the Human Rights Committee (October 
2011) and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (May 2013).50 During 
the latest review, the latter Committee raised some of the same issues it had in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran&#8217;s first review, which had taken place 18 years before, noting that this had 
prevented it from maintaining a regular dialogue with the country.  
</p>
<p>36. The Secretary-General notes with regret the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s lack of 
cooperation with the Human Rights Committee, which has repeatedly sought further

<p>50
 While considering the second periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Committee noted 
</p>
<p>with regret the delay in submission of the report, following its previous consideration in 1993 and 
requested the Islamic Republic of Iran to submit its third periodic report by 31 May 2018. The 
Committee also regretted that the State party did not provide adequate responses to some of the 
questions posed by the Committee.  </p>


<p>information on the implementation of its recommendations identified in paragraphs 9, 12, 
13 and 22 of its concluding observations.51 The Secretary-General encourages the 
Government to promptly provide the information requested by the Committee and to 
engage in constructive dialogue with the treaty bodies as a critical mechanism to review 
and improve human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with special procedures of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>37. At a press conference on 2 December 2013, the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights reiterated the importance of the Islamic Republic of Iran inviting the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran for a 
country visit. The Secretary-General has echoed this call on several occasions. Since his 
appointment in 2011, the Special Rapporteur has made several official requests to the 
Iranian authorities for a country visit but has not received an affirmative response to date. 
In a letter to President Rouhani, in July 2013, the Special Rapporteur expressed hopes for a 
positive engagement on the part of the Government, including by allowing him to visit the 
country. The Special Rapporteur met with the Permanent Missions of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran to the United Nations in Geneva and in New York to discuss future prospects for 
engagement.  
</p>
<p>38. The Secretary-General regrets that since 2005, no thematic mandate holders have 
been invited to visit the Islamic Republic of Iran, despite a standing invitation issued to all 
thematic mandate holders in 2002, and a pledge to invite two such experts in 2012. He 
expresses the hope that the Government will consider scheduling visits to which it has 
agreed in principle, for the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Despite having agreed to a visit by the 
Working Group in 2004, which was delayed at the request of the Government, the 
Government has ignored five annual reminder letters requesting the rescheduling of the 
visit: in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. As of early 2014, the Government had yet to set 
a date for the visit.  
</p>
<p>39. The Secretary-General is concerned about the low rate of replies to the large number 
of communications sent to the Government by numerous mandate holders. Out of 25 
communications sent in 2013, the authorities had responded to four. The majority of the 
communications addressed concerns about torture, executions, arbitrary arrest and detention 
of journalists and human rights activists, harassment of family members of activists, 
prosecution of religious minorities, unfair trials and ill-treatment of prisoners, and denial of 
medical treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>40. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights continued to raise 
human rights concerns with Iranian officials, including in meetings with the Minister for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51
 In its concluding observations, the Human Rights Committee requested the Islamic Republic of Iran 
</p>
<p>to provide within one year further information on the specific areas of concern including inequality of 
women with regard to marriage, family and inheritance; the death penalty including executions of 
minors; and the independence of judges. Since then, the Committee has sent reminders to the 
Government in May and December 2013, but has not received any positive response. See

<p>Foreign Affairs. She also intervened with the authorities on a number of individual human 
rights cases, through private meetings, letters and public statements. These mainly related 
to the rights of women, the death penalty, and the rights to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran undertook its first universal 
periodic review on 15 February 2010. Out of 189 recommendations, it accepted 123 of 
them. While little information is available regarding progress on implementing these 
recommendations, the Secretary-General notes as positive information that the Government 
has embarked on drafting its national report on implementation of the first universal 
periodic review recommendations. As the Islamic Republic of Iran is scheduled to appear 
before the Human Rights Council in October-November 2014, for its second cycle of the 
review, the Secretary-General calls on the Government to more actively involve civil 
society actors and other relevant organizations in preparation for the review, and to seek 
assistance from the United Nations in the implementation of the review&#8217;s 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>42. <b>The Secretary-General welcomes the positive steps taken by the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, notably the release of high-profile political prisoners, 
and the reinstatement of some students and lecturers in universities. The Secretary-
General encourages the Government to build on these positive developments by 
creating space for human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists, and to release 
political prisoners, including human rights defenders and lawyers Abdolfattah 
Soltani, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah and Mohammad Seifzadeh, detained solely for 
exercising their rights to freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly.  
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The Secretary-General remains deeply troubled by reports of increasing 
numbers of executions, including of political prisoners, and continuing amputations 
and floggings. The Secretary-General reiterates his call for the Government to 
institute a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, and to prohibit executions in 
public.  
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Secretary-General urges the Government to address the concerns 
highlighted in this report, and the specific calls for action requested in previous 
resolutions of the General Assembly, as well as recommendations of various human 
rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review process  
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>Noting the positive achievements that the Islamic Republic of Iran has made 
against several economic and social indicators, the Secretary-General encourages the 
Government to continue addressing regional disparities in the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights, as well as discrimination against women and members of 
certain minorities. The Secretary-General also calls on the Government to work in 
close cooperation with civil society organizations in the follow-up and implementation 
of the May 2013 recommendations of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. He strongly encourages the Government to reach out to the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for the necessary technical 
assistance and cooperation in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>To improve human rights protection and promotion in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and with a view to strengthening a national human rights culture, the Secretary-
General urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to establish an </b></p>


<p><b>independent national human rights institution, as also recommended by the
