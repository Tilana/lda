</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
visited the United States of America from 24 January to 7 February 2011. In the present 
report, she broadly examines the situation of violence against women in the country, 
including such issues as violence in custodial settings, domestic violence, violence against 
women in the military and violence against women who face multiple, intersecting forms of 
discrimination, particularly native American, immigrant and African-American women. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur highlights the positive legislative and policy initiatives 
undertaken by the Government to reduce the prevalence of violence against women, 
including the enactment and subsequent reauthorizations of the Violence against Women 
Act, and the establishment of dedicated offices on violence against women at the highest 
level of the Executive. The Violence against Women Act has steadily expanded funding to 
address domestic violence and, with each reauthorization, has included historically 
underserved groups. 
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur did observe a lack of legally binding federal 
provisions providing substantive protection against or prevention of acts of violence against 
women. This lack of substantive protective legislation, combined with inadequate 
implementation of some laws, policies and programmes, has resulted in the continued

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, Ms. Rashida Manjoo, conducted a country mission to 
the United States of America from January 24 to February 7, 2011. The objective of this 
visit, which included meetings in Washington D.C, North Carolina, Florida, California, 
Minnesota and New York, was to examine the situation of violence against women broadly, 
including issues such as violence in custodial settings, domestic violence, violence against 
women in the military, and violence against women who face multiple, intersecting forms 
of discrimination, particularly Native-American, immigrant and African-American women. 
</p>
<p>2. In 1998, the first Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, visited eight prisons in the United States to study specifically the issue of 
violence against women in custodial settings.  This mission report examines some of the 
issues raised in the 1998 report, but it includes a broader focus on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her gratitude to the Government of the 
United States of America for the cooperation extended prior to, during and after her visit to 
the country.1 During the visit, consultations were held in Washington D.C. with officials of 
the Department of State; Department of Justice&#8217;s Federal Bureau of Prisons and Office of 
Violence against Women; the Department of Homeland Security; Department of Labor; 
Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Health and Human 
Services; Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense. The Special 
Rapporteur also met with the White House Advisor on Violence against Women and with 
members of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>4. At the local level, the Special Rapporteur met with tribal authorities in the Eastern 
Band of Cherokee Indians, North Carolina; and with state and county authorities in St. Paul 
and Minneapolis, Minnesota.   
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur visited three prisons and detention facilities managed by 
Federal and State authorities, including the Glades County Detention Centre in Florida; and 
two of the facilities visited by her predecessor in 1998, the Federal Correctional Institution 
(FCI) in Dublin, California and the Central California Women's Facility (CCWF) in 
Chowchilla. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having been granted full access to the 
Monmouth County Correctional Institution in New Jersey2 and not receiving timely 
instructions regarding her request for access to a military base3.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to her interlocutors, including state officials, civil 
society advocates, survivors of violence, and women in custody who shared their personal 
stories and experiences with her. She looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue 
with the Government and other stakeholders on the implementation of her 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>  
 1  The Special Rapporteur would particularly like to thank the government of the United States, for 
</p>
<p>agreeing to respond to the current report in a very short time frame.  
 2 A tour of the facility was offered to the Special Rapporteur, yet with no possibility of conducting 
</p>
<p>individual interviews with the inmates.  
 3 The Special Rapporteur enquired about the possibility of visiting a military base two weeks before the 
</p>
<p>mission started and reiterated the request upon commencement of the mission. She was informed that 
Department of Defense protocol was unable to accommodate the request on such short notice. </p>

<p><b> II. Manifestations of violence against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>7. Violence against women occurs along a continuum in which the various forms and 
manifestations of violence are often both causes and consequences of violence. These 
manifestations cross public and private domains and range from intimate and interpersonal 
violence to structural, systematic, and institutional forms of violence. In the interests of 
clarity, the following sections disaggregate and address the specificity of violence against 
women encountered in different contexts within the country. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking 
</b></p>
<p>8. Domestic Violence or Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive human rights 
violation that continues to affect women across the United States. According to the 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)4, in 2008 approximately 552,000 violent 
crimes by an intimate partner were committed against women. These include 35,690 rapes 
or sexual assaults, 38,820 robberies, 70,550 aggravated assaults and 406,530 simple 
assaults.5 In 2008, the rate of intimate partner victimization for women was 4.3/1000 
victimizations, whereas the equivalent rate for men was 0.8/1000.6  
</p>
<p>9. In 2007, 64% of female homicides were perpetrated by a family member or an 
intimate partner. These include a spouse or ex-spouse (24% of cases), a boyfriend or 
girlfriend (21% of cases) and other family members (19%).7 Furthermore, women were 
killed by intimate partners at twice the rate of men. In 2007 the rate of intimate partner 
homicide for women was 1.07 per 100,000, whereas the rate for male victims was 0.47 per 
100,000.8  
</p>
<p>10. The Violence Policy Center reports, that in 2008 firearms were the most common 
weapon used by men to murder women, with nearly two-thirds of the women having been  
murdered by male intimate partners. The number of women shot and killed by their 
husband or intimate acquaintance was more than four times higher than the total number 
murdered by male strangers using all weapons combined.9 In addition to domestic homicide 
committed with a gun, women also suffer &#8220;hostile gun displays&#8221; as a form of IPV by which 
abusive partners threaten to use guns against their victims.10 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. Rape and sexual assault are also prevalent forms of violence against women in the 
country. The NCVS reported 182,000 cases of women raped or sexually assaulted in the 
United States during 2008 i.e. approximately 500 women every day.  
</p>
<p>12. Stalking is a crime that targets women at higher rates than men in the United States 
and may have dangerous links with more violent crimes, such as battering, rape and 
murder. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics Supplemental Victimization Survey 
on Stalking, an estimated 3.4 million persons were victims of stalking during a 12 month 
</p>
<p>  
 4 NCVS data includes crimes that were not reported to the police.

 6 IPV is identified as violence committed by current or former spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends, and 
</p>
<p>comprises instances of non fatal violence (i.e. assault, rape, robbery), and of fatal violence (i.e. 
homicide).

</p>
<p>period in 2005 and 2006.11 Women were at higher risk of stalking than men, with 20 
victimizations per 1,000 females, as compared to 7 victimizations per 1,000 males. 
</p>
<p>13. Domestic violence is an extremely underreported crime, with victims hesitating to 
contact the authorities due to factors such as: 1) fear of retaliation from their abuser, 2) the 
perception that the police will not respond adequately to the abuse and/or 3) a feeling that 
these are personal issues that should be addressed privately.12  
</p>
<p>14. The reluctance to reach out to the police is even more entrenched among minority 
and immigrant communities, as they may view the police and the courts as oppressive, 
rather than protective institutions. For example, during interviews with survivors and 
advocates the Special Rapporteur heard accounts of disproportionate arrests of women of 
color following incidents of IPV. For instance, stereotypes about African-American women 
as being &#8220;more aggressive&#8221; sometimes lead to police officers not adequately differentiating 
between victim and perpetrator when intervening in such cases. 
</p>
<p>15. Interlocutors stated that, although every state now defines domestic violence as a 
crime, it is still not investigated or prosecuted with the same seriousness as other violent 
crimes. Furthermore, the police often fail to respond to reports of IPV and/or violations of 
protection orders, and when they do respond, they do so inappropriately. It is reportedly not 
uncommon for police officers to encourage informal resolution between the parties instead 
of arresting perpetrators. This is coupled by a failure to conduct adequate investigations 
including not enquiring about the presence of firearms, not taking photographs despite 
visible injuries of victims, and/or not enquiring about perpetrators history of abuse.   
</p>
<p>16. In relation to criminal trials, statistics reveal that alleged abusers are rarely 
prosecuted with a serious offence in domestic violence cases. A 2009 Department of Justice 
report, which reflects findings from a study of 16 large urban counties in 2002, indicates 
that 56% of intimate partner violence cases filed with the courts resulted in a conviction. 
Furthermore, only 18% of those defendants were convicted of felonies and most of those 
convictions were for a misdemeanor. A third (33%) of the cases were discontinued by the 
prosecution or dismissed by the court.13  The study also showed that conviction rates varied 
drastically depending on the location, ranging from a low of 17% to a high of 89% across 
the 16 counties.14 
</p>
<p>17. Underreporting and lack of investigation is also prevalent regarding instances of 
rape and sexual assault. From 1992 to 2000, only 36% of rapes, 34% of attempted rapes, 
and 26% of sexual assaults were reported to police. This is mainly due to perceptions of 
such victimization as a personal matter, fear of reprisals by perpetrators and lack of 
confidence in the police.15  This reluctance is further exacerbated, by inadequate responses 
in the investigation and prosecution of the crime. A study published in 2010 revealed that 
most police officers hold attitudes and opinions that undermine their ability to treat rape 
victims appropriately. Furthermore, there is reticence to changing current investigation and 
case processing methodologies.  According to the report, most law enforcement officers 
have received training on how to interview offenders, conduct forensic examinations,

<p>search for evidence, and interview witnesses. The interviewing of victims is usually done 
through inadequate adaptations of these techniques, thus resulting  in victims being 
presumed to be lying and being examined closely for evidence of this.&#8221; 16 
</p>
<p>18. Apart from the physical and psychological consequences faced by women victims of 
violence, interlocutors made reference to a wide range of subsequent obstacles faced by 
victims. In some cases, victims have been arrested, charged inappropriately and even 
wrongfully convicted as perpetrators. Women victims may have their children removed by 
child protective services and accused of &#8220;failing to protect&#8221; them from their abuser. Women 
who are wrongfully arrested during an incident of IPV might have this used against them in 
subsequent custody proceedings. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for women to be 
pressured to agree to plea bargain arrangements, or to attend dispute resolution or other 
procedures through which batterers continue to harass and intimidate them.  
</p>
<p>19. Victims of domestic violence also face grave consequences in terms of economic 
instability, loss of employment and homelessness. In some cases, victims lose their homes 
after landlords evict them, using &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; or &#8220;one strike&#8221; policies that permit the 
eviction of a tenant if any criminal activity occurs in her home. Unfortunately, in most 
cases such policies fail to distinguish between a primary perpetrator and a victim who acts 
in self-defense.  
</p>
<p>20. Domestic and sexual violence can also significantly affect the workplace, either 
because these crimes occur on the job17, or because they create problems with employers, 
i.e batterers preventing victims from going to work or harassing them on the job. This puts 
victims at risk of losing their jobs, makes them more dependent on their abusers and, 
therefore less able to escape a situation of violence. 
</p>
<p>21. Women victims of violence also face enormous challenges in terms of their sexual 
and reproductive health. Abusers usually exercise control over victims&#8217; access to 
contraception, abortion and other reproductive health services. According to the National 
Domestic Violence Hotline, 25% of 3,169 callers who participated in a recent survey, 
reported that they had experienced birth control sabotage and pregnancy coercion 18 Women 
experiencing IPV commonly also experience sexual assault, and abusive partners often 
refuse to use condoms and respond violently to women&#8217;s intentions to use contraception. 
As a result, women experiencing IPV are more likely to experience unplanned pregnancies 
and the contacting of sexually transmitted diseases. During pregnancy, women are at risk of 
escalated rates of abuse and of greater financial and emotional dependency on their abusers. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women in the military  
</b></p>
<p>22. Sexual assault and harassment of women in the military has become progressively 
acknowledged as a pervasive form of violence against women in the United States. 
Advocates report that when women join the military, they not only face the physical risks 
associated with war and combat, but also the risk of assault at the hands of their peers. 
Although sexual assault affects both military men and women, available statistics show that

<p> 17  In average, 1.7 million violent crimes occur on the job. Approximately 36,500 people each year are 
raped and sexually assaulted at work, 80% of whom are women. Detis T, Violence in the Workplace,

</p>
<p>the vast majority of victims who report tend to be women, under the age of 25, and from 
junior enlisted ranks.19  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a federal class-action lawsuit against 
Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, former Secretaries of Defense for failing to respond to 
rape and sexual assault in the ranks, failing to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators, 
and maintaining a weak judicial system. The suit also claims that rape and sexual assault 
victims were openly subjected to retaliation, discouraged from reporting the crimes and 
ordered to keep quiet and refrain from telling anyone about the criminal acts.20 
</p>
<p>24. Because most cases of sexual assault in the military go unreported, accurate statistics 
are not available. According to the Department of Defense&#8217;s (DoD) most recent anonymous 
survey, 4.4% of active duty women and 0.9% of active duty men indicated they had 
experienced an incident of unwanted sexual contact in the 12 months prior to the survey. 
These incidence rates reflect a one-third decrease for women and a one-half decrease for 
men compared with 2006 incidence rates. Of those active duty women and men who 
indicated they experienced unwanted sexual contact, only twenty-nine percent of women 
and fourteen percent of men indicated that they reported the incident to a DoD or civilian 
authority.21  
</p>
<p>25. In an attempt to remedy this, since 2005 the DoD offers a &#8220;Restricted Reporting&#8221; 
option, which allows sexual assault victims to confidentially disclose the details of their 
assault and receive medical treatment and counseling, without triggering an official 
investigative process. This has contributed to an increase in the number of reports made 
each year. On average, the Department has received more than 750 Restricted Reports 
annually since the enactment of the Restricted Reporting policy in 2005; about 15 percent 
of these reports convert to an Unrestricted Report each year at the victim&#8217;s request.22 In 
201023 the Department received 3,158 reports involving service members as either the 
subject and/or the victim of sexual assault which reflects a 2% decrease in overall reporting 
from FY09.  According to the <i>DoD FY10 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military</i>, 
despite this small decrease in reports, the trend since 2005 has been for increased numbers 
of victims to come forward each year and report the crime.24 DoD surveys support this 
increase in reporting.  In 2006, reports of sexual assault to DoD authorities accounted for 
about 7% of the sexual assaults estimated to have occurred that year, based on estimates 
derived from anonymous surveys of the active duty population.25 In 2010, reports by 
victims accounted for about 14% of the sexual assaults estimated to have occurred.26    
</p>
<p>26. In relation to sexual harassment and violence at the Military Service Academies, 
during the 2009-2010 academic program year there were a total of 41 reports of sexual 
assault, which represent a 64% increase from the 25 reports received during the previous 
year.27 The latest DMDC survey also shows that 12.9% of women and 1.9% of men 
indicated experiencing unwanted sexual contact, and 56% of women and 12% of men 
indicated experiencing sexual harassment. These results suggest that the 41 reports of

<p>sexual assault at the Military Service Academies accounted for fewer than 10% of the 
incidents of unwanted sexual contact that may have actually occurred. 28  
</p>
<p>27. Violence against women in the military is prompted by numerous factors, ranging 
from a very hierarchic and command driven structure, to a culture that promotes masculine 
traits of power and control, and a pattern of underreporting and impunity. Survivors 
explained how perpetrators often exert control over victims, and are likely to outrank them. 
If the perpetrators are in the victims&#8217; chain of command, reporting the incident can seem 
impossible and victims often feel that they need to make a choice between their military 
career and seeking justice. 
</p>
<p>28. Underreporting of sexual assault in the military is strongly linked to a military 
culture which values readiness for duty, but also poses reporting barriers, ranging from lack 
of confidentiality, fear of punishment for collateral misconduct, perceived impact on 
security clearance, and availability for deployment. Advocates reported that victims also 
fear retaliation by perpetrators because commanders often fail to protect those who report 
sexual assault.29 
</p>
<p>29. Many sexual assault cases are disposed of administratively through non-judicial 
punishment. In 983 investigations of sexual assault in 2009, 42% of perpetrators had court-
martial charges initiated, with 36% receiving non-judicial punishments under Article 15 of 
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and 22% receiving a discharge or another 
adverse administrative action.30 The low number of prosecutions is purportedly exacerbated 
by the exercise of discretion by commanders in responding to allegations.31 The Special 
Rapporteur heard allegations of commanders who took into consideration the value of the 
tasks carried out by both victims and alleged perpetrators when deciding how to address a 
case of sexual assault within their units. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the DoD 
that, overall, only 14% to 18% sexual assault cases in the United States are ever prosecuted. 
DoD rates are therefore a reflection of these low prosecution rates in the country as a 
whole. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was made aware of how sexual assault that occurs in the 
military has additional impact for Service women as compared to civilian survivors. The 
feelings of betrayal experienced by survivors are particularly intense given the high 
expectations of support and loyalty among service members, and given the strict sense of 
respect for the chain of command. One survivor described sexual assault in the military as 
equivalent to a situation of incest in which victims face the trauma of being raped by a

</p>
<p> 29 According to the 2010 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members survey, 
71% of the women who indicated they experienced unwanted sexual contact, chose not to report it to 
a DoD or civilian authority. The most frequently endorsed reasons given were the following: 1) They 
did not want anyone to know (67%), 2) they felt uncomfortable making a report (65%), 3) they did 
not think their report would be kept confidential (60%), 4) they were afraid of retaliation/reprisals

<p>31. According to the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA), Military Sexual Trauma 
(MST)32 impacts veterans in several ways ranging from mental health problems, to physical 
health symptoms and conditions, as well as difficulties readjusting to everyday life after 
discharge. The VA has identified Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, 
anxiety, adjustment and substance use disorders, as the top mental health diagnoses 
associated with MST. Among Veterans using DVA outpatient healthcare in FY 2009, 
21.9% of women Veterans and 1.1% of male Veterans screened positive for MST at some 
time. Of these Veterans with a positive MST screen, 52.3% of women and 35.3% of men 
had an MST-related mental health encounter. A substantially larger proportion of women 
and men, 69.7% and 53.1% respectively, had at least one MST-related health encounter 
(which includes both mental health and physical health encounters).33   
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women in custodial settings 
</b></p>
<p>32. The mission carried out in 1998 by the first UN Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women highlighted the main challenges faced by women in detention, particularly 
with regards to: 1) the high rates of incarceration of disadvantaged women, particularly 
racial minorities;  2) the severity of sentencing for drug-related offences and the lack of 
alternative rehabilitation programs, especially  for women with children; 3) the lack of 
gender-specific health care services including sexual and reproductive health, mental 
health, substance abuse and counseling for victims of physical and sexual abuse, 4) the 
abuse in the use of restraints; 5) the lack of minimum standards with regard to state 
practices in women&#8217;s prisons, especially as regards sexual misconduct by staff; 6) the 
privatization of prisons and the need for strict guidelines and oversight; and 7) the 
challenges of accessing legal remedies, particularly, the impact of the Prison Litigation 
Reform Act&#8217;s PLRA.34 
</p>
<p>33. While many of the abuses continue to exist today, some important gains have been 
made. Most notably, the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act (PREA), passed in 2003, which 
signaled the government&#8217;s willingness to take seriously the issue of sexual assault in 
prisons, and has led to positive changes such as increased reporting and proposed standards. 
There have also been successful lawsuits in a number of states challenging inhumane 
conditions of confinement in women&#8217;s prisons. As noted in the 1998 report, the prevailing 
attitude towards incarcerated people in the United States is punitive, although currently 
there are efforts in some states to explore alternative, rehabilitative approaches. 
</p>
<p>34. As regards the sexual abuse of women in prisons, a 2008-2009 report indicates that, 
in a 12 month period, 4.7% of women in prison had experienced sexual assault by an 
inmate and 2.1% had experienced sexual misconduct by a staff member.35 Sexual assault of 
women in prisons includes rape, non-consensual sexual acts, abusive sexual contacts, 
</p>
<p>  
 32 The VA defines MST as &#8220;psychological trauma which [&#8230;] resulted from a physical assault of a 
</p>
<p>sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which occurred while the veteran was 
serving on active duty or active duty for training&#8221;.  &#8220;Sexual Assault&#8221; is the term used by the DoD to 
denote contact sex crimes against adults. &#8220;MST&#8221; and &#8220;Sexual Assault&#8221; are two different terms which 
describe two different phenomena.

<p>sexual misconduct and sexual harassment.36 A 2009 report by the Office of the Inspector 
General found that male staff members were most often accused of sexual misconduct 
stemming from pat searches.37 Several interlocutors reported that, in the case of staff sexual 
misconduct, while forced non-consensual sex does occur, it is more common for staff to use 
their position of power to coerce sexual activity. This was confirmed during interviews with 
inmates who explained how women prisoners sometimes accept sexual advances to ensure 
their access to phone calls, visits, or basic supplies such as food, shampoo, or soap. 
Interlocutors and inmates themselves note high incidents of verbal abuse and general 
mistreatment by both male and female guards, particularly younger staff who are new.  
</p>
<p>35. Advocates conveyed how victims of sexual abuse often suffer from lifelong physical 
and mental repercussions including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and 
thoughts of suicide. In prison, the stress of the abuse can be exacerbated by the prisoner&#8217;s 
inability to escape her perpetrators and the fear of retaliation if she reports the abuse.   
</p>
<p>36. A number of additional challenges often result in tension and conflict among 
inmates and with prison staff. These include inadequate access to basic hygiene products, 
the high costs of telephone calls and, the inadequacy and sufficiency of the food served. 
This was a particular concern at the Central California Women&#8217;s Facility (CCWF) where 
interlocutors pointed out persistent deficiencies in terms of services and the hostility with 
which some guards respond to inmates. These challenges are further intensified by the 
overcrowding in the facility which was designed to hold 2,004 inmates but currently holds 
3, 686 people.38  
</p>
<p>37. Despite access to telephones, the prohibitive cost of calls impedes inmates&#8217; 
possibilities to contact lawyers and families. These were highlighted as particular concerns 
for detainees at the Glades County Detention Centre (Glades). Given the remoteness and 
geographical isolation of the facilities, telephone calls are often the only means for inmates 
and detainees to remain in contact with their family members. This is a particular concern 
for women with minor children.  
</p>
<p>38. The poor state of health care services for inmates was also flagged as a concern by 
many interlocutors. Inadequate access to health services in prison and detention facilities is 
characterized by delays, neglect, and mistreatment of inmates and detainees.39 Patients with 
chronic health concerns have complained of the long delays in seeing a doctor, intrusive 
body searches immediately upon their return from therapy, and regular indifference of staff 
to requests for special assistance. One inmate stated that she had consistently complained of 
a lump in her breast but was only examined by a doctor eight months after her initial 
complaint, and was immediately sent to surgery to have her breast removed. Interlocutors 
referenced many other examples including one inmate who waited three months to have a 
cast put on a broken arm.40  
</p>
<p>39. The inadequacy of dental health care was also raised by a number of interlocutors 
who point out that some inmates have been waiting for more than two years to see a dentist 
despite complaints of extreme discomfort and the inability to chew properly.

<p>40. Many of the women in custodial facilities also face inadequate mental health 
services. Reportedly, 60-80% of women prisoners face substance abuse problems41 but few 
received professional treatment. The mental distress of women in detention within the 
criminal justice system is further increased by the continued practice of cross-gender 
supervision and searches, the frequent lockdowns, the isolation of inmates, and the general 
aggressive climate and verbal abuse prevalent within the facilities. While efforts have been 
made to look more closely at the mental health concerns of inmates, interlocutors note a 
growing concern with the over-medication of mental health patients in some facilities.  
</p>
<p>41. At the core of these health concerns is an inadequate system which is insufficiently 
responsive to gender-specific needs,42 including the reproductive health43 needs of women, 
and is understaffed and under-resourced.44 Correctional facilities increasingly charge fees 
for medical services, posing even more challenges for inmates and potentially discouraging 
them from seeking much needed medical assistance.45    
</p>
<p>42. The 1998 mission report expressed concern about the lack of minimum standards 
and the continued practice of shackling of prisoners, including pregnant women.46 In 
<i>Nelson v. Correctional Medical Services</i>, the court held that women had a clearly 
established right not to be shackled during the final stages of labour unless there was clear 
evidence of security of flight risk.47 As at October 2010, ten States had enacted laws 
prohibiting shackling of pregnant women in custodial settings.48 Despite these 
developments, interlocutors reported that pregnant women are routinely shackled on their 
way to and from hospital and sometimes remain shackled during labour, delivery, and post-
delivery.  
</p>
<p>43. The Federal Bureau of Prisons&#8217; policy on shackling49 establishes that an inmate who 
is in labour, delivering her baby or is in post-delivery recuperation should not be placed in 
restraints unless there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate presents an immediate, 
serious threat of hurting herself, staff or others, or there are reasonable grounds to believe 
the inmate presents an immediate and credible risk of escape that cannot be reasonably 
contained through other methods. With regard to immigration detention, current draft 
policy50 dictates that without extraordinary circumstances that render restraints absolutely 
necessary, a pregnant woman in ICE facilities shall not be restrained. The Rapporteur was 
even informed that, when possible, aliens who are pregnant and subject to removal are 
typically released on bond, orders of recognizance or supervision, or are enrolled into an 
alternative to detention program.  
</p>
<p>44. Nevertheless, advocates state there is insufficient evidence that these policies are 
adequately enforced or implemented in practice. The DHS informed the Special Rapporteur

<p>that ICE is in the process of finalizing its policy on detention standards, yet advocates have 
expressed concerns regarding the real enforceability of such standards if they are not 
promulgated as regulations. They have also stressed that these standards must be part of a 
broader transition to a civil detention system.51  
</p>
<p>45. An underlying problem identified during the mission is the general over-
incarceration of women, commonly for non-violent or drug related crimes.52 A 1997 study 
by the U.S. Department of Justice found that women were over-represented among low 
level non-violent drug offenders; they had minimal or no prior criminal history; and were 
not principal figures in criminal organizations or activities. Nevertheless they received 
sentences similar to &#8220;high level&#8221; drug offenders under the mandatory sentencing policies.53 
Furthermore, following the introduction of mandatory sentencing in federal drug laws in the 
mid-1980s, the number of women in prison has risen by 400%, mostly non-violent first-
time offenders.54 This rapid increase has resulted in overcrowding in many facilities, 
thereby creating an environment which is ripe for violence. 
</p>
<p>46. Another concern is the disproportionate impact of over-incarceration of African-
American and immigrant women. More than one million women are currently under the 
supervision of the criminal justice system in the United States with African- American 
women being the fastest growing population in prison.55.African-American women 
represent 30% of all women incarcerated under state or federal jurisdiction, and Hispanic 
women represent 16%. The possible causes for racial disparity are complex and varied but 
many interlocutors criticized criminal laws with mandatory sentencing provisions which 
have a disparate impact on certain racial groups.   
</p>
<p>47. A major factor pushing the high numbers of detained women is the rapidly growing 
detention of individuals without valid immigrant status who are in custody of U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).56 These include certain arriving asylum 
seekers and other undocumented immigrants in removal proceedings, including immigrants 
who are inadmissible or deportable based on convictions for certain crimes or due to 
terrorism-related activity. The detained population of individuals in administrative 
detention is now over 29,000 nationwide, up almost 50% from 2005.57  
</p>
<p>48. Most of the women interviewed at Glades had been arrested on minor charges and 
were held in immigration detention, awaiting deportation. Many were legal residents who 
had been convicted of drug related offences and faced the possibility of removal from the 
country, due to immigration laws. Although immigration detention facilities are civil and 
administrative forums, many function similarly to punitive correctional facilities in terms of 
confinement and isolation practices. Among the concerns of immigration detainees are 
access to state-sponsored legal aid; separation from families, especially minor children; 
access to health care services; access to interpreters; and the lack of opportunities for

<p>employment and education while in detention.58 At Glades, many immigrant detainees 
considered that they were not given opportunities for employment and education due to the 
likelihood of their early deportation. Officials noted that the average stay of a detainee is 30 
days (56 days for field cases).However, many of the detainees had been in the facility for 
several months with very little to occupy them, due to their ineligibility for employment or 
educational opportunities.    
</p>
<p>49. Incarcerated women face particular challenges relating to separation from their 
children, as they are more likely than male prisoners to be primary caretakers. Furthermore, 
the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) enacted in 1997 facilitates the easy 
termination of parental rights of mothers whose children have been placed in foster care for 
more than 15 months. Additionally, the Act provides bonuses to States that increase their 
adoption rate and allows States to by-pass the &#8216;reasonable effort&#8217; to reunite children with 
their biological parents in certain circumstances.59Even if custody is maintained, prisons 
make it difficult for women to visit with their children and infants. As mentioned above, the 
remoteness and geographical isolation of the facilities, and the high cost of telephone calls 
impedes the ability of inmates to maintain regular contact with their family. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women who face multiple forms of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>50. Not all women in the United States experience violence with the same frequency or 
intensity. Although violence against women cuts across gender, race, and immigration 
status, it has a particularly pernicious effect on groups that lie at the intersection of these 
categories. In 2008, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that 
racial, ethnic and national minorities were disproportionately concentrated in poor 
residential areas with sub-standard housing conditions, limited employment opportunities, 
inadequate access to health care facilities, under-resourced schools and high exposure to 
crime and violence. The Committee expressed its concern about the incidence of rape and 
sexual violence experienced by women belonging to racial, ethnic and national minorities.60  
</p>
<p>51. Combinations of poverty, age, employment status, residence, and social position &#8211; 
and not race or culture per se &#8211; may explain the higher rates of abuse among African-
American, Native-American and immigrant communities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. African-American women 
</b></p>
<p>52. Due to their historical treatment in the United States, African-American women 
experience unique socio-economic and cultural pressures that contribute to higher rates of 
discrimination and violence than other women. They experience intimate partner violence 
at rates 35% higher than their White counterparts and 2.5 times the rate of men and other 
race groups.61  
</p>
<p>53. Although African-American women comprise just 8% of the U.S. population, in 
2005 they accounted for 29% of all female victims of intimate partner homicide.62 In such

<p>cases where the weapon was identified, 54% were killed with guns.63  Where the 
relationship between the victim and the murderer could be determined, over 90% knew the 
male killer; 60% of the victims were wives, common-law wives, ex-wives, or girlfriends of 
the offenders.64  Where the circumstances could be ascertained, 91% of the killings 
happened during an argument, and not in conjunction with another crime.65 
</p>
<p>54. There are many factors that prevent African-American women from reporting or 
leaving abusive partners.   Because her partner is also a &#8220;victim&#8221; of a racist system, some 
African-American women may see their abuser&#8217;s behavior as a display of anger stemming 
from their frustration of living in such a society.66  African-American women may also feel 
a sense of racial and cultural &#8220;loyalty&#8221; to hold their families together, even if it means 
staying in an abusive relationship.67 Also, if their abusers are arrested, they may feel guilty 
for subjecting their mate to an institution they perceive as racist.68 Their religious faith and 
cultural beliefs may also keep some African-American women from reporting abuse. They 
might feel the need to &#8220;impart goodness and mercy&#8221;69 on their abuser and refuse to do 
anything they feel will hurt their partner, such as leaving them or going to the police. 
</p>
<p>55. Racial profiling by law enforcement in the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; is a prominent issue for 
African-American women. The exercise of discretion by law enforcement officials  permits 
officers to decide on arrests  as to who may be carrying drugs or committing crimes, which 
leads to racial disparities in rates of prosecution and arrest of women.70  A National 
Institute of Health study found that even though white women and Latinas were more or as 
likely as African-American women to report using drugs at least once in their lives,71 
incarceration rates for African-American women (mostly for drug crimes) was double that 
of women of all races.72 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Immigrant and undocumented women 
</b></p>
<p>56. A 2004 study in New York City found that 51% of intimate partner homicide 
victims were foreign-born, while 45% were born in the United States.73 Married immigrant 
women experience higher levels of physical and sexual abuse than unmarried immigrant 
women.74 
</p>
<p>57. In addition to IPV, undocumented immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to 
violence in the workplace. The Special Rapporteur heard testimonies of women who not 
only faced unfair working conditions as undocumented workers, but also sexual harassment

</p>
<p>and abuse from their employers.  Complaints about their working conditions often resulted 
in threats of losing their jobs or being reported to immigration authorities. Other 
vulnerability factors include language barriers and the lack of knowledge by such women of 
the rights and remedies available to them. 
</p>
<p>58. Immigrant women often suffer higher rates of battering as they have less access to 
legal, social and support services. Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee may not 
have access to bilingual shelters, financial assistance, or food. It is also less likely that they 
will have the assistance of a certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the 
police or a 911 operator, or in acquiring information about their rights and the legal 
system.75 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur heard testimonies of undocumented immigrant women who 
were partners of US citizens who had never married them or legalized their status. Most of 
these women have children who are American citizens. When facing abuse by their 
partners, these women hesitated in seeking assistance from the authorities as they feared 
deportation, given their lack of immigration status. They are usually isolated from family 
and other support systems, and more economically dependent on their abuser than other 
victims.  
</p>
<p>60. Although an abused woman who is married to a citizen or a permanent resident is 
entitled to receive permanent status, abusers often do not initiate this process - as a way to 
maintain their power and control over these women.76 Other ways of control include 
threatening to call immigration authorities and having the victim deported if she decides to 
leave or does not obey the abuser; convincing the victim that the police and other 
community services will contact the immigration authorities if she seeks help; convincing 
the victim that her children will remain in the country with the abuser if the victim is 
deported; making the victim believe that she will be charged with abandoning the home if 
she leaves her abuser, and then face legal repercussions; and keeping all of her relevant 
papers, including immigration papers, out of her reach. 77 
</p>
<p>61. Immigrant women in the United States are usually women of diverse ethnic 
backgrounds, who do not speak English as their first language and who are at the 
intersection of many manifestations of discrimination such as sexism, racism and classism. 
This discrimination might also be exacerbated by immigrant women&#8217;s low education, 
language and literacy skills or economic status. Therefore, when facing violence and abuse, 
many immigrant women are often unaware of the protections available to them, and they 
are fearful that they or their family members will be deported, or will suffer criminal 
consequences as a result of reporting violence to the police.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Native-American women 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur received numerous reports on the prevalence of domestic 
violence and sexual assault against Native-American women and how violence against 
them exceeds that of any other population in the country. According to congressional 
findings, 34% of Indian and Alaska Native women will be raped in their lifetimes and 39% 
of them will be subject to domestic violence.78 The rate of violent victimization of

Caucasian women.81 Between 1992 and 2001, white or African-American offenders 
committed 88% of all violent victimizations against Native-Americans.82 With regard to 
rape or sexual assault, 86% of American Indian/Alaska Native survivors reported that 
perpetrators were white or African-American.83 
</p>
<p>63. The prevalence of violence within Indian territories is strongly linked to the poverty 
and exclusion that Native-Americans have historically endured. In his 2009 mission report, 
the Special Rapporteur on Racism made special reference to the situation of Native-
Americans and historical discrimination. He highlighted the dire socio-economic conditions 
they face and the difficulties in preserving their cultural heritage. In 2007, 25.3% of 
American Indian and Alaskan Natives lived below the poverty level and they faced an 
unemployment rate of 12.6%.84  
</p>
<p>64. Another fundamental cause of these high levels of violence are the jurisdictional 
restrictions faced by Indian tribes stemming from legislation such as: 1) the Major Crimes 
Act of 1885, by which Indian nations have to share criminal jurisdiction with the federal 
government to prosecute certain crimes committed by Indians, including rape and murder; 
2) Public Law 53-280 of 1953, by which some state governments obtained criminal 
jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed on Indian lands; and 3) the Indian Civil Rights 
Act of 1968, which limits tribal sentencing authority over Indian perpetrators on their own 
lands. Reportedly, this complex jurisdictional arrangement causes confusion over who has 
the authority to respond to, investigate, and prosecute violence against Indian women.  This 
results in many violent crimes never being prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>65. Furthermore, tribal criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians is 
denied due to a limitation imposed by the United States Supreme Court in the 1978 
<i>Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe</i> decision.85 The Oliphant decision removed the ability of tribal 
governments to prosecute and impose criminal sanctions on non-Indians for crimes such as 
domestic and sexual violence. The de facto consequence is that Indian tribes can detain a 
perpetrator, but must then transfer him to a state or federal law enforcement agency. If this 
agency refuses to take custody or prosecute, the offender will be released. This has a 
particularly negative effect on Native women&#8217;s access to justice - given that the great 
majority of perpetrators of violence against Native-American women are non-Native.  
</p>
<p>66. Coupled with the jurisdictional restrictions, is the failure of federal and state 
authorities to effectively police and prosecute violent crimes. According to a 2010 report by 
the Government Accountability Office, U.S. attorneys declined 50% of cases from Indian 
reservations from 2005 through 2009.86 Furthermore, declination rates tended to be higher

</p>
<p><b> III. State response to violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Developments and challenges in the legislative framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Violence against Women Act (VAWA)  
</b></p>
<p>67. In recognition of the severity of the crimes associated with domestic violence, sexual 
assault and stalking in the United States, and following a 1993 U.S. Senate finding that 
&#8220;gender-based crimes and fear of gender-based crimes restricts movement, reduces 
employment opportunities, increases health expenditures, and reduces consumer spending, 
all of which affect interstate commerce and the national economy&#8221;88, the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA) was passed in 1994. Enacted as part of the Violent Crime Control 
and Law Enforcement Act89, VAWA significantly strengthened the criminal justice 
system&#8217;s response to issues of violence against women by, among other things, creating 
new felonies, compelling state and municipal jurisdictions to enforce protection orders, and 
helping undocumented immigrants who rely on abusers to obtain lawful immigration 
status.90 VAWA programs are funded through annual appropriations for both the 
Departments of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 91 
</p>
<p>At inception, it has included $1.6 billion in federal funding to improve law enforcement, 
victim services, research, and other programs related to issues of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>68. The reauthorization of VAWA in 2000 improved protections for battered 
immigrants, sexual assault survivors, and victims of dating violence; enabled victims that 
flee across state lines to obtain custody orders without returning to their jurisdictions and 
improved the enforcement of protection orders across state and tribal lines. The 2005 
reauthorization of VAWA, created new programs on court training and child witnesses, as 
well as culturally specific programs. It also introduced housing provisions to protect victims 
of IPV from evictions.92 
</p>
<p>69. VAWA aims to address the high incidence of violence against women. It has 
steadily expanded funding to address domestic violence and with each reauthorization has 
included historically underserved groups, such as Native-American women. Although 
VAWA&#8217;s intentions are laudable there is little in terms of actual Federal substantive 
protection or prevention for domestic violence. This has been further exacerbated by 
jurisprudence emanating from cases such as <i>DeShaney</i>, <i>Morrison</i> and <i>Town of Castle Rock</i>.

<p>70. The 1994 version of VAWA authorized lawsuits in federal courts against those who 
committed gender based violence, providing battered women with a federal remedy against 
perpetrators of violence. Unfortunately, in 2000 the Supreme Court invalidated this portion 
of VAWA in <i>United States v. Morrison</i>, holding that Congress did not have the authority to 
create such a cause of action as part of its power to regulate interstate commerce under the 
United States Constitution or its general police power.93 In 2005, in <i>Town of Castle Rock v. 
Gonzalez</i>, the Supreme Court also ruled that the United States Constitution provides no 
remedy for a state&#8217;s failure to enforce a domestic violence restraining order, and thus 
protect victims of gender-based violence.94 <i>Castle Rock </i>was preceded by <i>DeShaney v. 
Winnebago Dep&#8217;t of Soc. Servs</i>., where the Supreme Court found that the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide a remedy when state actors fail to 
take reasonable measures to protect and ensure a citizen&#8217;s rights against violations by 
private actors. 95  
</p>
<p>71. The effect of these cases is that even where local and state police are grossly 
negligent in their duties to protect women&#8217;s right to physical security, and even where they 
fail to respond to an urgent call, there is no federal level constitutional or statutory remedy. 
It has been argued that without any solid and binding national scheme at the federal level, 
mandating legislation and also training programs, there is little protection afforded for 
domestic violence victims in various jurisdictions, and many women in different parts of 
the country continue to suffer from inadequate protection.96 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) 
</b></p>
<p>72. In terms of violence against Native-American women, Congress recently enacted the 
Tribal Law and Order Act, which attempts to establish federal accountability for the 
investigation and prosecution of crimes committed on tribal lands and which provides tribes 
with additional tools to combat crime locally. The act increases from one to three years the 
sentencing limitation imposed upon tribal courts through the Indian Civil Rights Act of 
</p><p>1968. This Act has the potential to decrease violence against Native-American  women, not 
only by allowing increased sentencing authority over  Native perpetrators, but also by 
requiring federal prosecutors to share information on declinations of Indian country cases, 
where the perpetrator is non-Native. TLOA also requires more cooperation among tribal, 
state, and federal agencies.   
</p>
<p><b> 3. The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and the Prison Litigation ReformAct 
(PLRA) 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) aims to reduce prison rape 
through a &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policy, as well as through enhanced research and information 
gathering. It requires yearly surveys of sexual assault in correctional settings across the 
country, creates a national clearing house with information and assistance to authorities

rights violations by the local police for failing to protect the victims, and human rights violations by 
the U.S. courts, for failing to provide remedy.  A decision from the Commission is expected in 2011.

</p>
<p>about prevention, investigation and prosecution, and provides substantive funding yearly 
for policy improvement at the State level.97   
</p>
<p>74. PREA established the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (NPREC) to 
carry out a comprehensive study of the penological, physical, mental, medical, social, and 
economic impacts of prison rape and to recommend national standards for improvement. 
The Commission released its recommendations in June 2009 and the Department of Justice 
has subsequently drawn on them to develop national standards for combating sexual abuse 
in confinement settings. The Department&#8217;s national standards were released for public 
comment in January 2011.98  
</p>
<p>75. Despite the positive aim of PREA, the Act is limited as it does not create a private 
action that can be enforced in courts. Rape and sexual assault cases mentioning PREA have 
been summarily dismissed on the &#8216;no private right of action&#8217; ground.99 This lack of remedy 
from the courts or any direct sanctions, except perhaps decreases in federal funding, 
highlights the limitations of PREA as an instrument to prevent and protect against acts of 
rape and sexual assault in custodial settings and to address root causes of the problem.   
</p>
<p>76. Furthermore, PREA prohibits the establishment of national standards that would 
impose substantial additional costs to Federal, State and local authorities.100 This restriction 
may hinder the allocation of resources to programs aimed at detecting, preventing, reducing 
and punishing rape and sexual abuse in confinement settings. A 2010 study commissioned 
by the Department of Justice emphasized both the economic and the non-quantifiable 
benefits to be gained by eliminating rape and sexual abuse in custodial settings, and 
suggested that both should be considered in finalizing national standards for prison rape 
elimination.101  
</p>
<p>77. Reportedly, incarcerated women also face persistent obstacles due to the Prison 
Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) of 1995. The Act limits the possibility of prisoners to 
receive redress for instances of sexual abuse and impedes their right to file a claim for acts 
of sexual assault and abuse perpetrated against them. The Act denies equal access to the 
courts to the more than 2.3 million incarcerated persons.102 
</p>
<p>78. The provisions of the Act that are most restrictive are those that require the inmate to 
exhaust all internal prison grievance systems prior to submitting a claim to court and also to 
prove physical injuries. The exhaustion requirement forces victims to report up the chain of 
command and possibly even to the person who is victimizing them, thus creating an 
obvious fear of retaliation and a reluctance to report abuse. Additionally, victims must file 
complaints within a very short period of time following the injury, as specified by the 
internal regulations of prisons.103 The physical injury requirement places a bar on claims for 
</p>
<p>  
 97 The statute requires the U.S. Attorney General to adopt a final rule creating national standards based 
</p>
<p>on these recommendations; the rule will be automatically binding on the BOP, and each state will be 
required to comply with the rule or risk losing 5% of federal funding designated for criminal justice 
activities.

<p>non-physical injury such as sexual harassment, threats of assault or groping.104 
Furthermore, the PLRA caps attorney&#8217;s fees in prison litigation. This is a disincentive for 
competent attorneys who would like to take on such cases.105  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur is aware that several attempts have been made to amend the 
PLRA, most recently through the 2007 proposed bill to enact the Prison Abuse Remedies 
Act. The Act would have eliminated the three main bars to bringing a claim under PLRA as 
discussed above.106  
</p>
<p><b> B. Developments in the institutional and policy framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Investigation and prosecution of domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>80. Domestic violence has increasingly been recognized as an issue that goes beyond the 
private sphere and that requires the intervention of the State. Therefore, legislation has been 
developed at federal, state, and local level to offer certain legal remedies to victims of 
domestic violence and to introduce mechanisms for adequate police response in domestic 
violence emergencies. Most of these provisions have been provided at the state and local 
level, through measures such as civil protection orders, mandatory arrest policies, 
mandatory prosecution policies, and treatment programs for abusive partners.   
</p>
<p>81. Civil protection (or restraining) orders are generally available on an emergency basis 
through a simple application to a court, and can be obtained without the help of an attorney. 
Civil protection orders can include provisions relating to contact with the victim, exclusion 
of the perpetrator from the home, and custody, visitation and child support obligations, if 
relevant. A violation can result in civil and/or criminal penalties.  
</p>
<p>82. Some States have enacted mandatory arrest (or pro-arrest) laws, requires police 
officers to make an arrest when someone has engaged in a domestic violence crime or has 
violated a protection order. The Special Rapporteur was informed that these measures, 
which are intended to reduce police discretion in responding to domestic violence, were in 
many cases adopted to comply with some of the grant conditions applicable to VAWA.  
</p>
<p>83. Mandatory criminal prosecution of abusers constitutes another measure to provide 
safety to victims of domestic violence and to ensure that cases of domestic violence are not 
dismissed. The implementation of mandatory prosecution policies has led to increases in 
guilty pleas and convictions, as the law allows for prosecutions even when a victim is 
unwilling to participate in court processes. The Special Rapporteur received reports 
indicating that many domestic violence cases do not result in the conviction of the abuser 
but are plea-bargained i.e. charges are dismissed if batterers comply with some minimal 
restrictions, which can include entering into treatment programs.  
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur visited the Hennepin County Domestic Abuse Service 
Center in Minnesota, which offers services to victims of domestic violence. An innovative 
feature of this center is that it houses, in the same building, several state and non-state 
agencies that help victims during the entire judicial process. Advocates at the Center not 
only help victims complete the necessary paperwork to request a Protection Order and 
explain the civil and criminal court process, but they also accompany victims to court, help 
them create safety plans for themselves and their families, assist in finding shelter or 
temporary housing, and refer them to other resources and service providers.

</p>
<p><b> 2. Addressing sexual violence in the military 
</b></p>
<p>85. In 1964 the Equal Opportunity complaint system was introduced, allowing service 
members to submit complaints about discrimination and sexual harassment. The findings of 
the 2004 DoD Care for Victims of Sexual Assault Task Force107, led to the creation of the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) in 2005, and the establishment of 
new policies (DoD Directive 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) 
Program and DoD Instruction 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program 
Procedures), with the aim of preventing sexual assault, improving the responsiveness to 
such crimes, and ensuring system accountability. 108  
</p>
<p>86. SAPRO provides for the establishment of Sexual Assault Response Coordinators 
(SARCs) and Victim Advocates (VAs) who are responsible for ensuring that medical, 
counseling and legal support services are available for victims of sexual assault. As part of 
the SAPR Policy, reports on sexual assault in the Military Services and on sexual 
harassment and violence at the US Military Academies are presented annually before 
Congress. Furthermore, in 2009 the Department initiated the development of the Defense 
Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) to improve data collection, analysis, and case 
management.109 
</p>
<p>87. Within the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA), the MST Support Team is an 
advisory group established to conduct national monitoring of MST screening and MST-
related treatment, to coordinate national MST-related education and training, and to 
promote best practices in the field. MST-related treatment is delivered across all Veteran 
Health Administration (VHA) facilities in a range of clinics and settings and by a variety of 
mental and physical health providers.  For example, in FY 2009, 14,194 mental health 
professionals provided a total of 470,238 MST-related mental health care visits to Veterans 
with positive MST screens. 
</p>
<p>88. Every Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) has a designated MST Point of 
Contact who monitors and ensures that national and VISN-level policies related to MST are 
implemented at facilities within the VISN. Furthermore, all VA Medical Centers have a 
designated MST Coordinator who serves as a local point person for MST issues and 
ensures implementation of national and VISN-level policies related to MST. 
</p>
<p>89.   The DVA mandates MST universal screening for all patients and in 2009, 21.9% of 
women veterans and 1.1% of men veterans who chose to seek DVA healthcare services 
screened positive for MST. 110  
</p>
<p>90. The process of claiming benefits for service related injuries or conditions is 
cumbersome and does not consistently take into account MST, given the difficulties of 
substantiating such experiences. Veterans interviewed noted that while DVA health 
services are provided without having to substantiate MST, the quality of the services is a 
concern. Also they suffer further sexual harassment and face a general hostile environment 
when seeking to utilize those services. Although the number of women Veterans using 
these medical services is rapidly growing, currently only 16% of veteran women use these 
medical services. 111  Interviewed veterans claimed that women prefer to access the private 
medical sector when possible.

<p><b> 3. Addressing women&#8217;s conditions in custodial settings 
</b></p>
<p>91. While much work remains to ensure greater protection of the rights of women in 
prisons and detention facilities, the Special Rapporteur noted some initiatives to create safe 
and productive conditions of confinement. The work program in Dublin, particularly the 
telemarketing training facility, could be considered a model program to equip inmates with 
marketable skills for reintegration into society. The mother-child and the drug rehabilitation 
programs are also forward-looking initiatives to allow mothers to continue to have positive 
interactions with their children while serving their sentences and to help women address 
their trauma and addiction concerns. Furthermore, the athletic and gardening programs 
were seen as positive in restoring the health and well-being of the inmates.  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of three BOP programs which support 
the mental health needs of female detainees: 1) The Resolve Programs for female offenders 
include evidence-based psycho-educational and cognitive-behavioural treatment groups for 
female offenders suffering from trauma-related mental illnesses; 2) the FCI Danbury, CT, 
has a specialized residential mental health program which targets the needs of seriously 
mentally ill female offenders and 3) the Dual Diagnosis Residential Drug Abuse Program is 
designed for inmates who have a substance abuse diagnosis and a major mental illness or 
serious medical condition. Additionally, basic outpatient mental health services are 
available in all Federal female institutions and one inpatient mental health services is 
available at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) Carswell in Texas.  
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the positive achievements introduced at CCWF 
since the visit of her predecessor in 1998 including the gender-responsive rehabilitation 
initiatives outlined in the State Master Plan for Female Offenders, the inmate appeals 
process to foster accountability and respond to allegations of abuse, and a number of 
educational and vocational training programs introduced to reduce recidivism. The latter 
allow female inmates to go through a classification process which identifies the programs 
that will best suit them to ensure they have the opportunity to attain the marketable skills 
for reintegration into society. The Rapporteur was also informed of the Community 
Prisoner Mother Program (CPMP), which is run by the California Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).  
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur found fewer rehabilitative programs in the Glades County 
Detention Centre, which is used primarily as a temporary housing for federal immigration 
detainees, with an average stay of 30 days. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Addressing violence against African-American women 
</b></p>
<p>95. In 2003, the Safe Return Initiative (SRI) 112 was created by the Department of Justice 
Office on Violence against Women in conjunction with the Institute on Domestic Violence 
in the African-American Community (IDVAAC).113  The program provides domestic 
violence services and support for African-American families who have an intimate partner 
returning home from prison.114  Some of the services provided are training law 
enforcement, church leaders, employment specialists, domestic violence workers etc on 
domestic violence in the African-American community; encouraging a community-based

</p>
<p><b> 5. Remedies available for undocumented and immigrant women victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p>96. Currently, three protective avenues exist for immigrant women who are victims of 
violence. Victims of domestic violence who are the child, parent, or current/former spouse 
of a United States citizen or a permanent resident and are abused by that person may be 
eligible to apply for a green card without needing the abuser to file for immigration benefits 
on their behalf. VAWA created this self-petitioning provision of the law.  VAWA also 
created the T nonimmigrant visa and U nonimmigrant visa. The T visa is a form of 
immigration relief that provides status to victims of human trafficking, enabling them to 
live and work in the United States as well as bring certain family members to the country.  
In order to be eligible for a T visa, a victim must show cooperation with law enforcement 
requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution.  Minor victims and victims who 
have suffered severe trauma are exempted from this requirement. The U visa is a 
nonimmigrant status that affords protection to undocumented victims of certain crimes.  It 
was created to facilitate the reporting of crime to law enforcement by a population known 
to underreport crime victimization due to immigration issues.  The discretionary granting of 
such a visa does not require that a victim or perpetrator be in legal immigration status. The 
applicant must be a victim of qualifying criminal activity and have suffered substantial 
physical or mental abuse as a result of the crime, possess credible and reliable information 
about the qualifying criminal activity, and be helpful to the investigation and/or prosecution 
of that qualifying criminal activity. Domestic violence is one of these qualifying criminal 
activities and reportedly, one of the top crimes immigrants petition for.   
</p>
<p>97. Advocates reported that even when women manage to get a self-petitioned visa 
process under VAWA approved, they still might have to wait for years before receiving 
their legal permanent residency. According to the DHS, this wait is due to the physical 
presence period that is required by law prior to an adjustment of status to lawful permanent 
residency and to statutory annual quotas for becoming an immigrant. The possibility of 
applying for a U-visa is a positive step forward to address these cases, but there are still 
challenges relating to implementation, and also raising awareness among individuals who 
might be eligible, including undocumented immigrant women. 
</p>
<p>98. Another concern that was consistently shared by survivors and advocates was the 
negative effect that initiatives such as the Secure Communities Program have had on 
immigrant women. The Secure Communities Program requires local governments and 
police to share information with the federal government and the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS). According to advocates, this information exchange enables the DHS to 
target undocumented immigrants or resident immigrants who are not yet citizens, and make 
them deportable for committing minor offenses. This is as a result of new legislation that 
increased the types of criminal offenses for which immigrants can be deported. Such 
initiatives make immigrant women more vulnerable to abuse, as attempts to stand up for 
their rights, are countered by threats to report them to immigration.  
</p>
<p>99. Advocates argue that certain policies and programs have been fuelled by racial 
profiling, leading to the criminalization of people that do not pose a real threat to the 
security of the communities. This was confirmed during interviews in detention centers 
where the Special Rapporteur heard accounts of women who had been tricked or coerced 
into keeping or carrying drugs and are now serving sentences prior to their deportation.

<p><b> 6. Addressing violence against Native-American women 
</b></p>
<p>100. While visiting the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the Special Rapporteur 
observed an example of the infrastructure that some tribal justice systems have developed 
to provide safety to women within their jurisdiction, including dedicated codes to address 
domestic violence. 116 They have supported training of personnel of tribal law enforcement 
authorities, tribal courts, prosecutors and probation officers. Tribal courts have also ordered 
that offenders enrol in re-education programs and tribes have supported programs to 
encourage boys and young men to respect women.  
</p>
<p>101. Lacking the necessary criminal authority to prosecute non-native offenders, tribal 
courts have used civil laws and remedies to respond to cases of violence against women. 
These include civil contempt proceedings, banishment, suspension of certain tribal benefits, 
and issuance of tribal protection orders, monetary penalties, community service, and 
restitution, among others. Furthermore, Indian nations regularly issue civil protection orders 
to prevent future violence and award temporary custody of children, to both native and non-
native women in their jurisdiction. Tribal authorities enforce these protection orders on 
their land, but once women leave tribal land, they must rely on other jurisdictions, mainly at 
the state level, for their enforcement. The Special Rapporteur was informed that many 
States do not recognize or enforce tribal protection orders. 
</p>
<p>102. Numerous tribes such as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians maintain and 
continue the practice of excluding batterers and rapists from their tribal jurisdictional 
boundaries. Unlike state and federal authorities, tribes have the power to restrict 
perpetrators of such crimes from entering their borders. Banishment prevents women and 
their children from being forced to flee their community and home due to violence. This is 
a serious community sanction which cuts off perpetrators from the tribe and sends a strong 
message about the protection of women and children in the community. 
</p>
<p>103. Unfortunately, efforts made by Indian nations to address the problem of violence 
against women are diluted by a lack of essential resources. The Special Rapporteur is well 
aware that the tribe she visited is a privileged one, in which resources are available to 
implement innovative policies and programs. Interviewees indicated that in many tribal 
communities, Indian women are disadvantaged by a lack of basic services and personnel to 
assist victims of sexual and physical violence.  Many Indian nations have only a few police 
officers to cover their vast territories. For example, within the state of Alaska, at least 
eighty Alaska Native Villages have no law enforcement presence in the village.117  
</p>
<p>104. In 2010 the Federal Attorney General announced additional resources to hire 33 new 
Assistant US Attorneys, as well as additional victim specialists, to improve collaboration 
between federal and tribal prosecution and law enforcement efforts in the prosecution of 
violent crimes in Indian Country. 
</p>
<p>105. In January 2011, the Attorney General announced the formation of the Violence 
against Women Federal and Tribal Prosecution Task Force, comprising US Attorneys, 
representatives from tribal governments and advisors from OVAW, health care 
professionals and law enforcement officials. Within a year of convening, the Task Force is 
directed to produce a trial practice manual on the federal prosecution of violence against 
women offenses in Indian Country.

</p>
<p><b> 7. Dedicated initiatives at the federal level 
</b></p>
<p>106. Commitment toward the elimination of violence against women has been shown at 
the highest level of the Executive with the appointment of a White House Advisor on 
domestic violence and sexual assault issues, and a White House Council on Women and 
Girls. These offices liaise closely with the advocacy community, as well as with various 
government departments. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the high levels of 
interagency coordination between the Department of Justice and other government 
departments in charge of implementing policies and programs to address violence against 
women, including the Departments of Housing, Homeland Security, Health, Labor and 
Veteran Affairs. 
</p>
<p>107. Within the Department of Justice, The Office on Violence against Women (OVW) 
was created specifically to implement the VAWA and other relevant legislation. The OVW 
administers financial and technical assistance aimed at 1) reducing domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, 2) strengthening services for victims and 3) 
improving criminal justice responses to these crimes. Since its inception in 1995, OVW has 
awarded nearly $4.5 billion in grants. 118   
</p>
<p>108. Apart from the 911 emergency services, there are four free national hotlines for 
victims of violence to receive counseling and to be referred to service providers in their 
locations. These include: the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the National Sexual 
Assault Hotline, the National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline, and the National Stalking 
Resource Center.  
</p>
<p>109. Other crucial services for victims are provided through the Family Violence 
Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) which provides federal funding dedicated directly to 
domestic violence shelters and programs. FVPSA is administered by the Department of 
Health and Human Services, and funds essential services such as emergency shelters, 
hotlines, counselling and advocacy, and primary and secondary prevention. FVPSA also 
supports services provided by more than 200 Indian tribes.   
</p>
<p>110. Advocates noted that many of these programs report critical shortages of funds and 
staff to provide emergency shelter, housing, child care and legal representation.  The 
National Census for Domestic Violence Services found that in one day in 2010, over 
70,648 adults and children received services at 1,746 domestic violence programs 
nationwide. Yet, on that same day, over 9,541 requests for services went unmet due to a 
lack of resources.119  
</p>
<p>111. In relation to housing provisions for women victims of violence, in 2005 the 
Violence Against Women Act created an exemption to federal one-strike policies in public 
and voucher assisted housing for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, and 
stalking, and provided other housing protections for victims.  Currently, Federal law 
prohibits the eviction or denial of housing to victims because of the violence committed 
against them. The Rapporteur was also informed that in October 2010, the current 
administration issued new rules providing guidance to public housing authorities on 
implementation of the VAWA housing provisions. Nevertheless, some interlocutors

  In this regards, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to receive post-mission information indicating that

victims. </p>

<p>claimed that these housing protections only apply to public housing and voucher housing 
and do not cover other federally subsidized housing. Such programs do not apply to victims 
of sexual assault, and do not include provisions allowing for early lease termination and/or 
relocation to tenants who must flee violence. Furthermore, State laws do not consistently 
meet these Federal standards.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The government has taken positive legislative and policy initiatives to reduce 
the prevalence of violence against women, including the enactment and subsequent 
reauthorizations of the Violence against Women Act, and the establishment of 
dedicated offices on violence against women at the highest level of the Executive. The 
government has also allocated substantial resources which are beneficial to advocates 
and service providers, particularly at the grassroots level.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Nevertheless, the lack of substantive protective legislation at federal and state 
levels, and the inadequate implementation of current laws, policies and programs, has 
resulted in the continued prevalence of violence against women and the 
discriminatory treatment of victims, with particularly detrimental effects on poor, 
minority, and immigrant women.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>It is clear that multiple forms of discrimination against certain groups of 
women not only makes them more vulnerable, but also exacerbates the negative 
consequences that violence has upon them. Thus the implementation of current policy 
and programmatic initiatives must address the persistent structural challenges which 
are often both the causes and consequences of violence against women. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>In light of the information received, the Special Rapporteur would like to make 
the following recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Remedies for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Explore more uniform remedies for victims of domestic violence, sexual 
assault and stalking. Expanding federal causes of action under VAWA, where 
possible, would mitigate current discrimination, and increase uniformity and 
accountability at the state and local levels.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Review and more effectively address the disproportionate impact that 
violence has on poor, minority, and immigrant women. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Re-evaluate existing mechanisms at federal, state, local and tribal levels 
for protecting victims and punishing offenders, given that calls for help often do not 
result in either arrests or successful prosecutions.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establish meaningful standards for enforcement of protection orders 
and impose consequences for a failure to enforce. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Initiate local and national dialogues with relevant stakeholders to 
consider the effectiveness, in theory and application, of expedited proceedings, 
mandatory arrest policies, mandatory prosecution policies, and batterer&#8217;s programs. 
This dialogue is necessary in light of the skepticism regarding the state&#8217;s response to 
domestic violence, and also the de facto disparate impact of such measures.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Initiate more public education campaigns that condemn all forms of 
violence, both public and private.   </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (g) Enhance gun control measures, by ensuring an adequate background 
check system to capture all relevant elements that determine an individual&#8217;s 
suitability for gun ownership. Background checks for licensed individuals should be 
revisited periodically to determine continued suitability. States should have clear gun 
removal policies when intervening in domestic violence cases, including the possibility 
of removal of guns after the first notification of domestic disputes. Gun dealers should 
be penalized for illegally selling guns and also for failure to report stolen guns which 
are subsequently used to commit crimes. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure effective implementation, regulation, monitoring and evaluation 
of VAWA&#8217;s housing provisions, including making available more affordable, secure 
housing options for those fleeing domestic violence. Federal and state housing policies 
should not discriminate against victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking - by excluding them as applicants or evicting them based on their histories of 
abuse. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Reform Federal and State labor laws to prohibit discrimination against 
survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and provide for 
emergency leave when employees need time off to address safety, health, housing, and 
legal concerns.   
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) All courts should order safe and appropriate parenting arrangements, 
including considering any history of domestic violence, prior orders of protection and 
domestic violence criminal convictions when determining custody, visitations and 
mediation issues. Furthermore, &#8220;failure to protect&#8221; statutes should not be used to 
unjustly remove children from non-offending caregivers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Military violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure the effective implementation of a no-tolerance policy for rape, 
sexual assault and sexual harassments in the military, ensure adequate investigation of 
all allegations by an independent authority and allow victims to bring claims against 
the military when damages arise out of negligent or wrongful acts.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure the effective implementation of training for all SAPRO 
employees, including Victim Advocates, SARC's, investigators and health 
professionals. Furthermore, the role and authority of the SARC&#8217;s should be 
strengthened beyond their current advisory role.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Enable more female-only and service specific in-patient PTSD and MST 
programs within the VA, to ensure victims a safe place to privately seek assistance 
without threats of further harassing behavior. Furthermore, mandatory and routine 
training on the specific issues facing women veterans should be instituted for all VA 
staff. The VA should also extend evidentiary relief to victims claiming in-service 
sexual assault and accept their testimony as main proof to support a diagnosis of 
PTSD.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women in detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Adopt international legal standards and norms for the protection of 
prisoners and detainees through the implementation of laws, policies and programmes 
at the Federal, State and local levels. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Explore and address the root causes, including the multiple and 
intersectional challenges, which lead to the increasing number of immigrant and 
African-American women in prisons and detention facilities.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Consider alternatives to incarceration, particularly for women detainees 
who are primary care-givers of their children, given the non-violent nature of many of 
the crimes for which women are incarcerated, and also in light of laws relating to loss 
of parental rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Consider amendments to the ASFA with a view to ensure that women in 
custodial settings do not easily or arbitrarily lose their parental rights. States should 
be encouraged to take a balanced approach when assessing the interest of the child&#8217;s 
welfare and the parental rights of incarcerated or detained mothers.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that sentencing policies reflect an understanding of women&#8217;s 
levels of culpability and control with drug offenses. Review laws that hold women 
responsible for their association with people involved in drug activities, and which 
punish them for activities of drug operations they may have little or no knowledge. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Emulate current programs to equip inmates with marketable skills for 
reintegration into society in all federal and state prisons, and ensure access to all 
women prisoners, regardless of their immigration status.   
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Adopt policies at the federal and state level to ensure that women in 
prisons receive the highest attainable level of physical and mental health care. In 
particular, women's prisons should provide comprehensive reproductive health 
services and gender-sensitive mental health and drug treatment programs.  Women 
should not be punished, through administrative segregation or otherwise, for behavior 
associated with their mental illness. Adequate independent oversight processes should 
be instituted to improve minimum standards of health services and to ensure that 
costs do not prohibit inmates from accessing health care.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Adopt legislation banning the use of restraints on pregnant women, 
including during labor or delivery, unless there are overwhelming security concerns 
that cannot be handled by any other method.    
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Enact laws criminalizing sexual abuse and other misconduct towards 
prisoners, covering not only guards and correctional officers, but also all individuals 
who work in prisons including volunteers and government contractors. The National 
Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Prison Rape should reflect the 
substantive issues indicated in the NPREC report of 2009. As articulated in the 
NPREC&#8217;s finding number five, victim&#8217;s health and safety should remain the focus, 
reporting procedures should be improved and responsive, and accountability should 
be the norm rather than the exception.  Compliance with these laws should be 
monitored through an independent mechanism through which prisoners can file 
grievances directly. Furthermore, prosecutors should receive specialized training on 
sexual abuse cases, to enable more responsive prosecutions in prison contexts. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Strengthen institutional oversight to ensure a comprehensive approach 
in preventing and responding to rape and sexual abuse in prisons, including through 
more accessible and transparent grievance procedures.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Amend the prison Litigation Reform Act to ensure women prisoners and 
detainees equal protection before the law, thereby addressing the numerous 
complaints noted above.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Eliminate cross-gender searches and provide for supervision in private 
spaces within all women&#8217;s prisons, in line with international standards regarding the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/26/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b> 
</p>
<p><b>treatment of prisoners. The National Standards should include NPREC 
recommendations that cross-gender pat searching be done only in the case of an 
emergency and not on a routine basis. Unnecessarily invasive and degrading strip 
search procedures should also be eliminated. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Improve and adopt national standards to transform the country&#8217;s 
immigration detention system into a truly civil model, thus avoiding the custody of 
immigrant detainees with convicted individuals.  These standards should be made 
legally binding in all detention facilities, including those run by state, local, or private 
contractors.   
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Locate immigration detention facilities closer to urban centers where 
legal services and family members are more accessible.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Violence against native-American women 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Prioritize public safety on Indian land by fully implementing and 
funding the Violence against Women and Tribal Law and Order Acts.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Assist tribal authorities in their efforts to respond to violence against 
women, including by allowing these law enforcement agencies to access federal 
criminal databases and by establishing, in consultation and cooperation with Indian 
nations, a national reporting system to investigate and prosecute cases of missing and 
murdered Native-American women. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establish federal and state accountability for the investigation and 
prosecution of violent crimes against Native-American women. The government 
should also ensure that state authorities recognize and effectively enforce tribal court 
protection orders.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Increase resource allocation to Indian tribes and tribal non-profit 
organizations providing services to women to develop comprehensive services for 
survivors of sexual and domestic violence.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Consider restoring, in consultation with Native-American tribes, tribal 
authority to enforce tribal law over all perpetrators, both native and non-native, who 
commit acts of sexual and domestic violence within their jurisdiction. 
</b></p>
