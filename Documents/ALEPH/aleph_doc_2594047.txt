1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. 
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate 
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The 
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period. 
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3. 
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the 
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period. 
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, where the entity’s 
corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable. 
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just 
retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can 
also, if you wish, delete the “OR” at the end of the selection.

(Recommendations). The information in this statement is current as at 15 August 2016 and has been 
approved by the Board.
To the extent that Leigh Creek Energy does not intend to follow all of the Recommendations, this Corporate 
Governance Statement identifies those Recommendations and sets out Leigh Creek Energy’s reasons for 
not following them.
Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight
Recommendation 1.1
A listed entity should disclose:
(a)
(b)
the respective roles and responsibilities of its board and management; and
those matters expressly reserved to the board and those delegated to management.
Recommendation followed
The role of the Board is covered by the Corporations Act 2001, ASX listing rules and the constitution 
of the Company. Its primary role is to represent shareholders and to promote and protect the 
interests of the Company with a view to creating long term shareholder wealth.  In achieving these 
ends the Board overviews the development of strategies, the setting of objectives, the 
establishment of policies to be implemented by management and assumes responsibility for 
ensuring adequate systems of internal control, risk management and financial reporting. The Board 
also ensures the provision of resources to senior management to achieve the Company’s objectives 
and undertakes subsequent monitoring of their performance.
Leigh Creek Energy's Board has adopted a Board Charter which clearly defines the roles and 
responsibilities of the Board and  management.
Leigh Creek Energy's Board Charter has been disclosed on its website at:  
www.lcke.com.au/Investors/Company-Charter-Policies/Board-Charter
Pursuant to their appointment, Non-Executive Directors usually have limited involvement in the 
day to day management of the Company, unless the circumstances of the Company require 
otherwise. The Board has appointed an Executive Chairman, Managing Director and Chief Executive 
Officer, responsible for the operational and administrative performance of the Company and the 
provision of relevant information and input to the Board to enable it to discharge its 
responsibilities.
Recommendation 1.2
A listed entity should:
(a)
(b)
undertake appropriate checks before appointing a person, or putting forward to security 
holders a candidate for election, as a director; and
provide security holders with all material information in its possession relevant to a decision 
on whether or not to elect or re-elect a director.
Recommendation followed
Although the Board does not have a separate nomination committee to oversee such matters (see 
Recommendation 2.1 below), as a matter of practice the Board ensures that all potential candidates 
for election are appropriately vetted, including by carrying out criminal history and bankruptcy 
checks and conferring with referees. The Board also ensures that all material information regarding 
candidates is put to security holders at the time of election or re-election to the Board.
Recommendation 1.3
A listed entity should have a written agreement with each director and senior executive setting out 
the terms of their appointment.
Recommendation followed
Leigh Creek Energy has entered into written agreements with each director and  senior executives.
Recommendation 1.4
The company secretary of a listed entity should be accountable directly to the board, through the 
chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the board.
Recommendation followed
The Company Secretary is accountable to the Board through the Chair on all governance matters. 
The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a matter of decision for the Board.
Recommendation 1.5
A listed entity should:
have a diversity policy which includes requirements for the board or a relevant committee of 
the board to set measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity and to assess annually 
both the objectives and the entity’s progress in achieving them;
disclose that policy or a summary of it; and
disclose as at the end of each reporting period the measurable objectives for achieving 
gender diversity set by the board or a relevant committee of the board in accordance with 
the entity’s diversity policy and its progress towards achieving them, and either:
(i)
(ii)
the respective proportions of men and women on the board, in senior executive 
positions and across the whole organization (including how the entity has defined 
“senior executive” for these purposes); or
if the entity is a “relevant employer” under the Workplace Gender Equality Act, the 
entity’s most recent “Gender Equality Indicators”, as defined in and published under 
that Act.

(b)
(c)
Page 2 of 12
Recommendation not followed
Leigh Creek Energy does not have a diversity policy and the Board does not set objectives for 
achieving gender diversity. Notwithstanding this, Leigh Creek Energy strives to provide the best 
possible opportunities for current and prospective employees of all backgrounds in such a manner 
that best adds to overall shareholders value and is consistent with Leigh Creek Energy’s values, 
policies and procedures.
The Board and senior management recruit persons based on skills and experience appropriate for 
the role concerned and do not discriminate based on gender, age, ethnicity or cultural  background.
Recommendation 1.6
A listed entity should:
(a)
(b)
have and disclose a process for periodically evaluating the performance of the board, its 
committees and individual directors; and
disclose, in relation to each reporting period, whether a performance evaluation was 
undertaken in the reporting period in accordance with that process.
Recommendation not followed
The Executive Chairman, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer are subject to an Annual 
Performance Evaluation which is undertaken by the Board. The reviews are internal. The Chairman 
presides over the review process with input from other Directors. The Non-Executive Director 
presides over the review process of the Executive Chairman with input from other Directors. 
Review of senior staff is ongoing.
The Board undertakes an ongoing process of evaluation and the composition of the Board is 
changed accordingly.
Recommendation 1.7
A listed entity should:
(a)
(b)
have and disclose a process for periodically evaluating the performance of its senior 
executives; and
disclose, in relation to each reporting period, whether a performance evaluation was 
undertaken in the reporting period in accordance with that process.

to address board succession issues and to ensure that the board has the appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience, discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively.
Recommendation followed
The scope and size of Leigh Creek Energy dictates a small Board. When a need arises and where it is 
considered the Board would benefit from the appointment of a Director with specific skills and 
experience, all members of the Board participate in seeking out appropriate potential candidates. In 
some instances assistance from external sources may be sought if necessary.
Recommendation 2.2
A listed entity should have and disclose a board skills matrix setting out the mix of skills and 
diversity that the board currently has or is looking to achieve in its membership.
Recommendation followed
The skills and experience of each director are set out in detail on   Leigh Creek Energy's website:
http://www.lcke.com.au/About-Us/Our-People-Board
The Board is cognisant of the need to review the composition of the Board from time to time to 
ensure an appropriate balance of skills, diversity, independence and experience relevant to the 
nature and extent of company operations and its future direction at any given point of time.

Page 4 of 12
association or relationship in question and an explanation of why the board is of that 
opinion; and
(c)
the length of service of each director.
Recommendation followed
Mr English and Mr Chatfield are independent non-executive Director. Mr English and Mr Chatfield 
do not have a material contractual relationship with the Company, other than as Directors. Mr 
English and Mr Chatfield have not been employed in an executive capacity and have not acted as a 
material professional advisor.
Mr Shearwood and Mr Peters have been employed in an executive capacity as Mr Peters was 
appointed to the role of Executive Chairman on 27 May 2015, and Mr Shearwood was appointed to 
the role of Managing Director on 27 May 2015. Mr Shearwood is considered to be a substantial 
shareholder indirectly, and Mr Peters is not a substantial shareholder.
Despite the fact that the Board does not consist of a majority of independent Directors, the Board 
considers it presently has an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and diversity 
to properly fulfill its role.
The statutory Directors’ report contained in each Annual Report sets out relevant experience and 
expertise on each Director, their period in office and status.
The length of service of each director is also set out on Leigh Creek Energy’s website at: 
http://www.lcke.com.au/About-Us/Our-People-Board

The chair of the board of a listed entity should be an independent director and, in particular, should 
not be the same person as the CEO of the entity.
Recommendation not followed
The Chair of the Board is Mr. Justyn Peters who is also an Executive Director.
The Board considers that, given Leigh Creek Energy's size and nature, it is appropriate for Mr. 
Peters to act as Chair in addition to his executive functions. Although he has an executive position, 
Mr. Peters is not the CEO of Leigh Creek Energy with the role of Managing Director performed by 
Mr. David Shearwood and the role of CEO performed by Mr. Phil Staveley.
Recommendation 2.6
A listed entity should have a program for inducting new directors and provide appropriate 
professional development opportunities for directors to develop and maintain the skills and

Leigh Creek Energy.  Directors are encouraged to undertake continuing professional education and, 
if this involves industry seminars and approved education courses, where appropriate, this is paid

Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting

chaired by an independent director who is not the Chair of the Board.
However, one of the members of the Audit and Risk Committee is  an executive director.
The Board is comprised of only four directors, two of whom are  executive directors. The Audit and 
Risk Committee is therefore unable to have  three members, all of whom are non-executive  
directors. The members of the Audit and Risk committee are all financially literate, and have a 
significant understanding of the industry in which the Company operates.

performance of the entity and that the opinion has been formed on the basis of a sound system of 
risk management and internal control which is operating effectively.

Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk
Recommendation 7.1
The board of a listed entity should:
(a)
have a committee or committees to oversee risk, each of which:
(i)  has at least three members, a majority of whom are independent directors; and
(ii)
is chaired by an independent director,
and disclose:

ensuring management has developed and adequately reports against sound systems of risk control.

controls are in place to monitor all levels of management  in the efficient and effective discharge of 
their responsibilities by the use of independent analysis, appraisals, advice and recommendations.
The composition of the Audit and Risk Committee, and a link to its charter which has been made 
available on Leigh Creek Energy's website, is set out in Recommendation 4.1 above.

The board or a committee of the board should:
(a)
review the entity’s risk management framework at least annually to satisfy itself that it 
continues to be sound; and

disclose, in relation to each reporting period, whether such a review has taken place.
Recommendation followed
The Board regularly review's management's systems of risk control to ensure that they remain 
sound.  However, the Company does not have a formal internal audit function. The Board considers 
that, given the size and nature of the Company, the flow of information between management and 
the Board allows the Board to continually evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the Company's 
risk management and internal control processes.
Leigh Creek Energy has adopted a Risk Management Policy which has been disclosed on Leigh Creek 
Energy's website at: 
www.lcke.com.au/Investors/Company-Charter-Policies/Risk-Management-Policy
That policy is regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains adequate.
Page 10 of 12
Recommendation 7.3
A listed entity should disclose:
(a)
(b)
if it has an internal audit function, how the function is structured and what role it performs; 
or
if it does not have an internal audit function, that fact and the processes it employs for 
evaluating and continually improving the effectiveness of its risk management and internal 
control processes.
Recommendation followed
Leigh Creek Energy is committed to understanding and managing risk and to establishing an 
organisational culture that ensures risk management is included in all activities, decision making 
and business processes.  The Company does not have a formal internal audit function due to its 
small size.
The Audit and Risk Committee meets at least bi-annually to receive and consider reports on, and 
monitor and discuss, known and emerging risk and compliance issues, including non-financial 
operational and other business risks.
The ongoing mitigation and management of key business risks is an item addressed by the Board as 
a whole at each board meeting through discussion, and it is an item of business on the agenda of 
the Audit and Risk Committee at least bi-annually.  Operational, financial, legal, compliance, 
strategic and reputational risks continue to be managed primarily by the Executive Chairman and 
Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Executive Officer as a part of the day-
to-day management of the Company’s affairs.  Where appropriate, these risks are managed with 
the support of relevant external professional advisers.
The Company undertakes an ongoing review of its safety and environmental risks and reports on 
this aspect to the Board on a monthly basis.
Recommendation 7.4
A listed entity should disclose whether it has any material exposure to economic, environmental 
and social sustainability risks and, if it does, how it manages or intends to manage those risks.

risks.

The charter of the committee

If it does not have a remuneration committee, disclose that the fact and the processes it 
employs for setting the level and composition of remuneration for directors and senior 
executives and ensuring that such remuneration is appropriate and not excessive.
Recommendation followed

this time. The role of setting remuneration levels for directors and senior executives is undertaken 
by the Board.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is set by reference to an aggregate cap approved by 
shareholders from time to time at the annual general meeting. The contribution of each Non-
Executive Director is taken into account in arriving at individual remuneration levels having regard 
for reasonable and competitive market rates.
The performance of Executive Management and Executive Directors, when such office is held, is 
reviewed by the Board in establishing the remuneration of such persons, with the exclusion of the 
Executive concerned from those deliberations.
External advice is sought on remuneration matters when deemed necessary to ensure that the 
remuneration of Directors and Executive Management  is appropriate and not excessive.
The details of remuneration of Directors and Senior Management  during each reporting period are 
set out in the statutory Directors'  Report.
Recommendation 8.2
A listed entity should separately disclose its policies and practices regarding the remuneration of 
non-executive directors and the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives.
Recommendation followed

and the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives is set out in the 
Remuneration Report contained in the Leigh Creek Energy Annual Report.  A copy of the Leigh 
Creek Energy’s Annual Report is located on the Company’s website.
Recommendation 8.3
A listed entity which has an equity-based remuneration scheme should:
(a)
have a policy on whether participants are permitted to enter into transactions (whether 
through the use of derivatives or otherwise) which limit the economic risk of participating in 
the scheme; and
(b)
disclose that policy or a summary of it.
Recommendation followed
Leigh Creek Energy has an equity-based remuneration scheme.  The Leigh Creek Energy Share 
Trading Policy provides that participants in the scheme must not enter into any transaction which 
would have the effect of hedging or otherwise transferring to any other person the risk of any 
fluctuation in the value of any unvested equity interest.  The Share Trading Policy is located on the 
Leigh Creek Energy web site at www.lcke.com.au/Investors/Company-Charter-Policies/Share-
