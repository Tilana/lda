<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, 
justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence to the Human Rights Council pursuant 
to resolution 18/7. The report lists key activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur from 
August 2012 to July 2013, and analyses selected challenges faced by truth commissions in 
transitional periods, while proposing responses to strengthen the effectiveness of those 
mechanisms in addressing gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits and regional consultations 
</b></p>
<p>2. From 11 to 16 October, the Special Rapporteur undertook his first country visit, and 
thanks the Government of Tunisia for its invitation and cooperation. The report is contained 
in document A/HRC/24/42/Add.1.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur will visit Uruguay from 30 September to 4 October 2013 
and Spain from 22 to 31 January 2014. He thanks both Governments for their invitations. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur had hoped to visit Guatemala in the first half of 2013, but 
was informed that the Government was unable to accommodate a visit this year. New 
country visit requests have been made to Brazil, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, Indonesia and Rwanda. Other country visit requests are pending in relation to 
Guinea and Nepal.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur launched a process of regional consultations to gather 
information on national normative frameworks, experience and practices regarding 
transitional justice mechanisms to encourage experience-sharing and identify and promote 
good practices relating to the components under the mandate and their integration into a 
comprehensive policy. The first regional consultation, for the Middle East and North Africa 
region, was held in November 2012 in Cairo. The second, in the Latin American and 
Caribbean region, took place in December 2012 in Buenos Aires. A regional consultation 
for Africa is planned for November 2013 in Uganda; one for Europe is scheduled for 2014 
in Germany, and one for Asia is envisaged for 2014/2015. The results of the meetings will 
form part of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s study requested by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 18/7 (para. 1 (f)). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur sent communications in 2012 to Nepal1 and in 2013 to 
Bangladesh, Burundi, Guatemala, Mexico, Nepal and Uruguay.2  
</p>
<p>7. Jointly with other special procedures, he issued press releases on Bangladesh,3 
Guatemala4 and Uruguay,5 as well as on the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See A/HRC/22/67 and Corrs. 1 and 2, communication to Nepal (22 October 2012). 
 2 See A/HRC/24/21, communications to Bangladesh (22 March 2013), Burundi (22 March 2013), 
</p>

May 2013). </p>


<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,6 on the call for the post-
2015 development agenda to be urgently refocused with respect to equality, social 
protection and accountability,7 and on the call to Governments to ensure that victims of 
torture and their families obtain redress and rehabilitation.8 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>8. In September 2012, the Special Rapporteur presented his first report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/21/46) on the mandate&#8217;s foundations and implementation strategy. 
On that occasion, he met with the Ambassadors of Argentina, Nepal, the Republic of Korea 
and Tunisia, and was a panellist in a side event organized by Impunity Watch and in the 
high-level discussion on the role of judges and lawyers in transition, organized by the 
International Commission of Jurists.  </p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur delivered the keynote speech at the international conference 
on &#8220;Right to truth, reparation and reforms: achievements of and perspectives for transitional 
justice&#8221;, held in Rabat on 14 and 15 January 2013. 
</p>
<p>10. He participated in a conference on &#8220;Integrating transitional justice, security and 
development&#8221;, held from 17 to 19 January by Wilton Park, Switzerland and Norway, with 
an intervention on &#8220;Linking human rights, justice, security and development&#8221;.    
</p>
<p>11. On 22 January, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Development Talk on 
&#8220;Institutions and democratic governance&#8221;, organized by Sweden in Stockholm, with a 
keynote speech on transitional justice and development.   
</p>
<p>12. He participated in the panel discussion on transitional justice and genocide 
prevention at the conference on the theory, policy and practice of mass atrocity prevention, 
held on 25 and 26 February by the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and the Auschwitz 
Institute for Peace and Reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>13. On 27 February, the Special Rapporteur gave the keynote speech at the International 
Expert Seminar on &#8220;Access to justice for indigenous peoples including truth and 
reconciliation processes&#8221;, co-organized by the Institute for the Study of Human Rights at 
Columbia University, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), and the International Center for Transitional Justice. 
</p>
<p>14. From 22 to 24 April, the mandate participated in a regional conference on the topic 
&#8220;For a strengthened effectiveness of transitional justice processes&#8221;, held in Yaound&#233;, co-
organized by OHCHR, France and Switzerland.

<p>15. On 1 May, the Special Rapporteur delivered opening remarks, via telephone link, to 
the Commonwealth round table on reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>16. On 30 and 31 May, in Berlin, he met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Germany, the Office of the Federal President, the Parliamentary Committee for Human 
Rights and Humanitarian Aid, and the Institute for Human Rights, with a view to preparing 
the regional consultations for Europe. He also participated in a workshop organized by the 
Working Group on Peace and Development. 
</p>
<p>17. In May and July, the Special Rapporteur met in Geneva with the Ambassadors 
and/or representatives of Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, France, Guatemala, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of 
Korea, Rwanda, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uganda, the United States of America, 
Uruguay and the International Organization of la Francophonie. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  The right to truth 
</b></p>
<p>18. Truth-seeking entities, including truth commissions, aim at the fulfilment of the 
right to truth, which is enshrined in a number of international instruments, notably the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law. The Human Rights Council has placed the right to truth in 
the context of contributions to end impunity.9 Similar references have been made by 
OHCHR,10 treaty bodies,11 and special procedures of the Council.12  
</p>
<p>19. At the regional level, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights were at the forefront of developing jurisprudence 
on the right to truth of the victim, his or her next of kin, and the whole of society. 
Regarding the collective nature of this right, the Commission observed that &#8220;every society 
has the inalienable right to know the truth about past events, as well as the motives and 
circumstances in which aberrant crimes came to be committed, in order to prevent 
repetition of such acts in the future&#8221;.13 In a more recent judgment, the Court framed the 
right to truth in the form of a positive State obligation, stressing that &#8220;the next of kin of the 
victims and society as a whole must be informed of everything that has happened in 
connection with the said violations&#8221;.14 The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights has recognized the right to truth as an aspect of the right to an effective remedy for a 
violation of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.15 In connection with gross 
human rights violations committed in the context of countering terrorism, the European

 15 The Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa highlight 
</p>
<p>that the right to an effective remedy includes &#8220;access to the factual information concerning the 
</p>
<p>violations&#8221;. Principle C (b) (3). </p>


<p>Court of Human Rights acknowledged the right to truth not only for victims and their 
families but for the general public as well.16 
</p>
<p>20. The right to truth entitles the victim, his or her relatives and the public at large to 
seek and obtain all relevant information concerning the commission of the alleged 
violation,17 the fate and whereabouts of the victim18 and, where appropriate, the process by 
which the alleged violation was officially authorized.19 With this legal framework in mind, 
in the aftermath of repression or conflict, the right to truth should be understood to require 
States to establish institutions, mechanisms and procedures that are enabled to lead to the 
revelation of the truth, which is seen as a process to seek information and facts about what 
has actually taken place, to contribute to the fight against impunity, to the reinstatement of 
the rule of law, and ultimately to reconciliation.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Selected current problems in the operation of truth 
commissions and proposed responses to increase their 
effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>21. The past two decades have seen a steady increase in the establishment and use of 
various truth-seeking mechanisms, ranging from State-sanctioned truth commissions to 
&#8220;unofficial&#8221; truth-seeking processes, carried out by civil society groups, including victims&#8217; 
organizations.20 Truth-seeking has also been pursued at the international level through 
international commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions.  
</p>
<p>22. The present report will focus on selected current problems of State-sanctioned truth 
commissions in the aftermath of gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law, and proposes responses to increase their effectiveness. It 
identifies some challenges stemming from trends that can be usefully addressed in a text of 
this sort. Hence, the report will deal with aspects related to the establishment and operation 
of truth commissions that, if addressed adequately ex ante, improve the likelihood of a 
commission being able to make its distinctive contribution. It also deals with topics that 
might improve the chances of a commission&#8217;s recommendations being taken up ex post, 
emphasizing an underlying practical interest. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  The state of the field: achievements and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>23. As temporary, ad hoc institutions, truth commissions are not part of an established 
institutional framework and have no pre-existing political constituency or cadres of well-
established bureaucrats. Yet they have proven to be capable of making significant 
contributions to transitional processes in the over 40 countries that have implemented them 
</p>
<p>  
 16 European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), <i>El-Masri</i> v. <i>the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</i> 
</p>
<p>(n&#176; 39630/09), 13 December 2012, para. 191, the Court emphasizes &#8220;the great importance of the 
present case not only for the applicant and his family, but also for other victims of similar crimes and 
the general public, who had the right to know what had happened&#8221;. 
</p>

 18 A/HRC/16/48, pp. 12-17.

 20 Some of them have produced important reports, including Brazil&#8217;s Nunca Mais, Guatemala&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Proyecto lnterdiocesano de Recuperaci&#243;n de la Memoria Hist&#243;rica (REHMI), Uruguay&#8217;s Nunca M&#225;s, 
Northern Ireland&#8217;s Ardoyne: the Untold Truth, and Greenbsoro&#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission&#8217;s Final Report. </p>


<p>since the 1980s.21 Those that have had such impact derive this potential from, among other 
factors: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The moral standing of their members. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Their establishment in the wake of social turmoil or upheaval, when the basic 
&#8220;social contract&#8221; is being revised. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The fact that the topics that they address closely relate to fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A sound and consistent methodology.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Openness to civil society. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A &#8220;victim-centred&#8221;, inclusive approach. 
</p>
<p>24. Successful truth commissions have made, inter alia, the following contributions: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Giving a &#8220;voice&#8221; to and empowering victims: commissions can create platforms for 
victims to tell their stories &#8211; for example, by holding public hearings &#8211; thereby 
giving them a place in the public sphere for the very first time. This is part of the 
process of affirming the status of victims, often members of socially marginalized 
groups, as equal rights holders.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Fostering general social integration: official acknowledgment of atrocities 
contributes to ending cycles of resentment and mistrust. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Helping set reform priorities: in the aftermath of massive atrocities, commissions 
have been sources of information about systemic failure, which has helped in setting 
up reform agendas.     
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing important information for the other transitional justice measures: 
commission reports and other information gathered by commissions have been 
useful for prosecutorial efforts and fundamental to reparation programmes and 
institutional reforms. 
</p>
<p>Ultimately, commissions have provided recognition to victims as rights holders, fostered 
civic trust, and contributed to strengthening the rule of law.22  
</p>
<p>25. It is crucial to keep in mind however that what truth commission reports, on their 
own, are primarily capable of delivering is not the same as actual transformation; hence the 
importance of reaffirming the need to strengthen the links among truth, justice, reparation 
and guarantees of non-recurrence,23 and more broadly, between those measures and other 
coexisting policy interventions.24  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that despite its importance, truth cannot be a 
substitute for justice, reparation or guarantees of non-recurrence, singly or collectively, and 
recalls that there are abiding national and international obligations concerning each 
measure, compelling practical moral and political reasons for implementing them, as well

<p>as convincing empirical evidence that they work best, as justice measures, when designed 
and implemented in a comprehensive fashion rather than in isolation from one another.25   
</p>
<p>27. Given the perceived potential of truth commissions, they have become a habitual 
response to the challenges posed by transitional situations and the legacies of atrocities. The 
impetus to establish them has not waned. Indeed they have become &#8220;normal&#8221; responses not 
just in post-authoritarian but also post-conflict transitions. Some countries have even 
implemented transitional justice measures in the absence of a political transition and while 
conflict is still ongoing.26 Consequently, truth commissions are now frequently also tasked 
with investigating serious violations of international humanitarian law.27 
</p>
<p>28. Some contextual characteristics made truth commissions apt mechanisms in the 
aftermath of violations committed by authoritarian regimes:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The denial of gross or systematic violations, which was as deliberate as the planning 
and execution of those violations by past regimes, made truth-seeking an appropriate 
response.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Given the nature of many transitions from authoritarianism, in which predecessor 
regimes retained, at least temporarily, the capacity to destabilize the transitional 
process, a policy of truth was a sensible first step towards more comprehensive 
redress. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Authoritarian State institutions were responsible for the overwhelming majority of 
violations that required investigation and disclosure, which made the task of 
commissions at least feasible.   
</p>
<p>29. Truth commissions in post-conflict settings face particular challenges. They must 
provide an account of violations often perpetrated by a multiplicity of agents of violence, 
each much less structured than the security sector of authoritarian regimes and frequently 
with circulating membership, while the perpetrator/victim line is often porous. Furthermore, 
security concerns negatively affect virtually all aspects of the operation of commissions, 
providing powerful disincentives to potential witnesses, statement-takers and even 
commissioners. Commissions in post-conflict contexts operate in an overall environment of 
weak institutions, depleted social capital, fragmented civil societies, severe capacity and 
resource constraints, and often in situations marked by deep ethnic cleavages.   
</p>
<p>30. However, truth commissions face challenges that do not relate only to the 
peculiarities of post-conflict settings. The Special Rapporteur would like to call attention to 
the overburdening of truth commissions worldwide as manifested by the following factors, 
among others: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The inability of truth commissions to meet the deadlines set forth in their mandates. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Controversies surrounding the aptness of particular appointments of commissioners, 
posing serious problems for an institution that derives much of its potential from the 
moral authority of its leadership.

</p>
<p>development and present state of transitional justice, <i>Journal for Human Rights</i>, vol. 5, No. 2 (2011). 
 27 See para. 35 below. The resolution establishing this mandate refers both to addressing &#8220;gross human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law&#8221;, Human Rights Council 
resolution 18/7, preamble, eleventh paragraph.   </p>


<p>&#8226; Publicly expressed differences and, indeed, discord, among commissioners over 
fundamental issues concerning a commission&#8217;s operation and conclusions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Abiding critiques about poor implementation of commission recommendations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A worrisome trend towards the seemingly open-ended expansion of commission 
mandates, not just thematically, but functionally, leading to doubts about whether 
there is any institution encompassing all the competencies required by such 
expansion.   
</p>
<p>31. In highlighting these challenges, the Special Rapporteur intends to contribute to 
maintaining the integrity of commissions and strengthening their efficacy, given past 
experiences which demonstrate that they can be useful, and at times key, transitional 
instruments.   
</p>
<p><b> B.  Ex ante challenges  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Mandates 
</b></p>
<p>32. The greatest challenge currently facing truth commissions concerns the expansion of 
their mandates. By a &#8220;mandate&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur refers to the foundational 
document, taking the form of an executive decree, a legislative act, a peace agreement, or a 
United Nations regulation. Foundational documents typically define (a) the duration of a 
commission&#8217;s operation; (b) the temporal scope of the mandate defining the period in which 
the violations must have occurred to be under the commission&#8217;s purview; (c) the thematic 
mandate - the types of violations that the commission is authorized and/or obligated to 
address; (d) the commission&#8217;s functions - the actions it is supposed to undertake; and (e) the 
objectives or ends the commission is requested to fulfil.28 The Special Rapporteur will use 
this classification for analytical purposes and to call attention to some trends.29 
</p>
<p>33. <i>Duration</i>. The period assigned to truth commissions to complete their tasks has 
expanded, albeit within limits. Illustrative is that truth commissions of the 1980s and 1990s, 
with the exception of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, tended to 
last one year or less.30 Commissions of the past decade have tended to last over one year 
and up to three years.31 Experience has shown that performing such complex tasks in only a 
few months is unfeasible. At the same time, prolonging indefinitely the lifespan of a 
commission is also unfeasible, as it would diminish the commission&#8217;s function of signalling 
in a timely fashion the break with past abusive practices.  
</p>
<p>  
 28 Mandates frequently include other elements, such as the specifications of the powers of the 
</p>
<p>commission (e.g., subpoena, search and seizure), selection and appointment procedures, or the names 
of appointees.  
</p>
<p> 29 Hastening to add that as tendencies, &#8220;outliers&#8221; can be identified regarding most of them, and that the

<p>34. <i>Temporal scope</i>. Although patterns of atrocities rarely emerge or end at sharply 
determined points in time, most commissions take recognized junctures, such as the dates 
of coups, uprisings or the initiation of conflict as starting points, and the cessation of 
conflict or the fall of an abusive regime as cut-off dates. Excluding clear patterns in the 
distribution of violations and important incidents of violations from the temporal scope of a 
commission&#8217;s work raises general doubts as to the mechanism&#8217;s impartiality. Because there 
are limits to plausible periodizations, choices concerning the temporal scope are somewhat 
bounded. Commissions have been asked to investigate violations ranging from under a 
dozen years (Argentina, 7 years; Sierra Leone, 11 years; El Salvador, 12 years) to over 20 
or more years (Timor-Leste, 25 years; South Africa and Guatemala, 34 years; Morocco, 43 
years; Kenya, 44 years), which demonstrates an expansion in temporal scope. 
</p>
<p>35. <i>Thematic mandates. </i>During a period of repression or violence, violations of many 
rights occur. Mandates determine which kinds of violations will be investigated by 
commissions. Here again a trend towards expansion is observable in the following select 
examples:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The National Commission on the Enforced Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) 
in Argentina was tasked with investigating disappearances, understood as 
kidnappings with no remains ever found;32  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Truth Commission in El Salvador received a general mandate,33 which it 
interpreted to focus on 32 exemplary cases of disappearance, extrajudicial killing, 
and massacre in addition to its consideration of the overall context of these crimes.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Act establishing the South African truth commission mandated it to investigate 
&#8220;gross violations of human rights&#8221;, which it defined as: &#8220;(a) the killing, abduction, 
torture or severe ill-treatment of any person; or (b) any attempt, conspiracy, 
incitement, instigation, command or procurement to commit&#8221; such violations.34   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The regulation of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor that 
established CAVR determined the thematic scope as human rights violations 
&#8220;committed within the context of the political conflicts in East Timor between 25 
April 1974 and 25 October 1999&#8221;, comprising &#8220;(i) violations of international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards; (ii) violations of international humanitarian law; and (iii) criminal 
acts&#8221;.35 These included violations of economic, social and cultural rights.36   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Act establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Liberia defines 
the mandate by reference to &#8220;human rights violations&#8221;, by which it means &#8220;(1) 
violations of international human rights standards, including, but not limited to, acts 
of torture, killing, abduction and severe ill-treatment of any person&#8221; and &#8220;(2) 
violations of international humanitarian law, including, but not limited to, crimes 
against humanity and war crimes&#8221;. The mandate also comprises &#8220;abuses &#8230; 
including massacres, sexual violations, murder, extra-judicial killings and economic

<p>crimes, such as the exploitation of natural or public resources to perpetuate armed 
conflicts&#8221;.37 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In this incomplete but representative sample, the Act establishing the Truth, Justice 
and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya constitutes the most expansive thematic 
mandate. The commission was directed to investigate, inter alia: &#8220;violations and 
abuses of human rights and economic rights inflicted on persons by the State, public 
institutions and holders of public office, both serving and retired&#8230;&#8221;. The Act 
mentions specifically: massacres, sexual violations, murder, extrajudicial killings, 
abductions, disappearances, detentions, torture, ill-treatment and expropriation of 
property, and includes in terms of economic crimes &#8220;grand corruption and the 
exploitation of natural or public resources&#8221;, &#8220;the irregular and illegal acquisition of 
public land&#8221;, &#8220;economic marginalization of communities&#8221; and the &#8220;misuse of public 
institutions for political objectives&#8221;. The Act also calls on the Commission to inquire 
into the &#8220;causes of ethnic tensions&#8221;.38 
</p>
<p>36. <i>Gender considerations.</i> An unambiguously positive aspect of the expansion of 
thematic mandates concerns the specific attention dedicated to women&#8217;s rights (and in some 
cases to gender issues more broadly). While early truth commissions were &#8220;gender blind&#8221;, 
ignoring manifest violations against women, over time, both by design and through 
practice, commissions made significant progress in addressing the violations of the rights of 
women. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Peru set an important precedent by 
establishing a dedicated gender unit and trying to mainstream gender considerations 
throughout its report.39 It is encouraging that the reports of the truth and reconciliation 
commissions of Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as of CAVR, paid sustained attention to 
women and children.40 This is a trend that needs to be celebrated and reinforced.41 
</p>
<p>37. <i>Functional mandate</i>. The functional mandate specifying the concrete functions 
commissions are expected to fulfil has also witnessed notable expansion, with commissions 
being expected to satisfy increasingly complex functions. At the most basic level, 
commissions were expected to carry out a fact-finding function. Thus, CONADEP, in 
Argentina, was tasked with clarifying the facts regarding the disappearance of persons. 
Since disappearances were such a prevalent violation in the countries where the earlier 
commissions were set up, their other main function was to help determine the whereabouts 
of the disappeared &#8211; a victim-tracing function. 
</p>
<p>38. It is difficult, however, to confront the enormity of violations of this sort and not be 
propositive. Although it was not part of its mandated functions, CONADEP proposed in its

<p>report judicial reform measures and economic assistance for the family members of 
victims.42 In this way, the commission acquired two additional functions, a victim-redress 
function, and a preventive function, largely centred on institutional reform proposals. It is 
important to note, however, that in contrast to the fact-finding and victim-tracing powers, 
the victim-redress and preventive functions are merely potentialities; commissions typically 
cannot reform institutions or provide reparations, they can merely make recommendations. 
The subsequent history of truth commissions speaks of the growing complexity of these 
four functions and of the attribution to commissions of new ones, as well as of the omission 
of the difference between actual functions and mere potentialities.     
</p>
<p>39. Even the fact-finding function has become significantly more complex: while the 
Argentinean commission&#8217;s task was limited to clarifying the facts regarding the 
disappearance of persons, the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation in Chile 
was mandated &#8220;to clarify in a comprehensive manner the truth about the most serious 
human rights violations committed in recent years in our country&#8221;43 and the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission in South Africa was asked to establish &#8220;as complete a picture 
as possible of the nature, causes and extent of gross violations of human rights&#8221;.44 The 
decree establishing the truth commission in Peru (before it became a truth and 
reconciliation commission, which involved the attribution of yet another function) 
continued this process of expansion by requiring the commission &#8220;to analyse the political, 
social and cultural conditions, as well as the behaviours, both within society and by State 
institutions, that contributed to the tragic situation of violence experienced by Peru&#8221;.45 The 
pattern continued with the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was to 
investigate &#8220;the nature, causes and extent of gross violations and abuses of human rights, 
including the root causes, circumstances, factors, context, motives, and perspectives which 
led to such violations&#8221;.46 Finally, there is no better illustration of such expansion than the 
Act establishing the Kenyan truth commission. With respect to an already all-encompassing 
catalogue of violations, it describes the commission&#8217;s task in terms of &#8220;establishing an 
accurate, complete and historical record of violations and abuses of human rights and 
economic rights inflicted on persons by the State, public institutions and holders of public 
office, both serving and retired &#8230; including the (i) antecedents, circumstances, factors and 
context of such violations; (ii) perspectives of the victims; and (iii) motives and 
perspectives of the persons responsible for commission of the violations&#8221;, as well as 
&#8220;establishing as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature, and extent of the gross 
violations of human rights and economic rights&#8221;.47   
</p>
<p>40. Hence, fact-finding has ceased to be an effort aimed at clarifying cases, the fate of 
individual victims, and (when mandated and possible) the identities of those responsible for 
those violations, and has become an undertaking to understand comprehensively root 
causes, circumstances, factors, context and motives of countrywide situations of repression 
and/or violence. There is of course much to be said in favour of wide analysis, but it must 
be clear (a) that even deep analysis is not the same as transformation, and (b) that given

<p>relevant constraints it sometimes comes at the expense of functions that commissions can 
actually complete.   
</p>
<p>41. The preventive function of truth commissions has widened (in theory) alongside the 
expansion of &#8220;fact-finding&#8221;. This has not happened necessarily by design. Mandates are not 
more elaborate concerning concrete preventive mechanisms; rather, the wide-ranging 
analysis seems to invite similarly wide-ranging transformation proposals in the name of 
prevention. Thus commissions have made proposals for the transformation of various 
institutions, including the judiciary, security forces, education, media, civil registries, 
electoral systems, and land tenure patterns.   
</p>
<p>42. Perhaps the only original function of commissions that has not seen a comparable 
expansion is victim tracing. This function has gained neither increased prominence, nor 
elaboration in commission mandates, yet the need for it has by no means waned. On the one 
hand, in most situations where truth commissions are implemented the fate of thousands of 
victims remains unclarified and thousands of bodies remain unidentified, even when mass 
burial sites have been located. On the other hand, professional competence in forensics has 
grown significantly. Considering how exhumations can contribute significantly to truth and 
justice processes, and the cross-cultural importance for families of victims and entire 
communities of ensuring proper burial of the deceased, the Special Rapporteur calls for 
renewed attention to the victim-tracing function of commissions. On their own, truth 
commissions are unlikely to assume full responsibility for exhumations and identification 
when a large universe of victims exists. Support from other institutions is needed, but 
commissions in the past have played a useful role in tracing victims and identifying burial 
sites.48   
</p>
<p>43. The victim-redress function of some earlier truth commissions has, by contrast, 
become a staple of virtually all commissions and has grown in complexity. Most mandates 
require commissions to make recommendations concerning victim reparation. Some 
commissions have specifically recommended establishing complex programmes49 which 
distribute a variety of goods both symbolic and material (including cash payments and the 
provision of services), and both to individuals and to communities. Truth commissions have 
often articulated comprehensive proposals, such as those by the Peruvian commission,50 the 
South African commission,51 and CAVR in Timor-Leste.52   
</p>
<p>44. The overwhelming majority of truth commissions have not been called to implement 
reparations programmes, but to make recommendations concerning their design. Given that 
reparations programmes are usually long-term projects that outlast the commission&#8217;s life, 
and that the more complex the programme the heavier its administrative load, there are 
</p>
<p>  
 48 The TRC of Peru devoted significant attention to recommendations concerning exhumations. See 
</p>

p. 312, paras. 22-23, available at: http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report. The reparations proposals were 
rejected by the government, which implemented a significantly more modest programme, see, e.g., 
Christopher J. Colvin, &#8220;Overview of the Reparations Program in South Africa&#8221;, in De Greiff, <i>The 
Handbook of Reparations</i> (fn 49), p. 176<i>.

<p>good reasons behind the continued trend not to make commissions responsible for their 
implementation.53 
</p>
<p>45. In addition to the four core functions, truth commissions have been attributed 
additional functions, including contributing to prosecutorial efforts, either by providing 
information they gather (for example in Argentina)54 or, as in the case of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission in Peru, by actively constructing cases to be presented to 
prosecuting authorities.55   
</p>
<p>46. It is thus a misperception that most truth commissions have been created as 
substitutes for criminal justice and that they are closely related to amnesties either as one of 
their characteristic functions or as an indirect consequence. Most commissions have had no 
relationship with amnesties. Even in the oft-mentioned South African case of &#8220;truth in 
exchange for amnesty&#8221;, the relation was complex. The amnesty for which those who 
provided testimony could apply, or remain liable to prosecution was (a) conditional on the 
crimes committed having been &#8220;political&#8221; and on full disclosure and (b) granted or denied 
by a subcommittee of the commission which was independent from the one receiving the 
testimony.56 Indeed, most of those who provided testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission had their applications for amnesty turned down.57  
</p>
<p>47. Another function truth commissions have increasingly been given relates to 
reconciliation. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that there are no shortcuts to 
reconciliation, and in particular, that meaningful reconciliation requires, in addition to truth, 
the implementation of the remaining three elements: justice, reparation and guarantees of 
non-recurrence.58 Thus truth commissions on their own cannot achieve reconciliation, and 
the inclusion of the term in their titles likely generates expectations that cannot be satisfied.   
</p>
<p>48. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the inclusion of victim-
perpetrator pardon mechanisms in two recent draft laws on truth commissions. Although 
the legal consequences of such mechanisms are presently unclear, they risk undermining 
the realization of international obligations to prosecute. These proposed pardon 
mechanisms, ostensibly an aspect of reconciliation, misunderstand its nature, especially 
when the procedures can be initiated without a request from victims. In circumstances of 
continuing significant power asymmetries between perpetrators and victims and the 
ongoing security concerns of the latter, forcing victims to participate in procedures that 
bring them face to face with those who are presumably responsible for the violations they 
suffered imposes huge burdens on them and exposes them to great risk. Additionally, it 
raises serious questions about the voluntary nature of the pardons that may flow from such 
procedures.59    
</p>
<p>  
 53 Despite this, Tunisia is presently considering a draft law creating a commission with the 
</p>
<p>responsibility to also implement reparations programmes (see A/HRC/24/42/Add.1, para. 37).  
 54 Chile&#8217;s TRC was barred from making attributions of responsibility &#8211; that function was reserved to 
</p>
<p>judicial authorities &#8211; but this did not prevent it, in accordance with its mandate, from referring 
evidence of criminality to courts. The Commission on Truth for El Salvador refrained from pushing 
for prosecutions, not because it did not find sufficient prima facie evidence of violations, nor because 
it thought prosecutions in any way undesirable, but because it did not trust Salvadoran courts at the 
time to be capable of carrying out fair trials, see Hayner (fn 21), p. 49. 
</p>
<p> 55 The TRC of Peru constructed 47 such cases, see Final Report (fn 39), vol. VII, chap. 2. Progress on 
these cases, however, has been slow.   
</p>
<p> 56 South African Act 95-34 (fn 34), ch. 4.  
 57 Subsequent prosecutions have been scant, however.  
 58 A/HRC/21/46, paras. 36-39. 
 59 See A/HRC/22/67 and Corrs. 1 and 2, communication to Nepal (22 October 2012). </p>


<p>49. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that reconciliation at the social 
level cannot be reduced to one-to-one encounters. Gross human rights violations do not 
constitute only a violation of an individual, but additionally a violation of the very principle 
of the rule of law. Thinking that one-on-one pardons undo all the damage that such 
violations bring about fails to consider their systemic and structural dimension. Social 
reconciliation requires, inter alia, establishing institutions that are trustworthy and that 
genuinely embody the idea that each individual is a rights holder. This process cannot 
happen via victim-perpetrator encounters alone.60 
</p>
<p>50. A novel function of the truth commissions under consideration in at least one 
country is an arbitration function for the settlement of individual cases of corruption. Given 
the quasi-judicial procedures required to guarantee minimal fairness in decision-making, a 
huge additional workload is to be expected. Furthermore, arbitration of corruption cases 
involves a significant likelihood of defeating the expectations of the public, which is likely 
to have maximalist aspirations of recovery and punishment. In short, the very same truth 
commission mandated to be proactive concerning prosecutions or vetting is also expected 
to act as a neutral arbitration and settlement body. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
highlight the enormous challenges and internal tensions that this combination of functions 
is likely to generate.61 
</p>
<p>51. On the basis of the above analysis, it can be concluded that most elements of the 
mandate have suffered significant expansion: truth commissions today are expected to 
address a broader array of violations, occurring over longer periods of time, where the 
objective has shifted from clarification of cases to comprehensive analysis of whole 
contexts and underlying causes, motivating, in turn, the call for comprehensive reform 
proposals. The Special Rapporteur, pulling together the tendencies reviewed in this chapter, 
points to the following: institutions that have usually been underfunded, insufficiently 
staffed in terms of numbers or expertise, that by their very nature remain infrastructurally 
and politically weak, that have a relatively short operation period, and whose authority 
depends to a great extent on commissioners to vow to the seriousness of the investigations 
(rather than on their technical capacities concerning institutional design matters) are now 
expected to fulfil enormously more complex functions, as reflected in the expansive list of 
objectives assigned to them in their mandates. From this perspective, it should come as no 
surprise that commissions are finding it increasingly difficult to satisfy growing 
expectations. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur urges prudence in the drafting of the mandate of truth 
commissions, heeding basic considerations of functional adequacy. Commissions that are 
laden with objectives which they have no means to satisfy will predictably disappoint 
expectations. Truth commissions were important human rights instruments because they 
proved functionally adequate in satisfying their core functions, which was an important step 
</p>
<p>  
 60 See A/HRC/24/21, communication to Burundi (22 March 2013). 
 61 Tunisia country visit report, A/HRC/24/42/Add.1, paras. 38-39. A possible way of addressing both 
</p>
<p>systemic issues and individual cases of corruption would be the establishment of dedicated 
independent bodies with the professional capacities and specialisation for investigating financial files 
and settling individual corruption cases by arbitration. These bodies may conduct joint investigations 
and/or establish meaningful information sharing methods. In Tunisia, a specific investigation body 
was established, the National Commission of Investigation on Corruption and Embezzlement, that 
was composed of generalists on the systemic issue of corruption and technicians with specific 
expertise on investigating financial files. This Commission ran in parallel to a fact-finding 
commission on the gross human rights violations committed during the uprising. The Commission of 
Investigation on Corruption and Embezzlement then recommended the establishment of a permanent 
anti-corruption body at the constitutional level, see A/HRC/24/42/Add.1, para. 53. </p>


<p>in transition processes. The more the bulk of a commission&#8217;s work ventures into functions 
</p>
<p>that strain both its capacities and its sources of authority and legitimacy, the more 
difficulties it will encounter demonstrating its effectiveness.    
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Selection of commissioners 
</b></p>
<p>53. Truth commissions derive their power to a large extent from the moral authority and 
competence of commissioners. Hence selecting suitable commissioners is a crucial factor in 
their good functioning. As selection modes vary greatly, this report will distinguish in a 
simple manner methods of direct selection from consultative procedures which formally 
involve a variety of stakeholders in the selection process.  
</p>
<p>54. Direct selection, usually by the same authority that establishes the commission&#8217;s 
mandate and without a process of formal consultations, has been used in a large number of 
cases, such as in Argentina,62 Chile,63 Peru64 and Brazil.65 Direct selection is however not a 
Latin-American phenomenon, as demonstrated by the Moroccan case, where the 
commissioners of IER were appointed directly, through a Royal Dahir, by King 
Mohammed VI.66 
</p>
<p>55. It is not only executive powers that have used direct selection. The draft transitional 
justice law currently being considered in Tunisia empowers the National Constituent 
Assembly, and, in first instance, a committee composed of the President or Vice-President 
of the Assembly and the presidents of the parliamentary blocs to appoint the 15 
commissioners, ensuring that each sex represents at least one third of the membership.67   
</p>
<p>56. On the opposite side of the spectrum lie selection processes that are by design 
consultative in nature. This approach has been adopted for the selection of commissioners 
in South Africa,68 Sierra Leone,69 Liberia,70 Timor-Leste71 and Kenya.72 The model involves 
</p>
<p>  
 62 Decree 187/83 (fn 32). Confirming the point that most cases do not fall squarely on either side of the 
</p>
<p>classificatory spectrum, the decree creates a 16-member commission, with ten members appointed by 
the President and three additional members to be appointed by each of the two chambers of Congress 
&#8220;as direct representatives of the people and of the Provinces of the Nation&#8221;. One of the chambers did 
not make any appointments. The design thus involved also the legislative power in the selection of 
commissioners (12 men and one woman finally appointed). 
</p>
<p> 63 In the Supreme Decree that established the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation of 
Chile, President Aylwin announced the names of the eight commissioners (six men, two women), 
designated its president, and even its executive secretary, see Supreme Decree No. 355, 25 April

</p>
<p>may or may not be the case. In Chile, for example, transitional justice measures had long been 
debated by the different parties of the coalition that won the elections which brought President 
Aylwin to power, and were part of the political platform of the coalition, so in this sense, the 
measures had been the subject of public deliberation. See Elizabeth Lira, The Reparations Policy for 
Human Rights Violations in Chile, in: de Greiff, <i>The Handbook of Reparations</i> (fn 49). On Tunisia, 
see the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on his visit to the country, A/HRC/24/42/Add.1.

<p>a selection panel with seats apportioned to the representatives of different stakeholders 
including victims&#8217; groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), professional 
associations, religious organizations, local leaders and even representatives of the 
international community. The panel accepts submissions from the public, determines a 
shortlist of candidates, orders them by rank, and passes on the recommendation to an 
appointing authority. In some countries public hearings with those shortlisted were also 
required.   
</p>
<p>57. A thorough analysis of the costs and benefits of the two selection methods is beyond 
the aim of this report. However, some observations are in order. First, there is no fail-safe 
method of selection. While the overwhelming majority of commissioners have made 
important contributions, neither method has proven to be immune from occasionally 
questionable appointments. Second, both selection methods, while entailing certain 
advantages, involve costs. Direct appointments are expeditious, but the method does not 
check for potential narrowness in the range of candidates considered by the appointing 
authority.   
</p>
<p>58. Countries have opted for consultative processes for reasons that include: increasing 
the representativeness of commission members, broadening the pool of candidates, 
strengthening popular &#8220;buy in&#8221; and legitimacy. Indeed, these are valid arguments that speak 
in favour of consultative procedures in many domains. There are, of course, negatives, such 
as the lengthy amount of time which the operation of selection mechanisms requires.73 A 
less explored risk relates to the incentives that consultative procedures create for 
overemphasizing &#8220;representativeness&#8221; as a criterion of selection.  
</p>
<p>59. The use of selection panels is certainly more appropriate than the effort to guarantee 
representation through the outright apportioning of commission&#8217;s seats on the basis of 
criteria relating to ethnicity, political or other type of affiliation. However, selection bodies 
that are designed to secure wide representation are themselves at risk of having a skewed 
membership whereby technical expertise in the core areas of work of a commission is 
secondary to types of affiliation. In such circumstances there are few reasons to expect 
these bodies to make their selection primarily on the basis of technical expertise.74   
</p>
<p>60. Emphasizing the representativeness of commissioners, their capacity to act as 
&#8220;stand-ins&#8221; for particular groups, or the appeal of particular individuals to a multiplicity of 
groups may not always serve a commission well. This is the case when records of some of 
these persons raise questions of conflict of interest given their connection with events or 
represented groups that the commission is likely to investigate; when the candidates&#8217; inter-
group appeal translates to unwillingness to take strong stands; or when they simply lack the 
technical capacity to make real contributions. Against this background, the Special 
Rapporteur calls for the development of international guidelines on incompatibilities, 
conflicts of interest, and moral fitness of individuals serving in truth commissions.     
</p>
<p>  
 71 Seven members (five men, two women), see, on the selection procedure, UNTAET/REG/2001/10 (fn 
</p>
<p>35), section 4.  
 72 Seven members (four men, three women), see TJRC Act of Kenya (fn 38), clauses 9, 10, and first 
</p>
<p>schedule. 
 73 Imposing narrow deadlines on consultative procedures defeats part of the purpose of establishing 
</p>
<p>them in the first place, see TJRC Act of Kenya (fn 38), first schedule.   
 74 The fact that selection panels are not responsible for appointments but merely for recommendations 
</p>
<p>also weakens the incentive to think about their selections in a way that would, at least <i>jointly</i>, cover 
the required technical competencies; they have no reason to think what a <i>group</i> of commissioners 
would look like from a technical perspective for the panels do not determine the composition of the 
commission as a whole.   </p>


<p>61. The design of selection procedures has received more attention than the selection 
criteria. To the extent that foundational documents of truth commissions mention criteria 
that commissioners have to satisfy &#8211; many do not &#8211; they include generalities relating to 
moral standing and reputation, rather than actual achievements in related areas or technical 
expertise. The Special Rapporteur urges those responsible for designing truth commission 
mandates, including selection mechanisms, to articulate more clearly the relevant criteria, 
beyond generalities concerning reputation. No position of comparable responsibility would 
be filled on the basis of such poorly defined standards.75    
</p>
<p>62. Of late, several truth commissions have included non-national members. The 
motivation for this seems to be twofold: to enlarge the pool of candidates, and to appoint 
individuals who are unrelated to local disputes. Generally, this has been a fruitful effort. 
However, the Special Rapporteur highlights that international appointments cannot make up 
for deficiencies in the selection procedures of truth commissioners.   
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Staffing, budgeting and management 
</b></p>
<p>63. Considering the actual lifespan of commissions and the immensity of their task, time 
is a scarce resource. Lengthening their operational mandate is not a viable solution in most 
cases.76 In this context, the preparatory period is crucial. Some commissions have been 
given a preparatory period of two to three months,77 which has proven to be insufficient, as 
many truth commissions are still dealing with operational matters well beyond this period. 
Extending the preparatory phase to about a six-month range would increase the likelihood 
that commissions would be able to discharge their substantive responsibilities during their 
allotted temporal mandate. This report emphasizes three sets of issues whose resolution 
during a preparatory period would have a positive impact on the subsequent performance of 
a commission. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Staffing 
</i></p>
<p>64. Staffing needs of a truth commission are related to many contextual factors, 
including the universe of cases to be addressed, the pre-existing work on those cases 
(largely by NGOs), the collaboration it receives from authorities and other former agents of 
violence and, importantly, the mandated goals of the commission. However, two general 
points can still be made. First, truth commissions have become large operations: 
CONADEP (1983) had 60 staff members, the staffing of many others was in the range of 
200-300, while CAVR (2002) had over 500 staff.78 Clearly, institutions with such large 
staff numbers require careful advance planning, budgeting and management, especially if 
they are to operate efficiently during a relatively short lifespan. Second, given current 
trends, commissions call for staff with multidisciplinary competences.79 As not all labour 
</p>
<p>  
 75 The criteria should be both positive (e.g., demonstrable commitment to and leadership in the cause of 
</p>
<p>human rights; demonstrated <i>accomplishments</i> in the area) as well as negative (e.g., demonstrable lack 
of conflict of interest &#8211; no prior membership in or support for an organization whose behaviour might 
be the subject of investigation by the commission).   
</p>
<p> 76 In addition to losing part of the signalling power, a very extended mandate makes commissions miss a 
window of opportunity that allows them to capitalize on the positive reformist impetus of transitional 
periods, increases the resource burden, and generates challenges associated with the rotation of 
personnel, including commissioners.  
</p>
<p> 77 See Hayner (fn 21), pp. 33, 43, 58.   
 78 Dates in parenthesis correspond to the year each commission started operations; numbers of staff at 
</p>
<p>peak-years, see Hayner (fn 21), pp. 268-273.   
 79 Aside from lawyers and other professionals familiar with criminal law; human rights, including 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights; and humanitarian law, truth commissions require competencies 
 </p>


<p>markets make specialists in all the required fields readily available, provisions should be 
made, ideally during the preparatory phase, for the hiring and training of staff. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Budgeting and procurement 
</i></p>
<p>65. Compared to other expenditures, such as security and military costs, truth 
commissions are relatively inexpensive. Nevertheless, they still require significant 
resources, the flow of which needs to be secured, ideally in advance. Some commissions 
have been greatly hampered by a scarcity of resources and unstable flows, which force 
them to scale back operations. To illustrate the quantities involved, the Chilean commission 
budgeted $1 million for nine months of operations; the commission in Sierra Leone, $4.7 
million for two years; the Liberian commission, $7.6 million for three and a half years; the 
Commission for Historical Clarification (CEH) in Guatemala, $9.5 million for one and a 
half years; the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Peru, $13.5 million for two years; 
and the South African commission had a budget of almost $18 million per year at the peak 
of its operations.80 The spread is large, but even the figures on the lower end require 
advance planning if they are going to be raised. 
</p>
<p>66. Second, most of these commissions required international assistance for (most of) 
their budgets. While the responsibility for planning belongs to truth commissions and 
accumulated experience suggests that commissions are often remiss or overtly optimistic 
regarding fundraising, the Special Rapporteur calls the attention of the international 
community to the need to assist truth commissions financially in expeditious, forward-
looking and reliable ways.   
</p>
<p>67. Third, when international agencies are involved in managing budgets of truth 
commissions, the latter have encountered difficulties gaining access to the funds. Given 
their short lifespans, commissions cannot afford, nor are they administratively configured to 
deal with the slow pace and the documentation-heavy, rule-laden procedures that 
characterize most international agencies. While commissions need to comply financially 
with standards of transparency, efficacy in the execution of plans is essential. The Special 
Rapporteur invites agencies that frequently support truth commissions to systematize and 
make available useful previous experiences concerning staffing, budgeting and 
procurement procedures.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Internal operations  
</i></p>
<p>68. Managerial and administrative functions have to be legally stipulated and both 
differentiated from, and related to, substantive functions. Commission presidents usually 
have legal responsibility for the overall operations. Experience has demonstrated that the 
assumption by presidents of large responsibility for the everyday management and 
administration is less than desirable; differentiating the administrative functions, delegating 
them to an executive director reporting to the presidency, is a more efficient arrangement.   
</p>
<p>69. Most commissions, particularly given the growing complexity of their mandates, 
come to establish different operational units, defined sometimes by topic81 or function82 and 
often by a combination of both. There is no formula for internal labour division that should 
be replicated regardless of context. It is crucial that in the preparatory phase the processes 
</p>
<p>  
in the following fields, among others: data entry, database design/ operation; translation; sociology, 
history, and anthropology (forensic and social); psychology and other trauma-related disciplines; 
gender; security sector experts (for witness protection, among other functions); development. 
</p>
<p> 80 See Hayner (fn 21), pp. 268-273.   
 81 E.g. reparations, disappearances, torture, gender violence. 
 82 E.g. investigations, public hearings, report writing. </p>


<p>of internal differentiation and harmonious integration are anticipated and resolved as much 
as possible.  
</p>
<p>70. Finally, truth commissions have often found it challenging to articulate the 
relationship between the commissioners. This issue inevitably involves a personal 
dimension, hence it is even less likely than the previously mentioned topics to be resolved 
through a formulaic approach. However, some structural factors can exacerbate potential 
frictions. A non-exhaustive list includes the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Appointment procedures that sacrifice competence for the sake of 
representativeness. These risk introducing into the nucleus of the commission 
prevailing political or social cleavages.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Loose internal regulations, or a protracted period before internal regulations are 
defined, which allow each commissioner to carve out his or her own functions 
independently of a coherent, shared plan.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ambiguous rules concerning the public role of commissioners and the authority to 
speak on its behalf.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unclear rules concerning relations between commissioners and different 
stakeholders both within and outside government.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Commissioners that act <i>ad honorem</i> and only part time, and who therefore need to 
keep their regular occupations, and hence allegiances to particular constituencies. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Ex post challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Implementation 
</b></p>
<p>71. Truth commissions have become the subject of increased criticism for the lack of 
follow-up on their recommendations. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that truth 
commissions are only in exceptional cases and in relation to only few initiatives, 
implementing agencies. As temporary bodies, most commissions will have ceased to exist 
at the time of implementation of their recommendations, a responsibility that lies primarily 
with governments.     
</p>
<p><i> (a) Articulating recommendations 
</i></p>
<p>72. The call for comprehensiveness regarding analysis and proposals for thorough 
institutional restructuring has led to a significant expansion in the length of commission 
reports, which poses a problem for them being used as policymaking tools.83 The main 
difficulty, however, is that in a short timespan no commission can make its 
recommendations on institutional design involving political, economic and legal 
dimensions truly &#8220;policy friendly&#8221;. In some cases, complex legislative action is not all that 
is required; constitutional reforms may also be necessary.84  
</p>
<p>  
 83 Again, even if not linear, the expansion in length of truth commission reports has led to documents 
</p>
<p>that virtually no policymaker will read in their entirety: the shortest report is that of the Commission 
on Truth for El Salvador, at 252 pages; CONADEP&#8217;s report was less than 500 pages long; Chile&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>TRC more than 1,100 pages; South Africa&#8217;s TRC more than 4500; Peru&#8217;s TRC almost 8,000; Sierra 
Leone&#8217;s TRC almost 1,900; East Timor&#8217;s CAVR more than 3200; Liberia&#8217;s TRC almost 1,400. 
</p>
<p> 84 Indeed, Sierra Leone&#8217;s TRC suggests the country should consider &#8220;the creation of a new 
constitution&#8221;, TRC of Sierra Leone, Witness to Truth (fn 40), vol. 2, ch. 3, para. 38.    </p>


<p>73. If commission mandates continue with the aforementioned expanded scope 
(something about which the Special Rapporteur reiterates his reservations), and the 
implementation of their recommendations by government agencies is to improve, then the 
competency of truth commissions in framing recommendations must improve. To this end, 
commissions will need to learn how to generate budgets and plans for their 
recommendations and increase their familiarity with how these relate to sectoral reform 
projects and development plans. They will need to engage earlier with different government 
agencies and development agents regarding the articulation of their recommendations in 
actionable ways. Similarly, it is critical for commissions to establish close relationships 
with civil society. In the end, the fate of recommendations depends to a large extent on the 
leadership, advocacy and persistence of civil society organizations.   
</p>
<p>74. By the same token, the Special Rapporteur calls on the international community, 
donors included, to examine their patterns of support &#8211; technical, financial, political &#8211; for 
truth commissions. He is concerned that as conflict wanes, but long before transformation is 
completed, support frequently wavers. Neither the cessation of conflict, nor the end of a 
truth commission&#8217;s duration, is reason for support to diminish, as the implementation of 
recommendations depends significantly on continued support.   
</p>
<p><i> (b) Follow-up to recommendations 
</i></p>
<p>75. Some cases demonstrate an attempt to &#8220;short cut&#8221; the problem of implementation by 
declaring in the mandates that the commissions&#8217; recommendations are legally binding. This 
includes those of Sierra Leone85 and Liberia.86 However, such attempted short cuts raise 
serious constitutional questions regarding the separation of powers, as commissions cannot 
order Parliament to enact certain laws, impose policies on the executive, or demand that 
prosecutors pursue particular cases and that courts hear them.87 The more far-reaching the 
recommendations are, the more they deal with issues that in democratic countries should be 
the subject of political contestation. Moreover, as empirical evidence demonstrates, 
proclaiming recommendations obligatory offers no guarantee for their implementation.   
</p>
<p>76. Over time, three different institutional solutions for follow up have been tried: (a) 
the creation of purpose-specific, stand-alone bodies, as witnessed in Chile88 and proposed in 
Peru;89 (b) the establishment of functional units within existing ministries, as observed in 
</p>
<p>  
 85 The mandate of Sierra Leone&#8217;s TRC states that &#8220;the Government shall faithfully and timeously 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations of the report that are directed to state bodies and encourage or 
facilitate the implementation of any recommendations that may be directed to others&#8221;, see The Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission Act 2000, Supplement to the Sierra Leone Gazette Vol. CXXXI, No. 
9, 10 February 2000, part V, art. 17. 
</p>
<p> 86 The Act that established Liberia&#8217;s TRC (fn 37) stipulates succinctly, &#8220;All recommendations shall be 
implemented,&#8221; section 48. 
</p>
<p> 87 The Liberian Supreme Court struck down article 48 of the TRC Act which made it mandatory for the 
government to implement the Commission&#8217;s recommendations. The Court concluded that the article 
</p>
<p>usurped the powers of other branches of government which was not authorized by the constitution, 
see <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Minister of Justice</i>, Attorney General, Independent National Human Rights 
Commission and Government of Liberia, Supreme Court of the Republic of Liberia, 21 January 2011; 
available at: www.mediafire.com/?u1n6zkqoxl1zn3o. 
</p>
<p> 88 For example, Chile&#8217;s Corporaci&#243;n Nacional de Reparaci&#243;n y Reconciliaci&#243;n is an example of a stand-
alone institution created specifically to complete the fact-finding, victim-tracing, and the reparation 
functions described in the mandate of the TRC.  
</p>
<p> 89 Peru&#8217;s TRC recommended the establishment of a temporary interministerial working group and a 
permanent autonomous body (Consejo Nacional de Reconciliaci&#243;n) attached to the presidency of the 
council of ministers, which would have as its responsibilities to coordinate national policies 
implementing the TRC&#8217;s recommendations, and to prepare draft bills that the executive could present 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Argentina;90 and (c) the assignment of follow-up responsibilities to independent human 
rights institutions, as seen in practice in Sierra Leone.91     
</p>
<p>77. Stand-alone official bodies have two main virtues: they can play a useful convening 
and coordinating role among specialized agencies and ministries, and, as autonomous 
bodies, they enjoy a certain degree of political independence. However, as agencies and 
ministries are not under their authority, in the face of recalcitrant attitudes, they prove to be 
feeble. Units within ministries, by contrast, can be effective implementers &#8211; but within their 
narrow domain of competencies, and provided political willingness exists. Finally, 
independent human rights bodies have more autonomy than stand-alone institutions and 
moral authority unmatched by either stand-alone bodies or units within ministries. 
Nevertheless, they tend to have narrow competencies and even less power to direct than 
stand-alone specialized official institutions.   
</p>
<p>78. Absent governmental commitment, an &#8220;institutional fix&#8221; to the lack of 
implementation of recommendations is unlikely. Discussions about follow up, however, 
have concentrated on institutional solutions rather than on functions. The urgent challenge 
is to strengthen the incentives governments have for implementation. This will not happen 
without a vigilant and involved civil society and a cooperative and yet demanding 
international community. Increased attention should be paid to monitoring the 
implementation of recommendations, because such processes can generate useful 
incentives, and because effective monitoring is in any case necessary for sound 
accountability. A good model of a monitoring mechanism is the interactive 
recommendation matrix established by the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone with 
the collaboration of the United Nations.92  
</p>
<p>79. There is an urgent need to strengthen the leverage of civil society with a view to 
improving the implementation record of governments. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages reflection on means available to truth commissions, governments and 
international donors to strengthen civil society. During their operation, commissions can 
strengthen civil society organizations and encourage the formation of networks of 
organizations. After their operation, they can recommend the establishment of regular 
forums where NGOs could share with governments the results of monitoring, which would 
strengthen the accountability of authorities for the effective implementation of 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Archives 
</b></p>
<p>80. Archives &#8211; both the commission&#8217;s own and general/national archives &#8211; are a natural 
extension of the life and legacy of a truth commission, and permanent in nature. They are 
instruments for realizing the right to truth.  
</p>
<p>  
to the legislature concerning four broad areas: reparations, historical memory, justice, and 
institutional reform, see Final Report (fn 39), vol. IX, ch. 2, sect. 4. This body, however, was never 
established. 
</p>
<p> 90 In Argentina, for example, responsibility for the implementation of the various reparation plans was 
eventually assigned to the Secretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos within the Ministry of Justice, Security, 
and Human Rights, see e.g., Mar&#237;a Jos&#233; Guembe, The Reparations for Grave Human Rights 
Violations: The Argentinian Experience, in de Greiff, <i>The Handbook of Reparations</i> (fn 49), p. 21.   
</p>
<p> 91 Not by design but by default, in Sierra Leone, the Human Rights Commission &#8211; the establishment of 
which was one of the recommendations of the TRC &#8211; has assumed the role of a Follow-up Committee 
envisaged by the Act, see TRC Act 2000 (fn 85), part V. 
</p>
<p> 92 Available at http://www.sierraleonetrc.org/index.php/resources/recommendations-matrix. </p>


<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes ongoing efforts by the Human Rights Council as 
well as by OHCHR93 to systematize existing standards in the area of access to information, 
protection and preservation of records, and management of archives.94 He welcomes 
particularly the role of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
in this regard. There are noteworthy efforts at the regional level, including by the Council 
of Europe.95  
</p>
<p>82. In many countries where truth commissions operate there are no pre-existing 
national archive laws or legislation regulating data access and privacy matters. 
Recommendations of truth commissions concerning these aspects contribute importantly to 
the promotion of human rights. In its final report, the IER of Morocco, for example, made 
recommendations about the preservation and organization of, and access to, national 
archives. Following these recommendations, an archive law was adopted in 2007 covering 
all records received and produced by the public service, including the Commission&#8217;s own 
records.96 A law on access to information is currently being prepared.97    
</p>
<p>83. The archives of commissions are, to a great extent, composed of victims&#8217; 
testimonies and statements. They are a means of guaranteeing that the voices of victims will 
not be lost, and they contribute to a culture of memorialization and remembrance. They also 
provide a safeguard against revisionism and denial &#8211; essential given the long duration and 
non-linearity of social reconciliation and integration processes. Furthermore, archives can 
play crucial roles in prosecutions, reparations and other transitional justice measures. These 
are important reasons for truth commission to prioritize early thinking on the establishment 
of their own and national archives by following up-to-date practices.  
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the balance between accessibility and 
openness of archives on the one hand, and confidentiality and privacy on the other, is not 
easy to achieve. Difficulties are exacerbated wherever security threats persist and data and 
document management infrastructures are weak. However, there are ways of achieving a 
proper balance, as suggested below.   
</p>
<p>85. An elemental question is the disposition of the archives. Commissions have 
stipulated that their archives should be deposited in national archives,98 be transferred either 
to ministries or to independent human rights institutions,99 be deposited in follow-up 
institutions,100 or transferred to the United Nations.101 The decision concerning the 
</p>
<p>  
 93 The Special Rapporteur would like to specifically highlight the OHCHR seminar on experience of 
</p>
<p>archives as a means to guarantee the right to the truth (2011), see report of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the seminar on experiences of archives as a means 
to guarantee the right to the truth, A/HRC/17/21. 
</p>
<p> 94 See Human Rights Council resolution 21/7 on the right to the truth, 10 October 2012; report of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: Implementation of the right to 
the truth, A/HRC/12/19 (2009).

a European policy on access to archives, 13 July 2000. 
</p>
<p> 96 Dahir Nr. 1-07-167.  
 97 The corresponding decrees implementing it should be elaborated and contain aspects relating to 
</p>
<p>accessing the archives of the Commission. 
 98 Which of course assumes their existence and (ideally) their good functioning. E.g., TRC of South 
</p>
<p>Africa, Report (fn 51), vol. 6, sect. 5, ch. 7, p. 729. 
 99 E.g., TRC of Sierra Leone, <i>Witness to Truth </i>(fn 40), vol. II, p. 203. In Peru, the mandate of the TRC 
</p>
<p>required it to transfer its archives to the national Ombudsman office: S.D., 065-2001-PCM, confirmed 
by Supreme Decree No. 101-201-PCM, 4 September 2001.  
</p>
<p> 100 E.g., CAVR, Final Report (fn 40), part 11, p. 44; Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission of 
Kenya, Final Report, vol. IV, pp. 76-77, available at: www.tjrckenya.org.   </p>


<p>repository of the archives is not inconsequential. Consideration should be given to the 
following factors:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Physical access. Transferring archives to far-away locations or abroad, even in a 
host institution with liberal access policies, puts non-digitalized sources out of reach 
for concerned populations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Preservation. Documents, even in digital form, need to be preserved, not simply 
warehoused.102  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The trustworthiness of the repository institution in the eyes of different stakeholders, 
including victims. Placing archives in institutions that are widely mistrusted by 
victims due to their past involvement in human rights violations, for example, 
generates powerful disincentives for victims and others to seek access to the 
archives or raises concerns about the accuracy of the contained information.  
</p>
<p>86. There is no uniformity in the criteria for obtaining access to archives. On one end of 
the spectrum are the archives of the CEH of Guatemala at the United Nations in New York, 
which require written authorization &#8220;signed by the Secretary-General in person&#8221; to open a 
sealed container prior to 1 January 2050.103 At the opposite end lie the archives of the truth 
commission of the Republic of Korea, which recommended that &#8220;the records should be 
utilized in extensive scale to find more facts and to be studied as historical sources&#8221;, and 
directed the repository to cooperate with all interested stakeholders.104 Most commissions&#8217; 
archives lie between these extremes, some limiting access to parts of the archives, 
particularly witness statements105 and material that may disclose the identities of child 
</p>
<p>  
 101 See ST/SGB/1999/6, whereby Secretary General Annan established &#8220;a special regime for the 
</p>
<p>management, utilization, preservation and disposition of the documents, records and other materials 
of the Commission for Historical Clarification&#8221; in the archives of the United Nations in New York.  
</p>
<p> 102 All the records transferred from Guatemala&#8217;s CEH to the United Nations in New York are sealed, and 
as far as anyone can tell, not even preservation efforts have been carried out. See, e.g., Trudy 
Peterson, <i>Final Act</i> (2005), pp. 74ff. Aside from technical aspects relating to preservation there is the 
question of the sheer physical safety of the archives, which have become an issue in different 
countries.   
</p>
<p> 103 See Secretary-General&#8217;s bulletin, Commission for Historical Clarification, ST/SGB/1999/6, 8 June 
</p><p>1999. The Oslo Peace Agreement between the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad 
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) stipulated that the &#8220;Commission&#8217;s proceedings shall 
be confidential so as to guarantee the secrecy of the sources and the safety of witnesses and 
informants.&#8221;  This, in itself, however, does not call for totally sealed archives, as is made plain by the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s bulletin, which contains an exception for records &#8220;specifically designated by the 
Coordinator of the Commission as being for the public domain&#8221;, although no such designation 
</p>
<p>appears to have been ever made, see Oslo Peace Accords, 23 June 1994, Agreement on the 
Establishment of the Commission to Clarify Past Human Rights Violations and Acts of Violence that 
have Caused the Guatemalan Population to Suffer, Operation, para. IV. For an in-depth description on

which documents can be accessed.107 
</p>
<p>87. Considering first the importance of the information contained in national and truth 
commission archives and their contribution to the realization of the right to truth and the 
other measures under the mandate, and second the technological advances in archiving, 
which allow for selected blocking of parts of documents &#8211; including names and other 
markers of individual identity &#8211; the Special Rapporteur encourages truth commissions to 
adopt in their recommendations policies that maximize access consistent with 
considerations of privacy and personal safety.   
</p>
<p>88. Against this background and the inconsistencies in practice, the Special Rapporteur 
calls for the development of international standards on this matter.    
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Art exhibits and other cultural interventions 
</b></p>
<p>89. Finally, the Special Rapporteur highlights art exhibits and other cultural and social 
activities that involve victims and civil society, as they have the potential to extend the life 
of truth commissions&#8217; work. Most transitional justice work targets institutional change. It is 
clear, however, that the transformations that will be required to redress past and prevent 
future violations also call for changes in attitude. This is what these initiatives are intended 
to do, and when they have been tried, they have been particularly effective. Examples 
include Yuyanapaq, the photography exhibit organized by the Peruvian truth 
commission,108 the poster exhibition organized by CAVR,109 and the National Vision 
project organized by the truth commission of Sierra Leone.110 The Special Rapporteur 
encourages activities which occupy and enhance a moral space vacated in the aftermath of 
atrocities and that have the potential of strengthening bonds of solidarity within society &#8211; so 
crucial in the wake of repression or conflict.111

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The right to truth requires States, in the aftermath of atrocities, to establish 
mechanisms and procedures empowered to seek information, ascertain facts and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively reveal the truth about what has happened, thereby contributing to the fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against impunity, the strengthening of the rule of law, and ultimately reconciliation.  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> Truth-seeking mechanisms, in particular State-sanctioned truth commissions, 
can be important instruments for the redress of gross and systematic human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations and serious violations of humanitarian law when implemented in a

<p><b>comprehensive manner. Truth commissions give voice to victims and affirm their 
</b></p>
<p><b>status as rights holders, contribute to social integration, help set reform priorities, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide essential information in realizing other transitional justice measures.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The appeal of truth commissions has not waned, but they face serious 
challenges, not limited to post-conflict situations. The Special Rapporteur calls 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the overburdening of commissions as manifested by their difficulties in 
</b></p>
<p><b>delivering on their objectives within the mandated deadlines; controversies 
</b></p>
<p><b>surrounding the aptness of particular commissioners, and discord among them; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>abiding critiques about poor implementation of their recommendations.   
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> Mandates of truth commissions have suffered significant expansion: 
commissions are expected to address a significantly broader array of violations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>occurring over longer periods of time, in more complex settings. One very positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>dimension of the expansion of the thematic mandate of truth commissions relates to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the specific attention they have increasingly paid to women</b>&#8217;<b>s rights.  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The functions of commissions have also considerably expanded: whereas 
commissions used to concentrate on fact-finding and victim-tracing (and made 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations concerning victim redress and prevention), these functions have not 
</b></p>
<p><b>only grown significantly in complexity, but new functions have been added. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissions are now expected to provide comprehensive analysis of whole contexts 
</b></p>
<p><b>and underlying causes. Furthermore, their preventive function now goes beyond 
</b></p>
<p><b>making basic reform proposals regarding institutions actually involved in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations. Rather, they are expected to generate comprehensive, structural reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>proposals. Given these trends, it should come as no surprise that commissions are 
</b></p>
<p><b>finding it increasingly difficult to satisfy growing expectations.   
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> Moreover, the expansion in the functions of commissions appears almost open-
ended. Two functions under consideration deserve special comment. First, a potential 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitration role for truth commission concerning cases of corruption has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>suggested. The Special Rapporteur notes the enormous administrative burden, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge in guaranteeing fair quasi-judicial procedures, the reputational risks, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the tensions with the investigative function concerning human rights violations of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>truth commission this combination may generate.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Second, some commissions under consideration are expected to achieve 
reconciliation with an emphasis on victim-perpetrator pardon procedures. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures will impose a huge burden on, and serious risks for, victims, raise 
</b></p>
<p><b>questions about the voluntary nature of pardons, and are not designed to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>systemic and structural dimension of violations, thus falling short of ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation at societal level. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The tendency to expand the mandates of commissions, especially when not 
supported by adequate funding, multidisciplinary expertise of the commissioners and 
</b></p>
<p><b>staff, and a sufficiently long preparatory period, is particularly challenging.   
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Truth commissions derive their power, to a large extent, from the moral 
authority and the expertise of commissioners, hence the selection of commissioners is 
</b></p>
<p><b>crucial to their success. Neither direct nor consultative procedures have prevented 
</b></p>
<p><b>some questionable appointments. Appointment procedures that insufficiently vet 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissioners for professionalism, integrity and expertise or that prioritize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>partisan political affiliation or ethnic identities of commissioners (likely to track 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevailing political or social cleavages) continue to generate challenges to 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissions. Apportioning seats within the commission to individuals who are meant 
</b></p>
<p><b>to represent particular constituencies invites posturing and </b>&#8220;<b>block voting</b>&#8221;<b>. </b></p>


<p><b>Additionally, more thought has been given to appointment procedures than to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>underlying crucial criteria for selection. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> As temporary bodies, truth commissions are, in general, not the implementing 
agencies of their own recommendations. This responsibility lies primarily on 
</b></p>
<p><b>governments. Since attempted institutional fixes to the follow-up problem have not 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteed the implementation of the recommendations, efforts should concentrate on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the underlying function, which is to increase the accountability of governments.    
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> However, the likelihood that ex post, commission recommendations will be 
heeded would improve if commissions strengthened their capability to frame 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations in actionable terms. Furthermore, as experience has shown, in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>end, the fate of recommendations depends largely on the leadership, advocacy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>persistence of civil society organizations. Commissions should engage with such 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations as early as possible, and do whatever is in their power to strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>them.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Commissions can significantly increase their impact by making contributions to 
the establishment of reliable and accessible archives </b>&#8211;<b> both those of truth commissions 
</b></p>
<p><b>themselves as well as national archives. Finally, commissions are well placed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage and support cultural manifestations, art exhibits, memorials and museums, 
</b></p>
<p>which enhance society&#8217;s understanding of the plight and the strength of <b>victims, 
</b></p>
<p><b>empower them, and foster the formation of a culture of rights.   
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations   
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> On mandates, the Special Rapporteur urges States and other actors responsible 
for the design of mandates, including, when applicable, international actors, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercise prudence in the drafting of mandates of truth commissions, which involves:   
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Heeding basic considerations of functional adequacy: commissions 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not be laden with objectives which they have no means to satisfy. The trend of 
</b></p>
<p><b>moving away from assigning commissions discrete, specific functions, towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>assigning to them open-ended objectives that cannot be satisfied needs to be stemmed;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Paying renewed attention to the victim-tracing function, recalling the 
</b></p>
<p><b>significant contribution that earlier truth commissions made to this task, and recent 
</b></p>
<p><b>advances in forensics; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensuring that truth commissions continue to dedicate specific attention 
</b></p>
<p>to women&#8217;s rights and adopt a gender<b>-based approach in their design and 
</b></p>
<p><b>functioning;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Recognizing that reconciliation is not a function commissions can bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>about on their own. In particular, perpetrator-victim pardon procedures place undue 
</b></p>
<p><b>burdens on victims and cannot redress the systemic and structural dimension of 
</b></p>
<p><b>atrocities, which constitute an attack against the very principle of the rule of law;    
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Treating with caution the assignment of arbitration functions to a truth 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission, and inviting States instead to consider establishing functionally 
</b></p>
<p><b>differentiated, albeit significantly coordinated, bodies dedicated to corruption cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other economic crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> On the selection of commissioners, the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Recalls the importance of making correct choices, given that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authority and legitimacy of truth commissions depends heavily on the qualities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>standing of commissioners. At the same time, he notes that there is no currently </b></p>


<p><b>employed selection procedure that necessarily guarantees good outcomes or one that 
</b></p>
<p><b>cannot be foiled;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Underlines that consultative methods of selection, while reflecting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>very idea of inclusive transitional justice measures, should not be set up in ways that 
</b></p>
<p><b>overemphasize criteria of representativeness at the expense of competence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Calls for a clearer articulation of the relevant selection criteria of 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissioners, which must include professionalism, integrity and expertise, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition to reputation, as fundamental criteria. Whether direct appointment or 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultative procedures are employed to select commissioners, a careful balance 
</b></p>
<p><b>between expediency and representativeness must be ensured, with competence as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>guiding principle; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Recommends the development of international guidelines on 
</b></p>
<p><b>incompatibilities, conflicts of interest and ethical standards for truth commissioners.  
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> On staffing, budgeting and management, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Given the increased complexity of the functions of truth commissions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which has led to an expansion of their staff sizes and composition, their budgets, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their internal operations, the proper setting up of a commission predictably takes 
</b></p>
<p><b>time. As preparatory periods of two to three months have proven insufficient, this 
</b></p>
<p><b>period should be extended to about six months; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The international community should assist truth commissions financially 
</b></p>
<p><b>in expeditious and reliable ways and not overburden commissions with slow-paced, 
</b></p>
<p><b>documentation-heavy, rule-laden procedures affecting the disbursement of funds. At 
</b></p>
<p><b>the same time, truth commissions are required to make use of the funding in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible and transparent manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Donor States and agencies should systematize and make available 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant experiences concerning staffing, budgeting and procurement procedures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Those responsible for the design and operation of truth commissions 
</b></p>
<p><b>should take measures that facilitate the harmonious and efficient operation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissions and that prevent the emergence of internal fractures. Adopting efficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>means of vetting commissioners for professionalism, integrity and expertise; avoiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>appointments on the basis of criteria that will likely reproduce existing social 
</b></p>
<p><b>cleavages; adopting promptly provisions that define the public role of commissioners 
</b></p>
<p><b>and their relationship with different stakeholders; and making the posts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissioners full-time, paid positions are some of the measures that help mitigate 
</b></p>
<p><b>internal tensions.   
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> On recommendations and follow-up, the Special Rapporteur urges: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) </b>States to meet their responsibility of implementing a truth commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>recommendations, most adequately through a robust network of implementing 
</b></p>
<p><b>entities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Truth commissions, especially if their functions retain the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>breadth, to increase their own competencies in budget generation and planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>articulate recommendations aligned with sectoral reform projects and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>plans, to increase the likelihood that their recommendations will be seriously 
</b></p>
<p><b>considered and implemented by State agencies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Civil society (unhindered and enabled by governments) to assume its 
</b></p>
<p><b>vigilant and involved role, and the international community its cooperative and yet </b></p>


<p><b>demanding functions, so as to increase the incentives for governments to implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission recommendations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Truth commissions and civil society to establish close and stable 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation between them during the work of a commission, cooperation that should 
</b></p>
<p><b>extend to follow-up mechanisms. Civil society organizations should play a 
</b></p>
<p><b>fundamental role in monitoring implementation, and their training, support and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening should represent a priority for donors within a comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>transitional justice approach.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>On archives and other means of extending the life of a commission, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States to opt for archiving modalities that maximize access to all 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, in compliance with the rights to privacy and personal security, 
</b></p>
<p><b>convinced that the establishment of truth commission and national archives 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute in a substantial manner to realizing the right to truth and may further 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal prosecutions, reparation, and institutional and personnel reforms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Technological advances in archiving that allow for selected blocking of parts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>documents should be utilized, and good practices gathered by expert bodies should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>applied. The Special Rapporteur calls for the development of international standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>on archiving and strongly supports such an initiative;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Truth commissions, States and donors to plan, finance or otherwise 
</b></p>
<p><b>support cultural interventions, including art exhibitions and memorials, which can 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to providing recognition for victims, ensuring them a role in the public 
</b></p>
<p><b>sphere, and generally foster a culture of rights.
