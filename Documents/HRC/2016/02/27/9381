</b></p>
<p><b>President&#8217;s Statement 6/PRST/1. Situation of human rights in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p> At the 21st meeting, on 28 September 2007, the President of the Council made 
</p>
<p>a statement reading as follows: 
</p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council welcomes the return to the rule of 
</p>
<p>constitutional law in the Republic of Haiti, as evidenced by the election of the 
</p>
<p>President of the Republic, the restoration of an elected Parliament, the appointment, 
</p>
<p>endorsed by Parliament, of a Prime Minister, and the holding of municipal elections. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council commends the Haitian authorities on their commitment 
</p>
<p>and efforts to improve living conditions for Haitians through measures such as greater 
</p>
<p>regard for human rights and cooperation between the Haitian National Police and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in curbing violence. 
</p>
<p>3. The Council is nonetheless aware of the many challenges that Haiti is 
</p>
<p>facing. It encourages the international community to continue supporting the efforts of 
</p>
<p>the elected authorities, and encourages those authorities to make use of the resources 
</p>
<p>and expertise placed at their disposal. 
</p>
<p>4. The Council takes note of the difficulties encountered and the efforts 
</p>
<p>made by the Haitian authorities. 
</p>
<p>5. While still concerned at the persistent criminal activity in some parts of 
</p>
<p>the country, the Council notes with satisfaction the steps taken to counter corruption 
</p>
<p>and drug-trafficking. It welcomes current efforts to correct irregularities in the police 
</p>
<p>and justice systems, and encourages the Haitian authorities to continue them, bringing 
</p>
<p>to fruition their plans for stronger inspection units within the police and justice 
</p>
<p>systems, regulations to govern the judiciary, the establishment of a High Council of 
</p>
<p>the Judiciary and the reopening of the Judicial Training College, an end to prolonged 
</p>
<p>detention and improved conditions in detention, the introduction of a legal aid scheme 
</p>
<p>and better staffed forensic science and forensic medical services. It notes with </p>

<p>satisfaction the proposal for a steady improvement in relations between the Office of 
</p>
<p>Citizen Protection and the MINUSTAH Human Rights Section. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council also welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; plans to pass a 
</p>
<p>series of laws on the status of women and reforms of the civil registry and land 
</p>
<p>registry systems. 
</p>
<p>7. The Council encourages the international community to step up its 
</p>
<p>activities in all these areas and in human rights training and education for the security 
</p>
<p>forces. 
</p>
<p>8. The Council thanks the independent expert appointed by the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General to consider the human rights situation in Haiti for his report (A/HRC/4/3). It 
</p>
<p>encourages the expert to continue his mission and report thereon to the Council at its 
</p>
<p>eighth session. It encourages the Haitian authorities to continue to cooperate with the 
</p>
<p>independent expert and put his recommendations into effect.
