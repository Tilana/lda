<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in Colombia</b>* ** 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report analyses the most important developments related to the situation 
of human rights and international humanitarian law in Colombia in 2010. The 2010 
electoral process concluded with the election of a new Congress and of President Juan 
Manuel Santos Calder&#243;n, who took office in August. 
</p>
<p> The report recognizes the commitment to human rights expressed by the Santos 
administration during its first months in office and welcomes the consolidation of the 
drastic reduction in the practice known as &#8220;false positives&#8221;, which resulted in extrajudicial 
killings. Other positive steps are the announcement of an ambitious land restitution policy 
and a more favourable stance towards human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p> The persistence of the internal armed conflict continues to affect the full enjoyment 
of human rights. All parties to the armed conflict, in particular guerrilla groups, continue to 
breach international humanitarian law. This situation is exacerbated by the violence caused 
by illegal armed groups emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organizations, and 
disputes among illegal armed actors to control drug trafficking. 
</p>
<p> The report further analyses several particular situations of concern and summarizes 
the main activities carried out by OHCHR-Colombia. It contains 11 recommendations to 
improve the human rights situation in the country.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In October 2010, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
Government renewed for three years the 1996 agreement that established the office in 
Colombia (OHCHR-Colombia), emphasizing all aspects of the original mandate. It was 
also agreed to assist the Government in establishing a national human rights centre to 
support human rights and international humanitarian law policies. 
</p>
<p>2. The High Commissioner wishes to express her appreciation to the Colombian 
authorities and civil society for receiving and collaborating with her office and expresses 
her gratitude to the countries and organizations that supported the office during the past 13 
years.  
</p>
<p>3. OHCHR-Colombia continued to observe the human rights situation, to provide legal 
advice and technical cooperation, and to promote human rights and international 
humanitarian law in the context of the internal armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>4. Upon invitation of the Government, the independent expert on minority issues and 
the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues visited Colombia. The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the Human Rights Committee reviewed the human rights situation in Colombia 
and formulated important recommendations.  
</p>
<p>5. On 12 October, Colombia was elected as a non-permanent member to the Security 
Council for 2011-2012. This, together with the openness to international scrutiny and the 
political will of the new Government, should translate into actions aimed at improving the 
country&#8217;s human rights situation. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>6. The first half of 2010 was influenced by the electoral process. On 26 February, the 
Constitutional Court rejected the possibility of a new re-election of then-President &#193;lvaro 
Uribe. Elections for Congress were held on 14 March in a generally calm atmosphere, 
despite some reports about irregularities. A second round of the presidential elections on 20 
June resulted in the election of Juan Manuel Santos Calder&#243;n, who took office on 7 August 
as President. 
</p>
<p>7. President Santos expressed his commitment towards human rights, highlighted the 
importance of economic and social rights and announced an ambitious land restitution 
policy. He also promised to engage in social dialogue and political consensus-building as a 
matter of principle for his presidency. Some of the first positive measures taken by the new 
administration are an act to pay homage to victims of enforced disappearance1 and a new 
Military Criminal Code that excludes human rights violations from military jurisdiction; a 
victims&#8217; draft act that includes the restitution of stolen lands; and improvement in the 
relationship between the executive branch and civil society and the judicial branch, as well 
as with Ecuador and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>8. Other developments impacting human rights and international humanitarian law in 
the context of the armed conflict include public reflections about possibilities for peace-
related initiatives of the Government of President Santos2 and guerrilla groups;3 the death in 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Act 1408 of 9 August 2010. 
 2 As conditions for considering an eventual peace process, the Government demanded that guerrilla 
 </p>


<p>combat of some of the most important military commanders of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia &#8211; People&#8217;s Army (FARC-EP); the rescue and release of kidnapped 
persons; and increased hostilities in the second half of the year.  
</p>
<p>9. In the last quarter of the year, intense rains and widespread flooding created an 
emergency situation that affected over 2.2 million Colombians. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights defenders, trade unionists and journalists  
</b></p>
<p>10. OHCHR-Colombia is concerned about the continuing homicides, threats, attacks, 
information theft, illegal surveillance and intimidation targeting human rights defenders and 
their organizations in different parts of the country. Victims include community defenders 
and leaders, members of Juntas de Acci&#243;n Comunal, Afro-Colombians and indigenous 
peoples, municipal ombudspersons, trade union members, staff of the National 
Ombudsperson&#8217;s Early Warning System (EWS) and journalists. These acts have been 
attributed to State agents, members of post-demobilization groups, and members of FARC-
EP and the National Liberation Army (ELN).  
</p>
<p>11. Of particular concern are the homicides, threats and harassment against those 
advocating for the rights of displaced persons, in particular leaders of women&#8217;s groups, and 
for the restitution of lands, especially in Cauca, Sucre and Urab&#225;. The murders of Rogelio 
Mart&#237;nez, Alexander Quintero and Oscar Maussa, who had received threats and had 
protection measures while working on land restitution cases, are illustrative of this 
situation. 
</p>
<p>12. The killing of trade unionists continues to be of concern. In 2010, 26 persons were 
killed, compared to 25 in 2009. The deaths of non-affiliated teachers increased from 4 to 
11.4 A total of 1,433 members of the union movement are covered by the Protection 
Programme of the Ministry of Interior and Justice. In 2010, one journalist was killed and 45 
threats against journalists were registered.5 
</p>
<p>13. Most criminal investigations initiated by the Attorney General in cases where the 
victims were human rights defenders, have had limited results. Furthermore, the Procurator 
General&#8217;s Office has not obtained visible results in its disciplinary investigations, despite 
public commitments to make progress. Serious and urgent efforts are needed to clarify 
these cases and establish responsibilities.  
</p>
<p>14. The prosecution and arbitrary detentions of human rights defenders on the basis of 
uncorroborated information provided mainly by informants, demobilized persons and 
military intelligence reports, continue to be of concern. In Arauca human rights defenders 
who had been detained up to over two years were acquitted for lack of evidence or after 
being declared innocent of the charges. Following their release, they continued to be 
stigmatized and threatened. 
</p>
<p>  
groups release all kidnapped persons and minors in their ranks, and end the use of anti-personnel 
mines and terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p> 3 Declarations by FARC-EP in July and September, and by the National Liberation Army in October. 
 4 Presidential Programme for Human Rights. The Unitary Workers Union (CUT) reported 38 killings, 
</p>
<p>including non-affiliated teachers. 
 5 Information provided by Freedom of the Press Foundation. </p>


<p>15. OHCHR-Colombia appreciates the Protection Programme of the Ministry of Interior 
and Justice. However, delays in assessing risks, slow implementation of measures, absence 
of a differential approach, and transfer of protection schemes to private companies continue 
to be of concern. Moreover, reforms introduced in May hindered the implementation of 
protection measures. Overall, protection programmes must be reformed to allow greater 
flexibility and effectiveness, and to include public officials, such as EWS staff, and persons 
involved in land restitution processes.  
</p>
<p>16. Implementation of agreements reached by the previous Government in the National 
Round Table on Guarantees for human rights defenders remains insufficient. As part of an 
effort to create an environment of respect for human rights, significant steps to implement 
the National Plan for Education on Human Rights (PLANEDH) should be taken by the 
Ministry of Education. The High Commissioner welcomes the inclusion of PLANEDH in 
the new National Development Plan 2010-2014 and encourages all parties to agree on a 
national action plan as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>17. Since August, OHCHR-Colombia has noted a positive change in attitude and 
discourse by government authorities towards human rights organizations, which the 
Government has called &#8220;the disarmament of words&#8221;. One visible expression of this new 
atmosphere is the signing, under the leadership of the Vice-President, of the Joint 
Declaration by the Government, Procurator General, National Ombudsperson, other State 
Entities, Civil Society and the International Community: Towards a Comprehensive Human 
Rights and International Humanitarian Law Policy.6  
</p>
<p><b> B. Intelligence services 
</b></p>
<p>18. In 2010, a former director of the Department of National Security (DAS) was 
brought to trial on charges of, inter alia, homicide and threats. Investigations continued on 
other former directors for illegal surveillance between 2005 and 2008. Statements by DAS 
senior personnel implicated former senior officials of the President&#8217;s office as beneficiaries 
of the illegally obtained information. 
</p>
<p>19. The information received by OHCHR-Colombia confirms the existence of a pattern 
of wiretapping, surveillance and systematic harassment by DAS officials, under orders from 
their superiors, to whom they reported their findings. These investigations appear to suggest 
that both the so-called G-3 group and the National and International Observation Group 
(GONI), whose members allegedly committed these illegal acts, indeed constituted formal 
structures within the institution. Furthermore, illegal activities were allegedly funded with 
DAS resources, the use of which required approval by the directors of the institution. 
</p>
<p>20. In October, the Procurator General sanctioned seven former DAS officials, an 
official from the Information and Financial Analysis Unit and one from the President&#8217;s 
office for serious breaches of discipline for wiretapping and illegal surveillance. 
</p>
<p>21. In November, a former DAS director was granted political asylum in Panama, as she 
invoked a lack of due judicial and security guarantees. The High Commissioner believes 
that this should not hinder investigations or contribute to impunity of alleged crimes.  
</p>
<p>22. The reforms of the intelligence services continued in 2010 with limited results. The 
National Police took steps to implement a data protection system to prevent the collection 
and storage of information that could violate human rights. The Armed Forces are in an 
</p>
<p>  
 6 See www.vicepresidencia.gov.co/Noticias/2010/Documents/101122_DecConferenciaNalDDHH.pdf.  </p>


<p>initial stage of designing similar procedures. No significant progress has been made by the 
Procurator General or the intelligence services in purging files.  
</p>
<p>23. Impunity and lack of democratic controls allow intelligence services to continue 
carrying out illegal and clandestine operations. OHCHR-Colombia continued to receive 
information on interception of e-mails, illegal surveillance, harassment and threats, 
information theft, modification of Web pages and break-ins into offices and homes of 
different civil society organizations, in some cases allegedly by members of military 
intelligence agencies. These acts, as well as those reported in 2009, remain unpunished. 
</p>
<p>24. Efficient mechanisms for independent oversight and control of intelligence services 
should be established and must be fully funded and legally empowered. In November 2010, 
the Constitutional Court ruled that the so-called &#8220;Intelligence Act&#8221; of 2009 was 
unconstitutional, due to formal flaws in its Parliamentary approval procedure.7 This, 
however, should not prevent the Government from expediting the intelligence reforms 
proposed in 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Extrajudicial executions  
</b></p>
<p>25. In 2010, the drastic reduction in the number of persons presented as killed in combat 
while under the custody of the Army, known as &#8220;false positives&#8221;, was consolidated. The 
High Commissioner considers it essential to advance in the judicial proceedings on past 
violations and to conduct an in-depth analysis of their causes, as a guarantee of non-
repetition.  
</p>
<p>26. The judicial rulings handed down to date8 confirm that these accusations were not 
false, as claimed by some politicians and members of the military. The National Human 
Rights Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office is investigating 1,488<b> </b>cases with 2,547 
victims. More than 400<b> </b>additional<b> </b>cases are being investigated through its sectional units. 
More than 448<b> </b>active cases still remain in the military justice system. Moreover, an 
unknown number of cases in the military justice may have been closed without taking 
appropriate judicial action. Based on the available data on cases and victims, OHCHR-
Colombia estimates that more than 3,000 persons9 may have been victims of extrajudicial 
executions, primarily attributed to the Army. The majority of these killings were carried out 
between 2004 and 2008. 
</p>
<p>27. The &#8220;judicial truth&#8221; behind extrajudicial executions, repeatedly demanded and 
supported by the Ministry of Defence, is essential, but not sufficient. Presidential 
sanctioning of the new Military Criminal Code in August was a positive step, since its 
article 3 confirms that human rights and international humanitarian law violations are not 
service-related acts and should, therefore, be prosecuted in the ordinary justice system. It is 
imperative that the military justice immediately transfer all cases of possible human rights 
violations to the ordinary justice system, and that cases that were closed by the military 
justice without proper investigation be revisited. 
</p>
<p>28. In this context, the significant decrease in the transfer of cases of persons &#8220;killed in 
combat&#8221; with signs of human rights violations from the military justice to the ordinary 
</p>
<p>  
 7 Decision C-913-2010. 
 8 To 15 October, of 125 rulings in cases assigned to the National Human Rights Unit of the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General, 22 were acquittals. 
 9 Estimate based on the number of cases under investigation by the Attorney General, plus the active 
</p>
<p>cases and the uncertain number of cases in the military justice system, taking into account that there is 
more than one victim in most of the cases. </p>


<p>justice system during 2010 is of great concern. Moreover, information received indicates 
that the transfer and dismissal of some military judges may be related to their collaboration 
with the ordinary justice system. 
</p>
<p>29. Members of security forces accused of serious human rights violations, as any other 
person, are entitled to due process. There are, however, doubts whether this right is upheld 
when soldiers accused of participating in extrajudicial executions are represented by the so-
called Military Defence (DEMIL). There are indications that DEMIL tries to prioritize 
certain interests of the military institution over defendants&#8217; rights. For example, the accused 
are prevented from confessing their involvement in the crimes and are thus unable to plea 
bargain for reduced sentences, and from making statements regarding the involvement of 
other members of the Army. 
</p>
<p>30. In the light of the above, the continued denial of extrajudicial executions by some 
members of the security forces and the attacks against those within the institution who 
collaborate with the justice system are of great concern. Therefore, it is essential that 
civilian and military authorities at the highest level unequivocally support these members of 
the security forces who collaborate with judicial processes, and design a protocol to protect 
them. It is further necessary to apply exemplary sanctions against those who disregard the 
Ministry of Defence&#8217;s human rights policy, and to guarantee that there are no setbacks to 
the measures adopted.10  
</p>
<p>31. Deaths due to excessive use of force by members of security forces, especially the 
National Police, or as a consequence of collusion with criminal groups continued to occur 
in 2010. In this regard, OHCHR-Colombia appreciates the willingness of the National 
Police to adequately address such cases. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Illegal armed groups that emerged after demobilization of paramilitary 
organizations  
</b></p>
<p>32. OHCHR-Colombia noted with concern the increase in the violence caused by illegal 
armed groups in 2010. The Ministry of Defence authorized its Armed Forces to support the 
National Police to combat six of these groups.11 Members of these groups committed 
homicides, threats, extortion, and acts of sexual violence and caused individual and 
collective forced displacement. Of particular concern is the drastic increase in massacres 
(40 per cent), in the context of violent disputes among and within these groups.12 In 
C&#243;rdoba, 10 massacres were registered in eight months, 5 of which occurred in October and 
November. 
</p>
<p>33. These groups are motivated primarily by economic gain from illicit activities. They 
enforce &#8220;social control&#8221; and operate in similar ways to organized crime. Although they do 
not seem to have a clear or coherent ideology or political motivation, they sometimes use 
the language and paraphernalia of paramilitary groups and their modus operandi. 
</p>
<p>34. Victims include social leaders, human rights defenders and public officials who 
confront these groups, as well as indigenous and Afro-Colombian persons. Other victims 
are those who refuse to collaborate, who denounce groups to the authorities or who possess 
property or request restitution of lands of interest to the groups. Attacks have also targeted 
</p>
<p>  
 10 For example, the decrease in the number of operational legal advisers. 
 11 Los Paisas, Los Urabe&#241;os, Popular Revolutionary Anti-terrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC), 
</p>
<p>Renacer, Los Rastrojos and Los Machos. 
 12 By November, the Presidential Programme for Human Rights had recorded 38 massacres with 179 
</p>
<p>victims. In 2009, it recorded 27 massacres with 139 victims.  </p>


<p>those who were perceived as collaborating with or belonging to rival groups or to security 
forces, or who happened to be in an area of dispute. 
</p>
<p>35. Of particular concern is the widespread use of children and adolescents by these 
groups in all type of activities, including <i>sicariato </i>killings, and the sexual violence 
committed against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR-Colombia has identified cases in Antioquia, C&#243;rdoba and Meta in which, 
as a result of corruption or threats, these groups have benefited from the acquiescence, 
tolerance and even collusion of members of security forces, including the National Police. 
At the same time, the Police have carried out some successful operations against leaders of 
these groups. 
</p>
<p>37. The High Commissioner recommends the adoption of policies and measures that not 
only increase the number of security forces officials, but also combat corruption within 
their ranks, strengthen the judiciary, improve protection for the population, and adopt 
social, educational and employment generation policies for those at risk of recruitment.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>38. While some progress was made during 2010, the realization of victims&#8217; rights 
continues to be insufficient. The Historical Memory Group of the National Commission for 
Reparation and Reconciliation presented four new reports that contributed to upholding the 
right to truth. Despite such important academic work, progress under Act 975 of 2005 
continues to be slim: less than 54 per cent of the defendants, approximately 4.5 per cent of 
the demobilized persons,13 contributed to the right to truth through voluntary depositions. 
While their confessions revealed a significant number of homicides, they did not give a 
complete picture of the diversity, context and systematic nature of violations committed by 
paramilitary organizations. 
</p>
<p>39. In June, a first ruling under Act 975 yielded the maximum alternative sentence 
(eight years) for two paramilitaries with partial indictments for several crimes. Also for the 
first time, this ruling provided for reparations to the victims. The sentence was appealed by 
the victims. In December, a second ruling sentenced to eight years another paramilitary, 
with partial indictment. Also on that occasion, the victims appealed the decision. During the 
proceedings, there was evidence of serious flaws with regard to the role of the victims, lack 
of clarity in the establishment of reparations and creation of false expectations among the 
victims due, in large part, to the lack of coordination of relevant State entities.  
</p>
<p>40. The High Commissioner, thus, reiterates her recommendation to consider a profound 
reform of Act 975. Such reform should include, inter alia, a time limit for the voluntary 
depositions, efficient mechanisms of exclusion from the benefits of the Act, and extending 
the requirement for voluntary depositions to demobilized persons not admitted in the 
proceedings. It could also include consolidating several of its proceedings; the possibility of 
collective indictments; the need to investigate and punish only serious crimes and to clarify 
that compliance with reduced sentences would start from the date of sentencing. It is also 
advisable to identify appropriate criteria for reparations, to establish the obligation to 
provide reparations from the beginning of voluntary depositions, to reinforce State 
mechanisms for accessing assets of perpetrators, to integrate differential approaches and to 
ensure adequate coordination with other transitional mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>  
 13 The Attorney General&#8217;s Office reported that, as of November, of approximately 53,000 demobilized 
</p>
<p>persons, 4,484 were being processed under Act 975. A total of 2,431 voluntary depositions had been 
initiated, which include several sessions per accused. </p>


<p>41. In November, the Constitutional Court decided that the principle of opportunity 
should not apply to demobilized paramilitaries who are not included under Act 975 and 
who have committed no crime other than their membership to a criminal (paramilitary) 
organization. Congress passed a draft law allowing the suspension of imprisonment of these 
demobilized paramilitaries, in exchange for a statement of truth. 
</p>
<p>42. In September, President Santos personally presented a new victims&#8217; act to Congress, 
based on a draft shelved in June 2009. This draft act was combined with another on land 
restitution. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes this initiative and considers it a key pillar which, 
if approved, would complement and improve the existing transitional justice framework.  
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR-Colombia reiterates its alert about the increase in violence against people 
participating in land restitution processes and urges the Government to make greater efforts 
to prevent such violence and avoid impunity. Although the obligation to prevent acts of 
violence is not unlimited, it must be upheld in cases when an individual or a specific group 
of individuals face real and immediate risks and the State has reasonable possibilities of 
preventing or minimizing the risk. OHCHR-Colombia offers its support and assistance for 
this purpose. 
</p>
<p>44. The High Commissioner considers that any new or reformed instrument of 
transitional justice requires the broadest possible consensus, the active participation of 
victims and their organizations, and compliance with international norms. It is particularly 
important to uphold the principle of non-discrimination of victims, who are such by virtue 
of having suffered gross violations of human rights or serious breaches of international 
humanitarian law, regardless of the perpetrator (members of illegal armed groups or State 
agents) and the possible criminal responsibility of the victim for other crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> F. &#8220;<i>Parapol&#237;tica</i>&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 14 March, Colombians elected 102 senators at the national level and 166 
departmental representatives for the 2010-2014 legislative term. OHCHR-Colombia notes 
with concern that the influence of the so-called &#8220;<i>parapol&#237;tica</i>&#8221; persists in the new Congress. 
Of the 268 elected congresspersons, 13 who had been re-elected are under criminal 
investigation by the Supreme Court. Moreover, information has been received of possible 
cases of &#8220;political proxies&#8221; between newly elected parliamentarians and persons involved in 
<i>parapol&#237;tica</i> processes.  
</p>
<p>46. In 2010 the Supreme Court sentenced 10 parliamentarians and acquitted 1. 
Particularly significant is the conviction of &#193;lvaro Garc&#237;a Romero to 40 years for his links 
with paramilitary groups and indirect participation in seven cases of aggravated homicide, 
and other crimes. Another important ruling was the &#8220;acquittal on the basis of doubt&#8221; in the 
case of Carlos Garc&#237;a Orjuela, after he had spent over two years in prison. The Court has 
filed 120 cases against parliamentarians and ex-parliamentarians.14  
</p>
<p>47. These rulings demonstrate the Court&#8217;s determination to fight impunity. OHCHR-
Colombia reiterates the need to continue with these proceedings, ensuring due process by, 
inter alia, restricting the use of pretrial detention, upholding the right to appeal and the 
applicability of the principle of favourability, in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Of these, 84 are under preliminary investigation, 13 under investigation, and 13 on trial. The 
</p>
<p>remaining 10 cases are being reviewed by the Court to establish jurisdiction. </p>


<p><b> G. Judicial branch 
</b></p>
<p>48. The newly-elected Government put an end to the tensions and public confrontations 
between the executive and judicial branches that characterized 2009 and much of 2010. 
This facilitated the election of a new Attorney General in December, after an impasse of 16 
months. The improved political climate has also created conditions for open discussions 
about judicial reforms. 
</p>
<p>49. In this reform process, OHCHR-Colombia emphasizes the need to ensure not only 
adequate funding and an independent governance structure for the judiciary, but also that 
the root causes of impunity be addressed. These issues include the needs: to improve access 
to justice, especially in rural areas and for specific groups, such as women, displaced 
persons, indigenous and Afro-Colombians; to resolve the backlog and expedite existing 
processes; to ensure the presence, and security, of well-trained judges and prosecutors 
throughout the country; to adopt appropriate sanctions for corrupt lawyers and judges; and 
to design strategies and provide sufficient resources in the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to 
systematically investigate human rights violations. It is also important to ensure that the 
justice system upholds human rights, without giving up any of the ground gained, such as 
the recourse to &#8220;<i>tutela</i>&#8221;, a constitutional mechanism for the protection of rights. 
</p>
<p>50. In March, the Supreme Court publicly warned of threats to the integrity and security 
of judges, magistrates and their families. Five magistrates of the Court (two of them ended 
their tenure in September 2010) have been granted precautionary measures by the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights.15  
</p>
<p><b> H. Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>51. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the approval by Congress of the ratification of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
and urges the Government to promptly complete the process, recognizing the additional 
competence of its Committee, as set out in article 31. 
</p>
<p>52. As the National Registry of Disappeared Persons is updated, the magnitude of the 
phenomenon of enforced disappearance becomes evident. By November, a total of 51,310 
people had been reported as disappeared, of which 12,632 are alleged enforced 
disappearances. Of these 3,073 are women and 3,042 are people under 20 years of age.16 
The number of registered cases of disappearance increased almost 40 per cent compared to 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p>53. Moreover, thanks to the efforts of the Attorney General&#8217;s Justice and Peace Unit, by 
November, under Act 975, 4,312 cases of enforced disappearance had been registered, out 
of a total of 51,616 crimes for which the confession process had been initiated. As a result, 
3,037 graves were exhumed and 3,678 bodies found; only 1,323 have been fully identified, 
of which 116 have not yet been handed over to their families.  
</p>
<p>54. Despite these figures, the level of impunity in the case of this serious human rights 
violation is very high. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office initiated some investigations, but, as 
</p>

2010).  
</p>
<p> 16 Disappeared Persons and Corpse Information System (SIRDEC). </p>


<p>recognized by the institution, progress was limited due to the complex nature of the crime.17 
In this context, OHCHR-Colombia recognizes the significance of the historic sentence 
passed in June on the enforced disappearances during the tragic events of 1985 at the Palace 
of Justice.18 The remaining cases relating to the tragedy must continue in an atmosphere of 
security and judicial independence. 
</p>
<p>55. In consultation with civil society organizations, the Attorney General adopted a 
protocol for the search for disappeared persons and the exhumation and identification of 
bodies. However, a protocol for the dignified handing over of remains to families is still 
pending, as these ceremonies are still conducted, for the most part, as judicial proceedings. 
It is important to establish mechanisms that will permit &#8220;declarations of absence&#8221;, rather 
than obliging families to &#8220;declare presumed death&#8221; of disappeared persons, in order to have 
access to State protection and assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>56. As mentioned in previous reports, the official information systems on cases of 
sexual violence committed in the context of the armed conflict reflect a significant under-
reporting of cases. For example, as indicated by the Attorney General, under Act 975 only 
42 acts of sexual violence were reported of a total of 51,616 crimes for which the 
confession process has been initiated.19 
</p>
<p>57. This confirms the urgent need to improve conditions to allow women to denounce 
acts of sexual violence in an environment of security and trust. It is also necessary to 
consolidate information in this field by bringing together judicial records with information 
from the health system and other entities. 
</p>
<p>58. In 2010, OHCHR-Colombia received information on cases of sexual violence 
against girls and young women, attributed to members of post-demobilization groups in 
Antioquia, Cauca, C&#243;rdoba and Norte de Santander. 
</p>
<p>59. Cases of sexual violence attributed to members of security forces, in particular the 
Army, in Arauca, Caldas, Cauca, Choc&#243;, Meta and Vichada were also reported. In most of 
these cases, the victims were girls. In comparison with the previous year, the reaction of the 
security forces to cases attributed to their members was more appropriate and investigations 
were initiated under the ordinary justice system.  
</p>
<p>60. The most dramatic case of sexual violence occurred in Arauca, in October, when a 
member of the military allegedly raped two girls in a period of two weeks; one of the girls, 
together with her two brothers, was subsequently murdered. Neither the Army nor the 
Attorney General reacted immediately to the reports of the first act of sexual violence, 
which demonstrates not only negligence in a particular case, but also structural flaws within 
the two institutions. 
</p>
<p>61. In July, the Minister of Defence issued Directive No. 11 of 2010, which aims to 
prevent all forms of violence against women and girls. OHCHR-Colombia appreciates this

 18 Retired Colonel Luis Alfonso Plazas Vega was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the 
</p>
<p>disappearance of 11 people in November 1985, after security forces stormed the Supreme Court 
building where the M-19 guerrilla group was holding hundreds of hostages. The sentence has been 
appealed.  
</p>
<p> 19 The Human Rights Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office has 82 cases assigned (3 resulted in 
convictions and 2 in acquittals). </p>


<p>effort, but considers it insufficient, and insists on the need to develop specific measures 
with respect to military discipline, including: command responsibility; repudiation of myths 
that encourage sexual violence; preventive background checks on military personnel; 
immediate response protocols; protection measures for victims; and the enabling of judicial 
and disciplinary investigations.  
</p>
<p>62. The Attorney General did not make progress in investigations of sexual violence. 
According to the Round Table of Non-governmental Organizations that monitors 
compliance with Constitutional Court Order 092 of 2008, out of a sample of 40 cases, only 
five led to a conviction, two continue on trial and one is awaiting sentence.20 
</p>
<p>63. In addition, the supervision of the Procurator General in these proceedings is weak. 
However, the decision adopted in July to remove from office seven junior police officers 
from the National Police for sexual abuse committed in June 2009 against a displaced 13-
year-old girl in the Parque Tercer Milenio in Bogot&#225;, is noteworthy. 
</p>
<p>64. 2011 will mark 10 years since the last visit to Colombia of the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences. OHCHR-Colombia suggests that 
the Government extend an invitation to this Special Rapporteur, as well as to the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict, to assess 
compliance with the recommendations formulated in 2001 and to receive new 
recommendations that contribute to the full realization of the human rights of women.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>65. Organizations advocating for the rights of persons with disabilities are not receiving 
sufficient support from the relevant authorities. Colombia is still not a party to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, although Congress completed the 
legislative process on 31 July 2009 and the Constitutional Court issued a positive opinion 
on 21 April 2010. Ratification of the Optional Protocol is also pending. 
</p>
<p>66. In November, the Constitutional Court did not decide on the substance of a lawsuit 
related to the right to same-sex marriages. OHCHR-Colombia believes that granting this 
recognition would reflect the highest standards of human rights, whereby all types of 
marriages and families deserve protection from the State, by virtue of the principles of 
equality and non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>67. Colombian NGOs reported the threats and the killing of 50 lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender persons. Impunity of such cases remains very high. For example, of 99 
cases reported in 2006-2007, 29 are currently under investigation and only one sentence has 
been handed down.21 
</p>
<p>68. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the fact that a draft act to sanction acts of racial 
discrimination is under discussion in Congress. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities 
</b></p>
<p>69. The rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities are still 
disproportionately violated in the context of armed conflict. In particular, their rights to life, 
territory and culture are being threatened by the presence of armed actors on their lands. 
</p>

<p>70. This has led to selective murders, disappearances, confinement, forced displacement, 
and indiscriminate attacks through the use of anti-personnel mines. The victims include 
women and girls, who are also subjected to acts of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>71. These crimes were attributed to FARC-EP, ELN and to post-demobilization groups. 
For example, FARC-EP was accused of the killing of two young Aw&#225; men in Barbacoas, 
Nari&#241;o in June. In April, unidentified assassins killed seven Afro-Colombian miners in 
Su&#225;rez, Cauca.  
</p>
<p>72. Violations, including sexual violence, have also been attributed to members of the 
security forces. Insufficient and inadequate measures to protect the civilian population 
during military operations may have led to cases of forced displacement, such as the 
displacement of 300 Eperara Siapiadara indigenous peoples in January in Olaya Herrera, 
Nari&#241;o. 
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR-Colombia recognizes the judicial efforts to address violations against 
indigenous peoples, such as the conviction of the killers of Edwin Legarda and the 
massacre of 12 indigenous Aw&#225; people in August 2009. However, the State must reinforce 
the protection measures to avoid further such killings.22 
</p>
<p>74. It is imperative to advance in the formulation of protection plans for indigenous and 
Afro-Colombian communities and in strict compliance with Constitutional Court 
orders 004 and 005 (2009). Despite repeated recommendations by OHCHR-Colombia, no 
protection plan has been implemented to date.  
</p>
<p>75. The Ministry of Interior and Justice faces huge challenges to uphold the right of 
communities to free, prior and informed consultation and consent. Current domestic 
legislation does not protect this right in the case of mining exploration, even though mining 
has been considered one of the driving forces for the economic development of the country. 
The persistent weakness of the State to protect collective rights is thus a matter of concern. 
For example, in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca, it took over a year to implement the court 
ruling to immediately stop illegal mining activities that were destroying the lands of the 
Zaragoza community council. The presence of Afro-Colombian communities or indigenous 
peoples in areas of economic interest is often ignored, or their ancestral lands are not titled 
as collective lands or reservations to avoid the obligation to consult. In other cases, 
consultations are conducted with people who are not legitimate representatives of the 
affected community, or the internal decision-making processes of the ethnic groups and 
communities are not respected. 
</p>
<p>76. In this context, it is necessary to adopt adequate legislation and a proper 
implementation mechanism, formulated in a participatory manner with indigenous peoples 
and Afro-Colombian communities. OHCHR-Colombia offers its support and advice in this 
process. 
</p>
<p><b> L. International humanitarian law  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>77. OHCHR-Colombia received reports of systematic attacks attributed to FARC-EP 
and ELN against civilian populations and property, such as massacres, selective homicides, 
</p>
<p>  
 22 The Presidential Programme on Human Rights reported the killing of 51 indigenous persons between 
</p>
<p>January and October, representing a 48 per cent decrease with respect to the same period in 2009. The 
National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) reported that 122 indigenous people were 
killed in 2010 (including unreported cases and indigenous buried as unidentified). </p>


<p>recruitment and use of children, and threats. In several cases, these groups, in particular 
FARC-EP, took direct action against the civilian population, using prohibited weapons and 
anti-personnel mines, and attacking civilian premises and property. Most breaches were 
recorded in remote areas of the departments of Antioquia, Arauca, Caquet&#225;, Cauca, 
C&#243;rdoba, Meta, Nari&#241;o, Norte de Santander and Putumayo. 
</p>
<p>78. In October, a public statement specifically declaring that the group would observe 
international humanitarian law was attributed to ELN commander Nicol&#225;s Rodr&#237;guez 
Bautista, alias &#8220;Gabino&#8221;. This is the first declaration of this sort by ELN that has come to 
the attention of OHCHR-Colombia. The office is not aware of any similar declaration from 
FARC-EP.  
</p>
<p>79. OHCHR-Colombia notes with particular concern breaches of the principle of 
distinction in the hostilities perpetrated by guerrilla groups, in particular FARC-EP, which 
has resulted in the death and injury of numerous civilians. For example, in Torib&#237;o, Cauca, 
FARC-EP carried out numerous attacks throughout the year, resulting in 3<b> </b>dead and 20 
injured civilians.  
</p>
<p>80. Teachers were also the victims of attacks and violent actions in 2010 by guerrilla 
groups.23 For example, persons identified as members of ELN killed the director of a school 
in Caldas.  
</p>
<p>81. The indiscriminate effects of anti-personnel mines continue to cause great harm to 
the civilian population. Despite this, the Presidential Programme on Human Rights and 
International Humanitarian Law recorded a decrease of 51 per cent in the number of anti-
personnel mine-related incidents and accidents, in comparison with 2009.24 
</p>
<p>82. Guerrilla groups also carried out attacks that caused unnecessary suffering to 
combatants. For example, existing evidence indicates that FARC-EP used explosives 
packed with nails and shrapnel and allegedly executed an injured policeman during an 
attack on a National Police truck in El Doncello, Caquet&#225;. 
</p>
<p>83. Both FARC-EP and ELN continued to take hostages. For example, FARC-EP held 
the Government Secretary of Arauquita, Arauca captive from February to May, and ELN 
was responsible for kidnapping four female human rights defenders in Teorama, Norte de 
Santander for two weeks in July.  
</p>
<p>84. Children and youth continued to suffer from &#8220;extensive, systematic and habitual&#8221; 
abuses by guerrilla groups.25 For example, in February, FARC-EP forced a meeting with 
the inhabitants of a municipality in Antioquia to conduct a census of the children, in order 
to recruit those over 8 years old. On numerous occasions, children used by guerrilla groups 
were killed during armed confrontations and other actions, such as the case of a 12-year-old 
boy who died in March when allegedly being used by FARC-EP to place an explosive 
artifact in El Charco, Nari&#241;o.  
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR-Colombia recalls that the line between forced and voluntary recruitment of 
children is legally irrelevant and that the concept of &#8220;use&#8221; should be interpreted as broadly 
as possible. Illegal armed groups are required, under any circumstances, to avoid 
incorporating, or to refuse the incorporation of persons under 18 in their ranks, and must 
avoid using them in hostilities, or in support functions, such as cooks or messengers. The 
</p>
<p>  
 23 The Presidential Programme on Human Rights recorded the killing of 24 teachers between January 
</p>
<p>and October, up 50 per cent from 2009.

<p>State must consider children who have been recruited or used by illegal armed actors as 
victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Security forces 
</b></p>
<p>86. OHCHR-Colombia continued to note the presence of military units in or around 
civilian premises, including homes and schools, in several departments, such as Meta and 
Valle del Cauca. In some cases, civilians were killed or injured during hostilities against 
security forces that were located in or near civilian premises. In other cases, guerrilla 
groups mined the premises after the military forces had left. 
</p>
<p>87. Also of concern are the numerous reports received from communities that alleged 
abuses by the Army in particular. For example, conducting &#8220;censuses&#8221; and taking 
photographs of civilians participating in community meetings place the civilian population 
at risk. Cases of stigmatization and pressure on civilians to act as informants, and some 
cases of illegal detention, have been reported. In some of these cases, victims suffered cruel 
or degrading treatment, even torture, and were released only after they were forced to sign a 
declaration that they had been well treated.  
</p>
<p>88. Despite national laws and international recommendations, OHCHR-Colombia 
continued to receive information on the use of children by members of security forces for 
intelligence work and on their participation in civic-military actions. 
</p>
<p>89. OHCHR-Colombia noted allegations of the existence of a mass grave containing 
2,000 bodies in La Macarena, Meta. Even though no evidence of a mass grave was found, 
at least 446 unidentified people were buried in the municipal cemetery after having been 
reported as killed in combat by the Armed Forces between 2002 and 2010. The weak 
judicial controls may have facilitated the concealment of extrajudicial executions and other 
serious violations. Initial information suggests that similar situations may exist in other 
cemeteries. OHCHR-Colombia has urged the Ministry of Defense to develop a national 
registry of persons killed in combat and the Attorney General to expand its investigations to 
other cemeteries.26 
</p>
<p>90. During 2010, OHCHR-Colombia observed irregular, and in some cases clearly 
illegal practices in the military recruitment process; these practices should be discontinued 
as soon as possible. Rapid development of mechanisms to regulate military service, 
including conscientious objection, with full respect for human rights, is urged. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Torture 
</b></p>
<p>91. OHCHR-Colombia continued to receive information on cases of torture by security 
forces, noting with great concern its repeated occurrence in departments such as Antioquia, 
Arauca, Caquet&#225;, Meta, Valle del Cauca and Vichada. Of particular concern is the situation 
in Medell&#237;n, where several people, including suspected criminals, have repeatedly been 
victims of torture and mistreatment. Several people suffered physical and psychological 
punishment while under police custody, in some cases accompanied by racial slurs. The 
mistreatment consisted, inter alia, of punches or kicks to different parts of the body or 
blows with weapons, as well as electrical shocks, burns, spraying with pepper gas, or 
suffocation with plastic bags.  
</p>
<p>92. Existing disciplinary mechanisms in security forces do not seem to be sufficiently 
effective in the investigation and punishment of these violations. When the Procurator 
</p>
<p>  
 26 OHCHR-Colombia report on La Macarena cemetery, Meta department, 2010.  </p>


<p>General&#8217;s Office assumes the investigation of this type of cases, only rarely are proceedings 
completed or those responsible punished.27 Similar flaws are observed in the investigations 
of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. The Attorney General initiated 32 investigations of 
torture between August 2009 and May 2010.28 In November, it was reported that the 
confession process had been initiated with respect to 543 crimes of torture, out of a total of 
51,616 crimes under Act 975. There have been no convictions in these cases yet. 
</p>
<p>93. In order to ensure greater citizen protection, and prevent vulnerability and 
helplessness of victims, OHCHR-Colombia encourages the State to classify, investigate, 
and punish acts of torture with appropriate sentences. Moreover, it insists on the need to 
ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p><b> N. Forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>94. In 2010, OHCHR-Colombia continued to receive information on collective and 
individual displacement caused by all armed actors. Although displacement increased at a 
lower rate than in past years, the high level of underreporting is a matter of concern, in 
some cases as a consequence of resistance by public officials to record displacement, such 
as in Arauca.  
</p>
<p>95. OHCHR-Colombia expresses serious concern about the high rate of murders of 
displaced persons. According to the National System for Integral Assistance to the 
Displaced Population (SNAIPD), 1,499 homicides of displaced persons were committed 
between 2007 and March 2010.29 The Government is urged to design and implement 
preventive mechanisms to protect the life and personal integrity of displaced people. 
</p>
<p>96. Although forced displacement occurs primarily in rural areas with the presence of 
illegal armed groups, during 2010 OHCHR-Colombia observed an increase in intra-urban 
displacement. Of particular concern is the situation in Medell&#237;n and C&#243;rdoba, where various 
mass displacements have been caused by disputes among post-demobilization groups.  
</p>
<p><b> O. Poverty and economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>97. Colombia has made progress in terms of human development despite the prolonged 
internal armed conflict and high levels of inequality.30 The <i>Human Development Report 
2010</i> ranks Colombia as one of the Latin American countries with high human 
development.31 This ranking is lower when adjusted for inequality, which reaches 
extremely high levels in the country. The Gini coefficient for 2010 was 0.585, and places 
Colombia as one of the seven most unequal countries in the world. 
</p>
<p>98. Extreme poverty is 16 per cent, the highest among the group of high human 
development countries, but it is even higher in some departments.32 Despite progress in 
</p>
<p>  
 27 The Procurator General&#8217;s Office issued 15 rulings related to acts of torture; in six cases, the public

<p>health-service coverage, full enjoyment of the right to health continues to be restricted. 
Approximately 17.5 per cent of the population suffers from at least one serious health 
problem33 and inequality and insufficient access, availability and quality of health services 
persist for people living in poverty, including remote rural populations, internally displaced 
persons, indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities.  
</p>
<p>99. High levels of informal employment persist,34 contributing to greater income 
instability and lack of access to protection granted by social security services.35 Moreover, 
the International Labour Organization has expressed concern regarding certain violations of 
labour rights, such as legislation allowing salary gaps between men and women, in 
violation of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value, and discrimination 
in access to employment based on race, colour and social background.36  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of activities of OHCHR-Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>100. OHCHR-Colombia continued to fulfil its mandate to observe, to provide advice and 
technical cooperation and to promote human rights. Out of 800 complaints received, 
OHCHR-Colombia followed up on 771. A total of 196 observation missions were 
undertaken, which represented 666 days in the field. It participated in 2,983 meetings: 
1,499 with public institutions, 878 with civil society representatives, 357 with United 
Nations agencies, and 249 with the international community.  
</p>
<p>101. Special attention was paid to judicial proceedings, such as those for the massacre of 
the Aw&#225; people in August 2009, the cases against a former DAS director, the enforced 
disappearances that occurred during the 1985 Palace of Justice events, and some cases of 
extrajudicial executions.  
</p>
<p>102. OHCHR-Colombia offered advice during the legislative debates on the draft act on 
victims and land restitution, the act to pay homage to victims of enforced disappearance, 
and the ratification process of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance. It also participated in the National Round Table on 
Guarantees for human rights defenders, collaborated in the strategy to implement the 
PLANEDH and conducted a joint evaluation of the needs and priorities of the National 
Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office. In addition, it facilitated an international-level exchange of 
experiences on purging intelligence files, and on mechanisms for the democratic control of 
intelligence services.  
</p>
<p>103. A project was initiated, together with indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian 
communities, on a participatory formulation of an instrument on the right to consultation 
and another was initiated with the Ministry of Defence to monitor the measures adopted to 
overcome extrajudicial executions.  
</p>
<p>104. OHCHR-Colombia participated in the commemoration of the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the tragic 1985 Palace of Justice events, where, for the first time, all victims

releases and started a campaign on the right to life and restitution of lands, including a radio

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Illustrative cases of violations of human rights and breaches 
of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>1. As a complement to the High Commissioner&#8217;s report on the situation of human 
rights in Colombia, and by way of illustration, a number of cases of human rights violations 
and breaches of international humanitarian law that have come to the attention of the office 
in Colombia of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (&#8220;OHCHR-Colombia&#8221;) during 
the reporting period are described below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>2. The following are illustrative cases of killings, kidnappings, threats, arbitrary 
detentions, NGO&#8217;s offices break-ins, and information theft against human rights defenders, 
which have been attributed to members of illegal armed groups that emerged after the 
demobilization of paramilitary organisations, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia-People&#8217;s Army (FARC-EP) and the National Liberation Army (ELN), as well 
as state agents. OHCHR-Colombia is especially concerned about the murder of leaders, 
peasant farmers and internally displaced persons involved in land restitution cases, 
particularly in the departments of Antioquia, Cauca and Sucre. 
</p>
<p>(a) In San Onofre (Sucre), on 18 May, Rogelio Mart&#237;nez was murdered. Mr. 
Mart&#237;nez, a member of the National Movement of Victims of State Crimes (MOVICE), 
Sucre section, was a leader of a group of families that returned to the &#8220;La Alemania&#8221; farm 
in 2007, and since 2009 entered the Ministry of Interior and Justice Protection Programme 
due to what the Police classified as &#8220;extraordinary risk&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>(b) On 23 May, Alexander Quintero, who worked defending victims&#8217; rights of 
the Alto Naya massacre in 2001 and promoting processes of peaceful coexistence and 
articulation between Afro-descendent, indigenous and peasant farmer communities in Alto 
Naya, was killed in Santander de Quilichao (Cauca). 
</p>
<p>(c) On 10 August, Jair Murillo, leader of the Afro-Colombian organisation of 
internally displaced persons in Buenaventura, <i>Fundacion Integral del Pacifico Nari&#241;ense</i> 
(Integrated Foundation of the Pacific coast in Nari&#241;o), was murdered in Buenaventura 
(Valle del Cauca). 
</p>
<p>(d) On 19 September, Hernando P&#233;rez, a peasant farmer who along with other 
leaders acted as liaison between peasant farmers and the Association of Victims for 
Restitution of Land and Assets (ASOVIRESTIBI) in Uraba (Antioquia) to promote claims 
for land stolen by paramilitary groups, was killed in Necocl&#237; (Antioquia).  
</p>
<p>(e) In January, fictional pages appeared on Facebook accusing several human 
rights defenders and members of NGOs, as well as academics of the Antioquia University, 
of being sympathizers of FARC-EP. 
</p>
<p>(f) In September, a human rights defender was forced to leave Itag&#252;&#237; (Antioquia) 
after receiving threats from criminal groups when the NGO he worked with denounced the 
wave of violence being caused by confrontations between these groups in the city. 
</p>
<p>(g) On 8 July, four human rights defenders were kidnapped by members of the 
ELN in Teorama (Norte de Santander) and were released a few days later. </p>


<p>(h) On 17 June, in Arauca, several persons who had been detained on 15 June 
2008 on charges of rebellion, terrorism and criminal association were released due to lack 
of evidence. 
</p>
<p>(i) In Sucre, a human rights defender detained in November 2008, remains in 
detention. He was accused of criminal association with paramilitary groups, although he 
himself had denounced these groups. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Intelligence services 
</b></p>
<p>3. Cases were reported of illegal wiretapping of emails, surveillance, information theft 
and harassment affecting members of different social and political organisations, allegedly 
conducted in some cases by members of state intelligence services. This conclusion was 
reached after a comprehensive analysis of different elements, which taken alone may seem 
irrelevant, such as the type of victim, the correlation between persons being investigated by 
the intelligence services and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the connections between the 
victims and specific social organisations and with previously documented cases, the modus 
operandi or the correlation between the time and place of certain events. 
</p>
<p>(a) Pamphlets appeared in April and May containing threats against human rights 
organisations and other social organisations in several departments in Colombia. The 
information collected on the victims and the modus operandi suggest state intelligence 
personnel&#8217;s participation in these acts.  
</p>
<p>(b) On 4 April, information was stolen from computers belonging to the 
Women&#8217;s Pacific Route and the Corporation for Community Eco-Development 
(COMUNITAR) in Popayan (Cauca) during a break-in by unknown persons into their 
offices. 
</p>
<p>(c) On 19 July, several persons entered the home of a human rights defender in 
Medell&#237;n (Antioquia) and stole a computer hard disk containing reports and photographs of 
her activities. The victim is a member of an NGO that does social work and carries out 
educational activities in Commune 13 of Medell&#237;n. 
</p>
<p>(d) On 10 August, unidentified persons entered the office of the Meta Civic 
Committee for Human Rights in Villavicencio (Meta), and stole information on its 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Extrajudicial executions 
</b></p>
<p>4. In 2010 the drastic reduction in cases of so-called &#8220;false positives&#8221;, where people 
previously being held by the Army are presented as killed in combat, was confirmed. 
OHCHR-Colombia however continued to receive information on some cases, which 
confirms the need to continue efforts to fully eradicate this practice as well as any other 
forms of extrajudicial execution.  
</p>
<p>(a) On 2 February, a soldier allegedly killed a presumed member of the FARC-
EP that had been injured during a bomb strike in Chaparral (Tolima). The victim was 
reported as killed in combat. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Aipe (Huila), on 25 March, members of the Army Unified Action Groups 
for Personal Freedom (GAULA) assigned to the Army Ninth Brigade, allegedly killed a 
presumed member of the FARC-EP, a minor, who had apparently been wounded earlier 
during a confrontation with the GAULA. </p>


<p>(c) On 7 July, two young men disappeared in Medell&#237;n (Antioquia) and were 
found dead the following day. According to information collected by OHCHR-Colombia, 
the victims had apparently been detained by National Police officers the night before and 
handed over to a criminal group.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Barbacoas (Nari&#241;o), on 12 September, National Police officers shot at a 
group of persons who ignored or did not hear their order to stop, killing one person and 
wounding seven others. The police agents apparently mistook them for members of a 
criminal group. 
</p>
<p>5. OHRHR-Colombia is monitoring the prosecution of several cases of extrajudicial 
executions in which the safety of the families of victims and the witnesses is a matter of 
concern. 
</p>
<p>(a) Reports conducted by the National Police found that at least eight of the 
mothers whose sons disappeared in Soacha (Cundinamarca) in 2008 and were subsequently 
reported by the Army as killed in combat in other municipalities around the country, were 
in situations they describe as &#8220;of extraordinary risk&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Antioquia, Bogot&#225; and Valle del Cauca, among others, complaints were 
registered of intimidation and threats against witnesses for the Attorney General&#8217;s Office or 
their families, in cases of alleged extrajudicial executions attributed to members of the 
Army. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Illegal armed groups that have emerged after the demobilization of 
paramilitary organisations. 
</b></p>
<p>6. It is a matter of concern the expansion and intensity of the acts of violence 
perpetrated against the population by illegal armed groups that emerged after 
demobilization of paramilitary organisations, as illustrated below: 
</p>
<p>(a) On 21 March, seven persons, including two children, were victims of a 
massacre committed in Puerto Libertador (C&#243;rdoba) as a consequence of a dispute between 
Los Urabe&#241;os, Los Rastrojos and Los Paisas. On the same day, members of the &#193;guilas 
Negras allegedly committed a massacre in the same place, killing three boatmen. 
</p>
<p>(b) In El Charco (Nari&#241;o), on 1 October, alleged members of Los Rastrojos 
murdered five members of a family. 
</p>
<p>(c) On 21 March, a 17-year-old girl was killed in Puerto Libertador (C&#243;rdoba), 
presumably by members of Los Urabe&#241;os, after she refused to have sexual relations with 
the leader of the group in that area. 
</p>
<p>(d) In Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), on 2 April, a <i>sicario</i> murdered Diego Fernando 
Escobar M&#250;nera, a judge of the Eighth Criminal Circuit of Medell&#237;n. The authorities 
attributed his death to members of an illegal armed group that emerged after the 
demobilization of paramilitary organisations.  
</p>
<p>(e) On 11 April, Yolanda Isabel &#193;lvarez Ib&#225;&#241;ez, governor of the La Esperanza 
indigenous <i>cabildo</i>, and her husband were murdered in Montelibano (C&#243;rdoba). Authorities 
have attributed this crime to members of Los Paisas. On 23 November, a 14-year-old boy 
was murdered in this same municipality, presumably by members of Los Urabe&#241;os. 
</p>
<p>(f) In Puerto Rico (Meta), on 12 August, members of the Popular Revolutionary 
Anti-Subversive Army of Colombia (ERPAC) allegedly murdered a 15-year-old girl, who 
received over 40 stab wounds. </p>


<p>(g) In April, Los Rastrojos allegedly recruited around 30 children for the ranks of 
the ELN in Puerto Berr&#237;o (Antioquia). In Caucasia (Antioquia), at least 13 children were 
allegedly recruited in February by Los Rastrojos, Los Paisas and Los Urabe&#241;os. In Granada 
(Meta), at least six children were recruited by the ERPAC. 
</p>
<p>7. Members of public security forces acted in collusion with some of these groups. 
</p>
<p>(a) Taraz&#225; (Antioquia), a National Police sergeant was arrested in April while 
transporting weapons for Los Urabe&#241;os. He had served 23 years with the Police and was 
about to retire. 
</p>
<p>(b) In November, during operation &#8220;Ner&#243;n&#8221; in Monter&#237;a (C&#243;rdoba), two National 
Police officers and three sub-officers were arrested on charges of collaborating with Los 
Paisas. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>8. The following cases illustrate how women and girls, and occasionally men, are 
victims of the sexual violence generated by all parties to the conflict, as well as by illegal 
armed groups that emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organisations.  
</p>
<p>(a) On 16 March, a soldier from the Manosalva Batallion attempted to rape an 
Embera indigenous woman in Quibd&#243; (Choc&#243;).  
</p>
<p>(b) In May, in Medio Baud&#243; (Choc&#243;), a sub-officer of the Marine Infantry 
sexually abused a 13-year-old girl.  
</p>
<p>(c) In Cumaribo (Vichada), army soldiers allegedly tortured and repeatedly raped 
a man and a woman throughout the night on 29 July.  
</p>
<p>(d) In April, in Bello (Antioquia), several cases of sexual violence against girls 
attributed to members of a criminal group related to illegal armed groups that emerged after 
demobilization of paramilitary organizations operating in the municipality were reported. 
</p>
<p>(e) On 15 July, a man was raped by a group of FARC-EP guerrillas in El Bagre 
(Antioquia), when they found out that he was homosexual.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>9. Acts of violence have been registered against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
persons (LGBT), such as the case of the transvestite who was beaten until he became 
unconscious by eight police agents in the Immediate Attention Centre (CAI) in Parque 
Bol&#237;var, Medell&#237;n (Antioquia) on 8 May. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities 
</b></p>
<p>10. The rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian communities continue to be 
disproportionately affected by the internal armed conflict. In particular, their right to life 
and territorial and cultural rights are threatened by the presence of armed actors on their 
lands.  
</p>
<p>(a) On 21 January, two leaders of Los Manglares Community Council were 
murdered in L&#243;pez de Micay (Cauca), allegedly by members of the FARC-EP. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Puerto Libertador (C&#243;rdoba), on 4 January, a woman from the Zen&#250; 
indigenous people was murdered, allegedly by members of Los Urabe&#241;os.  </p>


<p>(c) On 27 June, an indigenous Awa was killed in Barbacoas (Nari&#241;o), allegedly 
by members of the FARC-EP. 
</p>
<p>(d) An indigenous person in the rural community of Los Chorros, Caloto (Cauca) 
died on 2 May, when a device launched by the FARC-EP exploded in an indiscriminate 
attack; moreover, several homes were damaged during the attack. A group of soldiers had 
allegedly taken refuge under the civilian homes when the attack began. 
</p>
<p>(e) In January, several Embera indigenous communities from Bajo Baud&#243; 
(Choc&#243;) were under confinement due to confrontations between the Army and the ELN. 
The Afro-Colombian communities of Juana Marcela and Carmelita in Medio San Juan 
(Choc&#243;) were displaced in April after receiving threats from Los Rastrojos and &#193;guilas 
Negras. In October, Afro-Colombian communities from the Berreberre River basin in 
Medio Baud&#243; (Choc&#243;) were under confinement due to armed action from the ELN and Los 
Rastrojos. 
</p>
<p>(f) In March, several indigenous children were recruited by the FARC-EP in 
Florida (Valle) and, on 9 April in El Carmen de Atrato (Choc&#243;), the ELN attempted to 
recruit a group of indigenous children from the Abejero community.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR-Colombia has also received information regarding inadequate compliance 
with the right of communities to prior, free and informed consultation and consent in 
relation with the implementation of several projects in the departments of Cauca, Guajira, 
Norte de Santander and Tolima, among others. 
</p>
<p>(a) For the past three years, the community council of La Toma, municipality of 
Su&#225;rez (Cauca) has been requesting titles to the ancestral lands on which they have lived 
and worked since the XVII century. The state has ignored the presence of these Afro-
Colombian communities and, without prior consultation, granted property deeds and 
mining permits to private persons outside the community.  
</p>
<p>(b) The land management plans are occasionally used as instruments to negate 
the presence of indigenous peoples. In other situations, however, the need for a prior 
consultation has been recognized to draft land management plans, as did the Territorial 
Planning Council of the municipality of Tib&#250; (Norte de Santander) with the Bari indigenous 
people. 
</p>
<p>(c) In the case of the Mand&#233; Norte mining project for exploration and 
exploitation of gold, copper and other minerals in Antioquia and Choc&#243;, the Constitutional 
Court ruled that: i) the native groups affected by the project had not been consulted; ii) the 
community authorities and institutions representing the communities had not been taken 
into account; and iii) the community was not informed about the content of the Mand&#233; 
Norte project. 
</p>
<p><b> H. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>12. OHCHR-Colombia documented several massacres and selective killings attributed 
by authorities to members of guerrilla groups. 
</p>
<p>(a) Authorities attributed the murder of four persons who had been kidnapped on 
30 March in Andes (Antioquia) to the FARC-EP. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Taraz&#225; (Antioquia), on 3 May, members of the FARC-EP allegedly killed 
three persons, including a boy.  </p>


<p>(c) In Argelia (Cauca), on 10 January, members of the FARC-EP stopped and 
detained an ambulance, killing a boy who had been injured by this same guerrilla group.  
</p>
<p>(d) On 25 March, members of the FARC-EP were attributed responsibility for 
the death of a 12-year-old boy on 25 March who was used as a &#8220;child-bomb&#8221; during an 
attack on a police station. Other nine civilians and three policemen were injured. 
</p>
<p>(e) In Pradera (Valle del Cauca), members of the FARC-EP were presumably 
responsible for the death on 1 May of a peasant farmer they accused of collaborating with 
the public security forces. 
</p>
<p>13. The FARC-EP continued to hold civilians and members of public security forces in 
cruel and inhuman conditions, in some cases for over 13 years, such as the Army sergeant 
Jose Libio Mart&#237;nez, deprived of his freedom for reasons relating to the conflict from 21 
December 1997. In 2010, guerrilla groups continued to take hostages.    
</p>
<p>(a) On 6 February, the Government Secretary of Araquita (Arauca) was taken 
hostage by members of the FARC-EP. 
</p>
<p>(b) In Tad&#243; (Choc&#243;) on 8 June, ELN guerrillas took three road workers hostages.  
</p>
<p>(c) In Puerto Rico (Meta), the FARC-EP allegedly took hostage a fisherman on 1 
August, who remains missing.  
</p>
<p>14. OHCHR-Colombia also documented cases of threats by guerrilla groups.  
</p>
<p>(a) On 11 May the FARC-EP had allegedly threatened an indigenous leader in 
Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca).  
</p>
<p>(b) On 2 July, several public officials from Ituango (Antioquia) received threats 
allegedly from the FARC-EP. 
</p>
<p>15. Guerrilla groups continue to use antipersonnel mines and Antioquia is one of the 
departments that has been the most affected.  
</p>
<p>(a) In May the FARC-EP allegedly mined schools in Anor&#237; (Antioquia).  
</p>
<p>(b) On 4 June, a woman and two girls were wounded by an antipersonnel mine in 
Sabanalarga (Antioquia), possibly planted by the FARC-EP.  
</p>
<p>(c) On 6 July, two indigenous children were injured by an antipersonnel mine in 
Tame (Arauca), allegedly placed by a guerrilla group.  
</p>
<p>(d) Authorities reported that on 10 September the FARC-EP had allegedly placed 
explosives in the body of one of the policemen killed during an attack on police stations in 
San Miguel (Putumayo).  
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR-Colombia also received complaints of recruitment of children by guerrilla 
groups in several departments, in particular Antioquia, Cauca and Choc&#243;.  
</p>
<p>(a) In January, in Alto Baud&#243; (Choc&#243;), the ELN recruited three children, 
including two girls.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Jambal&#243; (Cauca), eight children were recruited in February, allegedly by 
the FARC-EP.  
</p>
<p>(c) In February, the FARC-EP presumably attempted to recruit at least 19 boys 
and girls in Ituango (Antioquia).  
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR-Colombia registered several cases of terrorism attributed by authorities to 
the FARC-EP. </p>


<p>(a) The attacks in Pasto (Nari&#241;o) against the headquarters of the &#8220;U&#8221; political 
party on 25 May and in front of the office of the Administrative Department of Security 
(DAS) office on 8 September. 
</p>
<p>(b) The explosion of a car bomb in Bogota on 12 August, which injured nine 
persons. 
</p>
<p>(c) The explosion of a car bomb on 30 November in front of a police station in 
Vegalarga, municipality of Neiva (Huila), which caused the death of one civilian and 
damaged several homes.  
</p>
<p>(d) Other cases were attributed to the ELN, such as the gas cylinder filled with 
explosives that were detonated near the &#8220;Alejandro Humboldt&#8221; school in Fortul (Arauca), 
on 7 January.  
</p>
<p>18. Indiscriminate attacks were also registered, such as an attack with a cylinder bomb 
launched by the FARC-EP on 30 May in Sabanalarga (Antioquia), which damaged a 
school, and another attack by the FARC-EP on a passenger bus in Chigorod&#243; (Antioquia) 
on 15 July.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Security forces  
</b></p>
<p>19. OHCHR-Colombia continued to observe the practice of placing military units in 
populated areas, very near to houses and other protected properties, such as schools.  
</p>
<p>(a) In January, soldiers of the &#8220;Cacique Nutibara&#8221; Infantry Battalion occupied a 
school in the rural community of Guaduas in Carmen de Atrato (Choc&#243;). 
</p>
<p>(b) In May, OHCHR-Colombia received information about the month-long 
occupation of a community centre in the rural community of Silva, Buenaventura (Valle del 
Cauca), by the Marine Infantry.  
</p>
<p>(c) On 24 August a group of soldiers from the &#8220;Vencedores&#8221; Battalion occupied 
a school in Tulu&#225;, Valle del Cauca.  
</p>
<p>(d) In Puerto Alvira, Mapirip&#225;n (Meta), a group of soldiers from the Army&#8217;s 
Joaqu&#237;n Par&#237;s Battalion camped close to the rectory and other civilian homes.  
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR-Colombia received information on cases of stigmatization and illegal 
detention by members of the Army against the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>(a) In Na&#237;n, Tierralta (C&#243;rdoba), soldiers from the XI Brigade allegedly 
intimidated the population on 13 January, accusing them of collaboration with guerrilla 
groups.  
</p>
<p>(b) In Puerto Rico (Meta), on 4 August, members of the Army allegedly detained 
a 12-year-old boy for two hours, accusing him of being a guerrilla and interrogating him on 
the whereabouts of the group in the area. 
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR-Colombia registered cases of armed confrontations between the Army and 
the FARC-EP, which caused harm to the civilian population in rural areas of the department 
of Cauca. Two such cases occurred in April and May, in Caloto and Torib&#237;o, where one 
woman died of a gunshot allegedly fired by a guerrilla and other woman was wounded by 
shrapnel from an explosive device allegedly launched by members of the Army. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Torture 
</b></p>
<p>22. Although the existing data does not appear to reflect either the magnitude or the true 
impact of this human rights violation, the following are illustrative cases: </p>


<p>(a) On 13 January, two police agents from the Bel&#233;n station in Medell&#237;n 
(Antioquia) had allegedly beaten two young men and some of their friends and family 
members repeatedly while they were being searched by police on the street and 
subsequently at the Police station. 
</p>
<p>(b) On 21 February, during an operation in Mapirip&#225;n (Meta) to capture 
members of an illegal armed group that emerged after demobilization of paramilitary 
groups, members of the National Police allegedly detained illegally a person and tortured 
him physically and psychologically while insisting him to provide them with information 
on members of the group. 
</p>
<p>(c) In Araquita (Arauca), on 24 May, two young men were allegedly beaten 
while detained by police agents. 
</p>
<p>(d) The perception of impunity in cases of complaints of torture is evident in the 
words of a policy agent from Medell&#237;n, who responded to a victim who intended to accuse 
him of torture by saying that he had already been accused of &#8220;48 counts of torture and did 
not care about one more&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>(e) On 28 November 2003, a peasant farmer was tortured in Ituango (Antioquia). 
Seven years later, the Procurator General dismissed five professional soldiers for a period 
of 15 years. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>23. During 2010, there were reports of cases of forced displacement, both individual and 
collective. It was a matter of concern the high rate of murders of displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>(a) In Valencia (C&#243;rdoba), on 17 February, &#8220;Los Urabe&#241;os&#8221; allegedly killed 
Te&#243;filo Vidal Vidal. The victim had been working for the restitution of land taken by the 
H&#233;roes de Tolov&#225; Bloc of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC) from 
internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>(b) On 24 November, Oscar Maussa was killed in San Juan Nepomuceno 
(Bol&#237;var). He was forcibly displaced in 1997 by a paramilitary group in the village of 
Blanquicet, municipality of Turbo (Antioquia), along with 11 families belonging to the 
Agricultural Workers Cooperative of Blanquicet (COTRAGROBLAN). Mr. Maussa, had 
been granted precautionary protection measures by the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights in September 2006. 
</p>
<p>(c) On 15 August, members of Los Rastrojos allegedly killed a community 
leader in Medio Baud&#243; (Choc&#243;) and forcibly displaced 50 families. 
</p>
<p>(d) In Santa B&#225;rbara (Nari&#241;o), on 2 October, Los Rastrojos allegedly caused the 
forced displacement of 40 families.
