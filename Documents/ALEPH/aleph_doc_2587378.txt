CANADIAN ZINC CORPORATION
Suite 1710, 650 West Georgia Street
Vancouver, British Columbia  V6B 4N9
INFORMATION CIRCULAR
(As at May 9, 2012, except as otherwise indicated)
This  information  circular  is  furnished  in  connection  with  the  solicitation  of  proxies  by  the
management  of  Canadian  Zinc  Corporation  (the  “Company”)  for  use  at  the  annual  general
meeting of the holders of common shares of the Company to be held on June 13, 2012 and at
any adjournments thereof (the “Meeting”). The solicitation will be conducted by mail and may be
supplemented  by  telephone,  electronic  or  other  personal  contact  to  be  made  without  special
compensation by directors, officers and employees of the Company. The cost of solicitation will
be borne by the Company.
 
APPOINTMENT OF PROXYHOLDER
 
The purpose of a proxy is to designate persons who will vote the proxy on a shareholder's behalf
in accordance with the instructions given by the shareholder in the proxy. The persons whose
names are printed in the enclosed form of proxy for the Meeting are officers or directors of the
Company (the “Management Proxyholders”).
 
A  shareholder  has  the  right  to  appoint  a  person  other  than  a  Management  Proxyholder  to
represent  the  shareholder  at  the  Meeting  by  striking  out  the  names  of  the  Management
Proxyholders  and  by  inserting  the  desired  person's  name  in  the  blank  space  provided  or  by
executing  a  proxy  in  a  form  similar  to  the  enclosed  form.  A  proxyholder  need  not  be  a
shareholder.
 
VOTING BY PROXY
 
Only registered shareholders or duly appointed proxyholders are permitted to vote at the Meeting.
Shares represented by a properly executed proxy in the accompanying form will be voted or be
withheld from voting on each matter referred to in the Notice of Meeting in accordance with the
instructions  of  the  shareholder  on  any  ballot  that  may  be  called  for  and  if  the  shareholder
specifies  a  choice  with  respect  to  any  matter  to  be  acted  upon,  the  shares  will  be  voted
accordingly.
 
If no choice is specified and one of the Management Proxyholders is appointed by a shareholder
as proxyholder, such person will vote in favour of the matters specified in the notice of meeting for
this Meeting and in favour of all other matters proposed by management at the Meeting.
The enclosed form of proxy also confers discretionary authority upon the person named therein
as proxyholder with respect to amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice of the
Meeting and with respect to other matters which may properly come before the Meeting. At the
date of this information circular, management of the Company knows of no such amendments,
variations or other matters to come before the Meeting.
 
COMPLETION AND RETURN OF PROXY
 
Completed forms of proxy must be deposited at the office of the Company's registrar and transfer
agent,  Computershare  Investor  Services  Inc.,  Proxy  Department,  100  University  Avenue,  9th
Floor,  Toronto,  Ontario,  M5J  2Y1,  not  later  than  forty-eight  (48)  hours,  excluding  Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays, prior to the time of the Meeting, unless the chairman of the Meeting elects
to exercise his discretion to accept proxies received subsequently.

NON-REGISTERED HOLDERS
 
Only  shareholders  whose  names  appear  on  the  records  of  the  Company  as  the  registered
holders of common shares or duly appointed proxyholders are permitted to vote at the Meeting.
Most  shareholders  of  the  Company  are  "non-registered"  shareholders  because  the  common
shares they own are not registered in their names but are instead registered in the name of a
nominee  such  as  a  brokerage  firm,  bank  or  trust  company  through  which  they  purchased  the
common shares. More particularly, a person is not a registered shareholder in respect of common
shares  which  are  held  on  behalf  of  that  person  (the  “Non-Registered  Holder”)  but  which  are
registered either: (a) in the name of an intermediary (an “Intermediary”) that the Non-Registered
Holder deals with in respect of the common shares (Intermediaries include, among others, banks,
trust companies, securities dealers or brokers and trustees or administrators of self-administered
RRSP's, RRIFs, RESPs and similar plans); or (b) in the name of a clearing agency (such as CDS
Clearing  and  Depository  Services  Inc.  (“CDS”))  of  which  the  Intermediary  is  a  participant.  In
accordance  with  the  requirements  of  National  Instrument  54-101  of  the  Canadian  Securities
Administrators,  the  Company  has  distributed  copies  of  the  notice  of  meeting,  this  information
circular,  the  proxy  and  other  materials  (collectively,  the  “Meeting  Materials”)  to  the  clearing
agencies and Intermediaries for onward distribution to Non-Registered Holders.
 
Intermediaries are required to forward the Meeting Materials to Non-Registered Holders unless a
Non-Registered Holder has waived the right to receive them. Very often, Intermediaries will use
service companies to forward the Meeting Materials to Non-Registered Holders. Generally, Non-
Registered Holders who have not waived the right to receive Meeting Materials will either:
 
(a)  be given a form of proxy which has already been signed by the Intermediary (typically by a
facsimile,  stamped  signature),  which  is  restricted  as  to  the  number  of  shares  beneficially
owned  by  the  Non-Registered  Holder  but  which  is  otherwise  not  completed.  Because  the
Intermediary has already signed the form of proxy, this form of proxy is not required to be
signed  by  the  Non-Registered  Holder  when  submitting  the  proxy.  In  this  case,  the  Non-
Registered  Holder  who  wishes  to  submit  a  proxy  should  otherwise  properly  complete  the
form of proxy and deliver it to the Company's registrar and transfer agent as provided above;
or
(b)  more typically, be given a voting instruction form which is not signed by the Intermediary, and
which, when properly completed and signed by the Non-Registered Holder and returned to
the  Intermediary  or  its  service  company,  will  constitute  voting  instructions  (often  called  a
“proxy  authorization  form”)  which  the  Intermediary  must  follow.  Typically,  the  proxy
authorization form will consist of a one page pre-printed form. Sometimes, instead of the one
page pre-printed form, the proxy authorization form will consist of a regular printed proxy form
accompanied by a page of instructions which contains a removable label containing a bar-
code  and  other  information.  In  order  for  the  form  of  proxy  to  validly  constitute  a  proxy
authorization form, the Non-Registered Holder must remove the label from the instructions
and affix it to the form of proxy, properly complete and sign the form of proxy and return it to
the  Intermediary  or  its  service  company  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  of  the
Intermediary or its service company.
In either case, the purpose of this procedure is to permit Non-Registered Holders to direct the
voting of the common shares which they beneficially own. Should a Non-Registered Holder who
receives  one  of  the  above  forms  wish  to  vote  at  the  Meeting  in  person,  the  Non-Registered
Holder  should  strike  out  the  names  of  the  Management  Proxyholders  and  insert  the  Non-
Registered Holder's name in the blank space provided. In either case, Non-Registered Holders
should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediary, including those regarding when and
where the proxy or proxy authorization form is to be delivered.
4
In  addition,  Canadian  securities  legislation  now  permits  the  Company  to  forward  meeting
materials directly to Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners (“NOBOs”). As a result NOBOs can expect
to receive a scannable Voting Instruction Form (“VIF”) from Computershare. These VIFs are to be
completed and returned to Computershare in the envelope provided or by facsimile. In addition,
Computershare provides both telephone voting and internet voting as described on the VIF itself
which contain complete instructions. Computershare will tabulate the results of the VIFs received
from NOBOs and will provide appropriate instructions at the Meeting with respect to the shares
represented  by  the  VIFs  they  receive.  If  the  Company  or  its  agent  has  sent  these  materials
directly to you (instead of through a nominee), your name and address and information about
your  holdings  of  securities  have  been  obtained  in  accordance  with  applicable  securities
regulatory  requirements  from  the  nominee  holding  on  your  behalf.  By  choosing  to  send  these
materials  to  you  directly,  the  Company  (and  not  the  nominee  holding  on  your  behalf)  has
assumed  responsibility  for  (i)  delivering  these  materials  to  you  and  (ii)  executing  your  proper
voting instructions.
REVOCABILITY OF PROXY
 
Any  registered  shareholder  who  has  returned  a  proxy  may  revoke  it  at  any  time  before  it  has
been exercised. In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a proxy may be
revoked  by  instrument  in  writing,  including  a  proxy  bearing  a  later  date,  executed  by  the
registered shareholder or by his attorney authorized in writing or, if the registered shareholder is
a corporation, under its corporate seal or by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized. The
instrument revoking the proxy must be deposited at the registered office of the Company, at any
time  up  to  and  including  the  last  business  day  preceding  the  date  of  the  Meeting,  or  any
adjournment  thereof,  or  with  the  chairman  of  the  Meeting  on  the  day  of  the  Meeting. Only
registered shareholders have the right to revoke a proxy. Non-Registered Holders who wish to
change  their  vote  must,  at  least  seven  days  before  the  Meeting,  arrange  for  their  respective
nominees or Intermediaries to revoke the proxy on their behalf.
 
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
 
Except as set out herein, to the knowledge of the management of the Company, no person who
has been a director or executive officer of the Company since the beginning of the Company's
last  financial  year,  no  proposed  nominee  of  management  for  election  as  a  director  of  the
Company and no associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons, has any material interest, direct
or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter to be acted
upon  at  the  Meeting  other  than  the  election  of  directors,  the  appointment  of  auditors  and  the
approval of the 2012 Plan.
 
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF
 
The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares without par value, of
which as at May 9, 2012 (the record date for the Meeting), 156,719,112 common shares were
issued and outstanding. The holders of common shares are entitled to one vote for each common
share held. Holders of common shares of record at the close of business on May 9, 2012 will be
entitled to receive notice of and vote at the meeting. The Company has only one class of shares.
 
To the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Company, as at May 9, 2012, no
person beneficially owns, controls or directs, directly or indirectly, shares carrying 10% or more of
the voting rights attached to the common shares of the Company, except as disclosed in the table

STATEMENT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
 
Objectives of Executive Compensation
 
The Board has appointed a Compensation Committee which has responsibility for determining
compensation for the directors and senior management The Company does not have a formal
compensation  plan  in  place  for  its  Named  Executive  Officers.  The  general  compensation
philosophy of the Company for executive officers, including for the CEO, is to provide a level of
compensation that is competitive within the North American marketplace and that will attract and
retain  individuals  with  the  experience  and  qualifications  necessary  for  the  Company  to  be
successful,  and  to  provide  longer-term  incentive  compensation,  such  as  the  grant  of  stock
options, which aligns the interest of executives with those of shareholders and provides longer-
term incentives to members of senior management whose actions have a direct and identifiable
impact on the performance of the Company and who have material responsibility for long-range
strategy development and implementation.
 
The  Company  is  primarily  engaged  in  the  exploration,  development  and  re-permitting  of  its
Prairie Creek property located in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The Company is considered
to  be  in  the  exploration  and  development  stage  given  that  its  Prairie  Creek  property  is  not  in
production  and,  to  date,  has  not  earned  any  significant  revenues  and  does  not  generate
revenues from operations. Accordingly, the Company is reliant upon funding from capital raising
activities. Therefore, the use of traditional performance standards, such as corporate profitability,
is not considered to be appropriate in the evaluation of corporate or executive performance, and
the Board of Directors has to consider the financial situation of the Company in a wider context
involving  the  ongoing  status  of  the  Prairie  Creek  project,  when  setting  its  executive
compensation levels.
 
Historically,  the  compensation  of  executive  officers  of  the  Company  has  been  comprised
primarily  of  cash  compensation  and  the  allocation  of  incentive  stock  options.  In  establishing
levels  of  remuneration  and  in  granting  stock  options,  an  executive's  performance,  level  of
expertise,  responsibilities,  length  of  service  to  the  Company  and  comparable  levels  of
remuneration paid to executives of other companies of comparable size and development within
the  industry  are  taken  into  consideration.  Interested  executives  do  not  participate  in  reviews,
discussions or decisions of the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors regarding this
remuneration.  The  Compensation  Committee’s  responsibilities  and  composition  are  described
below under the heading “Corporate Governance Disclosure – Compensation Committee”.
 
Goals and objectives for the Company are typically set through discussions at board meetings,
and senior management will then work to achieve the objectives that have been set. Follow-up
on progress would typically take place at subsequent board meetings. The Company did not set
formal, person-specific, performance goals for the Named Executive Officers for 2011, with the
exception  of  the  CEO  who  was  given,  by  the  Compensation  Committee,  annual  performance
goals  without  specific  rewards  attached  thereto.  Awarding  additional  compensation  upon
successful  completion  of  annual  performance  goals  is  entirely  at  the  discretion  of  the
Compensation  Committee.  Given  the  size  of  the  Company,  this  is  considered  appropriate  to
effectively manage the business and allow the Named Executive Officers to move the business
forward.
 
While  the  Company  does  not  actively  benchmark  its  compensation  programs  for  executive
officers, and the individual components thereof, it does review compensation levels within the
industry  primarily  through  the  use  of  third-party  “Compensation  Reports”,  which  are  available
through  certain  consulting  firms.  These  reports  typically  include  information  for  larger  mining
companies  but  do  assist  the  Committee  and  the  Company  in  determining  approximately  the
salary levels and other benefits in place across the industry.
8
The  Committee  relies  on  the  general  knowledge  and  experience  of  its  members,  and
recommendations from senior management, in reviewing appropriate levels of compensation for
Executive  Officers  and  the  implementation  of,  or  amendment  to,  any  other  aspects  of
compensation that the Committee may review from time to time. All Committee members have
relevant  general,  but  not  direct,  experience  in  executive  compensation  and  compensation
policies and practices in the junior mineral resources business gained through current and prior
experience  in  business,  the  minerals  industry  and  government.  Neither  the  Company  nor  the
Committee currently has any contractual arrangement with any compensation consultant.
 
There was a change in the Company’s Chief Financial Officer in both 2010 and 2011 and in
connection  therewith  the  Company  retained  Robert  Half  Financial  Consultants,  a  recruitment
consultant,  who  provided  advice  with  regard  to  salary  levels  in  the  industry.  No  other
compensation  consultants  were  engaged.  The  following  table  sets  out  the  fees  paid  to
compensation  consultants  by  the  Company  during  the  two  most  recently  completed  financial
years:

The  Compensation  Committee  is  responsible  for  considering  the  risks  associated  with  the
Company’s  compensation  policies  and  practices  and  has  not  identified  any  specific  risks
associated with the Company’s compensation policies and practices that are reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect.
 
Because of the current scale and scope of the Company’s operations, and the limited number of
senior management and employees, and the oversight by the Board of all significant activities,
including risk management, the Compensation Committee does not believe that the Company’s
compensation policies and practices would encourage any executive officer to take inappropriate
or excessive risk.
 
Base Salary
 
The  Company  provides  executive  officers  with  base  salaries  which  represent  their  minimum
compensation  for  services  rendered  during  the  fiscal  year.  Salary  levels  are  based  upon  the
executive’s  experience,  responsibilities,  performance  and  time  commitment.  Base  salaries  are
reviewed annually by the Committee. The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the CEO,
COO and CFO for 2011 and determined that a small increase would be warranted. The salaries
were  considered  to  be  appropriate  for  the  level  of  experience  and  skills  of  each  Named
Executive Officer.
 
Stock Options
 
The  grant  of  stock  options  to  purchase  common  shares  of  the  Company,  pursuant  to  the
Company’s  stock  option  plan  is  an  integral  component  of  executive  officer  compensation
packages.  The  Company's  stock  option  plan  is  administered  by  the  board  of  directors  of  the
Company,  with  option  grants  being  recommended  by  the  Committee  to  the  Board.  The  stock
option  plan  is  designed  to  give  each  option  holder  an  interest  in  preserving  and  maximizing
shareholder value in the longer term, to enable the Company to attract and retain individuals with
experience  and  ability,  and  to  reward  individuals  for  current  performance  and  expected  future
performance. Stock option grants are considered when reviewing executive officer compensation
packages as a whole.
 
The CFO was granted stock options on January 27, 2011 upon his recruitment. The grant date
fair  value  of  the  options  awarded  has  been  disclosed  in  the  Summary  Compensation  Table
(below). In awarding the stock options, the Committee considered the appropriate number and
percentage of options that should be awarded to each Named Executive Officer relative to the
total number of shares issued and stock options granted.
9
The  Company  has  not  prohibited  its  Executive  Officers  or  Directors  from  purchasing  financial
instruments designed to hedge or off-set a decrease in market value of any stock options granted
as  compensation  or  of  options  or  shares  of  the  Company  held  directly  or  indirectly  by  an
Executive Officer or Director.
 
Other Incentives
 
The  Company  does  not  have  a  formal  annual  incentive  bonus  plan  in  place.  Any  award  of  a
bonus  to  executive  officers  is  entirely  at  the  discretion  of  the  Board  of  Directors  based  upon
recommendation  by  the  Committee.  In  considering  the  payment  of  a  discretionary  bonus  to
Executive Officers, the Committee takes into account the individual performance and efforts of the
executive during the year, the progress made by the Company in furthering its business plan and
the overall economic climate. As discussed above, there are no specific individual performance
targets set ahead of time when determining additional payments such as bonuses.
 
Cash bonus amounts were paid to the CEO, COO and CFO for the year ended December 31,
2011,  and  were  determined  based  on  the  overall  accomplishments  made  in  2011,  including
signing of two Impact Benefit Agreements with neighbouring Aboriginal Communities, signing a
Socio  Economic  Agreement  with  the  Government  of  the  Northwest  Territories,  successful
completion of the Environmental Assessment for the Prairie Creek Project and the completion of
three  separate  equity  financings  around  the  year-end,  and  reflect  the  overall  view  of  the
Committee of the contributions made by the Named Executive Officers to the progress made by
the Company during the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
The Company has a health benefit plan that is available to all full-time employees. The benefit
plan is designed to protect employees’ health and that of their dependents, and cover them in the
event of disability or death.
Perquisites and personal benefits provided to executive officers reflect competitive practices and
particular  business  needs.  They  are  not  considered  a  material  component  of  the  executive
compensation program.

(1)  The value of option-based awards represents the grant date fair value of the stock options
awarded. For fiscal 2011, the Company granted stock options on January 27, 2011, which
were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions:

(2)  (i) Dividend yield – 0%, (ii) Risk free interest rate – 1.9%, (iii) Expected option life – 2.6 years
to 3.5 years and (iv) Expected volatility – 79.4% to 85.1%. The grant date fair value and the
fair  value  for  accounting  purposes  reported  in  the  Company’s  financial  statements  for  the
year ended December 31, 2011 were the same. For fiscal 2010, the Company granted stock
options on May 12, 2010, which were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with
the following assumptions: (i) Dividend yield – 0%, (ii) Risk free interest rate – 2.2% to 2.4%,
(iii) Expected option life – 2.5 years to 3.5 years and (iv) Expected volatility – 79.5% to 86.1%.
(3)  The Company does not have a formal bonus plan tied to set targets. Any bonus payments are
entirely discretionary and are reviewed by the Compensation Committee as part of an overall
review of performance for the year.
(4)  Perquisites  have  not  been  included,  as  they  do  not  exceed  10%  of  total  salary  for  the
financial years presented.
(5)  John Kearney and Alan Taylor are directors of the Company but were not compensated for
services in this capacity.
(6)  Carlos Escribano resigned from employment with the Company with effect from January 31,

DATA
CZN
S&P/TSX
The  performance  of  the  Company’s  stock  over  the  past  five  years  has  been  linked  to  overall
commodity  prices  and  market  sentiment  and  reflected  general  market  conditions  and,  in
particular,  the  stock  market  performance  for  junior  mineral  exploration  and  development
companies at each point in time. Commodity prices and global markets were adversely impacted
by the onset of the world-wide financial crisis in the second half of 2008, which saw the share
prices of junior mineral companies hit particularly hard.
 
Canadian  Zinc  does  not  directly  link  executive  compensation  to  total  cumulative  shareholder
return as the Company is not in active operations. Instead, the goals of the Company at this point
in  time  are  more  qualitative  and  geared  towards  successfully  obtaining  permits  for  the  Prairie
Creek  Mine.  The  Committee  does,  however,  consider  the  general  economic  situation  when
assessing compensation, as illustrated by the decision not to award any stock options or bonus
payments in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, the Committee considered that the increase in value of the
Company’s strategic investments and progress with regard to permitting of Prairie Creek were
such that the payments of year end bonuses to each of the CEO and COO were appropriate. In
2011,  the  Committee  considered  that  the  progress  with  regard  to  the  ongoing  development,
environmental assessment and permitting of the Prairie Creek project, and in securing financings
for the Company, were such that the payments of year end bonuses to each of the CEO, COO
and CFO were appropriate.

Stock Option Plan
Under  the  stock  option  plan  of  the  Company,  options  to  purchase  common  shares  of  the
Company may be granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company or subsidiaries of
the  Company  and  other  persons  or  companies  engaged  to  provide  ongoing  management  or
consulting services for the Company or any entity controlled by the Company. In determining the
number of common shares of the Company subject to each option granted under the stock option
plan, consideration is given to the present and potential contribution by such person or company
to  the  success  of  the  Company  and  the  appropriate  number  and  percentage  of  options  that
should be awarded and held by each party granted options relative to the total number of shares
issued and stock options granted.
At December 31, 2011 there were 6,410,000 stock options outstanding all of which, except for the
300,000  stock  options  issued  in  the  three  month  period  ended  March  31,  2011,  were  granted
under the Company's 2004 stock option plan (the “2004 Plan”). At the Annual General Meeting
held  on  June  16,  2010,  shareholders  approved  the  adoption  of  a  new  stock  option  plan  (the
“2010 Plan“).  The  2010  Plan  is  a  fixed  stock  option  plan  pursuant  to  which  options  on  up  to
6,000,000 common shares may be issued to directors, officers, employees and service providers
of  the  Company.  No  new  stock  options  will  be  granted  under  the  2004  Plan,  which  is  a  10%
rolling stock option plan, but the 6,110,000 stock options currently outstanding under the 2004
Plan will remain outstanding and subject to the 2004 Plan. Stock options will only be granted
under the 2010 Plan to the extent that the aggregate number of stock options outstanding under
the 2010 Plan and the 2004 Plan does not exceed 6,000,000.
 
The  300,000  incentive  stock  options  granted  during  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2011
were granted outside of the Company’s stock option plan and in accordance with the rules of the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
 
See "Equity Compensation Plan Information" below.
 
The Company is proposing to implement a 2012 Plan (as defined below) to replace the 2010
Plan  and  to increase  the  number  of  common  shares  of  the  Company  that  may  be  issued  to
directors, officers, employees and service providers of the Company on exercise of stock options
from 6,000,000 shares to 7,500,000 shares, (representing approximately 4.8% of the Company’s
outstanding shares as at May 9, 2012 If approved by shareholders, the 2012 Plan will replace the
2010 Plan. See "Particulars of Other Matters to be Acted Upon" below.
Pension Plan Benefits
 
The Company does not provide any form of group pension plan benefits to employees, officers or
directors.
 
Termination and Change of Control Benefits
 
Except as otherwise disclosed herein, the Company has no compensatory plan or arrangement
in  respect  of  compensation  received  or  that  may  be  received  by  an  executive  officer  of  the
Company  in  the  Company's  most  recently  completed  or  current  financial  year  to  compensate
such  executive  officer  in  the  event  of  the  termination  of  employment  (resignation,  retirement,
change of control) or in the event of a change in responsibilities following a change in control.
 
The Company entered into an Employment Agreement dated effective January 1, 2010 with Mr.
Alan Taylor, Chief Operating Officer, for his continuing services as an officer of the Company (the
“Taylor  Agreement”).  Certain  provisions  in  the  Taylor  Agreement  deal  with  events  around
termination of employment or resignation following a change of control of the Company, which is
defined as the acquisition by any entity directly or indirectly of not less than fifty percent (50%) of
the outstanding voting securities of the Company or the votes attached to those securities that are
sufficient, if exercised, to elect a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company (a "Change of
Control"). Should Mr. Taylor’s employment with the Company be terminated without cause, Mr.
Taylor is entitled to receive an amount equal to his then current annual salary upon termination,
and a further amount equal to 50% of the initial termination pay amount on the first anniversary of
his termination. In the event of a Change of Control and subsequent termination by the Company
without cause, or resignation of Mr. Taylor, within 12 months of the Change of Control, Mr. Taylor
is entitled to
13
receive, in addition to termination pay, a further amount equal to twenty-four months of his then
current annual salary.
 
A  summary  of  the  potential  payments  to  Mr.  Taylor,  assuming  the  applicable  resignation  or
termination had occurred on December 31, 2011, is illustrated below:
·  Termination without cause - $290,374.
·  Termination without cause or resignation following a Change of Control - $677,540.
The  Company  entered  into  an  Employment  Agreement  effective  January  17,  2011  with  Mr.
Trevor  Cunningham,  CFO,  for  his  continuing  services  as  an  officer  of  the  Company  (the
“Cunningham Agreement”). Certain provisions in the Cunningham Agreement deal with events
around  termination  of  employment  and  change  in  responsibilities  amounting  to  constructive
dismissal  following  a  Change  of  Control.  Should  Mr.  Cunningham’s  employment  with  the
Company be terminated without cause prior to January 17, 2012, Mr. Cunningham is entitled to
receive  three  months  termination  pay  at  his  then  current  annual  salary.  If  his  employment  is
terminated  without  cause  on  or  after  January  17,  2012  and  prior  to  January  17,  2015  Mr.
Cunningham is entitled to receive six months termination pay at his then current annual salary. If
his  employment  is  terminated  without  cause  on  or  after  January  17,  2015  Mr.  Cunningham  is
entitled to receive twelve months termination pay at his then current annual salary. In the event of
a Change of Control and subsequent termination or constructive dismissal within 12 months of
the change of control, Mr. Cunningham is  entitled  to  receive,  in  addition  to  termination  pay,  a
further amount equal to six months at his then current annual salary.
 
A summary of the potential payments to Mr. Cunningham, assuming the termination had occurred
on December 31, 2011, is illustrated below:
·  Termination without cause - $35,700.
·  Termination without cause following a change of control - $107,100.

during 2011.
14
From time to time, directors may be retained to provide specific services to the Company, or sit on
additional sub-committees of the Board of Directors of the Company, and will be compensated on
a basis to be negotiated. Effective from July 1, 2009 to September 30, 2011, John MacPherson
agreed to Chair an informal Corporate Development Sub-Committee to report to the Board on
corporate  acquisition  related  activities  for  an  annual  retainer  of  $12,000.  The  fees  earned  for

subsequent year. Directors are eligible to participate in the stock option plan. During the financial
year ended December 31, 2011, nil stock options were granted to the directors of the Company

INDEBTEDNESS TO COMPANY OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
No director or executive officer, proposed management nominee for election as a director of the
Company or associate or affiliate of any such director or executive officer, is or, at any time since
the beginning of the most recently completed financial year of the Company, was indebted to or
guaranteed or supported by the Company.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
 
Section 21 of the Articles of the Company provides for mandatory indemnification of directors and
former directors against all costs, charges and expenses in respect of any proceeding to which
they  are  made  a  party  by  reason  of  being  a  director  or  officer  of  the  Company,  subject  any
limitations contained in the Articles and in the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
 
The Company maintains insurance for the benefit of the Company’s directors and officers against
liability incurred by them in their capacity as directors and officers. The policy provides coverage
in respect of a maximum total liability of $5 million, subject to a deductible of $25,000 per event
with the exception of a deductible of $100,000 per event for securities claims. The premium for
2011 was $19,800 and in 2012 is $19,800. The policy contains standard industry exclusions and
no claims have been made to date.
 
INTEREST OF INFORMED PERSONS IN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS
 
No  informed  person  or  proposed  director  of  the  Company,  or  any  associate  or  affiliate  of  any
informed  person  or  proposed  director,  has  had  a  material  interest,  direct  or  indirect,  in  any
transaction of the Company since the commencement of the Company's last fiscal year or in any
proposed transaction which has materially affected or would materially affect the Company.
 
MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS
 
Except as otherwise disclosed herein, no management functions of the Company are performed
to  any  substantial  degree  by  a  person  other  than  the  directors  or  executive  officers  of  the
Company.
 
DISCLOSURE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
The following discloses the Company’s corporate governance practices as required by National
Instrument 58-101 Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices.
Independence of Members of Board
The Company’s board of directors currently consists of five directors. Three of the directors, Brian
Atkins, Dave Nickerson and John MacPherson, being a majority, are considered independent of
management  and  of  any  significant  shareholder  and  are  considered  competent  to  exercise
independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors. None of these directors
have  any  direct  or  indirect  material  relationship  with  the  Company  or  have  any  relationship
pursuant  to  which  they  may  accept  directly  or  indirectly  any  consulting,  advisory  or  other
compensatory  fees,  other  than  as  remuneration  for  acting  in  his  capacity  as  a  member  of  the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof.
The Chairman of the Board, John F. Kearney, is not independent in that he is also President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Alan B. Taylor is not independent as he is the Vice-
President Exploration and Chief Operating Officer of the Company.
The  Chairman  of  each  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Compensation  Committee  is  an
independent  director,  who  provides  leadership  to  those  committees,  and  the  Chairman  of  the
Board does not sit on either committee. Three of the five board members of the Company are
independent and this is considered sufficient at the current time to enable the Board to carry out
its duties and responsibilities. The Company does not have an appointed lead director.
16
Management Supervision by the Board
The  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Operating  Officer  report  upon  the  operations  of  the
Company directly to the Board on a regular basis. The independent directors are able to meet at
any  time  they  consider  necessary  without  any  members  of  management,  including  non-
independent  directors,  being  present.  The  Audit  Committee  is  composed  of  independent
directors  who  meet  with  the  Company’s  auditors,  and  without  management  in  attendance  if
considered necessary or desirable. The independent directors have regular and full access to
management  and  are  able  to  meet  at  any  time  without  the  non-independent  directors  being
present  if  considered  necessary  or  desirable.  The  independent  directors  hold  in  camera
discussions at every quarterly Audit Committee meeting to facilitate open and candid discussion
amongst themselves.

Position Descriptions
The  Board  has  not  developed  written  position  descriptions  for  the  Chair  of  the  Board  or  the
Chairs of each of the Committees. The Board is of the view that the role and responsibilities of
the Chair and of the Chairs of the respective Committees are sufficiently specific that no separate
written position descriptions would be helpful.
The Company does not have an employment contract, or a written position description, in place
with its President and Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the
day to day operations of the Company and reports directly to the Board of Directors on a regular
basis. The Board responds to, and if it considers appropriate, approves with such revisions as it
may require, recommendations which have been brought forward by the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition to those matters which by law must be approved by the Board, all significant activities
and  actions  proposed  to  be  taken  by  the  Company  including  in  particular  capital  budgets,
financing,  property  acquisitions  or  dispositions,  senior  appointments  and  compensation  are
subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
Orientation and Continuing Education
 
 
The Company does not have a formal orientation or education program for directors. New Board
members are provided with information respecting the functioning of the Board of Directors and
its Committees. In addition, directors receive copies of Board materials, corporate policies and
procedures, and other information regarding the business and operations of the Company. Board
members are expected to keep themselves current with industry trends and developments and
are encouraged to communicate with management and, where applicable, auditors and technical
consultants of the Company, and visit the Company’s offices on a regular basis. Board members
have access to legal counsel to the Company in the event of any questions or matters relating to
the Board members’ corporate and director responsibilities and to keep themselves current with
changes in legislation. Board members have full access to the Company’s records and general
industry information and material of interest is circulated to directors on a regular basis.
Ethical Business Conduct
The Board assumes responsibility for the Company’s approach to corporate governance matters.
The Board views good corporate governance and ethical business conduct as an integral and
essential  component  to  the  supervision  and  management  of  the  Company  and  to  meet
responsibilities to shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.
The Board has adopted a written code for directors, officers and employees – a copy of this Code
can  be  found  on  the  Company’s  website  at www.canadianzinc.com.  The  Code  is  intended  to
define  the  ethical  and  regulatory  standards  applicable  to  all  directors,  officers  and  employees
(including contractors) of the Company, and their family members, and provides guidance as to
the following matters (being a summary and not an exhaustive list): honest and ethical conduct;
avoidance  of  conflicts  of  interest,  whether  actual  or  potential;  full,  fair,  accurate,  timely  and
understandable  disclosures;  compliance  with  legislation  and  regulations;  prompt  internal
disclosure of any violation of the Code; and accountability for any failure to respect the Code.
The  Code  is  not  considered  a  comprehensive  guide  to  all  the  Company’s  policies  or  to
individuals’  responsibilities  under  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  The  Code  is  intended  to
provide general parameters and expectations of the Company and is provided to all directors,
officers, employees and key contractors when they commence their services with the Company.
18
The Board requires an annual review of the Code, conducted by the CFO. This review consists
of interviews and queries within the Company, the results of which are then reported by the CFO
at  a  full  meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  form  of  the  review  is  intended  to  determine
whether there are any violations of the Code that have not been previously reported and also to
ensure  that  the  Code  has  been  understood  by  recipients.  Should  any  matters  come  to  the
attention  of  the  Company  during  this  review,  or  at  any  other  time,  they  are  discussed  by  the
Board.
The  Board  conducts  periodic  reviews  of  the  Company’s  corporate  governance  practices  and
procedures  in  the  light  of  applicable  rules  and  guidelines  and  the  current  status  and  stage  of
development of the Company.
Directors are expected to adhere to all corporate law requirements in respect of any transaction
or  agreement  in  which  they  may  have  a  material  interest.  It  is  a  requirement  of  applicable
corporate law that directors who have an interest in a transaction or agreement with the Company
promptly disclose that interest at any meeting of the Board at which the transaction or agreement
will be discussed and abstain from discussions and voting in respect to same if the interest is
material. Where appropriate any director having a material conflict of interest will be expected to
withdraw  from  the  meeting  and  not  participate  in  the  meeting  where  such  matter  is  being
considered so that the remaining directors may properly exercise independent judgment.
Nomination of Directors
The Board has not appointed an independent Nominating Committee. Nominations, if and when
they arise, are generally the result of formal or informal discussions with members of the Board or
recommendations  by  members  of  the  Board.  Nominations  to  the  Board  are  determined,  after
appropriate review and investigation, by the Board of Directors as a whole.
Compensation Committee
 
The Board has appointed a Compensation Committee which has responsibility for determining
compensation for the directors and senior management. In 2011, the Compensation Committee
of the Board (the “Committee”) consisted of Brian Atkins, John MacPherson and Dave Nickerson
(all considered independent directors).
 
Pursuant to its Charter, the Committee has, among others, the following responsibilities:
 
·  Review  and  make  recommendations  to  the  Board  regarding  the  Company’s  compensation
plans, including with respect to incentive-compensation plans and equity-based plans, policies
and programs.
·  Review  the  level  and  form  of  the  Directors’  compensation  and  recommend  changes  to  the
Board for consideration and approval.
·  Review  and  monitor  the  Company’s  employee  and  management  compensation  and  benefit
plans and policies, provide oversight of any employee benefit plan, and review and approve the
compensation of the Company’s executive officers.
·  Annually review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”) compensation, evaluate the CEO’s performance in light of those goals and objectives
and  establish  the  individual  elements  of  the  CEO’s  total  compensation  based  on  this
evaluation.
·  Review  and  make  recommendations  to  the  Board  with  regard  to  grants  and/or  awards  of
restricted  stock,  stock  options  and  other  forms  of  equity-based  compensation  under  the
Company’s stock option, incentive-compensation and equity-based plans (as applicable).
·  Review  and  make  recommendations  for  the  Board,  when  and  if  appropriate,  of  employment
agreements, severance agreements and change in control provisions / agreements for the CEO
and other executive officers.
19
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the compensation of the
President and Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee meets as requested by the
Board  or  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  or  as  considered  desirable  by  the  Committee.  The
Compensation  Committee  has  the  authority  to  retain  independent  advisors  as  it  may  deem
necessary or appropriate to allow it to discharge its responsibilities.
Other Committees
In  addition  to  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  also  has  a
Health and Safety Committee comprised of Alan Taylor, Dave Nickerson and the Prairie Creek
Site  Managers.  The  function  of  the  Health  and  Safety  Committee  is  to  review  the  Company’s
Health  and  Safety  Policies,  practices  and  programs,  to  oversee  and  regularly  evaluate  the
Company’s Health and Safety performance and to monitor and advise the Board on current and
anticipated future best practices and regulatory issues relating to Health and Safety.
Assessment
The Board of Directors continuously reviews on an ongoing informal basis the effectiveness of
the  Board  as  a  whole  and  the  effectiveness,  contribution  and  performance  of  the  Board,  its
committees and individual directors. Each year, when it determines the number of directors to be
elected  at  the  annual  meeting  of  shareholders,  the  Board  considers  its  appropriate  size  and
composition  to  properly  administer  the  affairs  of  the  Company  and  to  effectively  carry  out  the
duties of the Board, given the Company’s current status and stage of development.

APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS
 
Unless such authority is withheld, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote
for the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company for the 2012 fiscal year,
and to authorize the directors to fix their remuneration.
 
Ernst & Young LLP were first appointed as auditors of the Company in May 2, 2005.
 
PARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
 
Adoption of 2012 Stock Option Plan
 
The Board of Directors has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company to
increase the number of common shares of the Company that may be issued on exercise of stock
options  from  6,000,000  shares  (under  the  Company's  current  2010  Plan)  to  7,500,000  shares
under  a  new  fixed  2012  stock  option  plan  (the  "2012  Plan").  7,500,000  common  shares
represents approximately 4.8% of the Company's outstanding shares as at May 9, 2012.
 
Both the current 2010 Plan and the proposed 2012 Plan are fixed stock option plans pursuant to
which stock options to purchase common shares of the Company may be granted to employees,
officers  and  directors  of  the  Company  or  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  and  other  persons  or
companies engaged to provide ongoing management or consulting services (“service providers”)
for the Company or any entity controlled by the Company. In determining the number of common
shares  of  the  Company  subject  to  each  option  granted  under  the  stock  option  plans,
consideration is given to the present and potential contribution by such person or company to the
success of the Company.
At  December  31,  2011,  there  were  6,110,000  stock  options  outstanding  all  of  which  were
previously granted under the Company's 2004 stock option plan (the “2004 Plan”). No new stock
options will be granted under the 2004 Plan, which is a 10% rolling stock option plan, but the
6,110,000 stock options currently outstanding under the 2004 Plan will remain outstanding and
subject to the 2004 Plan. Stock options will only be granted under the 2012 Plan to the extent
that the aggregate number of stock options outstanding under the 2012 Plan and the 2004 Plan
does not exceed 7,500,000. The 2012 Plan will be effective upon approval of the 2012 Plan by
the shareholders at the Meeting, and in that case will replace the 2010 Plan. In the event the
shareholders do not approve the 2012 Plan at the Meeting, the 2010 Plan will continue in full
force  and  effect  with  a  6,000,000  common  share  limit,  and  stock  options  will  only  be  granted
under the 2010 Plan to the extent that the aggregate number of stock options outstanding under
the 2010 Plan and the 2004 Plan does not exceed 6,000,000.
During the three months ended March 31, 2011, 300,000 stock options were granted outside of
the Company’s stock option plan in accordance with the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange to
the Company’s newly recruited CFO.
 
The purpose of the Company’s equity compensation plans is to attract and motivate directors,
officers and employees of and service providers to the Company (collectively, the “Optionees”)
and thereby advance the Company’s interests by affording such persons with an opportunity to
acquire an equity interest in the Company through the stock options. The 2012 Plan authorizes
the board of directors (or compensation committee) to grant stock options to the Optionees on the
following terms (which terms are consistent with the terms of the 2010 Plan, other than the higher
maximum number of common shares issuable on exercise of stock options):
·  Options  may  be  granted  to  directors,  officers  and  employees  of  the  Company  as  well  as
persons or corporations engaged to provide services to the Company (or any entity controlled
by the Company) and any individuals employed by such persons or corporations.
·  The  maximum  number  of  shares  that  may  be  reserved  for  issue  under  the  2012  Plan  is
7,500,000  common  shares,  representing  approximately  4.8%  of  the  Company's  issued  and
outstanding shares as
21
·   of May 9, 2012. In addition, options shall only be granted under the 2012 Plan to the extent that
the aggregate number of shares reserved for issue under the 2012 Plan and the 2004 Plan
does not exceed 7,500,000 common shares.
·  The  total  number  of  shares  issuable  to  all  insiders  of  the  Company  at  any  time,  under  all
security  based  compensation  arrangements  of  the  Company,  cannot  exceed  10%  of  the
Company’s issued and outstanding shares.
·  The  number  of  shares  issued  to  insiders  of  the  Company  as  a  group,  within  any  one  year
period, under all security based compensation arrangements of the Company, cannot exceed
10% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares as at the end of such one year period.
·  The exercise price for stock options granted under the 2012 Plan must be not less than the
closing market price on the day preceding the date of grant of the stock options.
·  Vesting of stock options will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors, or any committee
authorized by the Board of Directors to administer the 2012 Plan.
·  The maximum term of stock options granted under the 2012 Plan will be ten years from the date
of grant, subject to extension in the event of a management imposed black-out period.
·  Any  outstanding  stock  options  with  an  expiry  date  occurring  during  a  management  imposed
black-out period or within five days thereafter will be automatically extended to a date that is ten
trading days following the end of the black-out period.
·  If  an  Optionee  ceases  to  be  eligible  to  receive  options  under  the  2012  Plan  as  a  result  of
termination  for  cause,  any  outstanding  options  held  by  such  Optionee  on  the  date  of  such
termination shall be cancelled as of that date.
·  If an Optionee ceases to be eligible to receive options under the 2012 Plan for reasons other
than termination for cause (or death), any outstanding options held by such Optionee at such
time shall remain exercisable for a period ending on the earlier of the expiry time of such stock
option  or  three  months  after  the  Optionee  ceases  to  be  eligible  to  receive  stock  options.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may, on a case by case basis, allow such
stock options to remain in full force and effect until any time up to the original expiry time of
such stock options, irrespective of whether such expiry time is more than three months after the
Optionee ceases to be eligible to receive stock options.
·  Any outstanding stock options held by an Optionee at the time of his or her death shall remain
exercisable by the person or persons to whom the rights of the Optionee's stock options are
passed by the will of the Optionee or the laws of descent and distribution for a period ending on
the earlier of the expiry date of such stock options or one year after the Optionee's death.
·  The  Board  of  Directors  may  from  time  to  time,  without  shareholder  approval  and  subject  to
applicable law and to the prior approval, if required, of TSX or any other regulatory body having
authority over the Company or the 2012 Plan, suspend, terminate or discontinue the 2012 Plan
at any time, or amend or revise the terms of the 2012 Plan or of any option granted under the
2012 Plan to:
(a)  make amendments of a clerical or typographical nature and to include clarifying provisions in
the 2012 Plan;
(b)  implement features or requirements that are necessary or desirable under applicable tax and
securities laws;
(c)  change vesting provisions;
22
(d)  change termination provisions for an insider provided that the expiry time does not extend
beyond the original expiry time under the 2012 Plan;
(e)  change  termination  provisions  for  an  optionee  who  is  not  an  insider  beyond  the  original
expiry time;
(f)  reduce the exercise price of a stock option for an Optionee who is not an insider; and
(g)  implement a cashless exercise feature, payable in cash or securities;
provided that no such amendment, revision, suspension, termination or discontinuance shall in
any manner adversely affect any stock option previously granted to an Optionee under the 2012
Plan  without  the  consent  of  that  Optionee.  Any  other  amendments  to  the  2012  Plan  or  stock
options granted there under will be subject to the approval of the shareholders.
 
·  The 2012 Plan does not contain any provisions relating to the provision of financial assistance
by the Company to Optionees to facilitate the purchase of common shares upon the exercise of
stock options.
·  Stock options granted under the 2012 Plan are not assignable, but may be exercised by the
personal representative of a deceased Optionee.
·  The 2012 Plan requires adjustments to the numbers of shares which may be acquired and the
exercise  price  of  stock  options  in  the  event  the  Company  proceeds  with  certain  changes  or
transactions  in  which  the  Company’s  share  capital  is  altered,  some  form  of  corporate
reorganization  or  special  distribution  is  completed,  a  merger,  amalgamation,  spinout
transaction,  plan  of  arrangement,  takeover  bid,  compulsory  acquisition  or  going  private
transaction is completed. In such case the provisions typically entitle the Optionee to acquire, at
the same aggregate price, the shares, cash, securities or other property to which the Optionee
would have been entitled had the Optionee held the shares issuable under the stock option
before such transaction, with certain exceptions.
There are currently 6,110,000 stock options issued and outstanding under the 2004 Plan, and
300,000  stock  options  issued  and  outstanding  outside  the  Company's  stock  option  plans,
representing  3.9%  and  0.2%,  respectively,  of  the  Company's  issued  and  outstanding  share
capital  as  at  May  9,  2012.  All  existing  stock  options  issued  under  the  2004  Plan  that  are
outstanding remain outstanding under the 2004 Plan but no new stock options will be granted
under the 2004 Plan. As at May 9, 2012, the Company can grant stock options for an additional
6,000,000 common shares under the 2010 Plan, representing 3.8% of the Company's issued and
outstanding share capital as at May 9, 2012, subject to the above-described restriction that stock
options  will  only  be  granted  under  the  2010  Plan  to  the  extent  that  the  aggregate  number  of
stocks options outstanding under the 2010 Plan and the 2004 Plan does not exceed 6,000,000.
In the event the 2012 Plan is approved by shareholders and implemented by the Company, the
Company will be able to grant stock options for an additional 7,500,000 common shares under
the  2012  Plan  (instead  of  an  additional  6,000,000  common  shares  under  the  2010  Plan),
representing 4.8% of the Company's issued and outstanding share capital as at May 9, 2012,
subject to the above-described restriction that stock options will only be granted under the 2012
Plan to the extent that the aggregate number of stocks options outstanding under the 2012 Plan
and  the  2004  Plan  does  not  exceed  7,500,000.  Assuming  the  2012  Plan  is  approved  by
shareholders at the Meeting and based on 6,110,000 stock options being issued and outstanding
under  the  2004  Plan,  the  Company  would  currently  be  in  a  position  to  grant  1,390,000  stock
options under the 2012 Plan, representing 0.9% of the Company's issued and outstanding share
capital as at May 9, 2012. As stock options are exercised, cancelled, expired or terminated over
time under the 2004 Plan, more stock options would become available for grant under the 2012
Plan.
 
The full text of the 2012 Plan will be available for review at the Meeting.
23
The approval of the 2012 Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of  the  Company  entitled  to  vote  and  represented  in
person or by proxy at the Meeting.
 
Shareholders will be asked at the Meeting to consider, and if thought fit, approve with or without
variation, the ordinary resolution in the form set forth below to approve the 2012 Plan:

issued  to  directors,  officers,  employees  and  service  providers  of  the  Company  and  its
subsidiaries  on  the  exercise  of  stock  options  may  not  exceed  7,500,000  common  shares,  as
described in the information circular of the Company, be and is hereby authorized and approved,
that all unallocated stock options issuable pursuant to such stock option plan be and are hereby
authorized and approved and that any one director or officer of the Company be and is hereby

agreements  and  writings,  as  he  may  in  his  sole  discretion  deem  necessary  or  advisable  in
connection with any of the matters referred to in these resolutions."

interests of the Company and recommend that shareholders of the Company vote in favour of the
resolution.
 
The persons named as proxies in the enclosed form of proxy intend to cast the votes represented
by proxy in favour of the foregoing resolution unless the holder of shares who has given such
proxy has directed that the votes be otherwise cast.
