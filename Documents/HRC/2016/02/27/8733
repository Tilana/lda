<p><b> I. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>1. Prior to addressing the thematic issues in this report, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to report on the activities he conducted during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur first wishes to thank the Governments of Japan, Romania, 
Senegal, South Africa and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for 
having responded positively to his requests for a country visit; he is awaiting the responses 
of the Governments of India and Thailand. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank 
the Government of Belarus for its invitation, which is currently under consideration. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur undertook three country 
visits: Romania, from 15 to 20 June 2009; the United Kingdom, from 21 to 26 June 2009; 
and Senegal, from 17 to 21 August 2009. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the 
Governments that have responded positively to his requests for visits and to urge 
Governments that have not yet done so to provide a response. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications with Member States 
</b></p>
<p>4. From 1 January to 31 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 28 
communications alleging violations of the rights of migrants to 18 Member States and 
received 10 responses from the Governments concerned. The Special Rapporteur thanks all 
the Governments that responded to his communications for their collaboration. He wishes 
to remind Governments that have not yet responded to do so and to address all the concerns 
raised in each communication. A summary of all communications sent during the period 
under review are included in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/14/30/Add.1).<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur attended various events at the 
international level. From 20 to 24 April 2009, he participated in the Durban Review 
Conference, held in Geneva pursuant to General Assembly resolution 61/149. On 24 April 
2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in an event on the theme &#8220;Migration, 
discrimination and economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;, held parallel to the Durban 
Review Conference and organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, with the participation of the International Labour Organization (ILO), 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International 
Organization for Migration. On 17 September 2009, he addressed the Human Rights 
Council at a panel discussion on human rights of migrants in detention centres, held 
pursuant to Council resolution 11/9.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur also actively engaged with civil society organizations 
through participation in events which focused on relevant thematic issues. On 2 and 4 June 
2009, he participated in events on the themes &#8220;The global economic crisis: implications for 
migration and development&#8221; and &#8220;Migrant children &#8211; unprotected and neglected in 
migration policies?&#8221;, organized by Migrant Forum in Asia, Migrants Rights International, 
the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants and the National 
Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. On 3 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur 
participated in a meeting on the theme &#8220;Migrant domestic workers forging ahead towards </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12615 
</p>
<p>an ILO convention: challenges and opportunities&#8221;, organized by the Migrant Forum in 
Asia, Migrants Rights International and the Asian Migrant Domestic Workers Alliance. He 
also participated in an expert meeting on migration and peace organized by the Spanish 
Society for International Human Rights Law.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur also contributed to regional dialogue on issues concerning 
his mandate. He was a keynote speaker at the 1st meeting of the Permanent Forum of Arab-
African Dialogue on Democracy and Human Rights, held at the headquarters of the League 
of Arab States in Cairo from 7 to 9 December 2009.  
</p>
<p>8. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur participated in the 16th annual meeting of 
special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, held from 29 June to 3 
July 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The rights to health and adequate housing in the context of 
migration 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur recalls the universality and indivisibility of human rights, 
and stresses that States must take immediate and concrete steps to ensure the realization of 
human rights for migrants at all stages of migratory processes in countries of origin, transit 
and destination. In this context, the present report is focused on the enjoyment of the rights 
to health and adequate housing for migrants in host countries, in the light of the growing 
trend in many host countries to adopt immigration policies and measures which 
significantly hamper the enjoyment of these rights by migrants.  
</p><p>10. In particular, the Special Rapporteur wishes to take this opportunity to draw the 
attention of Member States to a number of reports he received on violations of migrants&#8217; 
rights to health and adequate housing. He emphasizes that the enjoyment of these rights by 
all individuals in society regardless of their citizenship, nationality and immigration status 
is not only an end in itself as a matter of entitlement, but also a crucial means to ensure 
equitable human development and social integration of migrants in host societies. Migrants 
can play an active role in the social and economic development of host countries, 
particularly when their fundamental rights, such as the rights to health and adequate 
housing, are fulfilled in a manner that ensures equal opportunities and gender equity.  
</p>
<p>11. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur also outlines recommendations for 
States to consider in their efforts to respect, protect and promote the fundamental rights to 
health and adequate housing on an equal basis. Due to space limitations, he addresses only 
the aspects of these rights which are most pertinent to migrants and pays particular attention 
to migrant women and children, who warrant special protection. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Major challenges in the realization of migrants&#8217; rights to 
health and adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>12. In adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, States accepted the solemn 
commitment to promote the universal respect for, and protection of, all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. States also recognized that all human rights are universal, 
indivisible and interdependent and interrelated.1 The principle of non-discrimination 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 2), in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 2, para. 1; art. 26) and the International 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, para. 5. </p>


<p>GE.10-12615 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2, para. 2), recognizes that 
individuals are entitled to all human rights without distinction of any kind as to &#8220;race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status&#8221;. Economic, social and cultural rights are guaranteed to &#8220;everyone 
including non-nationals, such as refugees, asylum-seekers, stateless persons, migrant 
workers and victims of international trafficking, regardless of legal status and 
documentation&#8221;,2 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
obliges States to take immediate, deliberate, concrete and targeted steps towards the 
realization of these rights.3 The non-discrimination principle vis-&#224;-vis migrant workers is 
reinforced by the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (Convention on Migrant Workers), which 
guarantees the human rights of all migrant workers and their families. 
</p>
<p>13. Notwithstanding that the principle of non-discrimination is well established in 
international human rights law, some misconceptions related to its applicability to non-
nationals impede the universal implementation of the rights to health and adequate housing. 
Consequently, the enjoyment of these rights by non-nationals is often dictated by the host 
State&#8217;s laws, policies and practical concerns.  
</p>
<p>14. Various treaty bodies have expressed concerns that migrants and their families are 
often subject to discrimination in practice in the areas of employment, housing, health care 
and education.4 In the wake of the global economic crisis, discrimination and xenophobia 
have increased, as has the corresponding negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights 
by migrants. Increasingly, States have enacted restrictive measures which adversely affect 
the enjoyment of the rights to health and adequate housing, arguably as a means of 
deterring irregular migrants and promoting &#8220;voluntary&#8221; returns to countries of origin.5 Such 
laws discriminating against migrants or programmes and policies which fail to address the 
specific needs and vulnerabilities of migrants often make it difficult for migrants to obtain 
access to basic services or permit access only at levels that do not meet international human 
rights standards. 
</p>
<p>15. Further, the criminalization of irregular migration as well other related measures of 
immigration control may indirectly preclude the enjoyment of human rights by irregular 
migrants. Laws imposing requirements for public servants, health professionals, judiciary 
and other stakeholders to report irregular migrants to the police or immigration authorities 
effectively deny such migrants access to health care and housing, as well as access to 
justice, as they become reluctant to seek public services or legal remedies, fearing negative 
consequences flowing from the detection of their irregular status.6 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about a general lack of comprehensive 
policies and measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights to health and adequate 
housing for migrants. The absence of such policies and measures may give rise to violations 
of the States&#8217; obligation to take steps towards the full realization of these rights. For 
instance, newly-arrived migrants may face a variety of challenges in accessing health care

</p>
<p>or housing, given their limited command of the language of the host State and their lack of 
knowledge of the laws and systems in the host countries. The enjoyment of the rights to 
health and adequate housing by migrants would be effectively hampered in the absence of 
necessary support, such as the provision of language training or free information on 
relevant laws and regulations. 
</p>
<p>17. Connected to this concern is a lack of disaggregated indicators on the economic, 
social and cultural rights of all individuals, including migrants.7 While the use of such 
indicators is crucial in developing effective public policies which protect the rights to health 
and adequate housing of all individuals including migrants, data collected in many 
countries is not disaggregated by migrant status, rendering invisible irregular migrants in 
particular.8  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The right to health for migrants 
</b></p>
<p>18. The health dimension of migration and what the enjoyment of the right to health 
means in this context are key concerns for the international community. This right is a long-
established norm in international human rights law, with a defined scope and content.9 The 
central provision is article 12, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, in which the States parties clearly recognize &#8220;the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health&#8221;.  
</p><p>19. The application of the right to health to migrants is guaranteed by the principle of 
non-discrimination provided, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as 
well as in article 2, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. Further, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressly 
confirmed the States&#8217; obligation to ensure equal access to preventive, curative and palliative 
health services by all persons, including migrants regardless of legal status and 
documentation.10 Similarly, referring to article 5 (e) (iv) of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination recommended that States respect the right of non-citizens to health 
by, inter alia, refraining from denying or limiting their access to preventive, curative and 
palliative health services.11 
</p>
<p>20. Additionally, article 43 of the Convention on Migrant Workers specifically obliges 
States to ensure equal access to health care by regular migrant workers and their family 
members. The Convention also guarantees the right of migrant workers and their family 
members to receive any medical care that is urgently required for the preservation of their 
life or for the avoidance of irreparable harm to their health, regardless of their irregularity 
with regard to stay or employment (art. 28). 
</p><p>21. In analysing the normative content of this right, it is recalled that the right to health 
is not a right to good health, but rather a right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, 
goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable

<p>standard of health.12 Such facilities, goods and services must be available, accessible, 
acceptable and of good quality.13  
</p>
<p>22. The element of accessibility stipulates that health facilities, goods and services must 
be physically and economically accessible by all sections of the population, especially 
vulnerable or marginalized groups, without discrimination on any of the prohibited 
grounds. To that extent, the principle of non-discrimination constitutes an important starting 
point, although migrants are often discriminated against, in law and in practice, while 
attempting to gain access to health care. Many host countries justify restricting migrants&#8217; 
access to health care on the grounds of protecting their welfare systems from abusive 
claims and, increasingly, as a means of deterring migration. While this reasoning may look 
attractive and may be politically useful in host countries, several studies seriously question 
this premise and the desired deterrent effect of such measures. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Health conditions of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>23. A number of reports indicate that migrants may be more vulnerable to poor health 
by virtue of their often low socio-economic status, the process of migration and their 
vulnerability as non-nationals in the new country. While studies in several countries that 
belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have found that 
migrants generally may be of good health or initially gain benefits in improved health 
conditions from migration,14 such benefits diminish over time, partly due to the exposure to 
the adverse working, housing and environmental conditions that often characterize low-
income groups in industrial countries.15 Many migrants are often employed in the three &#8220;D&#8221; 
jobs (dirty, difficult and dangerous) in mostly informal and/or unregulated sectors with little 
respect for labour and other protection. Typically, such work is of intensive and temporary 
or seasonal nature, with significantly higher occupational hazards. 
</p>
<p>24. The mental health of migrants is also an issue of concern, as factors such as social 
isolation caused by separation from family and social networks, job insecurity, difficult 
living conditions and exploitative treatment can have adverse affects.16 While better 
economic opportunities may result in positive effects on migrants&#8217; mental health, other 
reports indicate that migrants suffer a higher incidence of stress, anxiety and depression 
than residents.17 Further concerns are expressed about the mental health of migrants in 
detention, in particular with regard to the lack of access to mental health care and services, 
and inadequate allocation of resources to treat mental health ailments while in detention.18 
</p>
<p>25. The processes of migratory movement may also have a significant negative impact 
on the health of migrants before they arrive in the host country. The stricter restriction for

</p>
<p>entry to richer Northern countries has increased the use of clandestine, unofficial and 
dangerous entries. For instance, vulnerable groups of migrants, such as asylum-seekers, or 
victims of trafficking and people-smuggling, may have been exposed to sexual and gender-
based violence, greater vulnerability to ill-health and may have had a diminished ability to 
exercise informed choices concerning their health in countries of origin or in transit. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the exposure to risk associated with 
population movements also raises migrants&#8217; vulnerability to psychosocial disorders, drug 
abuse, alcoholism and violence. In addition, limited access to health care during the transit 
and early insertion phases of migration increases the resultant burden of untreated 
conditions.19  </p>
<p><b> B. Challenges in accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>26. A considerable gulf exists between the rhetoric of the universal application of 
human rights and the enjoyment of these rights in practice. While the international human 
rights standards require that States provide essential primary health care to all individuals 
regardless of their nationality or immigration status,20 host States have been less willing to 
meet this standard, fearful that such a move will defeat migration control policies and 
overburden health and other social services. 
</p>
<p>27. Entitlements and access to health care for migrants and the level of such care vary 
enormously, depending on the State in focus as well as on immigration status.21 It may 
range from emergency care to expansive health coverage for all, including migrants in 
irregular situations. On one end of the spectrum, regular migrants satisfying certain 
conditions may have entitlements comparable to citizens of host States, although there may 
be differences between long-term and short-term migrants with regard to entitlements and 
access.22 On the other end, non-nationals may not be able to access life-saving medication, 
because facilities deny treatment on the basis of &#8220;being foreign&#8221; or not having a national 
identity document.23 What may exist between the two extremes is the payment for 
preventative and primary health care, including urgent or emergency care and free medical 
service on certain restricted grounds.24 Most countries, however, link access to non-
emergency health care to migrants&#8217; immigration status. 
</p>
<p>28. While States have developed different criteria for what constitutes emergency health 
care, this regrettably does not address the fundamental issue of not conditioning health care 
to a person&#8217;s immigration status. In this regard, mere commitment to emergency care is 
unjustified not only from a human rights perspective, but also from a public health 
standpoint, as a failure to receive any type of preventive and primary care can create health 
risks for both migrants and their host community. Experts have suggested that given the 
relatively small proportion of migrants in irregular situations and their underutilization of 
services, providing them with access to preventive and primary care rather than with

<p>delayed emergency intervention may actually lower the costs of the health system.25 In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur stresses the critical importance of providing migrants with 
essential primary health care, given that migrants may often have to self-medicate and use 
health services at a later stage in the progression of their ailments than members of the host 
community. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to health for migrant women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>29. Article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women guarantees the right to access health-care services, including family 
planning services, on a basis of equality of men and women. This provision is particularly 
pertinent, as migrant women and girls face specific challenges in the field of health. They 
may be subject to sex- and gender-based discrimination, such as mandatory HIV/AIDS, 
pregnancy or other testing without their consent, as well as sexual and physical abuse by 
agents and escorts during transit.26 In host States, many female migrants are employed in 
relatively low-skilled jobs within the manufacturing, domestic service or entertainment 
sectors, often without legal status and little access to health services. They are often subject 
to exploitation and/or physical and sexual violence by their employers or clients. They may 
be particularly vulnerable to HIV and have few alternative employment opportunities.27  
</p>
<p>30. Female migrant workers engaged in domestic services are one of the most 
vulnerable groups of migrant workers. There appears to be a widespread pattern of 
physical, sexual and psychological abuses of migrant domestic workers,28 and they are also 
often exposed to health and safety threats without being provided with adequate 
information about risks and precautions. Further, their vulnerability is heightened by the 
lack of domestic legal mechanisms recognizing or protecting their rights. Consequently, 
they are often excluded from health insurance and other important social and labour 
protections.29 Given the lack of health care, they tend to seek care late. 
</p>
<p>31. Migrant women and girls also often experience different and more problematic 
pregnancy and gynaecological health issues, compared to the host population.30 Many 
arrive from countries with poor sexual and reproductive health services or information, 
including on family planning, or with little knowledge or experience in such services. 
Consequently, the rate of unwanted pregnancies among migrant women and girls may be 
high and they may be more exposed to risks of deportation or coercive abortion than 
women from the host country.31 Indeed, owing to the persistent discrimination against 
pregnant women, the number of requests for abortion in populations of migrant women and

<p>girls may be up to three to four times higher than that of host populations. Additionally, the 
absence of prenatal care may contribute to the high incidence of premature births, 
preeclampsia, and other complications among migrant women and girls.32 In some countries 
where citizenship is granted based on the <i>jus soli</i> principle (birthright citizenship), several 
obstacles and limitations have been put in place, intended to prevent migrant women from 
giving birth in the host country and thus acquiring citizenship for their children.33 
Moreover, pregnant migrant women may be obliged to pay hospital fees based on their 
nationality or immigration status in cases where nationals do not have to pay. Particular 
concern is raised in relation to pregnant migrant women and girls in irregular situations 
who are charged for services rendered other than on an emergency basis.34  
</p>
<p>32. With regard to immigration detainees, the Special Rapporteur received reports of 
detainees being wilfully and maliciously denied proper medical treatment, to which they are 
entitled by legislation, while they are in the custody of the national authorities.35 This is 
particularly worrying with respect to children and women, as well as with respect to victims 
of torture. The denial of reproductive rights for those who have been sexually assaulted or 
the failure to provide adequate information on their reproductive choices in the event of 
pregnancy are breaches of the obligation of States to ensure equal access to health care.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The right to health for migrant children 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Convention on the Rights of the Child extensively provides for the right of the 
child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health (art. 24). In that same 
article, obligations are placed on States to make every effort &#8220;to ensure that no child is 
deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services&#8221; by, inter alia, providing 
children with &#8220;necessary medical assistance and health care&#8221; and ensuring &#8220;appropriate 
prenatal and post-natal healthcare for mothers&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. Regrettably, there are vast discrepancies between international human rights norms 
and their actual implementation in the field of health care for migrant children, whether 
these children are in regular or irregular situations, accompanied or unaccompanied. 
Inadequate care has long-lasting consequences on a child&#8217;s development; for this reason, 
and in the light of the State duty to protect the most vulnerable, access to health care for 
migrant children should be made an urgent priority.  
</p>
<p>35. In general, the constraints on the rights of adult migrants immediately have an 
adverse impact on the rights of their children, and in the long term, may inhibit the 
children&#8217;s development.36 Reports suggest that poor working and economic conditions for 
migrant adults affect the general health and welfare of their children, as manifested in the

<p>birth of premature babies and increased risks of serious illness or death.37 Further, where 
migrant parents are deprived of health care, their children will also likely be deprived of 
such care. 
</p>
<p>36. The legal status of migrant parents may also affect access to health care by migrant 
children. While some migrant children may be citizens of the host country by virtue of <i>jus 
soli</i>, they may still face obstacles in accessing health care, in particular if their parents are 
migrants in irregular situations and therefore reluctant to seek health care for fear of their 
immigration status being detected. Similarly, many children in irregular situations are not 
enrolled in schemes for low-income migrant children that provide health care regardless of 
ability to pay, because their parents are reluctant to approach the social services for fear of 
being reported to the authorities.38  
</p>
<p>37. In addition, certain laws, policies and measures may indirectly hamper irregular 
migrant children&#8217;s access to health. For instance, in some countries, a parent must be a 
regular migrant in order to obtain a birth certificate for her child, thus making access to 
health care difficult for children of migrants in irregular situations. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur also expresses particular concern about the administrative 
detention of migrant children and recalls his earlier pronouncements that the detention of 
migrant children should be a last resort.39 He notes with concern that children suffering 
from serious medical conditions as well as children with disabilities were routinely kept in 
detention despite guidelines stating clearly they should not be. The health concerns for 
migrant children in detention are further exacerbated by the provision of inadequate 
medical services and treatment.40 Further, there is a failure to properly diagnose the mental 
health of children as well as inadequate access to counselling and other assistance.41  
</p>
<p><b> V. The right to adequate housing for migrants 
</b></p>
<p>39. The importance of ensuring the fulfilment of the right to adequate housing cannot be 
overemphasized, given its relationship to the realization of other fundamental human rights, 
such as the right to health. Clearly, the lack of adequate housing may trigger many health 
problems, such as poor nutrition, mental health problems and substance abuse,42 as well as 
illness caused by the lack of safe drinking water or sleeping rough. Despite the importance 
of this right, there still remains &#8220;a disturbingly large gap&#8221; between international human 
rights standards and the situation prevailing in many parts of the world,43 in particular with 
respect to migrant women and children.

</p>
<p>40. The right to adequate housing is an integral component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, as recognized in article 11, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Pursuant to this provision, States have obligations to 
take progressive measures to the extent of available resources, individually and through 
international assistance, to respect, protect and promote the right of everyone to adequate 
housing, regardless of their citizenship. Article 5 of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination also guarantees this right without 
distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin (art. 5 (e)), and the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination affirmed that discrimination on the basis of 
citizenship is prohibited.44 Under article 64, paragraph 1, of the Convention on Migrant 
Workers, States are also obliged to promote &#8220;sound, equitable and humane conditions&#8221; in 
connection with international migration, which arguably implies the right to adequate 
housing for all migrant workers. Regular migrant workers are also specifically guaranteed 
equal treatment in access to housing, including social housing schemes, and protection 
against exploitation in respect of rents under article 43, paragraph 1, of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>41. In analysing the challenges faced by migrants in the enjoyment of this right, it is 
important to note that the right to adequate housing is not a right to mere shelter, but the 
right to live in a safe, peaceful and dignified environment.45 Whether or not housing is 
adequate is contingent on a number of elements, including, inter alia, the security of tenure, 
affordability, accessibility, location and availability of services, facilities and infrastructure. 
In the context of migrants, the attention of the Special Rapporteur has been drawn to 
challenges in accessibility and the security of tenure, owing to migrants&#8217; vulnerable status 
as non-nationals. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges in accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>42. The principle of non-discrimination and equality plays a key role in ensuring that 
adequate housing is accessible to those entitled to it. In this regard, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has underlined that priority consideration should be 
afforded to disadvantaged groups to ensure full and sustainable access to adequate 
housing.46  
</p>
<p>43. In practice, however, a variety of challenges remain to be tackled in fully realizing 
this element of the right to adequate housing. In the private housing market, discrimination 
often inhibits migrants&#8217; access to adequate housing. Discrimination may be direct in the 
sense that some housing advertisements may explicitly indicate that certain groups of 
individuals are not desired as tenants or state preferences for nationals with permanent 
jobs.47 There are also reports that individuals identified or perceived to be from certain 
ethnic and religious groups have been subjected to discrimination in the private rental 
housing market, particularly since the attacks of 11 September 2001.48  
</p>
<p>44. Discrimination in housing may also result from poverty and economic 
marginalization. Migrants, who may experience marginalization in the labour market and 
often have difficulties in securing stable jobs with reasonable pay, are often relegated to a 
lower socio-economic status and may be subject to differential treatment by housing

<p>providers.49 The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context has 
received testimonies from migrant workers who did not have access to quality housing and 
who were forced to live in informal dwellings, on construction sites or in overcrowded 
houses, or to rent beds by the hour.50  
</p>
<p>45. Migrants may be subject to indirect discrimination in that certain criteria for 
accessing rental housing may have a disproportionate impact on them. For example, where 
landlords demand rental, credit or employment history records as part of applications for 
housing, newly-arrived migrants are at disadvantage as they do not have such records in the 
host State.51 The use of such criteria may constitute discrimination where they have a 
disproportionate impact on individuals on the grounds of citizenship or immigration 
status.52 In addition, newly-arrived migrants who do not speak the language of the host 
State may find it difficult to acquire information on the laws, contracts and other 
obligations relating to housing, as well as on governmental or community housing support. 
</p>
<p>46. Given their limited access to housing through the private market, it is of concern that 
migrants often do not enjoy the safety net provided by social housing in many countries, 
especially where there is a shortage of social housing in general.53 Certain categories of 
migrants, such as holders of temporary visas, may not be entitled to social housing,54 or 
migrants may be considered less desirable applicants than citizens.55 In some countries, the 
acquisition of citizenship is a requirement for renting social housing,56 which prevents 
newly-arrived migrants, including those in destitute situations, from gaining access to social 
housing.  
</p>
<p>47. Challenges in accessing adequate housing are even greater for irregular migrants; it 
is extremely difficult for them to rent private properties of good quality. The Special 
Rapporteur observed during his country missions that irregular migrant workers are often 
homeless or living in crowded, unsafe and unsanitary conditions.57 The difficulties are 
amplified in countries where the irregular presence of migrants is a criminal offence,58 and 
there are obligations to &#8220;denounce&#8221; irregular migrants. In some countries, it is in fact a 
criminal offence to let accommodation to irregular migrants.59  
</p>
<p>48. Further, irregular migrants often face practical obstacles in renting. For instance, 
landlords may require a variety of documentation, such as proof of residential registration,

<p>employment history and income statements, which is almost impossible for irregular 
migrants to provide.60 Thus, irregular migrants often resort to sublets or renting in an 
unofficial housing market, and must pay exorbitant rents despite the very poor conditions of 
the accommodation. Reports suggest that given the high rent, it is common for irregular 
migrants to live in overcrowded conditions and share beds with several other people who 
have different working schedules.61  
</p>
<p>49. In some cases, employers provide migrant workers with housing as part of the 
employment conditions. Often, however, the standards of housing provided are far from 
adequate. In some countries, migrant workers are provided with transport containers or 
trailers, or make-shift accommodations in buildings that they are constructing,62 which 
clearly does not meet the standards of adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>50. The precarious housing situations are further exacerbated by the fact that irregular 
migrants are usually excluded by law from most public services, including social housing.63 
Particular concern is expressed with respect to asylum-seekers who become irregular 
migrants and lose all social support and housing entitlements once their claims for asylum 
are rejected.64 Even when social housing is provided to rejected asylum-seekers, the 
housing provided may be below the adequate standards, designed to encourage their return 
to the countries of origin.65  
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges in security of tenure: forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>51. Adequate standards of housing encompass the security of tenure, which guarantees 
legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats.66 Forced eviction is 
&#8220;permanent or temporary removal against the will of individuals, families and/or 
communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and 
access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection&#8221;.67 It is widely acknowledged that 
forced evictions constitute gross violations of a broad range of human rights, particularly 
the right to adequate housing.68  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret the widespread practices of forced 
evictions of migrants around the world.69 There are many instances where migrants, most 
often vulnerable groups such as irregular migrants, asylum-seekers and unaccompanied 
children, are forcibly evicted from their homes without adequate notice, prior consultation 
or alternative accommodation.70 Such forced evictions often take place to clear slums, 
squatter camps and other informal settlements in the name of development, beautification

<p>and regeneration of the areas concerned, or for the holding of major events.71 In the absence 
of alternative accommodation provided by States, the evicted residents are often rendered 
homeless and pushed into areas where they have no access to basic services, employment 
opportunities or sources of livelihood.72 Reports suggest that irregular migrants are often 
arrested and arbitrarily deported to their countries of origin following forced evictions.73 
These practices of forced evictions clearly undermine not only migrants&#8217; right to adequate 
housing, but also other related rights such as the rights to health, food, water and education.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to adequate housing for migrant women 
</b></p>
<p>53. Women face significant barriers in accessing adequate housing due to 
discrimination74 and migrant women are subject to multiple discrimination given their 
marginalized status in societies. Labour market opportunities for women from developing 
countries are often skewed towards care activities, domestic work and the informal sector, 
which often provide very low wages and labour protections.75 Clearly, the resultant low 
socio-economic status of migrant women adversely affects their access to housing. 
</p>
<p>54. In some occupations, such as domestic work, women migrant workers may be 
provided with housing by their employers or legally required to live with them as part of 
the conditions for their visa sponsorships.76 However, numerous reports indicate that the 
housing conditions of domestic workers are often grossly inadequate, without running 
water or adequate sanitary facilities.77 Such workers may also have no privacy and may be 
forced to sleep on the kitchen or bathroom floor, which degrades the workers&#8217; dignity and 
leads to psychological abuse.78 Even in such situations, migrant women would be reluctant 
to complain about the housing conditions for the fear of the loss of employment and forced 
evictions, thereby perpetuating the violations of their right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also recalls the linkage between violence against women 
and the right to adequate housing.79 Many migrant women are vulnerable to various forms 
of violence, including domestic violence, sexual abuse and harassment, physical violence 
and forced evictions. Such violence is a serious concern for migrant domestic workers, 
whose options are effectively reduced to either enduring violence or reporting it to the 
authorities, thereby risking homelessness and eventual loss of employment and deportation. 
Further, migrant women at risk of homelessness are made even more vulnerable to further 
violence, such as sexual exploitation and trafficking.

</p>
<p><b> D. The right to adequate housing for migrant children 
</b></p>
<p>56. The right to adequate housing is specifically guaranteed to children under article 27 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognizes the right of every child to a 
standard of living adequate for the child&#8217;s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social 
development. Where necessary, States are also obliged to provide parents and others 
responsible for the child with material assistance and support programmes, particularly with 
regard to nutrition, clothing and housing. This right is not limited to children who are 
nationals, but extends to all children, including asylum-seeking, refugee and migrant 
children, irrespective of their nationality, immigration status or statelessness.80  
</p>
<p>57. A lack of adequate housing may have a profound impact on children, given the 
integral link between children&#8217;s housing rights and living conditions, and their cognitive, 
physical, cultural, emotional and social development. A safe and secure living environment 
is crucial for them in realizing a whole range of other human rights, such as the rights to 
education, health and personal security.  
</p>
<p>58. The stark reality is that this right remains unfulfilled in many parts of the world, 
often owing to the higher risk of poverty experienced by migrant children as compared to 
national children.81 A study shows that migrant children are more likely than national 
children to live in overcrowded housing, which may have a negative impact on their 
development.82 The concern is heightened with respect to irregular migrant children, whose 
right to adequate housing is dictated by the conditions of social exclusion that their families 
are subjected to. The lack of access to adequate housing for irregular migrant parents means 
that their children are deprived of housing as well.83 The Special Rapporteur has also been 
informed of cases where the authorities are willing to provide housing assistance to 
irregular migrant children, but not to their families. This gives rise to difficult situations 
where children must either choose to live with their families at risk of homelessness, or 
separate from them to receive housing assistance.84  
</p>
<p>59. Further, concern is expressed in particular with respect to independent, 
unaccompanied migrant children. Unaccompanied children are particularly vulnerable to 
social exclusion and often have limited access to housing, due to the absence of adults&#8217; 
assistance either via social networks or housing markets.85 Thus, independent and 
unaccompanied migrant children are more likely to be homeless or to live in collective 
dwelling or temporary homes of lower quality, such as shacks and rooms, compared to 
national children or migrant children with parents or guardians.86 A study conducted by the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) shows that the vast majority of independent 
migrant children in developing countries often sleep on the streets and in markets, shop 
fronts and kiosks, which exposes them to inadequate sleep, sexual harassment, robbery and

<p>assault.87 Even where unaccompanied children are provided with housing by the State, they 
are often accommodated in hostels or bed and breakfast accommodation,88 which may not 
be a suitable environment for children. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Good practices 
</b>60. In discharging his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has come across a number of 
initiatives, activities and policies implemented by Governments, international 
organizations, civil society and other stakeholders which reflect their commitment to the 
realization of migrants&#8217; rights to health and adequate housing. He believes it is important to 
exchange information on good practices with a view to bridging policy and protection gaps 
at all levels. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur commends efforts undertaken by Governments to ensure 
migrants&#8217; access to economic and social rights, regardless of immigration status. For 
example, the Migration Law (Law 25.871 of 2004) of Argentina recognizes the State 
obligation to ensure equal access to, inter alia, shelter, social services, public goods, and 
health for migrants and their families, regardless of immigration status. In Spain, all 
migrants, regardless of immigration status, are also entitled to register in the local 
government&#8217;s register, which is a requirement for, inter alia, having access to education and 
health care. It is worth noting that the content of the registration information is not shared 
with immigration authorities. 
</p>
<p>62. A number of initiatives have been also undertaken at the regional level. For 
example, the Migration Policy Framework for Africa, adopted by the African Union in 
2006, aims at developing a coordinated migration policy based on common priorities, 
including the interlinkages among migration, poverty and conflict as well as between 
migration and health.89 In 2008, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also 
developed the <i>Guidelines for the Preparation of Progress Indicators in the Area of 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</i>, in which it recommends that States consider groups 
and sectors enduring situations of severe inequality which limit their enjoyment of social 
rights, including migrants in irregular situations.90 In the Asia-Pacific region, there are 
initiatives, such as the Joint United Nations Initiative on Mobility and HIV/AIDS in South-
East Asia, which seek to develop and strengthen policies, legislation, plans and mechanisms 
to ensure universal access by migrants to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support 
services throughout the migration cycle. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur also notes initiatives undertaken by trade unions. For 
example, the Estonian Association of Trade Unions, the Central Organization of Finnish 
Trade Unions (SAK) and the Finnish Union of Salaried Employees (TU) provide 
information to migrant workers on housing, work permits, taxes, employment applications 
and services offered by trade unions. In the Republic of Korea, the Medical Mutual-Aid 
Union for Migrant Workers in Korea systematically responds to the issues of irregular 
migrant workers and its programmes have been expanded to provide regular migrant 
workers without workplace health insurance with, inter alia, health care and treatment 
through a mobile clinic in several cities, as well as financial support for medical expenses 
such as hospitalization, emergency treatment and childbirth/delivery.

</p>
<p><b> A. The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur welcomes national constitutions which recognize universal 
access to health regardless of immigration status, such as those of Colombia (art. 49) and 
South Africa (art. 27), and encourages other States to follow these practices. Some 
countries, such as Uruguay91 and Argentina,92 prohibit by law the denial of health-care 
services on the grounds of irregular immigration status. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur has also been informed of the initiative by the Ministry of 
Manpower of Singapore in September 2009 to increase the minimum medical insurance 
coverage of foreign workers. He also was informed of the adoption in 2003 of the Act on 
Foreign Workers&#8217; Employment in the Republic of Korea, which introduces the 
Employment Permit System for foreign workers. The System contains specific provisions 
for health insurance and coverage for the occupational health and safety of migrant workers 
in the manufacturing sector. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the guidelines for grantees adopted by the 
Department of Health and Human Services of the United States of America, which requires 
its health and welfare institutions to provide interpretation services and translation of vital 
documents for clients who do not speak English.93  
</p>
<p><b> B. The right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the universal application of the right to adequate 
housing by regional human rights mechanisms. The European Committee of Social Rights 
recently enunciated that a State has an obligation to provide adequate shelter to irregular 
migrant children as long as they are in its jurisdiction and to ensure that the conditions 
should be such as to ensure human dignity.94 The Special Rapporteur encourages other 
regional human rights mechanisms to promote the principle of non-discrimination in the 
application of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the provision of clear guidance on the 
responsibilities of housing providers in ensuring equal access to housing. For example, in 
Canada, the <i>Policy on Human Rights and Rental Housing</i>, adopted by the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission in 2009, states that a prospective tenant cannot be refused a rental 
apartment on the grounds of, among other things, his or her race, colour, ethnic background 
or citizenship, including refugee status. Harassment by housing providers or other tenants 
or any unfair treatment on those grounds are also prohibited.  
</p>
<p>69. The attention of the Special Rapporteur has been also drawn to initiatives 
undertaken by trade unions, such as the operation of a seasonal work centre for migrant 
workers by the trade union confederations Conf&#233;d&#233;ration Fran&#231;aise D&#233;mocratique du 
Travail and Force Ouvri&#232;re of France, in partnership with employers and local government 
representatives. The centre provides information to migrant workers on, inter alia, their

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>70. <b>In conclusion, the realization of the rights to health and adequate housing plays 
a crucial role in the integration of migrants in host societies. Obstructing and limiting 
access to services, institutions and goods that give effect to such fundamental rights 
represents not only violations of migrants&#8217; human rights, but also obstacles to 
migrants&#8217; inclusion and their active participation in the host States. In the view of the 
Special Rapporteur, such denial of human rights carries significant costs not only to 
migrants and their home countries, but also to host countries, including social 
disintegration and public health dangers. Despite progress made as a result of a 
number of encouraging good practices, the Special Rapporteur considers that many 
challenges lie ahead and wishes to make the following recommendations.</b>  
</p>
<p>71. <b>As a matter of fundamental principle, States should fulfil the &#8220;minimum core 
obligation&#8221; to ensure the satisfaction of minimum essential levels of primary health 
care as well as basic shelter and housing for all individuals within their jurisdiction,</b>95 
<b>regardless of their citizenship, nationality or immigration status, including migrants, 
migrants in irregular situations, migrant children and women. In times of severe 
resource constraints, the vulnerable members of society must be protected by the 
adoption of relatively low-cost targeted programmes</b>. 
</p>
<p>72. <b>States should expressly recognize in laws the rights to health and adequate 
housing for all individuals, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. 
Particular attention should be paid to removing laws which have a disproportionately 
negative impact on the enjoyment of these rights, such as the criminalization of 
irregular migration and the &#8220;obligation to denounce&#8221;. States should also strengthen 
legal frameworks to guarantee access to justice regardless of immigration status.</b> 
73. <b>States should collect disaggregated data and develop indicators on access to the 
rights to health and adequate housing by all individuals, paying particular attention to 
vulnerable groups such as migrants in irregular situations, migrant children and 
women. The indicators should form the basis of rights-based interventions designed to 
promote access to the rights to health and adequate housing by all.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>As newly-arrived migrants may encounter practical difficulties in obtaining 
information which enables them to meaningfully exercise their rights, States should 
provide free information and advice on relevant laws, policies and regulations and 
local practice as well as language training for migrants who do not speak the language 
of the host States. </b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>States should also consider and develop policies on the regularization and 
integration of migrants in irregular situations in order to reflect their contributions to 
the host societies and to provide better protection of their rights, including those to 
health and adequate housing.</b>

</p>
<p><b> A. The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>States are obligated under international human rights law to provide essential 
primary health care for migrants, including preventative and palliative care, 
irrespective of their immigration status. To this end, there is a need to clarify or define 
the entitlements of the right to health for migrants at the national level, as well as the 
scope and function of the existing public reimbursement schemes. A distinction must 
be made between entitlement and access to health services for migrants.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>States should work to reduce obstacles to health care for migrants by ensuring 
that access to health services is not conditioned upon one&#8217;s immigration status. Access 
to health services for migrants should also be ensured while in detention. In this 
regard, States should work to remove legal and other impediments such as the 
&#8220;obligation to denounce&#8221; or similar provisions in their national laws which impede the 
enjoyment of access to health by migrants</b>.  
78. <b>States should also provide adequate information through campaigns and 
outreach, commit sufficient funds and promote implementation measures relevant to 
migrants&#8217; health issues. These policies should also (a) include the promotion of health 
services that are culturally and gender sensitive and conducive to reducing linguistic, 
communication and cultural barriers, and (b) be aimed at facilitating increased 
confidence and awareness of health services among migrant communities.</b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>States should provide appropriate training to civil servants working in the area 
of migration and health and sensitize them on the issues of discrimination against 
migrants, particularly with respect to migrant women and girls and children. States 
must ensure that migrants are not denied access to health care due to uncertainty 
among public service providers, such as nurses and doctors, about what the law allows 
them to do for migrants.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>In view of the fact that migratory processes and living conditions of migrants in 
host States may have negative effects on their mental health, States should ensure that 
migrants&#8217; access to health care includes mental health care. In this regard, States 
should pay particular attention to improving the mental well-being of migrants by 
creating services that are integrated and appropriate to their needs. Further studies 
into the mental health needs of migrants, which recognize the crucial interrelationship 
between social circumstances and mental health and help provide an insight into 
relevant mental health care and assistance, in particular to migrant women, migrant 
children and migrants in detention, are required.</b>  
</p>
<p>81. <b>Sending, transit and receiving countries should have inclusive health access 
programmes to address the health requirements of migrants in a continuum. Such 
interventions must move beyond emergency care, and address physical, mental and 
social well-being, including reproductive health and infectious diseases, while 
providing adequate health education and information for migrants</b>. 
</p>
<p>82. <b>In view of the specific health risks to which migrant women and girls are 
exposed, the gender dimension often involved in migration and the structural power 
relationships which frequently govern women&#8217;s access to health care, States should 
provide adequate, appropriate and specialized medical assistance to migrant women 
and girls. States of origin should also provide free or affordable gender-sensitive pre-</b></p>


<p>GE.10-12615 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>departure information and training programmes which raise migrant women&#8217;s and 
girls&#8217; awareness of potential risks to their health.</b>96  
</p>
<p>83. <b>States should ensure the provision of standardized and authentic health 
certificates if required by host countries and oblige prospective employers to purchase 
medical insurance for migrant workers. All required pre-departure HIV/AIDS testing 
or other pre-departure health examinations must be respectful of the human rights of 
migrants and be</b> <b>accompanied with health information and health promotion efforts. 
Special attention should be paid to voluntariness, the provision of free or affordable 
services and to the problems of stigmatization.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The best interest of the child requires that States take specific measures to 
ensure that all migrant children are able to enjoy the right to health, including 
continued access to health, as well as the rights related to health, such as the right to 
obtain a birth certificate. The right to health for unaccompanied children must be 
ensured immediately upon arrival, regardless of their immigration status. 
Furthermore, any decision to repatriate children to countries of origin should take 
into account the access to the right to health in those countries in the determination of 
what is in the child&#8217;s best interest.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. The right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>States should develop a comprehensive national housing strategy taking into 
account the needs and circumstances of migrants, who are often vulnerable to 
homelessness. Through the housing strategy States should seek to address underlying 
factors which dictate people&#8217;s access to housing, such as low socio-economic status, 
gender, age and ethnicity.97 The strategy should also encompass a regular monitoring 
system for housing situations of migrants, both in public and private sectors, to 
identify and address any discriminatory practices.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>States should formulate comprehensive criteria which provide clear and 
practical guidance to housing providers on what constitutes discrimination on the 
basis of citizenship, nationality or immigration status and their responsibilities to 
ensure equal access to housing by all, including migrants.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Creative strategies at the local level are strongly encouraged, such as deposit-
guarantee and rent-deposit schemes, whereby a local authority or a housing 
association acts as a guarantor to the landlord to facilitate access to housing by 
migrants.98 In a similar vein, local authorities should proactively engage with 
landlords to promote equal access to housing through innovative programmes such as 
accreditation schemes for landlords, whereby the local authorities certify and approve 
responsible landlords.</b>99  
</p>
<p>88. <b>States should, at a minimum, provide migrants in irregular situations at risk of 
homelessness with a level of housing which ensures their dignity and allocate 
resources to shelters which provide assistance to migrants in irregular situations. In

<p>89. <b>States should ensure that evictions are carried out only in exceptional

Rapporteur on adequate housing (A/HRC/4/18, annex).</b>

migrant women and girls. In particular, States should develop mechanisms to monitor
