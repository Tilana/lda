<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert on the human rights situation in Somalia assumed his 
mandate in early June 2014, following his appointment by the Human Rights Council on 
8 May 2014. The Independent Expert wishes to thank the Council for its confidence in 
entrusting him with the mandate and also wishes to pay tribute to his predecessor for his 
work. The Independent Expert pledges to continue working with the Federal Government 
of Somalia, the subnational authorities, the international community and civil society 
partners towards enhancing the enjoyment of the basic rights and fundamental freedoms by 
the people of Somalia, as they yearn to live in a peaceful and democratic society. 
</p>
<p>2. In view of the reporting obligation under Human Rights Council resolution 24/30, 
the Independent Expert made preliminary inquiries of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, to organize a visit to Somalia in June-July 2014 
following his appointment. However, it was not feasible to undertake a visit that would 
yield any meaningful outcomes, as the holy month of Ramadan was approaching. The 
Independent Expert also needed to complete the requisite security training prior to 
travelling to Somalia. As it turned out, Al-Shabaab insurgents increased their attacks on 
Mogadishu at that time of the year, another factor which would have made such a mission 
unlikely. 
</p>
<p>3. In the light of those constraints, the Independent Expert undertook extensive 
background research on the prevailing socioeconomic, political, security, humanitarian and 
human rights situation in Somalia. This included reviewing reports by the outgoing 
independent experts, key Security Council resolutions, Human Rights Council resolutions, 
in particular Human Rights Council resolution 24/30 on assistance to Somalia in the field of 
human rights, the reports of the High Commissioner on high-level dialogues on assistance 
to Somalia in the field of human rights, as well as other reports by various international 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on the human rights situation in Somalia. 
</p><p>4. The Independent Expert also took advantage of his presence from 18 to 19 July in 
Nairobi, where he was undertaking security training, to meet with various stakeholders 
including United Nations agencies, donor countries and civil society organizations with 
which he exchanged a broad range of ideas and views on his mandate and the human rights 
situation in Somalia. Thereafter, between 21 and 24 July, the Independent Expert held 
discussions with relevant United Nations agencies, permanent missions, international 
organizations and international NGOs based in Geneva. The Independent Expert also held 
extensive discussions with the Permanent Representative of the Federal Republic of 
Somalia to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>5. The visits to Geneva and Nairobi were undertaken at a time when reports of a 
sustained Al-Shabaab campaign of terror and violence were impacting on the human rights 
situation. In recent months, Mogadishu in particular has witnessed targeted assassinations 
of government officials, members of the Somali Federal Parliament and attacks on vital 
institutions such as the Parliament and the Villa Somalia, the seat of Government. The 
attacks caused loss of life to members of the security forces and civilians, including women 
and children. 
</p>
<p>6. In spite of the violence, celebrations were held on 1 July 2014 throughout the 
country to mark the fifty-fourth anniversary of Somalia&#8217;s independence from colonial rule. 
The violence carried out by Al-Shabaab did not deter the Somali people from celebrating 
and exercising their right to freedom of assembly. </p>


<p><b> II. Situating the mandate of the Independent Expert 
</b>7. The Independent Expert intends to embark on his mandate guided by Human Rights 
Council resolution 24/30 on assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights and mindful 
of the recommendations that emanated from the stand-alone high-level interactive dialogue 
that was held on 24 September 2013. The Independent Expert acknowledges that the human 
rights situation in Somalia is complex, born out of the conflict which has affected Somalia 
for over two decades. The Independent Expert also firmly believes that the adoption of the 
Provisional Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia and the establishment of the 
Federal Government which marks its second year in office in September 2014 are key 
landmarks setting Somalia on the course for stability and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of the meetings 
</b>8. During his meetings in Geneva and Nairobi, the Independent Expert communicated 
his intention to prioritize support for efforts to reform and strengthen the institutional 
capacity of the security, rule of law and justice sectors so that those sectors continue to play 
an important role in the reconciliation and stabilization processes in Somalia. 
</p>
<p>9. Many of the interlocutors that the Independent Expert met agreed with him that the 
judiciary had an important role to play in fighting impunity and establishing accountability 
in Somalia. The question of how ex-Al-Shabaab combatants are handled was raised, with 
some noting that failure to handle such cases through properly established legal and judicial 
structures might have serious implications on impunity, accountability and future 
transitional justice processes. The Independent Expert learned about the challenges and 
tensions that existed between the formal legal system and Xeer (the customary legal 
system) and how that posed considerable challenges to the reform programmes within the 
justice sector. However, it was also noted that the positive aspects within Xeer should be 
identified and retained, and that it would be necessary to engage with clan elders on how 
Xeer can be made more human-rights compliant. The fight against impunity requires a 
linkage to be developed between the formal and customary justice systems. For Somalia to 
stabilize, it was emphasized that security and justice sector reforms were necessary and 
urgent. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to the security situation, the Independent Expert learned that Al-
Shabaab still controlled vast territories, particularly in south central Somalia. With no 
effective control over large parts of the country, the Federal Government of Somalia was 
constrained in ensuring human rights for its population. The Independent Expert was 
informed that, while the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) working jointly 
with the Somali National Armed Forces continued to liberate new areas, its capacity was 
overstretched and it was not able to adequately protect the newly recovered areas. This had 
not only affected the ability of humanitarian actors to provide supplies and services to the 
vulnerable populations, but impeded Government and other stakeholders from conducting 
programmes that would be beneficial to the populations in those regions. The Federal 
Government needed to be supported in building strong federal institutions, ensuring 
development and delivering services. A warning was sounded that any perceived vacuum in 
service delivery risked a relapse into chaos. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding the concerns raised about the repatriation of Somali refugees into the 
country, the Independent Expert was informed that a moratorium had been placed on the 
implementation of the 10 November 2013 Tripartite Agreement signed between the 
Government of Kenya, the Federal Government of Somalia and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on repatriation of refugees to 
Somalia. The Independent Expert learned from UNHCR that it had not assisted any </p>


<p>repatriation because the security situation in Somalia did not guarantee voluntary 
repatriation and that both the Kenyan and Somali Governments were committed to adhering 
to that principle.  
</p>
<p>12. In the context of displacement and migration, the Independent Expert heard about 
the problem of irregular mixed migration flows across Somalia, due to push factors such as 
conflict and drought. Somalia is both a country of origin and a transit route for migrants. 
The Independent Expert was informed that human trafficking was a cause for concern. Also 
highlighted were the challenges facing the Somali nationals repatriated from Saudi Arabia, 
some of whom had reportedly been severely abused and who, upon return did not have 
anywhere to go. 
</p>
<p>13. The plight of internally displaced persons (IDPs) was also raised with the 
Independent Expert. Police protection within IDP settlements was reported to be lacking or 
inadequate and as such, reports of sexual violence against women and recruitment of child 
soldiers continued to be made notwithstanding other violations of their basic rights. In 
addition, the phenomenon of &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; and the practice of diversion of humanitarian 
assistance continued to negatively affect access of IDPs to such assistance. It was 
highlighted that internal displacement had brought to the fore the problem of land and 
property rights, since IDPs continued to face evictions and relocations from lands they 
occupied either by returning owners or the Government, and returnees wanted to reoccupy 
their lands and properties which had been occupied by displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>14. There were also allegations that IDPs were being forcibly returned to their areas of 
origin which were still under Al-Shabaab control. It was also pointed out that, while 
necessary, military operations by AMISOM and the Somali National Armed Forces had 
inevitably caused internal and external displacement of civilian populations and also 
interfered with the planting season. This combination of factors coupled with high food 
prices, and late and below normal rains was likely to lead to food shortages. The United 
Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported to the Independent 
Expert that early warning indicators showed that food insecurity and malnutrition were 
likely to increase during the second half of 2014. The worst affected areas in which the 
food security situation was expected to deteriorate in the months ahead included parts of 
Bakool, Gedo, Hiraan, Lower Shabelle and Middle Juba regions. Meanwhile, assessments 
indicated that about 203,000 children under the age of 5 were acutely malnourished while 
about 2.9 million people in the country needed urgent life-saving and livelihood support. 
The urgent need for humanitarian assistance was reiterated. As at the end of July 2014 there 
was still a funding gap of US$663 million towards the humanitarian needs outlined in the 
Strategic Response Plan for Somalia. 
</p>
<p>15. In several meetings, concerns about AMISOM military operations and their impact 
on civilian populations were brought to the attention of the Independent Expert. It was 
stated that credible reports indicated that during the March 2014 offensive against Al-
Shabaab in Jubaland, transgressions against civilians had been witnessed. The 
responsibility of AMISOM and other troop-contributing countries to protect civilian 
populations and adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law was 
underscored. In this regard, the Independent Expert was encouraged to follow up with 
AMISOM forces and the Somalia National Armed Forces to ensure that they adhered to 
human rights principles and norms. The Independent Expert was also urged to encourage 
AMISOM to establish a credible framework to track casualties, investigate violations, take 
measures to mitigate violations and hold persons accountable for violations. 
</p>
<p>16. With respect to the AMISOM engagement in humanitarian assistance, concerns 
were raised about the tension that was bound to be created between the stabilization and 
development approach employed by AMISOM in the wake of its military operations and 
the humanitarian approach based on the neutrality principle applicable to humanitarian </p>


<p>assistance in newly recovered areas. Some interlocutors were of the opinion that AMISOM 
or other military forces in Somalia should not engage in directly providing humanitarian 
assistance as this could blur the distinction between military forces and humanitarian actors 
and undermine the principles of neutrality, impartiality and operational independence which 
underpin the work of humanitarian actors.  
</p>
<p>17. The Permanent Representative of Somalia informed the Independent Expert that 
despite the number of resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council on Somalia, there 
had been little improvement in the human rights situation in the country. He emphasized the 
importance of studying the root causes of the conflict if durable solutions and a sustainable 
mechanism for peace and reconciliation were to be found. He also stated that 
implementation of the human rights road map which had been adopted by his Government 
had stalled and that there was need for the Independent Expert to bring added value to 
ensure its implementation. The Permanent Representative further encouraged the 
Independent Expert to support Somalia as it prepared for the second cycle of the universal 
periodic review.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Emerging issues, analysis and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>18. A number of issues emerged from the meetings held, which the Independent Expert 
intends to raise with the authorities of the Federal Government of Somalia and other 
stakeholders. Those issues touch on the various recommendations made under resolution 
24/30 as well as the commitments made by the Federal Government with a view to a better 
realization of human rights in Somalia. 
</p>
<p>19. The Independent Expert holds the view that it is necessary to identify and prioritize 
urgent technical assistance for Somalia. The Independent Expert intends to consult the 
Federal Government of Somalia and other international and bilateral partners on the need to 
prioritize implementation of reforms in the justice and security sectors, since they constitute 
an important component, during the short, medium and long term, for building a sustainable 
democratic system in Somalia. These sectors are also targeted under the first pillar of the 
Federal Government&#8217;s Six Pillar Policy which concerns ensuring full stability and the 
supremacy of the law and good governance 
</p>
<p><b> A. Justice sector reforms 
</b></p>
<p>20. The consequence of an ineffective judicial system is the denial of the right to 
equality before the law, the equal protection of the law, and access to justice by all, under 
conditions of equality before an independent judiciary, rights which are guaranteed not only 
in the Provisional Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia, but by international 
human rights law. The National Strategic Plan for Justice Reform for the period 2013 to 
2014 recognizes that there is no universally coherent and functioning judicial system in the 
country, due to the crisis that has spanned two decades. It recognizes the difficulty of 
rebuilding the system due to multiple, overlapping, and sometimes contradictory legal 
systems since pre-independence, namely the secular statutory-based laws, Islamic sharia 
and Xeer all of which currently apply in an uncoordinated manner. 
</p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert learned that under the National Strategic Plan for Justice 
Reform, implementation of reforms would cost an estimated US$42,495,000. Under the 
Plan, the Federal Government of Somalia will establish an integrated justice sector reform 
process in which all relevant actors in the sector will work to: provide speedy and just 
criminal trials, better access to criminal justice for vulnerable groups, and reduce the 
number of detainees. The Plan also seeks to establish: a human rights compliant legislative </p>


<p>framework that also promotes accountability, justice sector institutions that are accountable 
and support the rule of law, timely and equitable access to justice and effective enforcement 
of laws and rights as well as stronger cooperation between State and non-State institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Police reforms 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Independent Expert was informed of concerns about the inefficacy of the 
Somali Police Force in carrying out its protection activities, in particular its investigative 
functions. The Police Force is a key component of the justice and security sectors and must 
be prioritized for resource mobilization, technical assistance and capacity-building if 
Somalia is to make the transition to a culture of respect for the rule of law and the fight 
against impunity. In February 2013, the Federal Government of Somalia adopted the 
Somali Police Force Strategic Action Plan for Policing for the period 2013 to 2017. In the 
Action Plan, the Federal Government recognizes the challenges facing the Police Force and 
indicates that its comprehensive development programme would require an estimated 
US$50 million to bring it up to international standards.  
</p><p>23. That estimate, however, does not include operational costs or the development of the 
necessary oversight and coordination functions for operational and accountability 
requirements. Key action points under the Somali Police Force Strategic Action Plan 
include: conducting joint planning and coordination by all security forces to establish the 
rule of law in newly liberated areas, strengthening management capabilities and skills of the 
Somali police leadership, developing human resources and improving infrastructure and 
equipment. In the Action Plan it is estimated that it would cost between US$9 million and 
US$12 million to re-establish policing in newly liberated areas in the first year. 
24. The Independent Expert believes that it is important that international partners 
identify areas that require support from among the two above-mentioned action plans&#8217; 
activities and objectives, resource, management and skills issues. For instance the 
Independent Expert was advised that some reforms in the justice sector were being 
implemented with the support of various partners, such as the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), the Government of Italy and the International Development Law 
Organization. 
</p>
<p><b> C. African Union Mission in Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Independent Expert notes that a stable Somalia is the key to the realization of all 
human rights. The Independent Expert commends AMISOM and the Somali National 
Armed Forces for their sacrifices in deploying troops to fight Al-Shabaab and bring 
stability to Somalia. However, the Independent Expert is concerned that, in spite of their 
obligations to respect human rights law and international humanitarian law, reports allege 
that those troops were responsible for violations, during and after their operations in the 
newly liberated areas. Military operations have exacerbated internal and external 
displacement of the civilian population. The Independent Expert was disappointed to learn 
that as a probable result of improper planning, the recent offensives against Al-Shabaab 
might have interfered with the planting season, hence contributing to the current food 
insecurity. 
</p>
<p>26. The Independent Expert urges AMISOM and the Somali National Armed Forces to 
comply with human rights and international humanitarian law and practise zero tolerance to 
sexual exploitation and abuse. All reported violations should be fully investigated and the 
perpetrators brought to account. </p>


<p>27. The Independent Expert learned that from 31 July to 1 August 2014 AMISOM, in 
collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross, organized a workshop in 
Nairobi on the implementation of the AMISOM standard operating procedures on the 
handling of persons detained by AMISOM. The procedures take into account relevant 
international humanitarian and human rights law. Among issues raised were the 
practicalities of setting up transfer review boards in cases where detainees challenge a 
decision to be transferred to the competent Somali authorities, how to deal with issues 
concerning the non-refoulement of detainees, and to ensure that detainees who are 
transferred to the Somali authorities do not face capital punishment following a trial that 
does not respect internationally recognized judicial guarantees. The Independent Expert 
welcomes these discussions and urges AMISOM to implement the outcomes and 
recommendations from the meeting with immediate effect. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>28. Continued reports of IDPs facing generalized insecurity, lack of access to 
humanitarian assistance and human rights abuses, including evictions from settlements, 
rape and sexual violence, remain a concern. The Independent Expert was informed that the 
Somali National Police Force was unable to provide protection in IDP camps, hence the 
phenomenon of &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; who are self-appointed camp guards from clans within the 
territory where an IDP camp or settlement is situated.  
</p>
<p>29. Access to land and property rights have become a sensitive issue in Somalia. In a 
recent report, the International Organization for Migration stated:  
</p>
<p>Land ownership is a highly emotive and complex issue in Somalia, particularly in 
Mogadishu. The rush to access land across the city has sparked several disputes. 
Much of the premium land is contested as large portions of the land were 
appropriated during the 1991 civil war and the previous owners have returned to 
reclaim it. New occupants have resisted vacating the property and the Somali 
government has yet to create a legal body to handle the issue. Local courts in 
Mogadishu claim they are overwhelmed by the sheer size and complexity of the 
cases. Compounding the problem is the lack of reliable documentation that can be 
used to verify and adjudicate rightful ownership of land given the years of absent 
central governance and the fact that there is a history of communal land ownership.1 
</p>
<p>30. This raises the pertinent question of the extent and effect of the institutional capacity 
to address issues related to property rights, in particular questions of access to land by IDPs 
and refugees, some of whom have suffered displacement more than once. Land is critical 
for the livelihood of a large number of Somalis many of whom are currently internally 
displaced. In the absence of a well-established justice system, there is a likelihood of 
conflicts over land and property ownership emerging as the country moves towards 
stability.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Neutrality and impartiality of humanitarian workers 
</b></p>
<p>31. It will be recalled that during the high-level interactive dialogue on assistance to 
Somalia in the field of human rights held in September 2013 the Special Representative of 
the African Union, Chair and Head of AMISOM, informed the Human Rights Council that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 International Organization for Migration, Department of Operations and Emergencies, <i>Dimension of 
</i></p>
<p><i>Crisis on Migration in Somalia</i>, Working Paper February 2014 (Geneva), p. 25. </p>


<p>AMISOM was providing humanitarian assistance to the civilian population, such as 
rebuilding schools and health infrastructure and providing medical services and medicines. 
During his meetings with various interlocutors, the Independent Expert heard concerns 
about the AMISOM involvement in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, particularly 
how it was likely to have a negative impact on the humanitarian principles of neutrality and 
impartiality of humanitarian actors. It was pointed out that humanitarian actors could be put 
in danger as combatants might not distinguish them from the fighting forces. The matter 
requires urgent consultations between AMISOM and the humanitarian actors. The 
Independent Expert urges all parties concerned to work out acceptable operational 
guidelines in order to ensure that, in the interest of promoting and protecting their human 
rights, the people of Somalia continue to benefit from, in particular, the right to health, 
education and a safe environment. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Humanitarian appeal 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert recalls that Somalia experienced a severe famine in 2011 
and wishes to add his voice to the appeal by humanitarian agencies to the donor community 
to meet the current funding gap of US$663 million in order to avert a humanitarian disaster 
in Somalia and ensure the basic right to life. The Independent Expert holds the firm view 
that for long-term and sustainable peace and stability in Somalia, the improvement of the 
economic well-being of youth, women including girls, through providing education and 
vocational training, soft loans for small businesses, the establishment of economic activities 
such as fishing, support to agriculture and the improvement of the livestock sector, are 
crucial to underpinning the peace that has been established in newly recovered areas. The 
international community should therefore consider shifting from predominantly providing 
food relief which enables people to resist shocks and famine, to investing in financing 
livelihood projects, including vocational training, tailoring, fishing, and other economic 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Protecting freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>33. Continuing reports of harassment, intimidation and arbitrary killing of journalists 
and threats directed at media houses such as the recent directives to one of the private radio 
stations to close in Jowhar remain a concern for the Independent Expert. He urges all 
Somalis of different shades of political opinion and creed to respect the rights of journalists 
and the media to exercise their right to freedom of expression, as a fundamental right and as 
a critical component towards establishing a stable and democratic society in Somalia. In 
early July 2014, the Prime Minister of the Federal Government of Somalia, together with 
the Minister for Information, launched a three-day stakeholders&#8217; consultative conference to 
finalize views and adopt a draft media bill prior to tabling it before Parliament.  
</p>
<p>34. The Independent Expert sent a letter to the President of the Federal Government of 
Somalia noting that adoption of a media law was a key step towards the implementation of 
the human rights road map and encouraged the adoption of a law which guarantees and 
protects the right to freedom of expression, access to information and existence of free 
media. The Independent Expert also welcomes initiatives aimed at strengthening the 
capacity of media practitioners such as the workshop on the draft national gender policy 
and gender-based violence organized in May 2014 by the AMISOM Gender Unit in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development and the 
Ministry of Information. </p>


<p><b> H. Civil society and freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Independent Expert is concerned about allegations in some quarters that the 
Federal Government of Somalia is reticent about the prominent role played by civil society 
organizations in the delivery of services. The Independent Expert believes that NGOs and 
other civil society organizations play a critical role in enabling the Government to 
implement its Six Pillar Policy.  
</p>
<p><b> I. National human rights commission 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Independent Expert understands that the process of establishing a national 
human rights commission is ongoing and that consultations on the draft bill are taking 
place. The Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development has given the matter 
priority, and will require technical assistance to ensure that the legislation establishing the 
national human rights commission reflects the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Constitutional review 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert was informed that the constitutional review process was 
under way. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia and UNDP have provided 
technical and financial support to the Ministry of Justice and the Constitution 
Implementation and Review Commission. In view of the importance, urgency and enormity 
of the work needed for the adoption of the Constitution in 2015 and the holding of elections 
in 2016, additional funds and technical assistance are urgently required. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Respect for the principle of non-refoulement 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Independent Expert heard very strong opposition to the forced return or 
repatriation of refugees from Kenya. The Independent Expert was assured by UNHCR that 
any return of refugees, under the 10 November Tripartite Agreement, would be based on 
voluntariness, dignity and safety; conditions which do not appear to exist in south central 
Somalia, from where most of the refugees currently in Kenya originate. 
</p>
<p><b> L. The clan system  
</b></p>
<p>39. The Independent Expert was informed by several interlocutors how deeply the clan 
structure was embedded in Somali society and of the positive roles those structures played 
and continued to play during conflict. For instance, some humanitarian actors noted that, 
with the assistance of the clans, they had been able to deliver humanitarian services and 
assistance to populations in rural areas including areas controlled by Al-Shabaab. Such 
positive aspects of the clan structure should be used for the benefit of the Somali 
population. 
</p>
<p><b> M. A cursory look at Xeer 
</b></p>
<p>40. The National Strategic Plan for Justice Reform states that the sharia and Xeer 
systems are deeply rooted in Somali society. The main justice mechanism for the majority 
of Somalis is Xeer. It is administered by clan elders and covers a variety of issues 
including: payment of blood money to compensate victims in murder, assault and theft 
cases; regulation of the use of natural resources, such as grazing and water rights, and </p>


<p>personal law matters of dowry and widow inheritance. It is stated that in recent times the 
influence of Xeer in some parts of the country has declined owing to previous co-option by 
pre-crisis governments, the advent of fee-charging by elders administering Xeer, and other 
factors, such as its decisions being ignored by powerful clans owing to the lack of an 
enforcement authority.

<p>41. The Independent Expert has reviewed some case studies on the application of Xeer 
in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and Puntland where a three-tier legal system applies. One study states that 
Xeer is respected by the secular courts. It is reported that clan elders in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; have 
been engaged in discussing how Xeer could be responsive to women, children and minority 
rights and to human rights.2 In Puntland, UNDP organized a conference from 7 to 
11 February 2009, at Puntland University, composed of parliamentarians, ministers, 
government officials, representatives of international organizations, elders, traditional 
leaders, intellectuals, cultural leaders, youth, women and professionals and members of 
civil society from across Puntland, to, inter alia, revise, unify and standardize the 
Xeer/customary law system, and to make a declaration on its role in enhancing peace, and 
protect human rights and the environment.3  
</p>
<p>42. The traditional leaders at that conference agreed to subject Xeer to a standardized 
code that protects human rights, especially those of women, children and minorities. They 
also agreed to submit the Xeer aspects of criminal law to judicial control. Parliament was 
tasked with adopting the necessary legislation to implement the declaration. The 
Independent Expert shall be keen to follow up on how the system operates in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; 
and Puntland after these initiatives. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
discusses the role of the customary justice system in her report to the Human Rights 
Council following her mission to Somalia in December 2011 (A/HRC/20/16/Add.3), and 
points to some of its shortcomings, such as the rationale of preserving social harmony 
rather than punishing the individual or upholding the rights of the victim. She observed that 
the use of material compensation owing to the payment of blood money for homicides, 
makes families seek justice through that system rather than pursue formal criminal 
proceedings. She states that Xeer has been found wanting in addressing cases concerning 
the rights of women, sexual offences or domestic violence against women where the rights 
of the victims are subjugated to the rights of the clan. In her recommendations, she called 
on the Government to clarify the relationship and boundaries between customary law and 
institutions, and the civil and criminal justice system. She stated further that the application 
and interpretation of sharia should also be in conformity with international human rights 
and gender equality standards. 
</p>
<p>44. The Independent Expert similarly believes that it should be possible to ensure that 
Xeer complies with international human rights law, by ensuring that all the negative aspects 
of its application are addressed. During his meetings, many interlocutors urged the 
Independent Expert to encourage human rights awareness among the clan elders. The 
Independent Expert views this as a possible entry point into addressing Xeer compliance 
with human rights law.

developing a policy and legal framework for traditional dispute resolution, through

<p>collection, analysis and dissemination of traditional dispute resolution data, and 
establishing a policy on traditional dispute resolution. It also requires designing and 
implementing a system for monitoring outcomes and implementing the traditional dispute 
resolution policy. The estimated cost of this activity is US$600,000.4  
</p><p>46. The Independent Expert believes that that activity is critical to a sustainable judicial 
system. It responds to the urgent needs of access to justice by all. The challenge shall be to 
ensure that the policy and legal framework for traditional dispute resolution meets 
international human rights standards. The Independent Expert holds the view that any 
support towards this initiative should endeavour to ensure that the policy and its 
implementation are in line with international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>47. The Independent Expert also holds the view that since the Xeer system is understood 
by the vast majority of Somali people, it could be part of a judicial system, to underpin the 
peace and reconciliation programme. If this view is acceptable in principle, a thorough 
study and analysis should be undertaken involving the Federal Government, 
parliamentarians, the judiciary, politicians, elders, scholars, professionals, both local and 
from the diaspora, and civil society in general, assisted by reputable institutions 
knowledgeable in Islamic sharia, Somali culture and history. In this regard, countries which 
form part of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation such as Mauritania could have 
experiences to share on how they have applied sharia, statutory law and customary laws. 
Subsequently a reform process of Xeer could be implemented on a medium to long-term 
basis.
