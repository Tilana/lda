<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The group of seven mandate holders (hereinafter &#8220;the group of experts&#8221;) carried out its 
task, mandated by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 4/8 (&#8220;Follow up to 
decision S-4/101 of 13 December 2006 adopted by the Human Rights Council at its fourth 
special session entitled &#8216;Situation of human rights in Darfur&#8217;&#8221;), of ensuring the effective 
follow-up to and fostering of the implementation of resolutions and recommendations on Darfur, 
as adopted by the Human Rights Council (hereinafter &#8220;the Council&#8221;), the Commission on Human 
Rights and other United Nations human rights institutions, as well as the task of promoting the 
implementation of relevant recommendations of the other United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan, safeguarding the consistency of these 
recommendations and contributing to the monitoring of the human rights situation on the ground. 
In the present interim report, the group of experts reviews the efforts of the Government of the 
Sudan to implement the recommendations of the group of experts, bearing in mind that the 
implementation must be carried out in an ongoing and sustained manner and that the group of 
experts is due to present a final report to a forthcoming session of Council as requested in 
Council resolution OM/1/3 adopted on 20 June 2007. 
</p>
<p> As part of its review process, the group of experts held a meeting in Geneva to consider the 
responses of the Government of the Sudan to its recommendations and in particular to identify 
areas of progress achieved, as well as shortcomings that still need to be addressed. These 
recommendations are entitled &#8220;Compilation of recommendations of the experts group to the 
Government of the Sudan for the implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 4/8&#8221;, and 
are contained in the annex to the report of the group of experts on the situation of human rights 
in Darfur (A/HRC/5/6). In this document, the group of experts indicated specifically and in as 
clear and precise a fashion as possible the kinds of action that the Government of the Sudan 
should take to implement each recommendation. Moreover, the group outlined the steps to be 
undertaken to implement the recommendations over the short and medium terms. The 
Government of the Sudan has endeavoured to address these recommendations and to report back 
to the group of experts in terms of the indicators that were set out in its compilation of 
recommendations. The group of experts thanks the Government for meeting with it and for its 
ongoing cooperation in providing information in a spirit of constructive dialogue. 
</p>
<p> The group of experts underlines its role in assessing the measures taken by the Government 
of the Sudan to implement the recommendations they have compiled. It will provide the Council 
with as detailed a description and analysis of the status of implementation as possible in its final 
report to be presented in December 2007. For several reasons, the group of experts has decided 
not to present a detailed evaluation of the current state of affairs in relation to the implementation 
of the specific recommendations in the present interim report. Most importantly it wishes to give 
the Government of the Sudan the maximum possible time to undertake initiatives responding to 
its recommendations and to report back on those measures and any impact they may have had. In 
addition, the group of experts remains keen to obtain as much detailed information as possible 
from all relevant sources so that it has a more clear and detailed sense of the situation on the 
ground. </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/7 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> Nevertheless the group of experts, on the basis of the information so far received, 
concludes that while certain recommendations have been partially implemented, it is not in a 
position to report that a clear impact on the ground has been identified. Regarding other 
recommendations, first steps towards implementation have been taken in some cases, whereas in 
others, recommendations remain to be implemented. The group of experts regrets that certain 
short term recommendations were not addressed by the Government at all or, in other cases, 
information provided was unrelated to them. The group of experts reiterates that the ultimate 
measure of the Government&#8217;s implementation of the recommendations compiled by the group 
has to be concrete improvements in the human rights situation on the ground in Darfur. 
</p>
<p> The group of experts reiterates its earlier invitation to all concerned United Nations bodies 
and agencies, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to provide the 
necessary support and technical assistance to the Government of the Sudan to assist it in 
implementing the recommendations of the group of experts, and it encourages donors to continue 
providing funds in this regard. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Arising out of its deep concern over the ongoing violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in Darfur, the Human Rights Council adopted without a vote at its 
fourth session, on 30 March 2007, resolution 4/8 on the &#8220;Follow-up to decision S-4/101 
of 13 December 2006 adopted by the Human Rights Council at its fourth special session entitled 
&#8216;Situation of human rights in Darfur&#8217;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 4/8, the Council decided to convene a group of seven mandate holders &#8220;to 
work with the Government of the Sudan, the appropriate human rights mechanisms of the 
African Union and to closely consult with the Chairman of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and 
Consultation (DDDC) to ensure the effective follow-up and to foster the implementation of 
resolutions and recommendations on Darfur, as adopted by the Human Rights Council, the 
Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations human rights institutions as well as to 
promote the implementation of relevant recommendations of other United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan in this regard, to safeguard the 
consistency of these recommendations and to contribute to monitoring the human rights situation 
on the ground&#8221; (para. 7). 
</p>
<p>3. The group of experts is presided over by Sima Samar, Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Sudan and is composed of Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict, Philip Alston, Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Hina Jilani, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
Walter K&#228;lin, Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, Manfred Nowak, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and Yakin Ert&#252;rk, Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences. Mr. K&#228;lin serves as rapporteur for the 
group of experts. The group of experts has been serviced mainly by the Africa Unit of the 
Capacity Building Branch, in the Office of the High Commissioner, by the assistants from the 
Special Procedures Branch to the seven Council mandate-holders that comprise the group of 
experts, as well as by a coordinator. 
</p>
<p>4. The group of experts recalls its mandate to ensure the effective follow-up and to foster the 
implementation of relevant resolutions and recommendations on Darfur in a process of 
facilitation and dialogue with the Government of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>5. The group of experts presented its first report to the Council (A/HCR/5/6) 
on 13 June 2007. In this report, the group reiterated its concerns regarding the human rights 
situation in Darfur expressed by the Council in resolution 4/8; identified priority areas for 
implementation; listed a number of specific recommendations to be implemented in the short or 
medium term and identified as particularly relevant for improving the human rights situation in 
Darfur; and urged the Government of the Sudan to implement without delay the </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/7 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>recommendations it committed itself to put into practice, and to continue its dialogue with the 
group of experts on the implementation of its other recommendations. Annexed to the report was 
a compilation of recommendations including relevant time-frames and indicators for assessing 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council, in its resolution OM/1/3 requested &#8220;the group of experts to continue its work 
for six months and to submit an update to the session of the Council in September 2007 and a 
final report to the following session of the Council&#8221;. The present interim report with its two 
annexes is submitted in accordance with this resolution. 
</p>
<p>7. In preparing the present interim report, the group of experts continued to follow the 
methodology used in its earlier work: 
</p>
<p> (a) To establish its cooperation and work, in a transparent manner, with the Government 
of the Sudan and other relevant partners within the international community; 
</p>
<p> (b) To identify obstacles to the implementation of previous recommendations; 
</p>
<p> (c) To differentiate short from medium term recommendations with a view to assisting 
the Government of the Sudan to implement fully the recommendations identified in the annex to 
its first report (A/HRC/5/6) and to keep the victims of past and ongoing violations of human 
rights and humanitarian law in central focus, as well as to reduce such violations in future. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>8. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, on 20 June 2007, encouraged 
the principals of United Nations humanitarian agencies active in Darfur to assist her Office and 
the group of experts in providing relevant information on the implementation of the 
recommendations which would be reflected in this interim report. 
</p>
<p>9. The Government of the Sudan, on 24 July 2007, transmitted to the group of experts a 
document entitled &#8220;Plan of the Advisory Council on Human Rights towards implementation of 
the short term (July-September) recommendations of the experts group&#8221;. This plan of action 
(annex I) lists a series of workshops, training seminars and other activities and identifies the 
financial needs of the Government of the Sudan for their implementation. 
</p>
<p>10.  On 21 August 2007, the Government of the Sudan submitted to the group of experts a 
progress report on the implementation of the short term recommendations (annex II) and 
supplementary information continues to be received. 
</p>
<p>11. The group of experts met in Geneva from 17 to 19 September 2007 to review the status of 
implementation. On 18 September, it met with a high level inter-ministerial delegation and 
representatives from the Permanent Mission of the Sudan to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
to discuss areas of progress, obstacles encountered, and areas that required the Government&#8217;s </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/7 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>urgent attention.<b>2</b> On 19 September, it met to take account of the Government&#8217;s update and to 
reflect further upon measures which the Government should adopt to ensure full implementation 
of the group&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>12. In addition, on behalf of the group of experts, the Office of the High Commissioner has 
actively sought the participation of the relevant human rights mechanisms of the African Union 
and consulted the Chairman of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation (DDDC). The 
group of experts received a letter dated 17 September 2007 from the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR), informing it that Commissioner Bahame Tom Nyanduga, 
Special Rapporteur on Asylum-seekers, Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons and Migrants in 
Africa was appointed focal point to liaise with the group of experts. The group met with 
Commissioner Nyanduga on 19 September 2007 in Geneva, exchanged views and information 
and pledged future cooperation. 
</p>
<p>13. The group of experts expresses its appreciation to the Government of the Sudan for its 
excellent cooperation during the period under review; its endeavours to address the 
recommendations compiled by the group of experts; the timely reporting back to the group; and 
the very open and constructive dialogue with the high level inter-ministerial delegation and 
representatives from the Permanent Mission of the Sudan to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva. 
</p>
<p>14. The group of experts also thanks the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), 
United Nations agencies in New York and Geneva and all others, including non-governmental 
organizations, who provided information on the current status of implementation of 
recommendations according to the time frame and indicators specified by the group of experts 
(A/HRC/5/6, annex I). 
</p>
<p><b>II. STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SHORT-TERM  
RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>15. In line with its previous report to the Council (A/HRC/5/6), the group of experts has been 
working with the Government of the Sudan with a view to promoting improvements in the 
human rights situation in Darfur according to the following four principal areas of concern: 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The inter-ministerial delegation was led by Mr. Abdeldaiem Zumrawi, Deputy Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice, and included Dr. Abdelmonim Osman M. Taha, Rapporteur of the Advisory Council on 
Human Rights, Dr. Hassabo Mohamed Abdelrahman, Commissioner for Humanitarian 
Assistance, Brigadier General Hassan Hamid Mohamed, Ministry of Defence. The delegation 
also included Ambassador Ibrahim Margani Ibrahim Mohamed Kheir, Permanent 
Representative, Ms. Rahma Salih Elobeid, Minister Plenipotentiary, Ms. Igbal Ishag 
Mohamed Elamin (Second Secretary), from the Permanent Mission of the Sudan to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/7 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> (a) Human rights protection, including protection of civilians and internally displaced 
persons, protection of women against violence, children and armed conflict, protection against 
summary executions, arbitrary detention, disappearances and torture, protection of witnesses and 
victims, and protection of human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> (b) Humanitarian access, including protection of humanitarian workers from harassment 
and attacks, facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced; 
</p>
<p> (c) Accountability and justice; 
 (d) Monitoring of implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>16. In order to assess the current status of implementation of its recommendations 
(A/HRC/5/6, annex), the group of experts considered information provided to it by 
the Government of the Sudan either in writing or orally during the meeting held on 
18 September 2007 as well as other information received. Written updates by the Government 
are annexed to this report (annex II). 
</p>
<p>17. The group of experts, in line with its task of presenting an update on ongoing activities, 
notes certain discrepancies between information provided by the Government of the Sudan and 
other sources. The group of experts has to rely on a variety of sources to assess whether there 
have been real improvements as a result of any measures taken. The information received so far 
from the Government and other sources, including UNMIS and other United Nations bodies, the 
appropriate human rights mechanisms of the African Union, the Chairman of the Darfur-Darfur 
Dialogue and Consultation, has not allowed the group of experts to provide the Council with any 
meaningful and objective assessment of the present status of implementation of the 
recommendations compiled by the group of experts and the eventual impact of such 
implementation on the actual human rights situation on the ground. 
</p>
<p>18. The group of experts will provide the Council with as comprehensive as possible a 
description and analysis of the status of implementation in its final report in December 2007. For 
several reasons, the group of experts has decided not to present as yet a detailed evaluation of the 
current state of affairs in relation to the implementation of the specific recommendations. Most 
importantly it wishes to give the Government of the Sudan the maximum possible time to 
undertake initiatives responding to its recommendations and to report back on those measures 
and any impact they may have had. In addition, the group remains keen on obtaining as much 
detailed information as possible from all relevant sources in order to get a clearer and more 
detailed view of the situation on the ground. In this regard, it will make a concerted effort to 
obtain and analyse pertinent information in the very limited time available before it must submit 
its final report. </p>

</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>19.<b> The group of experts, taking into account the challenges faced by the Government of 
the Sudan, welcomes its fresh commitment to work with the Council and the United 
Nations to implement pre-existing recommendations in the field of human rights. It 
appreciates the high degree of cooperation, flexibility and openness of its interlocutors 
during the period under review. 
</b></p>
<p>20.<b> The group of experts welcomes the efforts made by the Government of the Sudan 
towards implementation of its short-term recommendations. It concludes that while certain 
recommendations have been partially implemented, it is not in a position to report that a 
clear impact on the ground has been identified. Regarding other recommendations, first 
steps towards implementation have been taken, whereas still other recommendations 
remain, at least for the present time, without implementation. The group of experts regrets 
that certain short term recommendations were not addressed by the Government at all or, 
in other cases, information provided was unrelated to them. The group of experts reiterates 
that the ultimate measure of the Government&#8217;s implementation of the recommendations 
compiled by the group has to be concrete improvements in the human rights situation on 
the ground in Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p>21.<b> The group of experts is aware of the short period of time that was available to the 
Government within the framework of this mandate for implementing the recommendations 
compiled by the group and its limited financial and human resources. In addition, the 
dynamics of the conflict with an increasing number of armed actors may render the 
implementation of certain recommendations difficult. It reiterates, however, that these 
factors cannot be invoked as obstacles for effectively addressing human rights violations in 
Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p>22.<b> The group of experts reiterates its concern about reports of ongoing serious violations 
of international humanitarian law and human rights by the various parties to the conflict. 
It emphasizes the obligation of all parties to the conflict to abide by their commitments 
under international law and to make all efforts to comply with all human rights 
recommendations that have already been made by various United Nations bodies, as 
well as to work within the framework of the Abuja peace agreement and other 
appropriate forums, to comprehensively address the perilous human rights situation in 
Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> The group of experts emphasizes the essential work being carried out by UNMIS 
human rights monitors and other actors in the field and reiterates that the Government 
must provide human rights monitors with full and unhindered access to all regions of 
Darfur, including all places where persons are deprived of their liberty, as well as to 
investigation records, and that monitors must be allowed to interview victims and persons 
deprived of their liberty in private. </b></p>

</p>
<p>24.<b> The group of experts expresses its hope of receiving information relevant to the 
preparation of its next report from the Government of the Sudan, the appropriate human 
rights mechanisms of the African Union and the Chairman of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue 
and Consultation, UNMIS, other United Nations agencies, programmes and human rights 
mechanisms, as well as other actors involved in human rights and humanitarian work in 
Darfur</b>. 
</p>
<p>25. <b>The group of experts recommends that the Human Rights Council:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Urge the Government of the Sudan to continue and intensify its efforts to 
implement, without delay, the recommendations compiled by the group of experts in 
accordance with the specified time frames and indicators (A/HCR/5/6); 
 (b) Call upon the Government of the Sudan to address impunity and ensure that all 
allegations of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are duly 
investigated and that the perpetrators are promptly brought to justice; 
 (c) Reiterate its call to all parties to the conflict to put an end to all acts of violence 
against civilians, with special focus on women, children, the elderly, persons with 
disabilities, and internally displaced persons, as well as humanitarian workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Invite relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, including the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, to provide the Sudan with support and technical 
assistance, in accordance with assessed needs, for the implementation of these 
recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Call upon donors to provide, on the basis of needs assessment, funds for this 
support and technical assistance. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>1.1 Protection of civilians, including internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p> Draft orders to the armed forces were prepared prohibiting all kinds of attacks on civilians, 
including torture and violence against women, and stipulating that perpetrators of criminal 
offences will have their immunity waived and will be brought to justice. The draft was reviewed 
by the Advisory Council for Human Rights and was submitted for signature to the armed forces 
command. 
</p>
<p> Another draft was prepared by order of the armed forces command on facilitating the work 
of human rights monitors and of the ceasefire monitoring committees of the African Union 
forces. 
</p>
<p> The People&#8217;s Armed Forces Act was approved by the Cabinet. It contains an entire chapter 
on the principles of international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and 
civilian objects. It makes no distinction between protection during international conflicts and 
protection during internal conflicts. It also includes provisions on individual liability and the 
prosecution of persons who commit abuses. 
</p>
<p> The National Committee on International Humanitarian Law, in collaboration with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (Sudan), has set up a foundation course on the 
principles of international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and individual liability. 
The course is designed for the joint integrated units formed pursuant to the Machakos agreement 
and the Interim Constitution and 30 officers are due to receive training at the joint forces&#8217; 
headquarters on 26-29 August 2007.   
</p>
<p><b>1.1.3</b> At 4 p.m. on 1 August, the armed forces repelled an attack by a group known as the 
Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-Unity) against the city of Adilah and against citizens and 
their property. The attack struck terror into the people&#8217;s hearts. The armed forces forced the 
rebels to withdraw after 11 of their men were killed.

<p> An armed forces committee was set up to assess the losses resulting from the mistaken 
bombardment of the Al-Ara&#8217;is area in the Umm Kadadah district of North Darfur. It established 
a figure of 35,154,653 (thirty-five million, one hundred and fifty-four thousand, six hundred and 
fifty-three) dinars to be distributed for those who had been wounded (4 persons), killed 
(5 persons) or had suffered damage to property (46 persons). The third and final instalment was 
disbursed on 12 September 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>1.1.4 Disarmament Commission 
</b></p>
<p> The Disarmament Commission was given 85 tractors with a full range of accessories worth 
4 million. They were distributed to a number of areas for use in reintegration programmes. 
</p>
<p> A census was taken of child soldiers in the Abyi area (150 children). Sixteen children in 
the town of Waw and 24 children in Bantiyu were reunited with their families. 
</p>
<p> A census was taken of child soldiers in the state of the Blue Nile in the area of 
Karmak (227), and the areas of Kassala (270), Qadarif (24) and Sha`iriyah east of 
Jabal Marra (857). 
</p>
<p><b>1.1.5</b> In implementation of the memorandum of understanding signed between the Sudanese 
Ministry of the Interior and the African Union Mission, a security plan was established for the 
displaced persons&#8217; camps whereby internal camp security will be provided by the Sudanese 
police, while the African Union Mission will secure and protect the areas outside the camps. The 
following forces are in place: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; North Darfur: 142 officers and 6,353 men of other ranks, securing 20 displaced persons&#8217;

<p>&#8722; West Darfur: 114 officers and 5,413 members of other ranks, securing 28 displaced 
persons&#8217; camps. 
</p>
<p> The security situation in all the camps is calm. In 2007, there were no security incidents in 
the camps. 
</p>
<p>1.2 Protection of women against violence 
</p>
<p> An important draft declaration (attached) was prepared affirming the State&#8217;s determination 
to implement the plan on combating violence against women in cooperation with the 
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA), and referring to the Security Council resolutions. The draft will be published in the 
media on 18 August. 
</p>
<p> Short-term plans were drawn up for the committees concerned with combating violence in 
the three states and funding was provided for the plans. 
</p>
<p> On 14 June 2007, a workshop on combating violence against women was held at police 
headquarters, in cooperation with the United Nations Gender Unit, to reaffirm the commitment 
to implementing the action plan on combating violence against women in Darfur in accordance 
with the terms of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, security and children. 
</p>
<p> On 17 July 2007, a seminar was held, in collaboration with the Human Rights Section of 
UNMIS and the General Union of Sudanese Women, on the Protocol to the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. An analytical paper was 
presented comparing the contents of the Protocol with the Constitution and domestic laws of the 
Sudan. The main objective was to involve civil society organizations in taking the decision on 
signing and acceding to the Protocol. A recommendation was made in that regard. 
</p>
<p> The Advisory Council for Human Rights is holding a training workshop on human rights 
and law enforcement (human rights standards in domestic laws; the responsibilities of the police 
for protecting and promoting human rights; and human rights principles and policing issues), in 
conjunction with the UNMIS Human Rights Bureau and the Gender Violence Unit. The event is 
due to be held on 29-30 August 2007, at police headquarters, for 40 women who work in 
policing. 
</p>
<p> The draft armed forces circular refers to the criminalization of acts of violence against 
women, including rape, and to the prosecution of the perpetrators of such acts. 
</p>
<p> A draft of the terms of reference of the team assessing the work of the gender violence 
committees in Darfur was prepared (attached). 
</p>
<p> Joint patrols are still being organized with the African Union at displaced persons&#8217; camps, 
in order to protect women who go out to fetch firewood. </p>

<p> We attach herewith some court rulings issued in 2005 that were not brought to the attention 
of the Special Rapporteur and the Human Rights Council, together with some rulings delivered 
in 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>1.3 Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p> We should like to provide the following examples of legal protection of children: 
</p>
<p> On 3 May 2007, a Niyala court sentenced defendants Abd al-Rahman Zakariya and 
Ahmad Abdullah Sulayman to death for murder and robbery. The appeal court overturned the 
death sentences, on 10 June 2007, because the two defendants had been under 18 when they 
committed the crime. It ordered that they be placed in a reformatory. 
</p>
<p> At a regular session held on 20 March 2006, the Azhari Criminal Court, which was hearing 
the Suba case involving an attack upon a police station and the killing of 16 policemen, 
referred 3 of the defendants, who were minors, to a juvenile court. 
 The Dukkah General Criminal Court in Qadarif, in eastern Sudan, sentenced a woman 
called Fatimah Adam Yahya to death under article 130 (premeditated murder). Since there were 
legal documents proving that the woman was a minor, the Advisory Council wrote to the 
Department of Legal Assistance to request leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court for an 
annulment of the sentence. 
</p>
<p> The Al-Damazin General Criminal Court convicted a man called Najm al-Din 
Qasim al-Sayyid and sentenced him to death under article 130 (premeditated murder). Counsel 
for Mr. Al-Sayyid appealed the verdict on the grounds that his client had been under 18 when he 
committed the crime. The appeal court ordered that a medical examination be conducted to 
determine the age of the convicted man when the offence was committed. Based on the results of 
the examination, it upheld the guilty verdict and the sentence, as did a higher court. Counsel for 
the convicted man appealed to the Constitutional Court, which is still hearing the case. Three of 
the five judges have delivered their opinion in writing. 
 A workshop on juvenile justice was held on 26-27 June 2007, in cooperation with the

the arrest of political opposition member Ali Mahmud Hassanayn and a group of individuals 
either currently serving in, or retired from, the armed forces and whose names had been 
mentioned by the witnesses that had been questioned. The Minister of Justice gave statements to 
the press on this subject on 12 August 2007. The main points are set out hereunder: </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/7

</p>
<p>&#8722; The Department of Public Prosecutions received 33 suspects and after making 
preliminary inquiries charged 8 of them, in criminal indictment sheet No. 138/2007, 
under articles 21 (acting as an accessory), 24 (criminal conspiracy), 25 (incitement), 
26 (aiding and abetting), 50 (attempting to overthrow the constitutional system), 51

</p>
<p>&#8722; The Minister confirmed that the accused were receiving excellent treatment; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; On 14 August 2007, the family of Mr. Mubarak al-Fadil was given permission to 
visit him at Kawbar Prison. In the days that followed, family visits were arranged 
for Mr. Ali Mahmud Hassanayn and Mr. Abd al-Jalil al-Basha; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Documents supporting the charges against the accused were discovered, including a 
statement written by one of the accused that was supposed to be broadcast after the 
attempted coup had succeeded. Some weapons, hand grenades and SIM cards for 
mobile telephones were also found. 
</p>
<p> A number of persons were arrested in connection with the disturbances and riots that took 
place when work began on the construction of the Kabajar dam. The arrests were made pursuant 
to the National Security Act of 1999. The accused persons received visits from their families and 
the Bar Association. 
</p>
<p><b>Humanitarian assistance and protection of displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p> In March 2007, the State announced the implementation of a fast track policy in a joint 
communiqu&#233; with the United Nations which was signed by the Minister of State at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p> A mechanism was created in March 2007 to monitor inflows of humanitarian aid in 
accordance with the above-mentioned joint communiqu&#233; signed between the Government of 
the Sudan and the United Nations. Two visits were paid to the states of Darfur, the first on 
21-23 April 2007 and the second on 29-30 July 2007. Six meetings were held with foreign 
voluntary organizations. As a result, all obstacles on the ground were removed. 
</p>
<p> An annual volunteers&#8217; day was inaugurated on 11 June 2007 and the President of the 
Republic gave an address expressing the Sudan&#8217;s appreciation for the role played by donors and 
voluntary organizations in improving the humanitarian situation in Darfur. 
</p>
<p> On the occasion of national volunteers&#8217; day, the President of the Republic (by Presidential 
Decree No. 168 of 2007) awarded the medal of achievement to a number of national and foreign </p>

<p>voluntary organizations (the United Nations Mine Action Office in the Sudan, the Murdi Relief 
Development organization, M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, the Sudanese Red Crescent Society and 
the Roots Organization for Development). 
</p>
<p> With regard to the preparation of areas for voluntary return, the Government is 
rehabilitating villages by building educational, health and security establishments, following the 
model used in the villages of Kalmandu and Durayj. 
 The Government&#8217;s efforts in regard to the voluntary return of displaced persons have seen 
272,696 persons return to their villages, 150,788 of them in South Darfur (44 villages), 75,062 in 
North Darfur (31 villages) and 46,846 in West Darfur (127 villages).
