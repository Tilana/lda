NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.       Business and Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC
(Unaudited)
On August 25, 2015 Solitario Exploration & Royalty Corp. (“Solitario” or the “Company”), along 
with DHI Minerals (U.S.) Ltd. (“DHI”), sold their combined interests in the Mt. Hamilton gold project (“Mt. 
Hamilton”) to Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC (“Waterton”), for total cash proceeds of US$30 million (the 
“Transaction”) pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on June 10, 2015.  Solitario sold its 80% 
interest in Mt. Hamilton LLC (“MH-LLC”), a limited liability company which held 100% of the Mt. 
Hamilton project assets, and DHI sold its 20% interest in MH-LLC. DHI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Ely Gold and Minerals, Inc. (“Ely”).  Solitario received gross cash proceeds of US$24 million and Ely 
received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million.  Solitario’s costs and fees related to the Transaction, 
including broker fees and professional service fees, were $439,000.  The Transaction was structured as the 
sale of Solitario’s and DHI’s combined membership interests in MH-LLC.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 virtually all of the costs associated with MH-
LLC and the assets sold were directly related to the development of the Mt. Hamilton project, which were 
capitalized to mineral property.   Accordingly, separate presentation of discontinued operations would not 
have resulted in any material change to the results presented in the unaudited consolidated statements of 
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
See Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the annual financial
statements included in Solitario’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed 
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for a more complete discussion of 
the sale of Solitario’s interest in MH-LLC. 
 
Business and company formation
Solitario is an exploration stage company at June 30, 2016 under Industry Guide 7, as issued by the
SEC.  Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation ("Crown").  In July 1994, Solitario became a publicly traded 
company on the Toronto Stock Exchange through its initial public offering.  Solitario has been actively 
involved in mineral exploration since 1993.  Solitario’s primary business is to acquire and hold a portfolio of 
exploration properties and other related assets for future sale or joint venture or to create a royalty prior to 
the establishment of proven and probable reserves.  As a result of the completion of the Transaction, 
Solitario has shifted its primary focus from the development of the Mt. Hamilton project to the furtherance 
of its other assets and to Solitario’s historical focus on the acquisition of additional precious and base metal 
properties and assets with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests.
Solitario has recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property 
payments and the sale of a royalty on its Mt. Hamilton property.  Revenues from the sale or joint venture of 
properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a consistent source of revenue 
and would only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis.
The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Solitario for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  They do not include all disclosures 
required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements, but in the opinion of 
management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for a fair 
presentation.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results, which may be achieved in the future 
or for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes 
thereto which are included in Solitario’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.  The accounting policies set forth in those annual financial statements are the same as the accounting 
policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements, except as modified for appropriate interim 
financial statement presentation.
Financial reporting
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Solitario and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America ("generally accepted accounting principles"), and are expressed in 
US dollars. 
 
Revenue recognition
Solitario records delay rental payments as revenue in the period received.  Any payments received
for the sale of property interests are recorded as a reduction of the related property's capitalized cost.  
Proceeds which exceed the capitalized cost of the property without reserves are recognized as revenue.  
Payments received on the sale of properties with reserves are recognized as revenue to the extent the 
proceeds exceed the proportionate basis in the assets sold.   
 
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.  Some of the more significant estimates included in the preparation of Solitario's financial 
statements pertain to: (i) the fair value of Solitario’s short-term investments; (ii) the fair value of Solitario's 
stock option grants to employees; (iii) the fair value of Solitario's investment in marketable equity securities; 
and (iv) the fair value of Solitario’s liability for warrants Solitario issued to RMB Australia Holdings 
Limited in 2012 (the “RMB Warrants”).     
 
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid money-market securities with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Solitario has concentrations of cash at June 30, 2016 
deposited in banks and brokerage accounts of $234,000 which are not covered under the federal deposit 
insurance rules for the United States.  At June 30, 2016 Solitario holds short-term investments in United 
States Treasury securities of $7,506,000. 
  
Mineral properties
Solitario expenses all exploration costs incurred on its mineral properties prior to the establishment
of proven and probable reserves through the completion of a feasibility study.  Initial acquisition costs of 
Solitario’s mineral properties are capitalized. Solitario began capitalizing all of its development expenditures 
on Mt. Hamilton, subsequent to the completion of a feasibility study in 2012 through the date of the 
Transaction.  Solitario regularly performs evaluations of its investment in mineral properties to assess the 
recoverability and/or the residual value of its investments in these assets.  All long-lived assets are reviewed 
for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset 
may not be recoverable, utilizing established guidelines based upon undiscounted future net cash flows from 
the asset or upon the determination that certain exploration properties do not have sufficient potential for 
economic mineralization.   
 
Derivative instruments
Solitario accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  Solitario has not designated its covered calls as hedging 
instruments and any changes in the fair value of covered calls and the RMB Warrants are recognized in the 
statement of operations in the period of the change.   
 
Fair value
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”) establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 
820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  For certain of Solitario's 
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable, the carrying amounts 
approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Solitario's short-term investments and marketable 
equity securities are carried at their estimated fair value based on quoted market prices.  See Note 7, “Fair 
Value” below.     
 
Marketable equity securities
Solitario's investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the securities owned.  Solitario records 
investments in marketable equity securities as available-for-sale for investments in publicly traded 
marketable equity securities for which it does not exercise significant control and where Solitario has no 
representation on the Board of Directors of those companies and exercises no control over the management 
of those companies.  The cost of marketable equity securities sold is determined by the specific identification 
method.  Changes in fair values are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within 
shareholders' equity, unless a decline in fair value is considered other than temporary, in which case the 
decline is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations.   
 
Foreign exchange
The United States dollar is the functional currency for all of Solitario's foreign subsidiaries.
Although Solitario's exploration activities outside of the United States for the three and six months ended 
June 30, 2016 have been conducted primarily in Peru and Mexico, a portion of the payments under the land, 
leasehold and exploration agreements of Solitario are denominated in United States dollars. Foreign currency 
gains and losses are included in the results of operations in the period in which they occur.  
 
Income taxes
Solitario accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” 
(“ASC 740”).  Under ASC 740, income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the 
financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to certain income and 
expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes.  Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be 
taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred taxes are also 
recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income and income 
taxes, respectively.  A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of 
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial 
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 
740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim 
periods, disclosure, and transition. ASC 740 provides that a company's tax position will be considered settled 
if the taxing authority has completed its examination, the company does not plan to appeal, and it is remote 
that the taxing authority would reexamine the tax position in the future. These provisions of ASC 740 had no
effect on Solitario's financial position or results of operations. See Note 8, “Income Taxes” below. 
 
Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 
2015.  Potentially dilutive shares related to outstanding common stock options of 390,000 and 3,748,000, 
respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the RMB Warrants 
(exercisable to acquire 1,624,748 shares of common stock) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 
and 2015 were excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share because the effects were 
anti-dilutive. 
 
Employee stock compensation and incentive plans
Solitario classifies all of its stock options as equity options in accordance with the provisions of
ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation.”   
 
Recent accounting pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting
Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-19, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (“ASU 2016-19”), 
as part of its simplification initiative, which affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their 
employees.  The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and 
deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting 
policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold for income taxes and still qualify for 
equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-19 
is effective for fiscal year ending March 2018 using either the prospective, retrospective or modified 
retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered by ASU 2016-19.
In December 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes (“ASU 2015-17”). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred 
income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified 
statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within the 
year, beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a 
prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 did not have a 
material impact on the financial statements of Solitario as of June 30, 2016 or for the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2016.

Discontinued projects
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario closed its exploration office in
Mexico.  Solitario sold its Norcan and Aconchi exploration projects in Mexico for a retained a 1% royalty 
on both the Norcan and Aconchi properties.  Solitario recorded a mineral property write-down of $10,000 
related to the Norcan and Aconchi properties during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.  In 
addition Solitario recorded a loss on other assets in Mexico of $14,000 related to the exit from its 
exploration activities in Mexico during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
Solitario did not record any mineral property write-downs during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015.    
 
Capitalization of Mt. Hamilton cost during 2015
On February 22, 2012, Solitario earned an 80% interest in MH-LLC as a result of the completion of 
a feasibility study on the Mt. Hamilton project (the “Feasibility Study”) prepared by SRK Consulting (US), 
Inc. of Lakewood, Colorado (“SRK”).  In October 2014, SRK, on behalf of Solitario completed an updated 
feasibility study on Mt. Hamilton.  Solitario sold its interest in the Mt. Hamilton project on August 25, 2015 
through the Transaction.  Capitalization of costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, prior to 
the Transaction, is detailed in the following table

Solitario's investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are 
carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the securities owned.  The cost of marketable 
equity securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.  Changes in market value are 
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within shareholders' equity, unless a decline 
in market value is considered other than temporary, in which case the decline is recognized as a loss in the 
consolidated statement of operations.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 Solitario purchased 7,240,000 units of
Vendetta Mining Corp. for $289,000.  Each unit included one common share and one purchase warrant 
which allows the holder to purchase one share of Vendetta Mining Corp. common stock at a price of 
Cdn$0.10 per share for a period of two years (the “Vendetta Warrants”).  As of June 30, 2016, the 
Vendetta Mining Corp shares are carried at their fair value and included in marketable equity securities, 
see Note 3, above.  The Vendetta Warrants are carried at their fair value, based upon a Black-Scholes 
valuation model.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario recorded a gain on 
derivative instruments of $215,000 related to the Vendetta Warrants. 
 
5.       Short-term Debt
RMB Facility Agreement
On August 10, 2012, Solitario entered into a Facility Agreement and borrowed $5,000,000 from
RMB Australia Holdings, Limited (the “RMB Loan”).  In connection with the Facility Agreement, 
Solitario recorded a warrant discount related to the RMB Warrants issued in connection with the RMB 
Loan.  Solitario also recorded deferred offering costs related to the RMB Loan.  The warrant discount and 
deferred offering costs were amortized on a straight-line basis to interest cost over 36 months, the term of 
the Facility Agreement.  The RMB Loan amounts bore interest at the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 5%, payable 
in arrears on the last day of each quarterly interest period.  The RMB Loan was repaid on August 25, 
2015, in connection with the Transaction.  Solitario had no balance due on the RMB Loan as of December 
31, 2015 or June 30, 2016. 
 
Solitario recorded the following interest cost during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 related

6.        Derivative Instruments 
 
RMB Warrants
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, Solitario capitalized all of its interest to
The RMB Warrants entitle the holder to purchase a total of 1,624,748 shares of Solitario common 
stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of the RMB Warrants. As amended, the RMB Warrants expire 
on August 21, 2016, and have an exercise price of $1.5387 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution 
adjustments.  Solitario recorded a warrant discount at the time it entered into the Facility Agreement, 
which it amortized on a straight-line basis.  See Note 5, short-term debt, above.
Solitario has recorded a zero liability for the fair value of the RMB Warrants as of June 30, 2016
as Solitario does not expect the exercise of the RMB Warrants, prior to their expiration on August 25, 
2016.  Solitario recorded a $4,000 liability for the RMB Warrants as of December 31, 2015 for the fair 
value of the RMB Warrants based upon a Black-Scholes model.  Solitario adjusts the fair value of the 
warrants at each balance sheet date, with changes in value recorded in other income (loss) in the statement 
of operations.   
 
Covered Call Options
From time to time Solitario has sold covered call options against its holdings of Kinross Gold 
Corporation (“Kinross”). The business purpose of selling covered calls is to provide additional liquidity 
on a limited portion of shares of Kinross that Solitario may sell in the near term, which is generally 
defined as less than one year.  Solitario has not designated its covered calls as hedging instruments and 
records gains or loss on the covered call in the period of the change.  As of June 30, 2016, Solitario had 
written two covered calls, one covering 50,000 shares, expiring January 20, 2017, with an exercise price
of $4.00 per share and another covering 50,000 shares, expiring January 20, 2017 with an exercise price 
of $4.50 per share.  Solitario has recorded a liability of $128,000 for the fair value of its Kinross covered 
call as of June 30, 2016, based on quoted market prices.
Solitario recorded the following gain loss on derivative instruments:

7.        Fair Value
For certain of Solitario’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short term maturities.  
Solitario’s marketable equity securities are carried at their estimated fair value primarily based on quoted 
market prices.  The Vendetta Warrants are carried at their estimated fair value at June 30, 2016 of 
$321,000; based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model, see Note 4, “Other Assets,” above.  The RMB 
Warrants are carried at their estimated fair value based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model, see Note 
6, “Derivative Instruments,” above.
Solitario accounts for its financial instruments under ASC 820.  ASC 820 establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements.  
ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC 820 also 
requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy 
for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows:
•  Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
•  Level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability; or
•  Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the
reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the 
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. During the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2016 there were no reclassifications in financial assets or liabilities between Level 1, 2 or 3 
categories.

Solitario accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740.  Under ASC 740, income taxes
are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes 
currently due plus deferred taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for 
financial and income tax reporting purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax 
return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and 
liabilities are recovered or settled.  Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses and tax credits 
that are available to offset future taxable income and income taxes, respectively.  A valuation allowance is 
provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
-
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Solitario has recorded no net deferred tax assets. A
valuation allowance, which fully offsets the net deferred tax assets, has been recorded because it is  more 
likely than not that the Company will not realize some portion or all of its deferred tax assets.  The 
Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely 
than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario recorded deferred tax benefits of 
$175,000 and $237,000, respectively, in the statement of operations and recorded a deferred tax expense 
of  the same amounts to other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains on marketable equity 
securities.   
 
9.
Employee Stock Compensation Plans
Solitario’s outstanding options on the date of grant have a five year term, and vest 25% on date of
grant and 25% on each of the next three anniversary dates.  Solitario recognizes stock option 
compensation expense on the date of grant for 25% of the grant date fair value, and subsequently, based 
upon a straight line amortization of the unvested grant date fair value of each of its outstanding options.  
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario recorded $29,000 and $31,000, 
respectively, of stock option expense for the amortization of grant date fair value with a credit to 
additional paid-in-capital.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, Solitario recorded 
$157,000 and $313,000, respectively, of stock option expense for the amortization of grant date fair value 
with a credit to additional paid-in-capital. 
 
The 2006 Plan
On June 27, 2006 Solitario’s shareholders approved the 2006 Stock Option Incentive Plan (the
“2006 Plan”).  Under the terms of the 2006 Plan, prior to June 26, 2016, an aggregate of 2,800,000 shares 
were reserved under the 2006 Plan for the award of options to directors, officers and employees with 
exercise prices equal to the market price of Solitario’s common stock at the date of grant.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario granted options to acquire
350,000 shares of common stock under the 2006 Plan. The options have a five-year term, with an exercise 
price Cdn$0.72 per share, the closing price of a share of Solitario common stock as quoted on the Toronto 
Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) on the date of grant.  The options vested 25% on the date of grant and 
thereafter vest 25% on each of the next three anniversary dates of the date of grant, and had a grant date 
fair value based upon a Black-Scholes model with a 63% expected volatility, and 1% risk-free interest 
rate.  No options were granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  No options were
exercised during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015 under the 2006 Plan.
On June 26, 2016, in accordance with the terms of the 2006 Plan, the ability to grant any
additional options under the 2006 Plan terminated and no additional options will be granted under the 
2006 Plan. 
 
The 2013 Plan
On June 18, 2013 Solitario’s shareholders approved the 2013 Solitario Exploration & Royalty
Corp. Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”).  Under the terms of the 2013 Plan, the Board 
of Directors may grant awards for up to 1,750,000 shares to directors, officers, employees and consultants.  
Such awards may take the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and restricted 
stock units.  The terms and conditions of the awards are pursuant to the 2013 Plan and are granted by the 
Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors.
There were no stock grants or awards or exercises of options or awards under the 2013 Plan
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.   
 
10.        Shareholders’ Equity and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
On October 28, 2015, Solitario’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase
program that authorizes Solitario to purchase up to two million shares of its outstanding 
common stock through December 31, 2016.  During the three and six months ended June 
30, 2016, Solitario purchased 232,000 and 406,000 shares of Solitario common stock, 
respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $118,000 and $201,000, respectively.  As 
of June 30, 2016, Solitario has purchased a total of 551,000 shares for an aggregate 
purchase price of $268,000 under the share repurchase program since its inception.
