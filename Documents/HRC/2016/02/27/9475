<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
decision 2/102.  Section II of this report contains a summary of human rights treaty body 
activities aiming to promote gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights.  The information is 
extracted from the concluding observations on States parties&#8217; reports over the last two years, 
along with general comments issued in that time period, and other activities to which the 
committees contributed.  Section III traces how various special procedures have addressed 
gender and women&#8217;s rights issues in their respective mandates.  Section IV provides information 
on the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on gender and 
women&#8217;s human rights.  The last section of this report, section V, contains brief conclusions and 
recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION OF EQUALITY AND WOMEN&#8217;S 
  RIGHTS PROVISIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Committee has included one or more recommendations pertaining to 
gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights in almost all of its concluding observations adopted 
during its eighty-second (2004) to eighty-eighth sessions (2006). 
</p>
<p>3. Under article 6 of the Covenant, the Committee expressed concern that overly restrictive 
abortion laws can lead women to seek illegal and unsafe abortions, thus endangering their lives 
and health.  The Committee has noted cases where even when the law permits abortions, they are 
unavailable in practice.<b>1</b>  It has also dealt with issues relating to contraception, family planning 
services and sexual education in school curricula<b>2</b> and commented more generally on high infant 
and maternal mortality rates. 
</p>
<p>4. Regretting the prevalence of domestic violence in a number of States parties, the 
Committee has adopted several recommendations under articles 3 and 7 of the Covenant.  These 
pertain, inter alia, to the adoption and implementation of policies and laws to prevent and combat 
domestic violence; inclusion of specific provisions on domestic violence, including marital rape, 
in penal legislation; programmes to assist victims and raise public awareness; proper training of 
law enforcement officers; availability of restraining orders as required; and criminal prosecution

<p>of perpetrators of such violence.<b>3</b>  It has suggested that States parties establish crisis-centre 
hotlines and victim support centres equipped with medical, psychological and legal facilities, 
including shelters for battered spouses and children.<b>4</b>  They should address obstacles such as 
economic dependence on partners that prevent women from reporting such violence.  As regards 
&#8220;honour killings&#8221;, the Committee has recommended that States parties abolish legislation 
providing for lower sentences.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>5. Under articles 3 and 8, the Committee has addressed the issue of trafficking of women 
and recommended that States parties reinforce international cooperation and practical measures 
to combat trafficking and trafficking-related corruption, and prosecute and punish perpetrators.  
Protection should be provided to all victims and witnesses so that they may have a place of 
refuge and an opportunity to give evidence against those held responsible.  Rehabilitation 
programmes for victims should be established and residence permits granted where appropriate 
on the basis of humanitarian considerations.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>6. In relation to article 10, the Committee has expressed concern that the number of women 
in the prison population was significant,<b>7</b> and recommended that States parties end the practice of 
employing male staff to work directly with women in women&#8217;s institutions.<b>8</b>  Women and men 
inmates should be separated.<b>9</b>  The Committee also recommended that a State party prohibit the 
shackling of detained women during childbirth.<b>10</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. Under articles 3 and 26, the Committee has recommended that States parties ensure equal 
treatment of men and women in the area of employment.<b>11</b>  It has suggested that women&#8217;s 
participation in political and economic life be enhanced through effectively applied positive 
measures.<b>12</b>  In some cases, it has recommended that States parties appoint more women to the 
judiciary, and that special measures be adopted to increase their representation in all legislative 
and executive bodies.<b>13</b>  Women&#8217;s access to education has also been considered under articles 3 
and 26.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The Committee notes that women continue to face discrimination under customary law 
and traditional codes.<b>15</b>  Stereotypical attitudes which are detrimental to women&#8217;s human rights 
need to be changed.<b>16</b>  The Committee remained concerned at the persistence of female genital 
mutilation in some countries.<b>17</b>  In relation to articles 3, 23 and 26, it urged States parties to 
eliminate inequalities between spouses with regard to marriage, divorce, inheritance, exercise of 
parental authority, choice of residence and devolution of property.<b>18</b>  It has adopted views 
relating to the practice of polygamy and urged States to combat the practice of forced marriages

<p>of kidnapped women.<b>19</b>  It has also recommended that a State party end discrimination against 
women in the transmission of their nationality to their children when the father is a foreigner.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights achieved a major advance in its 
work during its thirty-fourth session (2005) when it adopted general comment No. 16 on article 3 
of the Covenant on the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social 
and cultural rights.  The general comment notes the distinct forms of discrimination experienced 
by women due to the intersection of sex with many other factors, which result in &#8220;compounded 
disadvantage(s)&#8221; or double discrimination.<b>21</b>  Two features of the general comment are 
particularly noteworthy.  First, the Committee explicitly sets forth the equal right of men and 
women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights as &#8220;a mandatory and immediate 
obligation of States parties&#8221; that is non-derogable.<b>22</b>  Secondly, it specifies that articles 2 and 3 of 
the Covenant, which deal with non-discrimination and gender equality, &#8220;are not stand-alone 
provisions, but should be read in conjunction with each specific right guaranteed under part III of 
the Covenant&#8221;.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>10. Accordingly, during its thirty-fourth to thirty-seventh sessions (2005), the Committee has 
systematically raised questions and concerns about the enjoyment by women of their economic, 
social and cultural rights in its dialogue with States parties on implementation of the Covenant.  
It routinely asks States parties about the existence and scope of any anti-discrimination or gender 
equality legislation, for gender disaggregated data relating to all articles of the Covenant, and 
gender-specific measures being taken to overcome any disparities that are found. 
</p>
<p>11. Under article 9, the Committee has inquired about the kinds of social protection afforded 
by States parties to female heads of household and victims of trafficking.  Under article 10, it has 
explored issues relating to trafficking of women and children for purposes of sexual and 
commercial exploitation, and domestic violence.  Under articles 9 and 10, the Committee also 
consistently inquired about the assistance provided by States parties to families, mothers and 
fathers alike, to enable them to better share the responsibilities of raising a family.  Under 
article 12, the Committee has examined the level of legal protection and practical enjoyment of 
reproductive health rights.

<p>12. The Committee has consistently welcomed the establishment of national human rights 
institutions that monitor the rights of women, and recognized the ratification of the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol as 
positive measures to protect and promote women&#8217;s rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. International Convention on the Elimination  
  of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has referred to double 
discrimination affecting women and gender-related racial discrimination issues in more than half 
of the concluding observations it adopted on States parties&#8217; reports during its sixty-eighth 
and sixty-ninth sessions (2006).  The Committee expressed concern over the lack of assessment 
of discrimination against women belonging to ethnic minorities.<b>24</b>  It regretted the lack of 
statistical information, disaggregated also by gender, on the economic situation of indigenous 
peoples and their communities and their enjoyment of the rights protected under article 5 of the 
Convention.<b>25</b>  In particular, the Committee noted the lack of adequate statistical data on 
indigenous women&#8217;s participation in public life.  When information was provided, it noted the 
low number of minority and indigenous women occupying positions of responsibility within the 
State party&#8217;s administrative, political or private sector.<b>26</b>  The Committee also noted high 
illiteracy rates among women and low primary school attendance of girls among the indigenous 
population of some States parties.<b>27</b>  Furthermore, it raised the issue of the nationality law of a 
State party which did not grant citizenship to children of women nationals married to 
non-nationals, as it does in the case of a father married to a foreigner.  The Committee warned 
that this may lead to a situation of statelessness and urged the State party to review its legislation 
on the acquisition of nationality in order to ensure that both parents can transmit their citizenship 
to their children.<b>28</b>  The Committee also addressed various forms of violence against women 
including trafficking of women and girls belonging to particular national or ethnic groups or 
non-citizens for the purpose of sexual exploitation;<b>29</b> the particular vulnerability of foreign and 
indigenous women to domestic violence and the lack of appropriate strategies to eradicate such 
violence; cases of forced sterilization of indigenous women without their knowledge or full and

<p>informed consent;<b>30</b> and violence against migrant women who suffer such abuses as long 
working days, lack of health insurance, physical and verbal ill-treatment, sexual harassment and 
threats, when they are undocumented, that they will be turned over to migration authorities.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
  or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Committee against Torture has paid increasing attention to the human rights of 
women in its consideration of States parties&#8217; reports.  At its thirty-seventh session (2006), the 
Committee found that rape constituted torture and that by deporting the complainants, who were 
both women, back to their country of origin where they had been raped by State agents, the 
State party would be in violation of article 3 of the Convention.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>15. The Committee has expressed concern regarding allegations of increased violent killings 
of women and has stressed that failure to investigate these cases exacerbates the suffering of 
relatives seeking justice.  It is also concerned about allegations of the widespread practice of 
torture, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and secret detentions, as well as frequent rape 
of women by military personnel and armed groups, and the apparent impunity enjoyed by the 
perpetrators of such acts (arts. 2, 12 and 14).  It has recommended that States parties promptly 
and impartially investigate and try all perpetrators of such acts.  When found guilty, sentences 
should be commensurate with the gravity of the offences.  Victims should be compensated, if 
necessary through a compensation fund for the victims of torture. 
</p>
<p>16. Under articles 6, 11 and 16, the Committee has expressed concern about inadequate 
protection and widespread ill-treatment of women in places of detention in some States parties.  
Under articles 2 and 7, the Committee has expressed concern at reports that detained women 
have been subjected to the excessive and unlawful use of force, including psychological and 
sexual torture, by criminal justice officials and the police.  In many instances, States parties have 
failed to provide information regarding violence against women in detention, lack procedures for 
lodging complaints and an effective witness protection programme, and have not undertaken 
prompt and impartial investigations of allegations as required by article 12.  Where complaints 
procedures do exist, there is generally an extremely low rate of convictions and numerous reports 
have been received detailing intimidation and threats against victims of sexual violence.  The 
Committee has recommended that States parties ensure the protection of women in places of 
detention in conformity with international standards.

(CAT/C/37/D/279/2005), adopted on 17 November 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. The Committee is concerned at the reported widespread prevalence of domestic violence 
and other forms of gender-based violence in many States parties.  It has made numerous 
recommendations to States parties to prevent and punish violence against women. 
</p>
<p>18. The Committee has addressed the issue of trafficking in women and children and 
allegations of official involvement for purposes of sexual and other exploitation.  It regrets 
instances when little or no information is made available to it on assistance for victims, specific 
measures to combat trafficking, including criminal legislation, and training for law enforcement 
personnel and other relevant groups are required by articles 2, 10 and 16, and sentences handed 
down to State agents under national criminal codes.  It has recommended that States parties take 
appropriate measures to combat trafficking and provide protection and redress to all victims. 
</p>
<p>19. The Committee has expressed concern about the absence of measures to protect migrant 
workers at risk, particularly female domestic workers who allege that they have been subjected 
to sexual violence and are confined and/or prevented from lodging complaints.  The Committee 
has also expressed concerns about allegations of torture and ill-treatment of members of 
vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples and sexual minorities, and recommended that 
States parties ensure that such allegations are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.  The 
Committee notes the limited guarantees available to women asylum-seekers to be interrogated by 
female officers and has recommended that States parties ensure that women asylum-seekers are 
interviewed by women officers in all instances.  With respect to reparations, the Committee has 
requested States parties to pay attention to gender discrimination and the most vulnerable groups 
of women. 
</p>
<p>20. The Committee recommends that gender issues be included in training courses for all 
persons who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of detained individuals.  
It regularly requests States to provide statistical information, disaggregated by, inter alia, gender, 
in relation to complaints of torture and ill-treatment allegedly committed by law enforcement 
officials and related investigations, prosecution and penal and disciplinary measures.  It has 
recommended that States parties establish effective and independent oversight mechanisms to 
ensure prompt, impartial and effective investigations into all reported allegations, and the legal 
prosecution or punishment of those found guilty. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has highlighted concerns relating to the girl 
child in its concluding observations on States parties reports.  Issues of concern relating to the 
rights of the girl child include improving the health needs of girls; the situation of girls in armed 
conflict; combating trafficking and eliminating child labour - including prostitution and sexual 
exploitation; and harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation, early marriages 
and early pregnancy, among others.  In addition, the Committee has prioritized concerns relating 
to the education of the girl child, urging States parties to amend or withdraw discriminatory laws 
and renounce practices which prevent pregnant girls from continuing with their education.  The 
Committee regularly notes that the situation of the girl child is of particular concern in rural and 
remote areas where girls live under the influence of community and religious leaders and face 
persistent harmful traditions and practices, and suggests that customary, religious and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>community leaders should work to overcome the negative influences of harmful traditions and 
customs on girls.<b>33</b>  It has also focused on the gaps in the protection accorded to boys, expressing 
concern about the lack of provisions relating to protection against sexual abuse<b>34</b> and the 
growing number of boys dropping out of schools.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>22. At its forty-third session (2006), the Committee adopted general comment No. 9 on the 
rights of children with disabilities, stressing that girls with disabilities are more vulnerable to 
discrimination.  The general comment urges States parties to take all measures to ensure their 
protection, access to services and inclusion in society. 
</p>
<p>23. At its day of general discussion in September 2006 on the right of the child to be heard, 
the Committee urged States parties to pay special attention to the rights of the girl child in order 
to combat sexist stereotypes and patriarchal values which undermine and place severe limitations 
on the enjoyment of the rights set forth in article 12.  In 2005, in the context of discussions on 
children without parental care, the Committee noted that girls without parental care are more 
vulnerable to violations of their rights, including sexual exploitation, child marriage and lack of 
access to education.  It was also emphasized that there is often a gender imbalance in care 
institutions and that both girls and boys need role models of both sexes.  The Committee 
recommended that States parties and other stakeholders ensure that a gender perspective is 
included in all approaches to care.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The Committee was represented by one of its members in an expert group meeting on 
&#8220;The elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against the girl child&#8221; organized by 
the Division for the Advancement of Women and UNICEF in Florence in 2006.  Committee 
members also actively participated in the consultation process of the United Nations Study on 
Violence against Children.

<p><b> F. International Convention on the Protection of the Rights

<p>25. The Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families, at its fourth and fifth sessions (2006), adopted concluding observations on two 
States parties&#8217; reports.  On the first report, it, inter alia, regretted the lack of information on

discrimination against migrant women and the vulnerability of domestic migrant workers, and 
recommended that the State party continue to take appropriate measures to protect women 
domestic workers, including through access to regular migration status, greater involvement of 
the labour authorities in monitoring their working conditions, and access to effective complaint 
mechanisms.  The Committee also expressed concern about trafficking of persons, and 
recommended that efforts be intensified to combat smuggling and trafficking, especially in 
women and children.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>26. In its contribution to the General Assembly&#8217;s High-level Dialogue on International 
Migration and Development (14-15 September 2006), the Committee recommended that special 
attention be given to protect the rights of migrant women, in particular domestic workers.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 13 December 2006, the General Assembly adopted the International Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Convention seeks to protect, promote and guarantee 
the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with 
disabilities, and to ensure respect for their inherent dignity.  The Convention sets out the 
obligations on States parties towards persons with disabilities in relation to civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights and includes provisions on international cooperation as well 
as national and international monitoring.  In recognition of the fact that women can suffer 
multiple discrimination, article 6 of the Convention obliges States parties to take all appropriate 
measures to ensure the full development, advancement and empowerment of women, for the 
purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of their human rights.  The Convention 
also encourages States parties to include a gender perspective in all efforts to promote the rights 
of persons with disabilities and specifically requires them to take appropriate measures to protect 
freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse, including their gender-based aspects, and to 
provide gender-sensitive assistance.  In relation to the right to health, States parties shall take 
appropriate measures to ensure access of persons with disabilities to health services which are 
gender sensitive.  Finally, the Convention establishes a new treaty body - the Committee on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities - whose members shall be elected with a view to ensuring 
gender balance in the Committee.

<p>country visits and communications with Governments regarding allegations of human rights 
violations.  This section highlights some of their main activities in this regard.  In respect of 
communications with Governments from November 2005 to November 2006, in cases 
where communications from special procedures to Governments addressed individuals rather 
than groups of persons, the total number of cases concerning individual women was 465, 
constituting 16.6 per cent of all communications concerning individuals. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education has actively raised awareness about 
obstacles to equal access to education and called for implementation of measures to ensure 
equality in education.  In 2005, he contributed to discussions on progress in girls&#8217; enjoyment of 
the right to education on the occasion of the target date for attainment of the first phase of 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 3, which seeks to eliminate gender disparity in primary 
education and is an important milestone towards MDG 2, which sets the objective of universal 
primary education by 2015.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the sixty-second session of the 
Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/45) on girls&#8217; right to education addresses, 
inter alia, the sociocultural context of gender discrimination by defining the concept of 
patriarchalism, which underpins discriminatory behaviours.  He denounces the negative impact 
on education, and especially on girls&#8217; education, of the persistent consideration of education as 
being a service rather than a human right and insists on the importance of ensuring not only girls&#8217; 
access to school but also their completion of the education cycle.  The report identifies obstacles 
to education for girls, such as early marriages and pregnancies, child labour (especially domestic 
work) and armed conflicts.  The Special Rapporteur draws attention to aggravating factors and 
highlights the key role of human rights education and its concrete implementation at the 
classroom level to combat gender discrimination and stereotypes.  The report also reviews the 
replies to a questionnaire sent to different stakeholders to solicit information on the realization of 
the right to education for girls, extracting major trends from the replies.  Finally, it provides 
recommendations based on the four elements identified as components of the right to education, 
namely, availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health in his report to the sixty-first session of the 
General Assembly (see A/61/338) examines, inter alia, the relationship between the right to 
health and one of the Millennium Development Goals, the reduction of maternal mortality.  
Properly integrated, the right to health can help ensure that the relevant policies are more 
equitable, sustainable and robust.  The report sets out the norms and obligations relevant to 
maternal mortality, highlights the positive contribution of the right to health to reducing maternal 
mortality, and proposes a human rights campaign against maternal mortality.  In July 2006, the 
Special Rapporteur participated in informal consultations organized by UNFPA on current and 
future work on sexual and reproductive health rights.  He noted that two interrelated challenges 
that he focuses on - discrimination and stigma, and poverty - permit him to examine many sexual 
and reproductive health rights issues, including maternal mortality, access to sexual and 
reproductive health-related information and services, and violence against women.  Systematic 
discrimination based on gender impedes women&#8217;s access to health and hampers their ability to 
respond to the consequences of ill-health for themselves and their family.  Eliminating 
discrimination against women in the field of health also means empowering women to make 
decisions in relation to their sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, violence and 
discrimination.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living has produced a series of reports on women and adequate housing 
(E/CN.4/2003/55, E/CN.4/2005/43, E/CN.4/2006/118).  In 2005 and 2006, in accordance with 
Commission resolution 2003/22, the Special Rapporteur, supported by OHCHR, United Nations 
entities and non-governmental organizations, held a North American Regional Consultation on 
Women and the Right to Adequate Housing (Washington, DC, October, 2005); a 
Central Asia/Eastern Europe Regional Consultation on Women&#8217;s Right to Adequate 
Housing - the interlinkages between multiple discrimination and women&#8217;s right to adequate 
housing (Budapest, November 2005) and a Euro-Mediterranean Regional Consultation on 
Women and Housing (Barcelona, Spain, March 2006).  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work on 
women and adequate housing has resulted in a wealth of information that is being prepared for 
publication by OHCHR.  The publication will include a comparative analysis of the status of 
women&#8217;s right to adequate housing at the regional level and selected testimonies and case studies 
stemming from the regional consultations.  In 2005, the Special Rapporteur made contributions 
to the drafting by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of general comment 
No. 16 on article 3 of the Covenant concerning &#8220;The equal right of men and women to the 
enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;.  In February 2006, the Special Rapporteur 
continued his dialogue with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW) on women and adequate housing and the need for further work in this area, including 
the development of model questions that could be used by the Committee in its dialogue with 
States parties.  Further, as requested by resolution 2005/25, the Special Rapporteur and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women have initiated work on the drafting of model 
provisions to protect women&#8217;s rights in domestic violence legislation. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
considers violence against women to be a specific form of gender discrimination that is both a 
cause and consequence of other forms of gender discrimination.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report 
to the sixty-first session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2005/72) examined the intersections of 
violence against women and HIV/AIDS.  Her report to the sixty-second session 
(E/CN.4/2006/61) examined the due diligence standard as a tool for eliminating violence against 
women.  The Special Rapporteur highlighted the need to re-examine and expand the standard, 
namely through the full implementation of generalized obligations of prevention and 
compensation, the effective realization of existing obligations to protect and punish, and the 
inclusion of relevant non-State actors as duty bearers in relation to responding to violence 
against women.  The Special Rapporteur conducted fact-finding missions to the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, Afghanistan and Mexico in 2005 and to Turkey, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2006.  
In her address at the sixty-first session of the General Assembly, she emphasized that the current 
challenge in combating violence against women pertains to ensuring that the root causes and 
consequences of the problem are tackled at all levels, from the home to the transnational arena.  
She also highlighted the value of applying a human rights perspective to the problem.  The 
Special Rapporteur has stressed the relevance of her work to the Commission on the Status of 
Women and the need to report to that body also. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in her 
report to the sixty-first session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2005/71) expressed concern at 
reports of marketing of women and children via the Internet or under the guise of 
marriage-brokering services and pen-pal clubs.  She noted that the majority of victims of 
trafficking are women and girls trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and expressed </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>concern that they are further penalized on charges of prostitution instead of receiving assistance.  
The Special Rapporteur reiterated this concern in her report to the sixty-second session of the 
Commission (E/CN.4/2006/62) and stressed that domestic laws and policies that penalize 
prostituted women and children contribute to their vulnerability and make women and 
children more susceptible to being victimized by sex trafficking.  She further underlined that 
socio-economic, political and cultural conditions in many parts of the world make women and 
children particularly susceptible to being trafficked.  The Special Rapporteur undertook country 
visits to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lebanon in 2005.  She has attended and contributed to 
various discussions globally addressing the particular human rights concerns of trafficked 
women and girls, including before the Commission on the Status of Women on the occasion of 
the Review and Appraisal of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2005. 
</p><p>34. In his report to the sixty-first session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2005/78 and Corr.1 
and 2), the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child pornography and child prostitution 
focuses on child pornography on the Internet.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the 
sixty-second session (E/CN.4/2006/67) dealt with the question of the demand factor in the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children.  He noted that demand for sexual exploitation comes 
overwhelmingly from men.  Girls remain in the vast caseload of the sexually exploited.  
Therefore, any intervention should address fundamental and systemic values and beliefs that 
accommodate and sustain sexual violence and exploitation of children: patriarchy, beliefs 
surrounding sexual dominance and machismo, male power and control, the view of children 
(especially girl children) as objects of possession, and perverted cultural beliefs.  It is only 
through the empowerment of women that the demand for child sexual exploitation can be 
reduced.  The Special Rapporteur noted that current prevention strategies typically address 
women and children as victims or potential victims and focus on how women and girls can avoid 
sexual abuse.  So far, men have not been sufficiently offered the opportunity to join prevention 
efforts and it is now necessary to develop strategies involving men. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance undertook country missions to Japan and Brazil in 2005.  In 
his report of his mission to Japan (E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.2 and Corr.1), the Special Rapporteur 
recommended the creation of a national commission for equality and human rights whose 
mandate would include addressing discrimination on the basis of gender.  He further 
recommended that all communities, and specifically the Buraku and Ainu communities, ensure 
that women can exercise their rights in equality as guaranteed by human rights treaties, including 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  In his report 
of his mission to Brazil (E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.3), the Special Rapporteur paid attention to the 
situation of black women, indigenous women, and women from <i>quilombos</i> who suffer the most 
from inequalities deriving from racial discrimination.  In his recommendations, he called for the 
establishment of a national commission for equality and human rights, and proposed that 
domestic workers, 90 per cent of whom are black women, benefit from legal recognition and 
protection, including by labour legislation.  In November 2006, the Special Rapporteur 
participated in the International Conference on the Human Rights of Dalit Women in The Hague.  
He stressed the importance of taking account of the gender dimensions of caste discrimination 
and the need to take gender-sensitive legislative, judicial, information and education measures, 
along with securing clear political will and determination to abolish caste-based discrimination. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous peoples conducted country visits to New Zealand and South Africa in 2005.  In the 
context of these visits, the Special Rapporteur has held specific meetings with indigenous 
women to gain a concrete view of their specific concerns and issues.  In his report of his mission 
to New Zealand (E/CN.4/2006/78/Add.3), the Special Rapporteur noted that across a range of 
indicators, Maori women still experience poorer economic, health and social outcomes than 
other New Zealand women.  For example, the rates of employment and participation in paid 
work for Maori women are still lower than those for Maori men and non-Maori; Maori women 
are still twice as likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer as non-Maori women and they 
continue to have a higher infant mortality rate compared to the total population.  Further, 
approximately 45-50 per cent of battered women using Women&#8217;s Refuge Services are Maori.  
Where women are at risk, their children may also be at risk.  Maori youth have higher rates of 
suicide than similar non-Maori age groups, a situation that may reflect higher family 
dysfunctions and social disorganization associated with a history of discrimination.  In his report 
of his mission to South Africa (E/CN.4/2006/78/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur noted that 
special mention must be made of the specific grievances of indigenous children, youth and 
women, who reported discrimination, violence, drug abuse, high suicide rates, prostitution, 
alcoholism and other syndromes associated with marginalization and poverty.  Of major concern 
to San and Khoe women is the unacceptably high level of domestic violence.  Violence in some 
communities is so extreme that it includes murders and assaults with weapons and is often 
associated with alcohol abuse and low self-esteem by men and women.  Indigenous women in 
South Africa, in particular indigenous rural women, are systematically excluded on matters of 
land reform policy and on discussions regarding solutions to their problems.  In September 2006, 
the Special Rapporteur participated in an open forum on the implementation of the 
recommendations of his visit to Canada.  In October 2006, the Special Rapporteur participated in 
a parallel event in the General Assembly concerning the launching of a report on violence 
against indigenous women by an international non-governmental organization (NGO). 
</p>
<p>37. The independent expert on minority issues notes that new and urgent attention must be 
given to the rights of women facing multiple forms of discrimination, exclusion and violence.  
Amongst the most disadvantaged and vulnerable are women from minority communities who 
face problems both because they belong to certain minority communities and because they are 
women.  On the occasion of International Women&#8217;s Day 2006, she called for all actors at the 
community, national and international levels to rise to the challenge of improving the security, 
opportunities and life chances of such women.  She also called for action to protect and promote 
the rights of those women whose lives have become defined by discrimination, exploitation and 
violence, and whose voices have been silenced by patriarchal ideologies and the fear of speaking 
out.  She noted that women from minority groups &#8220;often fight the patriarchy within their 
communities along with the patriarchy and racism of the larger community&#8221;.  Harmful cultural, 
religious or traditional practices which affect minority women need to be addressed.  Further, 
poverty and conflict deeply impact on minorities and create conditions in which minority women 
are further disempowered.  Pointing to Roma women, Afro-descendants and women affected by 
caste discrimination, she noted that the &#8220;hidden victims&#8221; of discrimination &#8220;are often the most 
disadvantaged from birth until death&#8221;.  She stressed the need for research and analysis to expose 
the reality of situations facing minority women and action which reaches into communities 
themselves as well as addressing discrimination manifested in larger society.  The independent 
expert has noted that education is key to improving the situation of minority women. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, in his report to the sixty-second 
session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2006/73), raised concerns about domestic migrant workers, 
who are mostly women, and highlighted particular human rights abuses suffered by women in 
the context of migration.  The Special Rapporteur attended a seminar on strengthening synergies 
amongst stakeholders in the protection and promotion of the rights of Indonesian women migrant 
workers in July 2006 in Jakarta. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders has reiterated that women defenders are more at risk of certain forms of violence and 
restrictions and become vulnerable to prejudice, exclusion and public repudiation by State forces 
and social actors, especially when engaged in the defence of women&#8217;s rights.  In her report to the 
sixty-first session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2005/101), she noted that defenders working on 
women&#8217;s rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues continue to face 
human rights violations.  In her report to the sixty-second session of the Commission 
(E/CN.4/2006/95), the Special Representative emphasized that there is no better protection for 
women human rights defenders than the strength and support of their own movements.  
Additional protection measures are therefore needed by States and the human rights community 
at large to provide women&#8217;s rights defenders with a secure environment for their work.  In her 
report to the sixty-first session of the General Assembly (see A/61/312), which focused on the 
right to freedom of assembly in relation to the activities of human rights defenders, she reiterated 
that those defending LGBT rights and women defenders face particular challenges.  In 2005, the 
Special Representative attended the World Conference on Women Human Rights Defenders held 
in Sri Lanka, which brought together leading gender experts and women human rights defenders 
from over 70 countries.  This conference was the culmination of a three-year international 
Internet campaign that had been spearheaded by the Special Representative.<b>40</b>  It focused on 
identifying and developing new strategies for protecting women defenders against a range of 
sources and types of abuse by States, non-State actors, families and communities, and sexual and 
sexuality-based attacks.  The website www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org continues to be 
a resource tool for women&#8217;s rights defenders.  Following the conference, 29 November was 
designated as International Women Human Rights Defenders Day.  On 29 November 2006, the 
Special Representative commemorated the Day in Bangkok in solidarity with a gathering of 
women human rights defenders from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.  The 
Special Representative delivered a keynote address at the first International Conference on 
LGBT Human Rights, held in Canada from 26 to 29 July 2006.  In her keynote address to the 
Council of Europe to discuss the establishment of a regional European mechanism to protect 
human rights defenders, she highlighted the challenges for women human rights defenders and 
defenders of LGBT rights (Strasbourg, 13-14 November 2006).  The Special Representative 
co-signed a joint letter on 10 December 2006 to coincide with the Global Day for Darfur calling 
on the international community to deploy a robust peacekeeping force to protect women in 
Darfur from rape and sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>40
</b>  The Special Representative of the Secretary-General called for an international campaign 
</p>
<p>following her 2002 report to the Commission on Human Rights which focused on women human 
rights defenders and the specific violations they face in the course of their work because of their 
sex and gender (see E/CN.4/2002/106, paras. 80-94). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers focuses on adequate 
representation of women within the judiciary and the legal profession and advocates that 
offences against women, particularly violence against women including rape, domestic violence 
and trafficking, as well as discrimination against women, are duly investigated, prosecuted and 
sanctioned within the judicial system.  In his visits to Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in the 
second half of 2005, he met with women&#8217;s judges and lawyers associations and raised these 
issues with the governmental and judicial authorities that he met.  In the report of his mission to 
Ecuador (E/CN.4/2006/52/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur regrets that, in the end, it was not 
possible to give effect to affirmative action to promote gender equality by setting a quota of 
20 per cent of members of the court who should be women judges, in accordance with the 
principles contained in the Ecuadorian Constitution and in international treaties, and he 
recommends that this point should be borne in mind when applying the mechanism to co-opt 
members to fill vacant posts in the Supreme Court and in other processes to select judges for 
high courts in Ecuador.  The Special Rapporteur also recommends the adoption of affirmative 
action to promote the participation of Afro-Ecuadorians or persons from indigenous groups 
in the above-mentioned institutions.  In his report of his mission to Kyrgyzstan 
(E/CN.4/2006/52/Add.3), the Special Rapporteur considers that until a better balance is 
achieved it may be relevant to introduce affirmative action measures, with a view to enhancing 
the participation of women and ethnic minorities in the judiciary at all levels. 
</p><p>41. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances took note in its report to 
the sixty-second session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2006/56 and Corr.1) of disappearances of 
women.  It noted that even when subjects of enforced disappearance are men, women are victims 
because they are the wives, sisters and mothers who are left behind, agonizing over the fate or 
whereabouts of their disappeared relatives.  The Working Group has also dealt with cases of 
abductions of women and girls in several conflict situations.

<p>42. OHCHR, through its Petitions Unit, participated in two training courses at the Women&#8217;s 
Human Rights Training Institute in Bulgaria in February 2005 and March 2006, organized by the 
Bulgarian Gender Research Foundation, the Centre for Reproductive Rights and the Network for 
East-West Women.  The purpose was to train women lawyers from Eastern Europe to use 
complaints procedures under international human rights treaties, in particular the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, in their efforts to promote women&#8217;s rights.  The Unit also 
participated in a project on the strengthening of the implementation of human rights treaty 
bodies&#8217; recommendations by improving national protection mechanisms<b>41</b> in June 2006 in 
Morocco.  The Convention and its Optional Protocol, along with the presentation of shadow 
reports on women&#8217;s rights to treaty bodies, were broadly discussed.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>43. In accordance with the High Commissioner&#8217;s Plan of Action and Strategic Management 
Plans, OHCHR is expanding its work to promote gender equality and protect and empower 
women.  It is taking action to implement the decision of the Secretary-General to transfer 
responsibility for supporting CEDAW to OHCHR.  A dedicated Unit on Women&#8217;s Human 
Rights and Gender has been established in the Office.  In addition to the Unit&#8217;s ongoing specific 
cooperation with individual United Nations entities and participation in a range of inter-agency 
activities in the fields of peace and security, humanitarian affairs and development, it is working, 
inter alia, to develop legal analyses and commentaries to be made available to Governments, 
civil society, treaty bodies and field offices on a wide variety of women&#8217;s rights issues.  The 
analyses and commentaries aim to ensure greater coherence in approaches to the issues.  The 
Unit will pilot gender-sensitive country-engagement strategies and will work to combat 
impunity for violations of women&#8217;s human rights.  It will place particular emphasis on the 
protection and promotion of women&#8217;s economic, social and cultural rights.  It will engage a wide 
range of partners to implement its work programme, taking note of the recommendation of the 
United Nations High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence to establish one United Nations 
entity focused on gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment.<b>

<p>44. The OHCHR Office in Angola is supporting the Government in its treaty reporting 
obligations and opening possibilities for civil society to elaborate shadow reports, including on 
women&#8217;s rights.  UNDP, UNFPA and UNIFEM, with the participation of OHCHR, are designing 
a joint United Nations programme on gender, with focus on political participation of women.  In 
partnership with Norwegian People&#8217;s Aid, OHCHR is supporting a project that aims to 
strengthen women&#8217;s participation in political life.  The Office&#8217;s work in Angola is guided by a 
human rights-based approach with principles of non-discrimination and a focus on vulnerable 
populations (including women) at the heart of all activities.  Follow-up to the recommendations 
of CEDAW on Angola&#8217;s periodic reports in 2004 is being supported by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>45. The OHCHR Office in Cambodia has worked closely with UNIFEM to support the 
process of elaborating Cambodia&#8217;s fourth periodic report to CEDAW and ensuring effective 
follow-up of recommendations issued in January 2006.  They include a number of broadly 
framed concerns, including the effectiveness of the justice system and the pervasive culture of 
impunity, which touch the mainstream of Government activity.  While responsibility for 
CEDAW implementation lies with the Cambodian National Council for Women, working with 
the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, other Government ministries have yet to fully mainstream 
gender in their activities.  OHCHR is working to raise awareness that equality between men and 
women is enshrined in all of the core human rights treaties and to encourage others, including 
United Nations entities, to follow up on the recommendations put forward by CEDAW in their 
activities.  It also raises awareness that the reporting processes under other human rights treaties 
provides opportunities to consolidate and highlight the issues raised by CEDAW.

<p>46. The OHCHR Field Office in Colombia works to register and analyse violations of 
women&#8217;s human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law pertaining to women.  
Workshops have been held to promote gender-sensitive human rights monitoring and registration 
of cases in the database.  The Office undertakes various actions, including communications with 
victims and/or authorities in follow-up to cases.  It has facilitated modules on gender and 
discrimination and international instruments on women&#8217;s rights.  Participants at training courses </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in the last 1&#189; years have included prosecutors, staff of the Colombian Institute of Family 
Welfare, adolescents participating in a programme to prevent violence against women, and 
United Nations staff in Colombia.  Following a recommendation of the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women after her visit to Colombia in 2001, the Office has worked to help the 
Attorney-General&#8217;s Office to develop an instrument to identify relevant cases for prosecutors.  
The Office has conducted an analysis of the impact of the legislation related to demobilization of 
members of illegal armed groups.  As a result, it included a recommendation in relation to the 
need to take into account the special needs of women and girls when the &#8220;Justice and Peace 
Law&#8221; was being debated in Congress.  This recommendation was accepted in the final draft of 
the law.  The Office has worked with the National Commission for Reparation and 
Reconciliation on ways to include a gender perspective in the development of criteria for 
reparation.  It has prepared documents relating to the recommendations by the Human Rights 
Committee, CEDAW and the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the need to revise 
the legislation on abortion in connection with a process before the Constitutional Court.  The 
Office has given advice to parliamentarians and NGOs on the scope of the State&#8217;s 
responsibilities regarding domestic and other forms of gender-based violence.  Its participation 
in United Nations system activities includes participation in an inter-agency group which is 
supporting the process of drafting and debating a law on gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>47. During the past 1&#189; years, the promotion and protection of the human rights of women 
has been integrated into the work of the Human Rights Division of the United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the OHCHR 
Office in that country, mainly through strengthening the fight against impunity relating to rape 
and other forms of sexual violence; identifying efficient and effective mechanisms and strategies 
to better monitor the occurrence of sexual violence and strengthen the fight against sexual 
violence; supporting initiatives and infrastructures in place to address sexual violence by 
providing medical, psychosocial and judicial assistance to the victims; sensitizing local 
authorities, armed groups, relevant partners and the international community on the widespread 
phenomenon of sexual violence in the country and on the international law applicable to the 
commission of the acts concerned; supporting prosecutions by Congolese justice of perpetrators 
of sexual violence; promoting gender balance within the Human Rights Division of MONUC by 
recruiting more women candidates (40 women/53 men); sensitizing and empowering women 
candidates for the 2006 elections with a view to making them more competitive; supporting the 
establishment of joint commissions (policy-army-human rights NGOs) on gender, women&#8217;s 
rights and judicial assistance to victims of sexual violence; advocating for the adoption and 
promulgation of the law on sexual violence; and advocating for greater protection of the rights of 
women in the Constitution of 18 February 2006.

<p>48. Gender-based violence in Nepal has been an issue of grave concern for many years and 
has been exacerbated by the conflict.  While some aspects such as domestic violence and 
trafficking have been addressed by organizations, the level of violence against women, girls and 
specific minorities has still to be thoroughly documented.  Sexual violence in particular remains 
a taboo subject and awareness-raising, prevention, support to victims and accountability for 
perpetrators are still areas requiring extensive coordinated efforts of a range of partners.  
OHCHR has focused on tackling impunity for gender-based violence, working especially on 
monitoring and reporting and capacity-building and legal reform.  OHCHR is collaborating with 
lawyers and NGOs to amend laws with special focus on sexual violence, including rape.  It has 
been investigating allegations of sexual violence committed by members of the security forces </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and cadres of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and has been intervening in cases where 
victims or human rights defenders have been threatened.  It has been working with local NGOs 
to develop a network of response mechanisms for victims.  OHCHR has advocated for increased 
representation of women at all levels, including in the peace process.  It has commented on the 
draft interim constitution and has raised the issue of gender representation in a range of meetings 
with various stakeholders.  OHCHR participates in various workshops with women&#8217;s 
organizations and is working closely with the Blue Diamond Society on the rights of sexual 
minorities.  Gender perspectives are also integrated in training given by OHCHR; participants 
include the National Human Rights Commission, NGOs, government agencies, security 
agencies, as well as the National Monitoring Committee on a Code of Conduct for Ceasefire.  
OHCHR liaises with other United Nations agencies working on trafficking and is paying 
attention to the issue of female migrant workers, who are particularly vulnerable to human rights 
abuses.  It participated in two conferences in Indonesia in July 2006 on the human rights of 
women migrant workers.

<p>49. In Sudan, the Human Rights Office of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan 
(UNMIS HR) is working closely with government officials and civil society organizations to 
promote women&#8217;s rights.  Besides creating awareness through training activities, UNMIS HR is 
also fostering the debate on reforming legal provisions concerning rape and other crimes of 
sexual violence within Sudanese laws, in particular the Criminal and Evidence Acts.  
Additionally, sexual and gender-based violence are among the main monitoring areas of the 
Office.  In Darfur, UNMIS HR has been supporting and actively participating in the efforts of 
the State Committees on Combating Gender-based Violence.  The South Darfur State Committee 
has been the most active among the three committees established and has received a grant from 
UNMIS HR to strengthen the Committee and enable it to more effectively implement activities 
identified in its six-month work plan. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights issues have been addressed by all treaty 
bodies and a great majority of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights.  
These mechanisms have provided States with numerous recommendations aiming to 
ensure equality and non-discrimination, and to protect and promote women&#8217;s civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social human rights.  These recommendations should be 
implemented expeditiously with a view to improving the status of women worldwide.  
States should further undertake to reach the goal of universal ratification of human rights 
treaties, should make efforts to remove reservations to treaties, and should reinforce 
actions to implement treaty commitments.  At the national level, policies, laws, institutions 
and procedures to protect and promote women&#8217;s human rights need to be instituted, or 
strengthened, to protect and empower women.  The scourge of discrimination and 
gender-based violence both in times of peace and during conflict must be eradicated 
without delay, and women and girls provided with opportunities to live their lives in 
dignity and security, and to enjoy all of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
