<p>in Dohuk upheld the sentences and sent them to be ratified by the President of the 
Kurdistan Regional Government, Mas&#8217;ud Barzani. After his arrest in 2006, Majeed Ibrahim 
Hamo is reported to have been subjected to torture by security (<i>Asayish</i>) personnel, as a 
result of which he sustained a broken shoulder and was burnt all over his body with 
cigarettes. The allegations of torture were raised by his lawyer during the trial. The doctor 
who carried out a medical examination on him two to three months after his arrest wrote a 
letter to the court stating that the results of the examination were inconclusive.
