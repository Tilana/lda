<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.<footnote name="1">90. El 7 de marzo de 2006, el Gobierno transmiti&#243; la siguiente informaci&#243;n adicional a la

taken for subsequent sale into sexual slavery by organizers of people trafficking.  The average 
age of most of the girls due to be flying out to the United Arab Emirates was in fact 15-30 years.  
It has to be pointed out that virtually all the Uzbekistan citizens heading to the Emirates were 
voluntarily going to engage in prostitution to solve their material and social problems. 349. As of 15 February of this year, after filtering work, the decision was taken by the Kyrgyz 
SNB investigative group to gradually deport and hand over 52 of the detained citizens of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan and the one Turkmenistan citizen, who had entered the territory of 
Kyrgyzstan from Uzbekistan, to the Uzbekistan SNB Border Troops. Note was taken of the use 
by three Uzbekistan citizens of forged passports, as well as the discovery on yet another three 
citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan of forged passports and fragments of false passports of the 
Kyrgyz Republic.    </footnote>0 del d&#237;a 9 de agosto de 2005, en el sitio conocido como Vereda

<p><b>A. Introduction 
</b> 
1. At its fourth session, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 2005/41 entitled 
&#8220;Elimination of violence against women&#8221; encouraged the Special Rapporteur to respond 
effectively to reliable information that comes before her and requested all Governments to 
cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of her mandate tasks and 
duties, to supply all information requested, including with regard to implementation of her 
recommendations, and to respond to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visits and communications.   
 
2. The present addendum to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual report contains, on a country by 
country basis, summaries of individual allegations, as well as urgent appeals sent to 
Governments on individual cases and general situations of concern to her mandate. This report 
includes summaries of the communications sent from 1 January and 31 December 2006.<footnote name="1">56. It is further reported that four other key witnesses in the aforementioned trial have been 
subject to police harassment in relation to the most recent trial and were subjected to torture in 
order to provide false testimony against C. Guangcheng in his previous trial.   
 
157. According to reports, C. Gengjiang was detained on 26 November 2006 and held until after 
the hearing had taken place.  He was allegedly forced to sign papers in which he agreed not to 
participate in the case.  On the same day,  C. Guangdong and C. Guangyu reportedly disappeared 
after they had agreed to testify on behalf of the defence. Later the same evening,  C. Guanghe 
was allegedly abducted by undercover police officers as he was on his way to meet with L. 
Fanping regarding the upcoming trial in which he was scheduled to testify the following day.  He 
was reportedly formally arrested on 28 November but his family was not informed of his arrest 
or his whereabouts until 3 December 2006.  Previously, it is alleged that C. Guanghe was 
detained and tortured before the first trial by members of the Yinan police in order to procure a 
false confession and to testify against C. Guangcheng.  He was convicted on the basis of the false 
confession but granted a suspended sentence.  It is feared that his recent detention may be related 
to the fact that that he has submitted written testimony stating that his prior evidence had been 
coerced through torture.  
 
158. Members of C. Guangcheng&#8217;s defence team have also allegedly been harassed, including 
his lawyers L. Jinsong, L. Fangping and T. Biao. The two lawyers were apparently prevented 
from interviewing witnesses and obtaining further evidence for the retrial.  On 27 November 
2006, as the trial was taking place, T. Biao was reportedly detained for five hours during which 
he was allegedly pushed to the ground by six or seven policemen who held him down while they 
searched him.  They also apparently searched his bags and computer and confiscated his mobile 
phone. 
 
159. Previously it had been reported: On 12 August 2005, C. Guangcheng and his wife Yuan 
were put under de facto house arrest. On 25 August 2005, C. Guangcheng evaded the police 
surrounding his village and went to Shanghai and Nanjing, then Beijing to seek help from 
lawyers.  On 6 September 2005 he was detained at the house of a friend in Bejijing by six men 
who said they were public security bureau (PSB) officers. He was held overnight in a hotel and 
the head of the Linyi PSB and the Deputy Mayor of Linyi came to see him in the morning.  The 
Linyi PSB head told C. Guangcheng he was suspected of violating Article 111 of the CCC 
(illegally providing intelligence to foreign countries), for which the maximum sentence is life.  
However, no one produced an arrest warrant justifying his detention and the Linyi PSB men 
coercively took C. Guangcheng back home. 
 
160. C. Guangcheng was placed under house arrest without any order to that effect. On 9 
September 2005 his landline and mobile phone services were cut off, and his computer was 
seized. On 23 September 2005, PSB officials searched his house without producing a search 
warrant. 
 
161. On 4 October 2005, Beijing law lecturer X. Zhiyong and lawyers L. Fangping and L. Subin 
attempted to visit C. Guangcheng but they were stopped on their way to his house. C. 
Guangcheng reportedly managed to leave his house and spoke with them briefly but was then 
forcibly returned and beaten by men surrounding his house. The lawyers tried to approach C. 
Guangcheng&#8217;s house but were physically prevented. X. Zhiyong and L. Fangping were also </footnote> The 
report also contains summaries of government replies received until 13 February 2007.  
 
3. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in issuing urgent appeals and in transmitting 
allegations, she does not make any judgment concerning the merits of the respective cases, nor 
does she necessarily support the opinions and activities of the persons on behalf of whom she 
intervenes. In the original communications, the full names of victims and perpetrators have been 
provided to the Government concerned. In this report, the names of individual victims and 
alleged perpetrators have been replaced by initials in order to protect their privacy and to prevent 
further victimization as well as to avoid pre-judgement of the alleged perpetuators.  
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Overview of Communications 
</b> 
<b>1. Communications sent 
</b> 
4. In 2006, Special Procedures mandate-holders sent a total of 1,<footnote name="16">. According to the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women as well as 
other international instruments States have a duty to take positive action and exercise due 
diligence to prevent and protect women from violence, to prosecute and appropriately sanction 
perpetrators of violence and to ensure that victims of violence receive compensation. States have 
this duty regardless of whether the relevant acts have been committed by private or State actors. 
The failure to comply with any aspect of the due diligence obligation constitutes a human rights 
violation. </footnote>5 communications to 143 
countries and entities, 48 per cent of which were joint communications sent by two or more 
mandate-holders. More than half of all communications (57 per cent) were urgent appeals related 
to allegations of ongoing or imminent human rights violations warranting immediate action. 
Government replied to 32 per cent of all communications sent. Communications sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, constituted 7 per 
cent of all communications sent by special procedures mandate-holders.<footnote name="2">60. By letter dated 14 September 2006, the Government of Greece responded to the letter of 
allegation sent by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, on 25 July 2006.  
 
261. The Government provided information pertaining to the legal provisions on adoption in 
Greece. Adoptions are actually governed by Law No. 2447/1990 on Adoption, supervision and 
sponsorship of minors, judicial attendance, judicial diligence of other&#8217;s affairs, relevant 
substantial, procedural and transitory provisions as well as articles 1542 to 1588 of the Civil 
Code.  
 </footnote> 
 
5. During the period under review (1 January to 31 December 2006), the Special Rapporteur 
transmitted 83 communications to 44 Member States: Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, 
China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, 
Greece, Guatemala, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Libya, 
Maldives, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russian 
                                                 
1 In addition, two allegation letters sent in 2005, which were not reflected in the previous report on Communications 
Received and Sent (E/CN.<footnote name="4">79. On 29 November 2004, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an allegation letter concerning the alleged rape of SM. In its letter dated 
22 March 2006, the Government informed that   S.M., aged 16, was reportedly raped by security 
personnel on 10 November 2004. Among the alleged perpetrators, police personnel YPK and 
army personnel BR and KK are in pre-trial custody in District Jail Morang by the order of 
District Court Sunsari. One army personnel BA, also an accused of the same incident, is still at 
large. 480. On 17 November 2004, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
Racism, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance and the Special Rapporteur on Sale of Children, 
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography sent an allegation letter concerning S.S., a Dalit girl 
aged 14, from Inaruwa, Sunsari who was allegedly raped and then murdered with impunity. On 
22 March 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that the police had at the time </footnote>/2006/61/Add.<footnote name="1">53. According to new information received: On 27 November 2006, C. Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial 
before the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court lasted approximately 10 hours.  It is reported that on 1 
December 2006, he was sentenced to four years and three months&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;gathering 
crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. 
 
154. According to reports, C. Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Y.W., has been under de facto house arrest 
from 12 August 2005 until 25 November 2006.  Since then, she had been continuously followed 
by local security personnel and persons in civilian clothes believed to have been hired by the 
police.  On 28 November 2006, around midday, she was arrested by members of the Yinan 
County Public Security Bureau and detained for questioning.  Their one-year-old child was also 
taken but was sent home later that day.  Approximately eight hours later, Yuan Weijing, was 
dragged out of police car and left in a barely conscious state on the side of the road near her 
village.  She was taken to the Mengyin County Menglianggu Hospital where she was treated for 
extreme trauma however she was accompanied by up to 20 policemen as an order of &#8220;residential 
surveillance&#8221; had been issued while she was in detention. She is also suspected of committing 
&#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and for &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. 
 
155. Furthermore it is reported that the local authorities have intimidated witnesses and 
allegedly withheld evidence in order to prejudice C. Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial. </footnote>), have been included. One allegation letter sent on 18 December 2006 
was not included. At the time this report was finalized, the Government concerned had not yet had the chance to 
respond to the issues within the deadline of 60 days indicated in the allegation letter. 
2 It is also worth noting that only 17 per cent of all communications sent by special procedures mandate-holders 
concerned female victims. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.<footnote name="1">46. According to the new information received: On 24 November 2006 G.H. was beaten by 
members of the State Security police who had been following her movements and keeping her 
under surveillance. It is reported that G.H., her 13 year old daughter and her mother have been 
constantly followed by police for approximately three months.  The incident reportedly took 
place on a street in Beijing (Jingsong Road, near the Lidu Hotel on bus route 408), after G.H. 
told three police officers (two male, one female) to stop following her and her children.  As a 
result of the beating by the two male police officers, G.H. is reported to have loosened teeth, a </footnote>

<p> 
Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Thailand, 
Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe.  
 
6. 48 communications concerned allegations of human rights violations that had already 
occurred or reflected longstanding concerns (allegations letters). In 35 cases, the Special 
Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal because a human rights violation was ongoing or imminent and 
there was a need to inform the government authorities about the allegations received without any 
delay. 
 
7. 80 out of 83 communications (96 per cent) were sent jointly with other mandate holders of 
the Human Rights Council. 
 
8. It is interesting to note that the largest number of joint communications (26) was sent 
together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, indicating a convergence 
between diverse forms of human rights violations experienced by women with that of more 
conventional forms of violations. This also signals an erosion of the public / private sphere 
dichotomy used for so long to exclude violence against women from public concern and 
scrutiny. Other communications were sent jointly with: 
</p>
<p>- The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders (22),  
</p>
<p>- The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children  (18),  
- The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</p>
<p>(17),  
- The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers (13),  
- The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression (8),  
- The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (8),  
- The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (5),  
- The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
</p>
<p>indigenous people (4) 
- The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance (3), 
- The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (1), 
- Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living, (1), 
- The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
</p>
<p>attainable standard of physical and mental health (1). 
 
<b>2. Governments Cooperation and Replies to the Special Rapporteur  
</b> 9. In each of the communications, the Special Rapporteur has asked Governments to respond 
to a detailed set of questions in order to clarify the allegations submitted. As of 15 February 
2007, the Special Rapporteur had received responses to 43 cases from Governments concerned 
and would like to express her particular appreciation for timely replies. The Special Rapporteur 
remains concerned that only half of the communications sent in 2006 (52 per cent) have so been 
responded to. Many Governments failed to respond and some only responded partially to the 
issues raised. The Special Rapporteur expresses her appreciation to have received, during the 
course of 2006, 19 additional responses to communications sent in 2004 and 2005. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.<footnote name="1">30. On 1 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent 
an urgent appeal to the government of China concerning M.H., a woman of Shanghai. She has 
been the subject of previously transmitted communications (see E/CN.<footnote name="4">66. The Government noted that this issue is complex and involves many different actors and 
destinations. While poverty, ignorance, lack of education and awareness, urbanization, socio-
cultural factors, consumerism, lack of job opportunities, and crisis in traditional forms of 
livelihood may function as the push factor of trafficking of women and children, it is 
accompanied by a more complex and vicious network of demand factor within and beyond the 
border. Therefore, the NPA aims at exerting more coordinated effort towards the prevention and 
controlling of women and child trafficking and rescue and rehabilitation of the victims. This 
involves the mobilization of resources at all levels and the participation of not only the 
government but the civil society as well.   
467. Regarding the accuracy of the facts summarized in the communication, it indicated that 
there are no specific empirical studies carried out by the Government of Nepal to ascertain them. 
However, the State has incorporated provisions of harsh penalty and imprisonment to the 
perpetrators of such crime. As per the provisions of the Trafficking in Person (Control) Act, 
1987, a convicted criminal of trafficking is liable for a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment 
and up to Rs. 200,000.00 penalty. The Act also provides for an extra-territorial jurisdiction in 
such cases allowing indicted persons to be prosecuted in the court of Nepal wherever the crime 
may have been committed. Any of the police offices in Nepal can accept the complaint of such 
cases. The principle of strict liability is applied, under which the statement of the victim or the 
plaintiff is considered as strong evidence against the defendant who has to prove his/her 
innocence. Cases under this Act are investigated and prosecuted by the Government attorney as a 
party of the case. There are cases where the judiciary has shown encouraging sensitivity in the 
interpretation of the laws on trafficking from the victims&#8217; perspective.  468. Regarding the question whether complaints had been lodged, the Government indicated 
that they may be lodged at any police station verbally or in writing. The police then proceed with 
the investigation of the case and in close coordination with the concerned Office of the District 
Government Attorney files the case to the court. According to the record available with the 
Office of the Attorney-General, the following figures on the cases filed by the prosecution 
officer to the court are reported: from July 2002 to June 2004, 133 cases were filed and 50 
adjudicated by the court; and, from July 2003 to June 2004, 173 cases were filed and 88 
adjudicated. Concerning investigation, medical examinations, rehabilitation offered to returned 
women and girls and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out, the 
Government specified that investigation and prosecution of every individual case takes place 
after the complaint is lodged. This may follow necessary physical examinations as per nature of 
the case and condition of the victim, which is determined by the investigating officer. The 
investigating officer, in coordination with the Office of the District Government Attorney, files 
the case to the competent court for the adjudication of the case. Furthermore, several NGOs in 
cooperation and coordination with the Government of Nepal have been providing shelter and 
training for the rehabilitation and provided means of livelihood to such victims in different parts 
of the country. The existing laws provide the establishment of a rehabilitation fund to run social 
rehabilitation centers for the victims of trafficking. A committee for the overall coordination of 
the activities with different stakeholders is also envisioned. 469. The Government further indicated, that as it had already mentioned, the relevant statistics 
show that perpetrators have been identified and penalized by the decision of the court. In cases 
where sufficient evidence proves that a person is involved in trafficking in persons, he/she is 
kept in judicial custody during the prosecution of the case. Even when the court of first instance </footnote>/2005/62/Add.1, para. 
296, and a communication dated 5 January 2006). M.H. was interviewed on 24 November 2005 
during the recent mission of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture to  China.  
 
131. According to the recent allegations received: on 15 January 2006, M.H. had traveled to 
Beijing with her daughter to take part in an unofficial memorial service marking the first 
anniversary of the death of former Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang. On 24 January, they were 
detained by four Shanghai police officers at their hotel in Beijing. According to her daughter, the 
police treated M.H. roughly, lifting her in an arm-lock and leaving her with bruising to her neck, 
arms and legs. The police took them to another hotel where Shanghai Residents&#8217; Committee 
officials were waiting to take them back to Shanghai by train. When the train arrived in Shanghai 
early the next day, M.H.&#8217;s daughter was released but M.H. was taken to Daqiao Police Station, 
Yangpu district. She was held there for questioning for 24 hours. The next morning, M.H. was 
able to telephone her husband, W.X.. She told him that she was being taken away from the police 
station by Yangpu district Residents&#8217; Committee officials but that she did not know where. He 
then heard M.H. scream and the line went dead. W.X. immediately telephoned the district 
Residents&#8217; Committee to find out where his wife was being taken, but they first denied that they 
were holding her. After repeated calls, the committee secretary confirmed that M.H. was &quot;in their 
hands&quot; and that they wanted to &quot;educate her&quot; because her protests about human rights violations 
were creating &quot;social instability&quot;. They have refused to indicate where she is detained and her 
family has not had access to her.

10. The following Member States did not respond to any of the communication that the Special 
Rapporteur sent in 2006: Bulgaria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, 
India, Iraq, Israel, Liberia, Morocco, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, the Sudan, Thailand, United Arab 
Emirates, and United States of America. 
 
11. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall Human Rights Commission 
resolution 2005/41 in which the Commission requested all Governments to cooperate with and 
assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of her mandated tasks and duties, to supply all 
information requested, including with regard to implementation of her recommendations, and to 
respond to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visits and communications. 
 </p>
<p><b>C. Trends and Observations 
</b> 
12. The communications sent concerned a wide array of issues related to violence against 
women, its causes and consequences as defined in the 1993 United Nations Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women. These included: violence committed by State agents, 
including arbitrary detention; intimate-partner and intra-family violence, including crimes 
committed in the name of honour, forced and early marriage; rape, sexual abuse and sexual 
exploitation; violence against women in the context of labour exploitation; refoulement to 
another country despite a well-founded fear of violence; as well as other forms of violence 
grounded in gender-based discrimination. <b> 
</b> 
13. An analysis of the communications sent indicates several areas of particular concern:  
 
<b>1) Violence against women committed by State agents 
</b> 14. 42 out of 83 communications (51 per cent of the total number) concern allegations of 
violence against women, or threats thereof, committed by State agents. Police officers and 
military personnel were particularly often identified as perpetrators. This category of 
communications also comprises reported cases, in which authorities sentenced or subjected 
women to cruel and unusual punishment (including sentencing to stoning and corporal 
punishment). 
 
15. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes article 4 (b) of the Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, which stipulates that States should pursue by all 
appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating violence against women and, to this 
end, should refrain from engaging in violence against women. 
<i> 
<b></b></i><b>2) Failure to prevent and respond to violence against women with due diligence</b> 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 7 
</p>
<p> 
 
17. 36 out of 83 communications sent (43 per cent) concerned allegations that a Member State 
failed to meet its obligations of due diligence in combating violence against women. The Special 
Rapporteur has acted on cases, for instance, in which authorities have been reported to let 
investigations or prosecutions of acts of violence against women lag, or where authorities failed 
to administer appropriate punishments and penalties.  
 
18. Several communications sent indicate that general problems of impunity and corruption in 
the public sector exacerbate gender-based violence by depriving women of the option to invoke 
the rule of law to counter social power structures that systematically discriminate against women  
 
19. The Special Rapporteur has also acted in cases in which non-State dispute resolution 
mechanisms reportedly either committed or condoned violence against women, sometimes with 
the acquiescence of the State concerned. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall her report 
on the Due Diligence Standard as a Tool for the Elimination of Violence against Women 
(E/CN.4/2006/61) and reiterate that Member States cannot delegate their human rights 
obligations to prevent and respond to violence against women with due diligence. They must 
therefore make appropriate, decisive and timely interventions whenever non-State dispute 
resolution bodies engage in, condone, or otherwise fail to address violence against women in a 
human rights compliant manner. 
 
<b>3) Violence against women facing multiple and intersecting layers of discrimination  
 
</b>20. 33 out of 83 communications sent (40 per cent) concerned women facing multiple and 
intersecting layers of discrimination. 
 
21. Women belonging to national, ethnic or religious minorities or lower social castes, 
indigenous women, and migrant women are strongly overrepresented among reported victims. 
The Special Rapporteur has also acted on cases of transgender persons, who identified 
themselves as women and were targeted due to this sex identity choice, as well as on a case of a 
lesbian woman, who was reportedly murdered because of her sexual orientation. 
 
22. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to the Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 2005/41 on the Elimination on Violence against women in which the 
Commission calls on States to address the specific circumstances facing indigenous women and 
girls in relation to gender-based violence, especially sexual violence, arising from multiple, 
intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination, including racism, paying particular attention 
to the structural causes of violence. 
 
<b>4) Violence against human rights defenders or their female relatives</b> 
<b> 
</b>23. The Special Rapporteur also observes an ongoing trend to subject female human rights 
defenders and women&#8217;s rights defenders to violence, including arbitrary detention, and threats of 
violence. 19 out of 83 communications (23 per cent) concerned cases of this nature. 
 
24. Four communications also referred to cases, in which State agents committed violence 
against wives or close relatives of male human rights defenders. In these cases, stereotypes about </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 8 
 
women&#8217;s supposed greater vulnerability (held by the perpetrators and often also the targeted 
defender himself) are instrumentalized to subdue the human rights defender. 
<b> 
5) Violence against pregnant women, especially while in detention  
</b> 
25. 17 out of 83 communications (20 per cent) related to pregnant women. In several cases 
pregnant women appear to have been deliberate targets of State violence, especially while in 
detention. In some of these cases, the alleged perpetrators acted in full consciousness of the 
pregnancy and with the intention to maximize the harm done to the woman and the fetus.  
 
26. Two cases also indicate a failure on the part of concerned Member States to respect 
women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive rights. In this regard, I would like to stress that women must 
never be forced or otherwise pressured into having an abortion. Conversely, there are also cases, 
including cases of pregnancy due to rape, in which denying women the possibility of having an 
abortion may constitute a form of psychological violence against women.3 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. Communications sent and Government replies received 
</b> 
27. Country specific communications sent and Government replies received are presented in 
the language received. In some cases the Special Rapporteur provides suggestions on which 
additional information is required to respond effectively to the information received. She also 
draws the attention of Governments concerned to relevant findings and recommendations 
contained in her country mission reports and the general recommendations of the Committee on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to the Government concerned.

Carta de alegaciones 
 
</b>28. El 16 de mayo de 2006, la Relatora Especial, juntamente con la Representante Especial 
del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos de 
conformidad con las resoluciones, envi&#243; una carta de alegaciones al Gobierno en relaci&#243;n con la 
Asociaci&#243;n de Lucha por la Identidad Travest&#237; Transexual (ALITT), una organizaci&#243;n que trabaja 
en defensa de los derechos de las personas travest&#237;s y transexuales en Argentina.  
 
29. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: el 16 de septiembre de 2003 la oficina de 
Inspecci&#243;n General de Justicia (IGJ) habr&#237;a negado la solicitud de otorgamiento de la personer&#237;a 
jur&#237;dica de la ALITT. En la carta de negaci&#243;n la IGJ habr&#237;a basado su decisi&#243;n en el art&#237;culo 33, 
segunda parte, inciso 1 del C&#243;digo Civil, que requiere que los objetivos de las organizaciones 
civiles tengan el objeto de bien com&#250;n. Seg&#250;n del IGJ, los prop&#243;sitos de la ALITT que incluyen 
la lucha para que el Estado y la sociedad acepten el travestismo como una identidad propia y la 
&#8220;construcci&#243;n de una ciudadan&#237;a travest&#237; - transexual&#8221; que ofrezca un marco valioso para el

recibido una respuesta. 
<b> 
Respuesta del Gobierno 
 
</b>30. El 14 de octubre de 2006, el Gobierno de Argentina transmiti&#243; la informaci&#243;n siguiente: 
 
31. A la pregunta: &#191; Son exactos 1os hechos a los que se refieren las alegaciones presentadas 
por la v&#237;ctima?, el Gobierno respondi&#243;: 
 
&quot;Si, son exactos.&quot; 
 32. A la pregunta: &#191;Fue presentada alguna queja por la ALITT?, el Gobierno respondi&#243;: 
 
&quot;S&#237;, en primer lugar la ALITT apel&#243; ante la C&#225;mara Nacional de Apelaci&#243;n en lo Civil la 
decisi&#243;n de la Inspecci&#243;n General de Justicia (IGJ) del 16 de septiembre de 2003 denegatoria de 
la autorizaci&#243;n para funcionar como persona jur&#237;dica. Luego, ante la confirmaci&#243;n de este 
rechazo de parte de este tribunal, el 19 de abril de 2004 la ALITT interpuso un recurso 
extraordinario ante la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Naci&#243;n. Desde el 7 de abril de 2005 la 
causa se encuentra en el despacho del Procurador General de la Naci&#243;n a fin de que emita su 
dictamen previo a la resoluci&#243;n definitiva por parte de 1os jueces del Tribunal Supremo.&quot; 
 
33. Tambi&#233;n se solicit&#243; informaci&#243;n detallada sobre la base legal de la negaci&#243;n de 
otorgamiento de la personer&#237;a jur&#237;dica de la ALITT y sobre la compatibilidad de esta con la 
Declaraci&#243;n de Defensores de Derechos Humanos y con el derecho a la libertad de asociaci&#243;n. 
 
 
34. Tanto la IGJ como la C&#225;mara de Apelaci&#243;n sostuvieron que el Estado no comparte 1os 
objetivos de la ALITT ya que no 1os considera incluidos en el concepto de bien com&#250;n que 
exige el C&#243;digo Civil para otorgar dicha autorizaci&#243;n. Este C&#243;digo estipula en el articulo 33 que 
tienen car&#225;cter de personas jur&#237;dicas privadas: &quot;I. Las asociaciones y les fundaciones que tengan 
por principal objeto el bien com&#250;n, posean patrimonio propio, sean capaces par sus estatutos de 
adquirir bienes, no subsistan exclusivamente de asignaciones del Estado, y obtengan autorizaci&#243;n 
para funcionar&#8221;. 
 
35. La autorizaci&#243;n a que hace referencia esta norma es la que otorga la Inspecci&#243;n General de 
Justicia conforme al Art. 10, inc. <i>a</i> de la Ley N.&#186; 22315, quien deber&#225; determinar si el objeto 
estatutario de la asociaci&#243;n propende al 'bien com&#250;n'. En virtud de la 'supuesta' falta de este 
requisito, la autoridad administrativa y la justicia le han denegado la autorizaci&#243;n para funcionar 
a la ALITT. 
 
36. El principal argumento que los &#243;rganos jurisdiccionales vertieron al denegar la personer&#237;a 
jur&#237;dica consisti&#243; en entender que en la interpretaci&#243;n de la acepci&#243;n 'bien com&#250;n&quot; no es 
suficiente que el objeto de la asociaci&#243;n sea l&#237;cito sino que tambi&#233;n debe ser socialmente &#250;til. El 
fin &#250;til de la asociaci&#243;n no debe serlo s&#243;lo para sus integrantes sino que debe alcanzar a la 
comunidad toda. Al respecto, la IGJ y la C&#225;mara expresaron que no comprenden cu&#225;l es el bien 
com&#250;n para toda la sociedad que se sigue de aceptar a 1as personas travest&#237;s o transexuales como </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 10 
 
iguales, miembros de la misma comunidad humana; tan s&#243;lo observ&#243; un beneficio particular para 
1os integrantes del grupo conformado por 1as personas que detentan esa condici&#243;n. 
 
37. En este sentido, ambas instancias reprodujeron 1os argumentos dados en su momento por 
la Corte Suprema en el caso de la Comunidad Homosexual Argentina (CHA) (12/7/90, ED 138-
788). En este caso, la mayor&#237;a sostuvo que bien com&#250;n &quot;supone en primer lugar bienes que como 
tales satisfacen necesidades del hombre, perfeccion&#225;ndolo y al mismo tiempo que son comunes, 
o sea susceptibles de ser obtenidos y participados por todos en forma solidaria. En este sentido 
bien com&#250;n se contrapone a bien individual y aunque la idea es aplicable en forma an&#225;loga a 
todo bien com&#250;n, remite principalmente al bien com&#250;n general&quot;. 
 
38. En consonancia con la posici&#243;n adoptada por 1os jueces disidentes del caso <i>CHA</i> y la 
recurrente, esta Secretar&#237;a entiende por 'bien com&#250;n&#8217; todo aquello que haga posible que toda 
persona desarrolle plenamente sus potencialidades tendiendo al logro de su propia perfecci&#243;n. 
As&#237;, el 'bien com&#250;n' consiste en la articulaci&#243;n y el equilibrio de 1os distintos intereses que la 
sociedad de hoy alberga, entre los que se incluye el reconocimiento de las diversidades que 
existen, y su armonizaci&#243;n, en tanto y en cuanto tengan un objeto considerado como l&#237;cito y que 
no interfiera con la libertad y la diversidad de terceros. 
 
39. Cabe se&#241;alar que &#233;sta no es otra que la doctrina sentada por la Corte Interamericana de 
Derechos Humanos en la Opini&#243;n Consultiva N.&#186; 5/86 (&quot;La colegiaci&#243;n obligatoria de 
periodistas&quot;, Serie A, N.&#186; 5, p&#225;rrs. 66 y 67) &#8212;tema sobre el que volvi&#243; a referirse en el mismo 
sentido en la Opini&#243;n Consultiva N.&#186; 6/86&#8212; cuando tuvo oportunidad de definir el contenido de 
la expresi&#243;n 'bien com&#250;n'. Esta Corte sostuvo que dentro del contexto de la Convenci&#243;n es 
posible entender el 'bien com&#250;n &quot;como un concepto referente a las condiciones de la vida social 
que permiten a 1os integrantes de la sociedad alcanzar el mayor grado de desarrollo personal y la 
mayor vigencia de los valores democr&#225;ticos. En tal sentido, puede considerarse como un 
imperativo del bien com&#250;n y la organizaci&#243;n de la vida social en forma que se fortalezca el 
funcionamiento de las instituciones democr&#225;ticas y se preserve y promueva la plena realizaci&#243;n 
de los derechos de la persona humana.&#8221; 
 
40. Asimismo, cabe recordar que en la reforma constitucional del a&#241;o 1994, los constituyentes 
incluyeron como parte integrante del bloque de constitucionalidad a los principales instrumentos 
internacionales de derechos humanos, entre ellos, la Convenci&#243;n Americana sobre Derechos 
Humanos que contiene un articulo que hace referencia espec&#237;ficamente a1 'bien com&#250;n' al 
establecer que &quot;Los derechos de cada persona est&#225;n limitados por los derechos de los dem&#225;s, por 
la seguridad de todos y por las justas exigencias del bien com&#250;n, en una sociedad democr&#225;tica&quot; 
(art&#237;culo 32, inc. 2). Dada la expresa referencia al tema del bien com&#250;n en el texto de la 
Convenci&#243;n que, huelga decir, es ahora parte integrante de la Constituci&#243;n Nacional, deber&#237;a 
recurrirse al &#250;ltimo interprete de la misma en busca de alguna pista orientadora sobre la cuesti&#243;n. 
 
41. Conforme a lo expuesto, entendido el 'bien com&#250;n' como las condiciones de la vida social 
que permiten a los integrantes de la sociedad alcanzar el mayor grado de desarrollo personal y la 
mayor vigencia de los valores democr&#225;ticos, cabe concluir que el otorgamiento estatal de la 
personer&#237;a jur&#237;dica a una asociaci&#243;n que tiene entre los prop&#243;sitos de su estatuto los de luchar 
para que el Estado y la sociedad acepten el travestismo como una identidad propia a fin de 
fomentar pr&#225;cticas ciudadanas m&#225;s democr&#225;ticas e inclusivas que  tiendan a la eliminaci&#243;n de la 
discriminaci&#243;n de la que fueron objeto hist&#243;ricamente en virtud de su orientaci&#243;n sexual y </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 11 
</p>
<p> 
apariencia f&#237;sica, generar espacios de reflexi&#243;n, educaci&#243;n e investigaci&#243;n tendientes a la 
difusi&#243;n de la cultura democr&#225;tica antidiscriminatoria en la que su identidad se encuentre libre de 
apreciaciones negativas y consecuentemente no sea estigmatizada y condenada a la exclusi&#243;n y 
contribuir a la eliminaci&#243;n de los estereotipos que vinculan el travestismo a la violencia y a la 
prostituci&#243;n como &#250;nica alternativa de vida, se ci&#241;e perfectamente a dicha manera de interpretar 
bien com&#250;n. 
 
42. M&#225;s aun, el mismo concepto de 'bien com&#250;n' p&#250;blico exige que el Estado apoye, promueva 
y facilite la creaci&#243;n de asociaciones que tienen como objetivo fundamental luchar por la no 
discriminaci&#243;n de grupos de ciudadanos hist&#243;ricamente excluidos de la arena social, pol&#237;tica y 
econ&#243;mica, como es el caso de las minor&#237;as sexuales, en este caso m&#225;s espec&#237;ficamente, travest&#237;s 
y transexuales. 
 
43. Respecto del derecho a la libertad de asociaci&#243;n, cabe enfatizar que los beneficios que se 
siguen del hecho de que el Estado argentino reconozca la persona jur&#237;dica a un grupo de 
personas, sirven para promover y facilitar el ejercicio de tan importante derecho reconocido en el 
plexo constitucional. Concretamente, dichos beneficios se refieren a que la asociaci&#243;n tenga 
capacidad para adquirir bienes a cualquier t&#237;tulo, esto es, por herencia, donaciones o legados 
(C&#243;digo Civil, arts. 1806, 3734 y 3735). Por otro lado, la personalidad jur&#237;dica que el PEN 
acuerda tambi&#233;n autoriza a los integrantes de una asociaci&#243;n a no responder por las deudas de 
&#233;sta, cosa que no sucede en una simple asociaci&#243;n donde los asociados responden por dichas 
deudas de manera subsidiaria y accesoria (<i>cf</i>. C&#243;digo Civil, art. 46 <i>in fine</i> y art. 1747). 
 
44. Por consiguiente, teniendo en cuenta las distintas formas asociativas que establece el 
C&#243;digo y c&#243;mo var&#237;a en cada una el r&#233;gimen de responsabilidad patrimonial, el menoscabo m&#225;s 
importante que implica para un grupo de personas que el Estado no les reconozca la personer&#237;a 
jur&#237;dica, es la referida al r&#233;gimen de responsabilidad patrimonial. 
 
45. De aqu&#237; podr&#237;a interferirse el avasallamiento al derecho de asociaci&#243;n reconocido en la 
Constituci&#243;n Argentina (art. 14) y en los instrumentos internacionales de derechos humanos que 
gozan de jerarqu&#237;a constitucional. Sin embargo, m&#225;s all&#225; de la viabilidad o no de este argumento, 
corresponde poner de manifiesto la violaci&#243;n al principio de igualdad y no discriminaci&#243;n que 
genera el no otorgamiento de la personalidad jur&#237;dica a una asociaci&#243;n que tiene como objeto 
luchar por la eliminaci&#243;n de la discriminaci&#243;n por sexo y orientaci&#243;n sexual en la sociedad. 
 
46. Finalmente, en principio, las decisiones denegatorias de la autorizaci&#243;n para funcionar 
como persona jur&#237;dica no pareciera ser incompatible con la Declaraci&#243;n sobre el derecho y el 
deber de los individuos, los grupos y las instituciones de promover y proteger los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales universalmente reconocidos, aprobada por la Asamblea 
General en su resoluci&#243;n 53/144, de 9 de diciembre de 1998. 
 
47. Entre sus postulados esta declaraci&#243;n establece en el art&#237;culo 5 que &#8220;A fin de promover y 
proteger los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales, toda persona tiene derecho, 
individual o colectivamente, en el plano nacional e internacional: <i>a</i>) a reunirse o manifestarse 
pac&#237;ficamente; <i>b</i>) A formar organizaciones, asociaciones o grupos no gubernamentales, y a 
afiliarse a ellos o a participar en ellos, <i>c</i>) A comunicarse con las organizaciones no 
gubernamentales e intergubernamentales&#8221;.

48. A pesar de no contar con dicha personer&#237;a, la ALITT, conforme al derecho argentino, 
todav&#237;a puede funcionar como una asociaci&#243;n simple. As&#237;, invistiendo car&#225;cter de este tipo de 
asociaci&#243;n, puede ejercer los derechos mencionados en el art&#237;culo 5. El desmedro que sufre la 
ALITT por desconoc&#233;rsele la personalidad jur&#237;dica consiste, por un lado, en que no podr&#225; hacer 
uso de los beneficios patrimoniales mencionados anteriormente. Este tipo de avasallamiento, no 
pareciera estar contemplado entre los enunciados por la Declaraci&#243;n. Por otro lado, y 
fundamentalmente, el no otorgamiento de la personer&#237;a a la ALITT implica la violaci&#243;n al 
principio de no discriminaci&#243;n. 
 
49. En este sentido, cabe dejar en claro que la denegaci&#243;n de personer&#237;a jur&#237;dica en el caso 
pone en juego no tanto la violaci&#243;n al derecho a la libertad de asociaci&#243;n, reuni&#243;n y participaci&#243;n 
como la violaci&#243;n al principio de no discriminaci&#243;n, ya que la raz&#243;n de dicha denegaci&#243;n s&#243;lo 
puede estar fundada en un &#225;nimo discriminador en virtud de la orientaci&#243;n sexual de los 
miembros de la ALITT &#8211;como se dio tambi&#233;n en el caso <i>CHA</i> mencionado.

Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>50. On 14 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government, 
jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, to bring to its attention the information about 
the situation of <b>L.M.R</b>, a woman who was raped by her uncle in her home in La Plata, Buenos 
Aires province, on March 2006. L.M.R. has a mental disability: she is 19 years of age, but has a 
mental age of 8.  
 
51. On 4 July, L.M.R. went to the Hospital San Mart&#237;n de La Plata to voluntarily obtain an 
abortion. Under Argentina&#8217;s Penal Code, abortion is illegal, but penalties for performing an 
abortion are suspended where a mentally disabled woman is pregnant as a result of a rape, and 
where her guardian or legal representative allows the abortion (art. 86). The director of the 
maternity ward was reportedly prepared to perform the abortion, since it fell within the limits of 
domestic law. While this procedure reportedly does not require judicial authorization in these 
circumstances, it is alleged that a judge for the protection of minors (Jueza de Menores) 
intervened and ordered the hospital to sign out L.M.R.   
 
52. According to the information received, on 31 July, the Supreme Court of Buenos Aires 
province authorized the abortion. However, L.M.R. has reportedly not yet received an abortion. 
It is alleged that the Bioethics Committee of the hospital of San Mart&#237;n claims that the procedure 
cannot be carried out beyond 20 weeks, and she is now between 20 and 22 weeks pregnant. 
 
53. According to the information received, there are significant concerns about the physical 
and mental health of L.M.R.   
 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b> 
54. By letter dated 25 September 2006, the Government replied to the communication sent on 
14 August 2006. The Government confirmed that after the intervention of In&#233;s Siro, the judge for 
the protection of minors, and two anomalous legal decisions in lower courts, L.M.R was granted 
legal permission to have an abortion. The Government also confirmed that after the San Mart&#237;n 
Hospital refused to perform the termination because of the late stage of pregnancy, the abortion </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 13 
</p>
<p> 
was performed at a private clinic funded by women&#8217;s organizations. It was also stated that two 
members of Parliament had brought impeachment proceedings against Ms. Siro on account of 
her ultra vires intervention. The Government also explained that regulations for safe and 
voluntary abortions in situations not prohibited under the Penal Code had not been introduced. 
However, the Government stated that the Human Rights Secretariat of the Ministry of Justice 
would strongly recommend that the colleges of magistrates should implement measures to ensure 
that judges are regularly brought up to date on the laws governing abortion. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
55. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Argentina for its responses 
to the Communication sent 16 May 2006 and 13 August 2006. 
 
</p>
<p><b>Bahrain 
 
Allegation letter  
 
</b>56. On 13 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers sent an allegation letter to the Government, concerning 
Z.A., S.F.M., S.A.A.A.L., S.I.H. and S.A. A..  
 
57. According to information received: Z.A. was regularly beaten by her husband, whom she 
married in 1992. In 2004, the couple&#8217;s Filipina domestic worker alleged that the husband had 
repeatedly raped her and she had become pregnant as a result. The Jinai Court eventually 
convicted the husband for adultery, holding that use of force could not be proven, and sentenced 
him to one month of imprisonment. When Z.A. filed for divorce in the Sha&#8217;ria High Court 
(Jaffaria Department), the presiding judge, Naser Al-Asfur, reportedly only granted a divorce 
after she renounced any rights to alimony and signed over property to her husband. An appeal is 
pending in the Court of Appeal. 
</p>
<p> 
58. S.F.M. was married in 1994 at the age of 17 and had three children (now aged 8, 10 and 
12) with her husband. Since 1999, the husband attempted to force her to have sexual relations 
with other men for money. She repeatedly reported this matter to the authorities, but the police 
refused to open a case against her husband, who is a police officer himself. In 2000, S.F.M. 
successfully filed for divorce in the Shari&#8217;a High Court (Sunni Department) and was granted 
custody of her children. In 2003, a friend of the husband allegedly invited her to his house under 
a pretext. After she had entered the house, the husband allegedly arranged that police arrest her 
on charges of adultery. She spent 20 days in pre-trial detention before the charges were dropped. 
During her detention, the husband successfully asked for a provisional court order assigning 
custody over the children to him. The case is still pending in court and the children reside with 
the husband.  
</p>
<p> 
59. S.A.A.A.L. married her husband in 1996, at the age of 15 years, and has an almost 2-year 
old daughter with him. She filed for divorce in the Sha&#8217;ria High Court (Jaffaria Department) in 
2003, because the husband allegedly drank, used marijuana and beat her during her pregnancy. 
The presiding judge reportedly told her that she has to renounce her rights to custody or alimony 
and sign over property to her husband before he could grant a divorce. A court clerk named 
Maky allegedly tried to exhort to have sexual relations with her under the guise of a temporary </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 14 
 
marriage of convenience (Mutaa). In exchange he offered to intervene with the judge on her 
behalf.  
</p>
<p> 
60. S.I.H., a Bahraini national of Egyptian origin, married her husband in 1993 and had two 
children aged 13 and 11 with him. When the husband began to drink and failed to support the 
family, in addition to beating her, she filed for divorce in the Shari&#8217;a High Court (Jaffaria 
Department). The presiding judge reportedly tried to pressure her to renounce her rights to 
custody of her children, before granting a divorce. Initially she was allowed to see her children 
once a week, but this right was rescinded in 2004. The divorce case is still pending in court. 
</p>
<p> 
61. S.A.A. married her husband in 2000 and has a daughter aged 5 with him. She filed for 
divorce in Shari&#8217;a High Court (Jaffaria Department), with Judge Zakaria Al-Sadadi presiding. 
Custody for the daughter was temporarily assigned to S.A.A., but her husband was granted the 
right to take his daughter with him twice a week. It is alleged that the husband sexually abused 
his daughter on some of these occasions. Following one incident, the head of the Child 
Protection Committee in Bahrain reportedly issued a report providing support for the allegations. 
Notwithstanding this report, the authorities reportedly took a full five days to refer her daughter 
for examination by a medical doctor at the Criminal Directorate, who at this point only found 
some scaring on the daughter&#8217;s thighs. Despite the allegations, the Shari&#8217;a High Court actually 
extended the husband&#8217;s visiting rights to six hours a week. S.A.A.&#8217;s appeal against this decision 
was reportedly rejected on 9 May 2006. 
</p>
<p> 
62. Reportedly, Bahrain does not have a codified family law that stipulates clear and equitable 
norms on divorce or child custody. As a result, judges can decide cases according to their 
personal interpretation of the Shari&#8217;a and their interpretation reportedly often favors men. The 
Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern that a considerable number of women in Bahrain 
could be trapped in violent relationships, because they have to fear having to renounce child 
custody rights or property rights in order to be granted a divorce. 
</p>
<p><b> Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p> 
63. The Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain replied on 21 August 2006 to the letter dated 
16 June 2006 and informed the Special Rapporteur that the<b> </b>legislation of Bahrain guarantees 
women&#8217;s rights in explicit provisions which ensure their enjoyment of all the political, civil, 
social, economic and cultural rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 
Constitution of the Kingdom furthermore recognizes a series of rights and obligations which 
guarantee women the attainment of their rights in society, particularly the right to equal human 
dignity and equality before the law, which is guaranteed under article 18 of Constitution in the 
framework of a system of government based on the separation of powers and the complete 
independence of the judiciary.  Women are also entitled to a fair and impartial hearing, in 
accordance with the rules of law and justice, and to receive legal aid, if they cannot afford to pay 
for legal representation. 
 
64. In addition, the Kingdom of Bahrain has ratified a number of international human rights 
treaties, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW), to which the Kingdom acceded in 2002 and which is an integral part of its 
domestic legislation. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 15 
</p>
<p> 
65. The Kingdom of Bahrain, convinced of the need to establish a specialized, high-level 
institution to deal with women&#8217;s issues, established the Supreme Council for Women in 2001 to 
act as a mechanism for the advancement of women in all domains.  Since its inception, the 
Council has conducted studies on the status of women and has endeavoured to promote and 
protect women&#8217;s rights.  It drew up a national strategy for the advancement of women, in 
cooperation with all governmental and civil institutions, in order to support women, inform them 
of their rights, protect them, provide them with practical and vocational training, and empower 
them in every domain. 
 
66. The Government noted that all the allegations contained in the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letter 
actually refer to a series of cases before the Bahraini courts. All the defendants were the 
husbands of the complainants. The facts enumerated in the letter do not reflect the course of the 
actual proceedings. 
</p>
<p> 
67. However, the competent authorities in the Kingdom, i.e. the Ministry of Justice and the 
Department of Public Prosecutions, received a copy of the allegations for use as background to 
the cases and so that a decision can be taken on them by the competent authority, particularly the 
allegations relating to the situation of representatives of the judiciary.  Another copy was sent to 
the Supreme Council for Women as the agency responsible for women&#8217;s issues in the Kingdom. 
In any case, the latest developments in the cases referred to in the letter are outlined here below. 
</p>
<p> 
68. With regard to S.F.M., her lawyer in the case is called Abd al-Rahman al-Khurshim; the 
defendant (the husband) is called A.a.A.G.A. All the information contained in the letter is 
correct, except for the fact that S.F.M. filed an application for a judicial review, petition No. 
189/2004, and that the hearing was scheduled for 5 September 2006. In the petition, she asked to 
be given back custody of her children after being acquitted on charges of adultery. It follows that 
the case is not closed, because a date has been set for the above-mentioned hearing. 
</p>
<p> 
69. S.A.A.A.L. obtained a divorce by agreement with her former husband, J.I.A.J. The case 
was settled and the court issued the dissolution document on 9 July 2006 based on the agreement 
reached by the two parties. 
</p>
<p> 
70. As for S.I.H., her lawyer in the case was Huda Sa`d Ahmad and the defendant (the 
husband) was A.a.J.A.a.Z. The competent court issued a divorce judgment on 18 January 2006 
and the dissolution document, No. 1775/A.H. 1427, was issued without either party filing a 
petition for leave to appeal. 
</p>
<p> 
71. With regard to S.A.A., her lawyer in the case is called M.M. and the defendant (the 
husband) is called Mohammed A.a.S.K.a.S.  The case file contains a series of annexed 
documents, referring to several complaints which the wife lodged with the police against her 
husband. The competent court wrote to the police asking them to send the relevant 
documentation in order to verify the wife&#8217;s allegations and take a decision in the case. The fact 
that the husband had no prior criminal convictions was documented in the case file. The highest 
Shariah court set a date of 6 September 2006 for the hearing and notified both parties. It is worth 
mentioning that the reason for the delay in hearing the case is that the two parties usually had 
reach an agreement on numerous subjects and then went back on their decision. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 16 
 
72. The Government concluded that the cases forming the subject of this correspondence are 
individual cases which have received a fair and impartial hearing by the judicial authorities in the 
Kingdom.  A copy of the allegations contained in the letter was received by the competent 
authorities and will serve as background to the cases. The competent authorities will take a 
decision on the allegations of concern to them, particularly those relating to the situation of 
judicial representatives. 
</p>
<p> 
73. These cases are governed by the relevant laws and provisions of the Shariah, which does 
not discriminate between the rights of men and women, as indicated in the introduction to this 
reply.  Moreover, the Bahraini judiciary enjoys complete independence as one of the three 
powers of the State and in accordance with the principle of multiple centres of power which 
the Kingdom has embraced. 
</p>
<p> 
74. With regard to the subject of family law, the legislature is the body with competence for 
this matter.  It has been examining this question for some time now with a view to guaranteeing 
the rights of everyone in the Kingdom. 
<b> 
Urgent appeal 
</b> 
75. On 21 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
of Bahrain to bring its attention to the information received regarding E.Y.O., a 32-year old 
woman of Eritrean nationality.  
 
76. According to information received,. E. Y. O. was working in Bahrain as a migrant 
domestic worker. Allegedly, the son of her employer repeatedly raped and beat her and the 
family employing her restricted her freedom of movement, did not pay her and took away her 
passport. She finally managed to run away on 7 November 2006. She managed to temporarily 
find lodging with a friend who then asked her to leave since she had no legal papers. He called 
the police who took her to a women&#8217;s detention centre in ISA Town. It is reported that the 
authorities in Bahrain did not take any steps against the son of the family she worked for. E. Y. 
O. has expressed fear that she may be deported to Eritrea and face persecution there.   
</p>
<p> 
77. Concern is expressed about the safety of O. and about the alleged lack of assistance 
provided to O., who could be a trafficking victim.  <b> 
 
Response from the Government to an allegation letter sent in 2005 
</b> 
78. On 11 October 2005, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
alleged mistreatment of A.B.J., a migrant domestic worker from Indonesia working in Bahrain. 
The full details of the allegations submitted have been reflected in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
previous report on communications sent and received (E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.1). 
 
79. By letter dated 13 December 2005,4 the Government responded.  The Government stressed 
the importance it attaches to human rights for citizens and migrants alike and highlighted various 
                                                 
4 The translation from Arabic became only available after the previous report on communications sent and 
received was finalized and the response is therefore reflected in this report. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
international treaties ratified by Bahrain as well as a number of legal provisions, including the 
Labour Code, to protect the rights of migrants. The Government specified that domestic workers 
and persons of like status are not covered by the Labour Code, because of the special nature of 
their work.  They are subject rather to the terms of the Civil Code.   
 
80. The Government also informed that, in 2006, a total of 2,206 labour disputes were referred 
to the Labour Complaints and Disputes Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.  
A total of 1,458 complaints were received from Bahraini workers, of which 722 were resolved 
and 736 were referred to labour tribunals.  As for complaints from non-Bahrainis, a total of 748 
were received, of which 245 were settled amicably and 503 were referred to labour courts.  
These figures refer to complaints from men and women.  In 2002, the Ministry registered 2,269 
disputes, of which 1,389 were made by Bahraini workers.  A total of 790 were settled and 599 
were referred to the courts.  A total of 880 complaints were received from foreign workers; 293 
disputes were resolved amicably and 587 were referred to the courts.  In May 2003, 908 disputes 
were registered; 506 of them were complaints from Bahraini workers.  A total of 257 were 
settled by the Ministry and 249 were referred to labour courts.  There were 402 labour 
complaints from foreign workers during the same period; 123 were settled by the Ministry and 
279 were referred to the courts. 
 
81. Regarding the specific case raised by the Special Rapporteurs, the Government noted that 
A.B.J., an Indonesian domestic worker, was recruited by a manpower agency approximately one 
year prior to the response to work in the Kingdom of Bahrain under the terms and conditions 
applicable at the time.  She was legally sponsored by a national of the Kingdom (a Bahraini) and 
was set to work for the sponsor&#8217;s mother (an Egyptian). 
 
82. Later, she submitted a complaint through the official channels (a police station), saying that 
she had not been paid, that she had been harassed by her employers and had sustained numerous 
physical injuries, including a fractured forearm.  She provided medical reports to support her 
claim. The competent authorities subsequently launched an investigation and liaised with the 
Indonesian Embassy in the Kingdom on the follow-up to the case. The Department of Public 
Prosecutions investigated the circumstances of the case in accordance with the normal 
procedures.  It then took the accused person into preventive custody.   
 
83. The sponsor&#8217;s mother (an Egyptian national) was charged with assault and inflicting 
multiple physical injuries.  She was also charged with assault causing an illness lasting over 20 
days (articles 302 bis and 339, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code). A session was held on 10 
December 2006 before the court with competence for the case (the Criminal Court). 
 
84. The Government concluded that the case is governed by the relevant laws and legislative 
provisions, which, as stated in the introduction to this reply, do not distinguish between the rights 
of citizens and migrants and guarantee just punishment of offenders who are found guilty of 
wrongdoing.  The Bahraini courts are completely independent, as one of the three powers of 
State and in accordance with the principle of pluralism embraced by the Kingdom. 
<b> 
Observations 
 
</b>85. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to her 
communication of 13 June 2006 containing information on four of the five cases raised. She </p>

appreciates his Excellency&#8217;s cooperation in this regard and welcomes the information that the 
allegation letter sent to her was forwarded to the competent authorities and that it will serve as 
background to the competent authorities which will take a decision on the allegations of concern 
to them, particularly those relating to the situation of judicial representatives. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to be informed about any further developments in these cases. She would 
also like to thank the Government for replying to her communication dated 19 September 2006. 
 
86. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a response with regard to the urgent appeal

Allegation letter 
 
 
</b>87. On 21 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning the gang-rape of 15-year old K.R.S. in Khidirpur Union-Basaudia-Lohajang within 
the Munshiganj District. <b> 
 
</b>88. According to those allegations, on 1 November 2005, K.R.S. (second daughter of R.S. and 
L.R.S.), was gang-raped when she was walking home from school in Khidirpur Union-Basaudia-
Lohajang within the Munshiganj District. After reporting the incident and indicating the names 
of the perpetrators to the police, she was arrested and imprisoned until 11 November 2005 
without being provided with the reasons of her detention. After the rape, several members of the 
girl&#8217;s community questioned one of the alleged perpetrators, who reportedly named all the other 
perpetrators, and recorded what was said. The recorded tape was then given to the police. It is 
reported that the police did not take the information on the tape into consideration in their 
investigations. One person was being prosecuted. <b> 
 
Allegation letter 
 
</b>89. On 20 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning K.B.S., a 30-year old woman from a minority community living in Hogolpota 
village, Bagerhat district. <b> 
 
</b>90. According to information received: On 30 October 2005, K.B.S. and her husband were on 
their way home, when six men allegedly blocked their way, tied the husband to a tree and then 
forced her into a field where she was allegedly gang-raped. <b> 
</b> 
91. The victim sustained serious injuries to her genitalia. The victim filed a case under the 
Women and Child Repression Prevention (Revised) Act of 2003 at Sharankhola police station. 
Since then, the police has completed its investigations and submitted a charge sheet to the court, 
which only names two of the six alleged perpetrators: K.M., son of H.M., from Rajapur village 
and A.A., son of B.H., from Dakkhin Badhal village. <b> 
</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
92. The remaining four alleged perpetrators were not charged and concern is expressed that 
this is related to their political connections. A.R. from Sharankhola, allegedly the primary 
perpetrator, is a member of the Dhansahor union council unit of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party 
(BNP). W.H., M.B., and A.N.I. (all from Sharankhola) hold the respective functions of president, 
general secretary and organizing secretary of the BNP Dhansahor union council unit. Sources 
also allege that the four men have repeatedly threatened the victim and successfully intimidated 
witnesses to withdraw their testimony against them. <b> 
 
Urgent appeal 
 
</b>93. On 20 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government to bring its attention to the following information: <b> 
</b> 
94. Since mid 2005, there has been an ongoing conflict between the Bengali settlers and the 
Marma indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the Southeastern part of Bangladesh. 
According to the information received, Bengali settlers have, with the support of the army, 
illegally and forcibly occupied titled indigenous peoples land. On 5 March 2006 Bengali settlers, 
with the support of the military, occupied land belonging to the Shishughar Buddhist Orphanage. 
On 3 April Bengali settlers, led by M., N.G.G. from Maischari, attacked the Marma indigenous 
peoples in the villages of Sa Prue Para, Joy Sen Para, Sapru Karbabipara and Nuapara. The 
attacks left more than 30 casualties.  
 
95. It is reported that when the Marma women opposed the incident, Bengali settlers ill-treated 
four Marma women including T.M., T.C.M., 18 years, and her mother P.M., 42 years. The 
incident was witnessed by Venerable S.M. who was consequently beaten to silence. It was 
reported that the Bengali settlers named A.M., B.I., K., S.A., A. and nine unknown settlers also 
raped T.C.M. and her cousin K.M., 18 years. When T.C.M. and her cousin K.M. were rescued, 
they were unconscious.  
 
96. Furthermore, Bengali settlers allegedly gang-raped T.M., aged 16, and A.K.M., aged 20, at 
Sa Prue Karbari. The four raped girls are hospitalized at the Khagrachari Sadar Hospital. 
Furthermore, it is also alleged that 13 of the indigenous wounded in the said attacks were 
hospitalized in the Khagrachari Sadar Hospital, and 3 seriously wounded in the Chittagong 
Medical College Hospital. Among the wounded indigenous people are: 1) T.M.C. (30) from Nua 
Para; 2) J.M. (35) from Do; 3) S.P.M., from Sa Prue Karbari Para; 4) M. M. (30) from Sa Prue 
Para; 5) An unknown women;6) K.M. (20), from Chaihla Prue Marma; 7) M.P.M. (50) from Sa 
Prue Para; 8) M.M. (26) from Chkara Karbari Para; 9) S.P.M. (65) from Joy Sen Para; 10) 
T.A.M. (Zunal Magh) (45) from Nua Para; 11) M.M. (40) from Sa Prue Para; 12) P.M. (42) from 
Sa Prue Para; 13) K.J.M. (18) from Sa Prue Para; 14) A.P.M. (40) from Joy Sen Para; and 15) 
M.M. (70) from Maischari. Some of the wounded indigenous people are in army custody, 
including: 1) R.M. (30 and 2) M.T.M. (30), both from Maischari. Furthermore, one Buddhist 
monk is still missing and the house of M.M. (65) in Sa Prue Karbari Para was destroyed and 
looted in the attacks.

<b>Urgent appeal

97. On 31 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding A.R., a lawyer, his wife S.S.S. and his legal assistant 
N.A.A.  
 
98. According to the information received: On 12 March 2006, S.S.S. was taken into custody 
and beaten by the police in Dhaka. She was pregnant at that time, but has since lost her child. 
She filed a complaint together with her husband against the police officers. Since then, she and 
her husband are receiving threats. In particular, on 24 May 2006, A.R. was stopped by a group of 
armed and unidentified persons. The attackers held a pistol to his chest, questioned him about his 
identity and threatened to shoot him. That same morning, while A.R, N.A., went to collect 
documents from the record office regarding S.S.S&#8217;s court case, three persons confronted him and 
inquired if he worked for A.R. and where they could find him. The men followed him for the rest 
of the day trying to prevent him from obtaining the documents he required from the record 
office. On 23 May 2006, an unidentified person called A.R. and warned him against pursuing 
legal proceedings against the police. The caller said if he did not do this, he and his family would 
pay the ultimate cost.  
 
<b>Follow-up allegation letter 
</b> 
99. On 21 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an 
allegation letter to the Government concerning S.S.S.  
 
100. According to information received: On 12 March 2006, several opposition political parties 
held a demonstration which moved in the direction of the Election Commission Office. On the 
way, at Mirpur Road, in between Manik Mian Avenue and Road 27 in Dhanmondi Residential 
Area, the police erected a barricade to block the protesters.  
 
101. S.S.S. was in this vicinity at the time as she was going to collect her son from a school that 
is located in the area. At approximately 12.30 pm, a group of demonstrators, belonging to an 
opposition political party, passed by school. The police fired tear gas and water canons at the 
demonstrators and beat them with sticks, canes and iron rods. S.S.S., who had been waiting in 
front of the school, took shelter inside a private hospital opposite the school. Police forcibly 
removed her from the clinic and placed her with the arrested demonstrators. S.S.S. told the police 
that she was pregnant and a diabetic patient. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (West Zone), 
K.M., reportedly accused her of lying. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Zone), M.H., 
and the Deputy Commissioner K.M. allegedly ordered their subordinates to break S.S.S.&#8217;s hands 
and legs. Male police officers placed their hands on S.S.S.&#8217;s lower abdomen to check whether 
she was pregnant. They tied a rope around her abdomen and forcefully pulled on both ends of the 
rope. Thereafter they forced her into a prison van. Inside the van, policemen walked on her body 
and kicked her genitalia as well as her lower abdomen. After S.S.S. fainted she was discarded on 
the street. Santa suffered severe injuries to her thighs, lower abdomen, back, waist, hip and other 
areas of her body. She also suffered two fractures, one in her right elbow and the other in the 
small finger on her right hand. </p>

</p>
<p> 
 
102. S.S.S. lodged a complaint against the alleged perpetrators at Mohammadpur police station 
but the police refused to record the case. On 14 March 2006, she filed a case (CR Case No. 
312/06) with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate&#8217;s Court in Dhaka against Deputy Commissioner 
M.H., Deputy Commissioner K.M., police constable R.A., and a number of other police officers 
under the Penal Code. On March 19, S.S.S. filed a second case (No. 23/06) against the alleged 
perpetrators under sections 10/30 of the Women and Child Repression Prevention (Special 
Provision) (Amended) Act 2003. According to the latest information received, neither case has 
led to a conviction of any of the alleged perpetrators. Over recent months, unknown perpetrators 
have on several occasions threatened S.S.S. and her husband A.R., who is also her lawyer, with 
death if they continue to pursue criminal action against the alleged perpetrators.  
 
<b>Allegation letter 
</b> 
103. On 17 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning M.K., a 14-year old 
girl, and her brother R.I., both residing in Uttar Chandani Mahal, Dighalia police station section, 
Khulna district.  
 
104. According to allegations received, on 23 July 2006, at around 1.30 p.m. Assistant Sub 
Inspector M.I., who is the second-in-command of the Senhato police outpost under the Dighalia 
police station in Khulna district, and Police Constable (No. 1632) S.M. arrived at M.K.&#8217;s home. 
Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. entered M.K.&#8217;s room and attempted to rape her. She managed to 
resist until her brother R.I. and various other family members arrived to help her. In response, the 
policemen beat M.K. and hit R.I. with a bamboo stick, a rifle butt and a chain, before they 
arrested him and took him to Senhati police outpost. A.H., commanding officer of the Senhati 
police camp, and Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. then demanded 10,000 Taka from R.I.&#8217;s family. 
They threatened that R.I. might be &#8220;killed in crossfire&#8221; if the family failed to pay the money.  
When the family only managed to raise 5,000 Taka, policemen beat R.I. with a stick and a rifle 
butt causing fractures of his left hand and right leg. They also poured hot water in his nose. He 
can no longer walk properly or work to support his family.  
 
105. On 24 July 2006, the police lodged a criminal case against R.I. and other relatives that 
protected M.K. from the attempted rape. On 25 July 2006, the local Magistrate&#8217;s Court issued a 
pre-trial detention order against Rafiqul Islam despite his critical medical condition. On 24 
October 2006, R.I. was released against bail. The charges against him are pending. M.K. told the 
public about the events in a press conference held at the Khulna Press Club on 28 July 2006. On 
30 July 2006, she also lodged a criminal case against Assistant Sub Inspector M. I. and Police 
Constable S.M. (No. 340/2006) with the Magistrate Court in Khulna under the Women and 
Children Repression Prevention (Special Provision) Amendment Act 2003.  
 
106. On 23 September 2006, A.S., a member of Ward 4 of the Senhati Union Council, told M.K 
to withdraw the case. A. S. also threatened her and her family with &#8220;Remember, the police 
lodged a case against you, in which your brother is detained in Khulna jail. If you don&#8217;t 
withdraw the case against the police, you will be in trouble. Fighting against the police is very 
difficult!&quot; He further suggested that the family come to a &quot;solution&quot; without fighting against the 
police. Since then, A.S. and Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. have reportedly repeatedly attempted to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 22 
 
intimidate M.K. by threatening to ensure that her brother would be convicted on trumped-up 
charges.  
 
107. The Special Tribunal of Women and Children Repression Prevention, which has 
jurisdiction over the criminal case against Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. has so far not taken any 
substantive action. In a court hearing that took place on 28 September 2006, Judge B.H. 
reportedly refused to consider the merits of the case and rescheduled the case to 30 November 
2006.  
<b> 
Follow-up urgent appeal  
</b> 
108. On 22 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur has sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding the case of M.K., a 14-year old girl, and her brother R.I., both residing in Uttar 
Chandani Mahal, Dighalia police station section, Khulna district. In a joint letter, dated 
17 November 2006, receipt of which the Government have kindly acknowledged by letter dated 
22 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur informed the Government that, on 23 July 2006, 
Assistant Sub Inspector Mr. M.I., allegedly tried to rape M.K., who resisted until her brother R.I. 
and other family members came to her assistance. M.K. and R.I. were subsequently allegedly 
subjected to threats, and R.I. was reportedly arrested and tortured by police before being released 
on bail on 24 October 2006.  
 
109. According the latest allegations received, the police authority assigned a female police 
officer, R.B., Assistant Superintendent of Police of Khulna, to conduct an investigation into the 
alleged attempted rape of M.K. In an investigation interview, held at Khulna Police Office on 12 
November 2006, R.B. reportedly intimidated and rebuked M.K., her mother R.K.N. and her 
brother R.I., for filing charges against Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. She reportedly did not 
explore the facts of the case. There are concerns that R.B. may receive instructions from 
Assistant Sub Inspector M.I.  The Special Tribunal on the Repression of Women and Children 
assigned M.I., a former Superintendent of Police in Khulan, to investigate the alleged rape. 
However, there are concerns that M.I. is failing to carry out an independent investigation.  
 
110. On 30 November 2006, M.K.&#8217;s lawyer, M.Y.S., submitted a petition to the Court, noting 
the continuous failure of the police and the former Superintendent of Police in Khulan, M.I., to 
investigate the case with due diligence. The judge, who responded to the petition, ordered a 
judicial probe. However, no magistrate has been assigned to investigate the case.  
 
111. On 7 December 2006, at about 2 a.m. Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. along with 15 to 20 
unidentified policemen raided the house of M.K. and R.I. and attempted to arrest R.I. The police 
also raided the houses of R.B., A.B. and A.B., who were witnesses in the case of attempted rape 
lodged by M.K. All of the said persons allegedly face charges for assaulting police, when they 
intervened to prevent the attempted rape. 
 
112. On 10 December 2006, at about 1 a.m. Assistant Sub Inspector M.I. raided the houses of 
M.K. and R.K. and tried to arrest them again. He also attempted to arrest H.S., a grocer in the 
village and maternal uncle of M.K., whose wife is one of the witnesses in the attempted rape 
case. All the witnesses are currently hiding in order to avoid being arrested.

<p> 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
113. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Bangladesh, while formally 
acknowledging receipt of each communication sent, did not reply to the substantive concerns 
raised in any of her communications in 2006.  
 
114. Pending these replies and without making any determination on the facts of the cases 
transmitted, the Special Rapporteur deems it appropriate to address the following observations: 
 
115. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to exercise due diligence in the 
investigation, prosecution and punishment of all individuals who allegedly took part in the 
reported violations, both at the decision and implementation level, and to keep her informed of 
any such developments. 
 
116. In this regard the Special Rapporteur would like to recall some of the findings and 
recommendations made by the previous Special Rapporteur, following her visit to Bangladesh, 
Nepal and India in 2001. In her report (E/CN.4/2001/73/Add.2), Ms. Coomaraswamy 
highlighted that corruption in the police seems a significant problem in Bangladesh, and 
recommended that there should be a clear direction from the top of the police hierarchy that such 
behavior will not be tolerated and police officers who engage in such activity should face severe 
consequences. Furthermore the report stressed (para.163) that there should be seminars and 
workshops with judges in the region to increase their awareness on issues relating to violence 
against women. In paragraph 165 it was stated that witness protection schemes should be set up 
for women victims. 
 
117. The reported cases suggest that these recommendations have not been implemented and the 
Special Rapporteur urges on the Government to address as a matter of priority existing patterns 
of corruption and impunity that appear to exacerbate violence against women in Bangladesh.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bulgaria 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation Letter </b> 
</p>
<p>118. On 25 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography and Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, have sent an allegation letter to the Government to 
bring its attention to the information concerning the trafficking of newborn infants from Bulgaria 
to Greece. 
</p>
<p> 
119. According to the information received, it is alleged that pregnant women, most of them 
from the Roma community in the region of Burgas in eastern Bulgaria, and many of them 
unemployed and living in harsh conditions, are induced by members of organized crime to come 
to work to Greece, being promised employment and good salaries. It is reported that instead, 
these pregnant women end up in small cities throughout Greece, where they are held together in 
apartments for the remainder of their pregnancy, before delivering at local hospitals, where, with 
the complicity of doctors, midwives and other hospital staff, their newborn babies are taken away </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 24 
 
from them and sold by organised crime members with the assistance of lawyers for up to 30,000 
euros.  
 
120. It is alleged that after having given birth in Greece, the women are sent back to their 
hometowns in Bulgaria and receive 1,000 euros per child.  
 
121. Reports also alleged that little progress has been made by Greek and Bulgarian authorities 
in investigating the trafficking and sale of children taking place between the two countries. <b> 
</b> 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>122. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not replied to her communication 
sent on 25 July 2006.<b>  
 
</b>123. The Special Rapporteur would like to urge both the Government of Bulgaria as well as the 
Government of Greece to take necessary steps and address this concern effectively and through 
cooperation. According to article 35 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Bulgaria is 
obliged to take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the 
abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form&quot;. Article 36 of the 
Convention requests States parties to protect children against all other forms of exploitation 
prejudicial to any aspects of children's welfare. 
 
124. The Special Rapporteur welcomes information received from the Greek Government that 
the Hellenic Police Headquarters are already cooperating with their Bulgarian counterpart. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply also from the 
Government of Bulgaria in regard to the allegations submitted. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>China 
Allegation letter 
</b> 
125. On 19 December 2005, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent a letter to the 
Government concerning allegations of trafficking and sexual exploitation of female citizens of 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea  in the Peoples Republic of China, especially in Jilin 
Province.  </p>
<p> 
126. According to information received there are at least 50,000 Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea citizens who only have irregular visa status in the Korean Autonomous Prefecture of 
Yanbian (Jilin Province), which borders the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and is home 
to about one million Chinese citizens of Korean ethnicity. While a considerable number 
clandestinely crossed the international border into China to escape persecution many others fled 
the poor socio-economic situation.  
</p>
<p> 
127. About half of those who cross the border are women. After arriving in China, many are 
trafficked and forced to marry or become the concubines of Chinese men. Human traffickers 
systematically target the women, who are usually hungry and desperate, by approaching them in 
the border region and promising them food, shelter, employment and protection. Once the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 25 
</p>
<p> 
traffickers have gained the women&#8217;s confidence, the women are lured to an apartment, confined 
and then sold to local men. The buyers often lock their victims in the house, tie them up or take 
away their clothing to prevent them from escaping. In many cases, the women are also physically 
abused and raped.  
</p>
<p> 
128. Some women from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea are also trafficked into the 
sex industry in Jinlin province and other parts of China. They are forced to prostitute themselves 
in brothels, which are often disguised as karaoke bars. 
</p>
<p> 
129. Women from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea with an irregular visa status are 
extremely vulnerable to trafficking since the Chinese authorities have reportedly been instructed 
to arrest and deport Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea citizens against their will, if they do 
not have a valid residence permit. China reportedly considers these persons to be irregular 
migrants who cross the border only for economic reasons. This deportation policy has been 
adopted despite the fact that Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea citizens face detention 
under cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions, ill-treatment and torture as well as, in extreme 
cases, summary execution in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Human traffickers are 
well aware of this deportation policy and often manage to subdue their victims by threatening to 
report them to the authorities, if they resist.  
</p>
<p> 
<b>Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 26 
 
132. With respect to her detention as alleged in the 5 January 2006 letter, further information 
received indicates that M.H. was detained by seven Residents&#8217; Committee officials in a Shanghai 
hotel from 3-6 January. The officials reportedly beat her several times, grabbed her breasts and 
prevented her from sleeping during this period.  
 
133. Grave concern is expressed that her detention, reported ill-treatment and repeated 
harassment may represent an attempt to prevent her from raising human rights concerns. 
Furthermore, in view of her alleged detention in an unknown location, concern is expressed that 
she might be at risk of torture and ill-treatment, particularly in light of previous allegations of ill-
treatment. 
 
<b>Response from the Government 
 
</b>134. By letter dated 14 June 2006 the Chinese Government replied noting that it has carefully 
examined the matters referred to in the communications and informed that: M.H., female, born 9 
December 1961, ethnic Han Chinese, lower secondary school education, currently unemployed.  
On 10 January 1991, following appraisal by the Ministry of Justice economic research 
assessment office, M.H. was assessed as suffering from a personality disorder, but still having 
civil responsibility and competence to take civil law acts. 
 
135. On 17 January 2006, M.H. and other persons assembled a crowd in a public area in 
Chongwen district in Beijing, thereby disturbing the peace.  Pursuant to the provisions of article 
34 of the regulations on punishments relating to the maintenance of law and order, the Yangpu 
office of the Shanghai public security bureau, acting in accordance with the law, served a 
summons on M.H. for a public order offence, for the period from 7.45 a.m. on 25 January 2006 
to 7.45 a.m. on 26 January.  Upon expiry of this period, no further measures of restraint were 
applied against M.H. and, in the course of this process, all her lawful rights were fully upheld, 
and the allegations that she was subjected to beatings have no foundation in fact. 
 
<b>Allegation Letter 
</b> 
136. On 24 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning the forced repatriation of a female national of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea by the People&#8217;s Republic of China  on 28 February 2006.  
 
137. According to information received: Six years ago, M. H., the woman referred to above, and 
her one-year-old daughter, were sold for 3,000 RMB to a Chinese man, who she was forced to 
marry. The woman became pregnant soon thereafter and gave birth to a second daughter named 
K.Y. It is reported that the mother was arrested by a Chinese police raid squad at 11.30 pm on 25 
February 2006 and handed over to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea security police 
three days later.  
 
138. Concern is expressed that the woman may face harsh punishment since she had already 
been deported on two previous occasions, but managed each time to return to her children in 
China. In this context, we also wish to recall our communication of 19 December 2005, in which 
we expressed our deep concern about the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women from the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 27 
</p>
<p> 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and the cruel and inhuman punishment Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea nationals face in their country, if they are deported by Your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government. The Special Rapporteurs are also concerned about the situation of 
M.H. and her older sister since they are now left alone with their father who reportedly often 
beats them in a drunken state.  
 
139. Reportedly, the deportation case referred to above is not a singular incident. In cities near 
the border, including Y. and L., an intensified information exchange between Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and Chinese authorities on Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
defectors has reportedly lead to an increase in deportations of Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea nationals. Chinese police reportedly receive a salary bonus of 2,000 RMB for every arrest 
of a suspected defector from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
 
140. We appealed to the Government not to deport citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea and to protect them from all forms of trafficking, exploitation and abuse. 
 
<b>Response by the Government 
</b> 
141. By letter dated 14 June 2006, the Government provided me with the following information: 
regarding the communications of 24 March 2006 and also 19 December 2005. 
 
142. Since the letter refers only to a child &#8220;J.Y.&#8221;, born of a mother from the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and a Chinese father, and mentions the time that the mother was 
apprehended and repatriated, but provides no indication of her full name, age, place of entry into 
China, place of residence, border-crossing point where she was repatriated or details of the 
Chinese father, it is very hard for the Chinese authorities to trace her.  According to 
investigations conducted by the Jilin and Liaoning public security authorities, the Chinese 
authorities did not apprehend or repatriate any illegal immigrants from the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea during the last ten days of February 2006 whose description matches that of 
J.Y.&#8217;s mother. 
 
143. The letter [of 19 December 2005] alleges that 50,000 illegal immigrants from the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea have been detained in Jilin in the Yanbian Korean 
Autonomous Prefecture, which is a wild exaggeration.  As a consequence of the improved 
economic situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and the strengthened controls 
exercised over the frontier region by China and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the 
number of Korean illegal immigrants entering China is steadily decreasing.  In accordance with 
the law, the Chinese Government guarantees the lawful rights and interests of foreign citizens 
within its territory.  Regardless whether these people have entered the country in the normal 
fashion or have crossed the frontier illegally, their lawful rights and interests are equally 
protected under Chinese law.  With regard to the issue of the illegal entry into China of citizens 
of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Chinese Government invariably proceeds in 
an appropriate manner, consistent with both domestic and international law and in observance of 
humanitarian principles.  In this process, the Chinese police authorities enforce the law in an 
impartial manner and there are no cases of commissions being paid for the repatriation of 
citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who have illegally entered China and 
have been apprehended.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 28 
 
144. The Chinese Government and the public security authorities always attach great 
importance to safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of women and children, and 
countering any kind of activities which infringe the rights and interests of women and children.  
They are consistently and indefatigably working to crack down with severity on any illegal 
activities involving trafficking in women and children.  Starting this year, as a consequence of 
the increase in contacts between China and foreign countries, offences involving trafficking in 
women and children are now starting to occur in China as well.  The Chinese public security 
authorities take a very serious view of this and have increased their preventive measures, taken 
stronger action to combat such offences, stepped up cooperation with police forces in all the 
other countries involved and cracked down with severity on Chinese and foreign offenders who 
traffic in women and children.  Persons profiting from the abduction and trafficking of women 
and those involved in rape, ill-treatment and unlawful detention of others are charged, in 
accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code, with the offences of abducting and trafficking in 
women and children, rape, inflicting injury, unlawfully detaining others and other associated 
offences.  At the same time, the authorities attach high importance to efforts to protect the rights 
and interests of victims, ensuring that they receive personal care and consideration, and are 
actively assisting foreign women and children who have been rescued from such abusive 
practices, endeavouring to ensure the personal safety and physical and mental health of victims. 
 
<b>Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>&#61472; 
145. On 30 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government of China regarding G.Z., a lawyer and Director of the Shengzhi 
Law Office in Beijing, his wife G.H., their children aged 13 years and 2 years and his 70 year old 
mother-in-law.. G.Z. has represented victims of human rights violations; clients who sought to 
hold the State accountable for corruption and neglect including forced evictions; and represented 
clients involved in cases related to freedom of speech and the press.  He has been the subject of 
three communications sent to the Government, the first sent by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, dated 25 November 2005, a second communication was 
subsequently sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 21 December 2005 and the most recent 
communication dated 22 August 2006 was sent by the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders.

<p> 
bleeding mouth and gums, her fingernail on one hand completely torn off and her leather 
clothing ripped into pieces.  
</p>
<p> 
147. It is further reported that G.Z. and G.H.&#8217;s 13 year old daughter, G., has also been harassed 
by the State Security Police who accompany her at all times, including while she is in school. It 
is reported that they follow her to her classroom, in the school corridors and even to the 
bathroom, which makes her educational environment difficult. Furthermore, on 21 November, it 
is reported that Beijing police showed their badges and attempted to pick up Tianyu, their 2 year 
old son, but his kindergarten teacher refused to comply. It has also been reported that G.H.&#8217;s 70 
year old mother is also tailed by police if she leaves the house. 
</p>

148. On 12 October 2006, G.Z. was formally charged with &#8220;inciting to subvert the State&#8221;.  It is 
reported that on 6 October 2006, G.H.'s birthday, she was allowed to see her husband at the 
Beijing No. 2 Detention Centre where they were watched and interrupted by police officers 
throughout the visit which lasted for approximately 20 minutes. However sources indicate that 
G.Z. has still not had access to his lawyer M.S. despite the recent discovery of his current 
whereabouts, as the authorities have reportedly stated that his case concerns &#8220;State secrets&#8221;.  
Prior to 6 October 2006 he had allegedly been held incommunicado since 15 August 2006 when 
he was arrested without a warrant at his sister&#8217;s house in Dongying City in Shandong Province, 
by more than 20 plainclothes police officers from the Beijing Public Security Bureau. According 
to reports the official Xinhua News Agency released a statement on 18 August 2006 stating that 
G.Z. had been arrested &#8220;on suspicion of breaking the law&#8221; however details of the alleged crime 
he had committed were not provided. 
 
<b>Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>&#61472; 
149. On 21 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding C.G., a 34 year old blind self-
taught human rights lawyer in Linyi, Shandong province, and his wife Y.W., his lawyers L.J. and 
L.F.,  a member of his defense team, T.B., and witnesses to his trial, - C. Gengjiang, C. 
Guangdong, C. Guangyu and C. Guanghe.  
 
150. C. Guangcheng has a long history of campaigning for the rights of farmers and the 
disabled. He assisted villagers in solving drinking water pollution problems when he was 
attending Najing Chinese Medicine University in 2000. He created and ran the &#8220;Rights Defense 
Project for the Disabled&#8221; under the auspices of the Chinese Legal Studies Association between 
2000 and 2001.  Since 1996, he has provided free legal consultation to farmers and the disabled 
in rural areas. In 2004, he ran a &#8220;Citizen Awareness and Law for the Disabled Project&#8221;. In April 
2005, C. Guangcheng and Y.W. began to investigate villagers&#8217; claims that Linyi City authorities 
were employing extensive violence in implementing government birth quotas. The first report 
was published by them on 10 June 2005 through the Citizens Rights Defence Network (gongmin 
weiquan wang) and they brought law suits against officials involved.    
 
151. C. Guangcheng has been the subject of four previous communications to your 
Government, the most recent of which were sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 30 
 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders dated 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 14 July 2006.  Previous communications were also sent on 7 April 2006 by the 
Special Representative on the situation of human rights defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, on 31 October 2005 by 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, and on 19 September 2005 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders.  
 
152. We are also in receipt of your Government&#8217;s replies dated 12 December 2005, 14 June 
2006 and 3 October 2006 (awaiting translation). Your Excellency&#8217;s Government states that &quot;(i)n 
dealing with Chen and his associates, the public security authorities acted in compliance with the 
law, in remanding them in custody or holding them for questioning.  Throughout this period their 
lawful rights were fully protected and there is no substance to the allegation that C.G. was 
subjected to beatings and placed under house arrest.&quot;  While we welcome your Government&#8217;s 
observations, we are afraid that they do not alleviate our concerns with respect to this case, 
particularly so in the light of consistent reports that a number of individuals involved in his trial 
have allegedly been targeted by the security forces including his wife, his lawyers, a member of 
his defense team and witnesses to his trial.

beaten. The three lawyers were then taken to Shuanghou Township Police station where they 
were interrogated until the following morning. They were advised that C. Guangcheng&#8217;s case 
involved &#8220;State secrets&#8221; and were escorted back to Beijing. 
 
162. On 24 October 2005, two other friends of C. Guangcheng from Beijing went to visit him. 
As C. Guangcheng tried to greet them, he was stopped and beaten by around 20 men surrounding 
his house. They beat C. Guangcheng with fists and sticks, knocked him down several times and 
kicked him. C. Guangcheng&#8217;s request to seek medical attention was denied by the men who beat 
him and put his house under surveillance. There were a number of eye witnesses on the scene.  
The visitors were escorted away. 
 
163. C. Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Y. Weijing, had also been prevented from leaving the house. It is 
also reported that was beaten when she left the house to greet visitors on 27 December 2005. 
 
164. On 30 October 2005, C. Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyer filed a lawsuit on his behalf at the People&#8217;s 
Court of Yinan County against two Shuanghou Township officials with intentional injury for 
their involvement in beating him outside his house on 24 October 2005. The two officials are 
alleged to head the group of more than 20 men who watched C. Guangcheng and Y. Weijing&#8217;s 
house. It is reported that to date the court has ignored C. Guangcheng&#8217;s suit.  
 
165. With respect to the &#8216;traffic&#8217; incident about for C. Guangcheng was eventually charged, on 
11 March 2006, C. Guangcheng reportedly marched with other villagers to protest the beating of 
a villager. Several dozen police blocked their way and surrounded them on national highway 
205, thereby causing a traffic disruption. C. Guangcheng was taken by Yinan County police from 
his house to the Yinyan Detention Centre without an arrest warrant.  There he was held 
incommunicado for 89 days until 10 June 2006.  
 
166. According to reports, C. Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers collected written testimonies from village 
witnesses, who were also detained and then released on bail. These villagers were reportedly 
forced to confess or provide incriminating false information against C. Guangcheng. They have 
stated that police used various torture methods at the detention centre in order to elicit 
confessions, such as tying them up to chairs with chains, depriving them of sleep for up to 15 
days and withholding food and water. 
 
167. On 10 June 2006, C. Guangcheng was formally detained on suspicion for &#8220;gathering 
crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. On 21 June 2006, the Yinan 
PSB issued an arrest warrant for C. Guangcheng No. 193 (2006). On the same day, C. 
Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers&#8217;s were allowed to visit him for the first time in three months. However, 
when they asked where he had been detained during those three months, the prison guards 
interrupted their discussion, preventing C. Guangcheng from answering the question.  His family 
has not been allowed to visit. His wife remained under house arrest. 
 
168. On 22 June 2006, one of C. Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, L. Jinsong, was taken into police 
custody for questioning.  On 24 June 2006, two lawyers, Jinsong and Subin tried to visit Y. 
Weijing but were stopped outside their house and beaten by men enforcing the residential 
detention of Y. Weijing.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 33 
</p>
<p> 
169. On 27 June 2006, lawyers L. Jinsong and L. Subin attempted again to see Y. Weijing (to 
seek medical parole for Chen Guangcheng), but were also harassed by persons in the village, 
while the police refused to intervene.  Around 20 men turned over their car (while L. Jonsong 
was still inside) and smashed their cameras. L. Jonsong was then taken to the police station for 
questioning. He resigned as Chief Counsel for Chen Guancheng&#8217;s case. 
 
170. On 18 August 2006, the day before C. Guangcheng&#8217;s trial, his lawyers were detained by 
police. X. Zhiyong who replaced L. Jinsong was allegedly beaten and taken into police custody 
and not released until 22 hours later after C. Guangcheng&#8217;s trial had ended. Similarly, it is 
alleged that L. Jinsong and another lawyer, Z. Lilhui were detained by police the night before the 
trial then released after the trial without charge.   
 
171. On 24 August 2006, the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court convicted C. Guangcheng under 
article 291 of the Chinese Criminal Code (CCC) for &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and 
&#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. CCC article 291 provides that &#8220;[w]here people are gathered 
to disturb order at railway stations or bus terminals, ferry landings, civil airports, market places, 
parks, theatres and cinemas, exhibition halls, sports grounds or other public places, or to block 
traffic or disrupt the movement of traffic, or to resist or obstruct public security officials from 
carrying out their duties according to law, if the resulting situation is serious, the ringleaders 
shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, criminal detention or 
surveillance.&#8221; C. Guangcheng was sentenced to four years and three months imprisonment.   
 
172. However, the Linyi City Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, when reviewing the appeal by C. 
Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, overturned this verdict on 30 October 2006 on the basis of insufficient 
evidence for convicting C. Guangcheng for the offence under CCC article 291. Instead of 
declaring C. Guangcheng to be innocent and releasing him, the Intermediate Court referred the 
case back to the lower court for re-trial. He continued to be held in detention at the Yinan County 
Detention Centre.  
<b> 
Response to an allegation letter sent in 2005 
</b> 
173. On 29 December 2005, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an 
allegation letter concerning <b>Liu Jizhi</b>, aged 51 and <b>Han Yuzhi</b>, aged 42, both of whom are Falun 
Gong practitioners.  According to the information received: On the night of 24 November 2005, 
Liu Jizhi was abducted by an estimated seven policemen.  Her home was ransacked and all Falun 
Gong materials were seized.  She was taken to Dongchengfang Town Police Station in Tunzhou 
City, Hebei Province, where she was interrogated, beaten with rubber clubs and given electric 
shocks with stun batons.  At approximately 2 p.m. on 25 November 2005, a police officer called 
He Xuejian took Liu Jizhi to a room, where he lifted her shirt and touched her breasts.  He then 
gave her electric shocks on her breasts with a stun baton.  Another police officer called Wang 
came into the room and encouraged He Xuejian to beat her up.  After Wang left the room, He 
Xuejian raped Liu Jizhi.  While raping her, he repeatedly slapped her in the face.  He then 
brought Han Yuzhi into the same room and raped her too.  Both rapes took place in the presence 
of another police officer, Dadjun, who made no attempt to intervene or prevent the incidents.          
<b> 
</b>174. By letter dated 28 June 2006, the Government informed that on 24 November 2005, the 
two women were taken in to the local public security office for questioning, on suspicion of </p>

involvement in illegal activities, and were released in the afternoon of the same day. On 26 
November, the Dashiqiao criminal police team in the Tunzhou City Public Security Bureau 
received a complaint from HY, claiming that she had been raped by HX.  On 27 November, LJ 
also filed a report with the Tunzhou Public Security Bureau, stating that she too had been raped.  
The authorities promptly summoned the policed officer in question.  In the ensuing questioning 
and investigation, it was ascertained that he was a temporary employee in the Dongchengfang 
Township Public Security Office.  He admitted that, in the afternoon of 25 November 2005, he 
had taken LJ and HY in turn back to his hostel, where he had indecently assaulted LY and had 
raped HY.  On 9 December, following approval from the procuratorial authorities, he was taken 
into custody. On 29 April 2006, the Baoding City People&#8217;s Office of the Procurator, Hebei 
Province, instituted criminal proceedings with the Baoding City People&#8217;s Intermediate Level 
Court against the defendant for the commission of the offences of rape and indecent assault of a 
woman.  On 19 May 2006, after hearing the case, the court sentenced the defendant to eight 
years&#8217; fixed term imprisonment.  On appeal, on 7 June, the Hebei People&#8217;s High Court dismissed 
the appeal and upheld the original judgment.<b>

J.A.T., una ni&#241;a de 14 a&#241;os, cometidos en la zona rural del municipio de Argelia, oriente del 
Departamento de Antioquia, y presuntamente perpetradas por miembros del ejercito regular. De 
acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: El 15 de febrero de 2006 un grupo de soldados del batall&#243;n 
&#8220;Juan del Corral&#8221;, adscrito a la Cuarta Brigada del ej&#233;rcito regular colombiano con sede en 
Medell&#237;n, se habr&#237;an presentado en la vereda &#8220;El Plan&#8221; del antemencionado municipio e iniciado

entrado en la vivienda de la familia G.G., ubicada en la misma vereda donde se encontraban 
solas dos menores de edad: una de 14 a&#241;os, cuyo nombre se desconoce hasta el momento, y 
S.P.G.G., de 17 a&#241;os. Se alega que los soldados habr&#237;an procedido a disparar contra esta &#250;ltima 
caus&#225;ndole la muerte. Seg&#250;n las denuncias, los soldados habr&#237;an tratado de convencer a la 
familia de que el disparo que acab&#243; con la vida de S.P.G.G. hab&#237;a sido efectuado el 
antemencionado supuesto miembro de la guerrilla y habr&#237;an exhortado a los familiares de la 
victima a informar a las autoridades &#8220;que a la joven la hab&#237;a matado el guerrillero&#8221;. Se informa

de evitar que estos denunciasen la verdad sobre la forma en que sucedieron los hechos. Se alega 
tambi&#233;n que el cad&#225;ver de S.P. habr&#237;a sido dejado en el potrero de la finca hasta el d&#237;a siguiente </p>

soldado habr&#237;a llegado a la vivienda de una familia campesina, y habr&#237;a exigido que le 
entregaran a su hija, una ni&#241;a de 14 a&#241;os ante lo cual los padres se negaron. El soldado habr&#237;a 
procedido a llevarse a la menor procediendo a violarla. La ni&#241;a regres&#243; posteriormente al

<p><b>Cyprus 
Allegation letter  
 
</b>200. By letter dated on 9 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children sent an allegation letter to 
the Government concerning the deportation of T. S., a national of the Russian Federation.  
 
201. According to the information received: T. S. initially traveled to Cyprus in 2003 to work in 
a night-club in Larnaka. Reportedly T. S. was sexually abused by the owner of the club who also 
posed serious limitations on her freedom of movement. She reportedly managed to escape from 
this situation of abuse and exploitation and went into hiding under the protection of the Russian 
Mission.  
 
202. According to the information received, T. S. filed a complaint for the abuse suffered with 
the police in 2004. According to the Combating of Trafficking in Persons and Sexual 
Exploitation of Children Law of 2000, T. S. should have qualified as victim of trafficking and be 
entitled to protection and support as well as with the possibility to remain to be employed by 
another employer. The law furthermore provides for a Court of Ministers, which may appoint a 
&#8220;guardian of victims&#8221; to advise, counsel, and guide victims of exploitation; to hear complaints of 
exploitation; to investigate those complaints; to provide victims with treatment and safe 
residence; to take the steps necessary through the appropriate agencies to prosecute the 
offenders; to take rehabilitative measures, including victim reemployment or repatriation; and to 
identify any deficiency in the law to combat trafficking.  
 
203. According to the information received however, T. S. was deported on 29 May, before her 
solicitor was able to present an appeal to Cypriot immigration authorities. 
 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b> 
204. By letter dated 26 October 2006, the Government informed that T. S. initially arrived in 
Cyprus in November 2002 and not in 2003. As she informed the Cyprus police, she was 
previously working in Lebanon and Syria as an entertainer. During her stay in Cyprus, she was 
employed at the &#8220;NOSTALGIA&#8221; night club, where, according to her complaint to the Cyprus 
Police on 3 June 2003, her employer attempted to illicit her to prostitution. As a result, she was 
forced to change employer and continued working in an unidentified night club in Limassol. 
Afterwards, T. S. traveled to her country and returned to Cyprus on 15 November 2003, to work 
at the night club &#8220;Chiquito&#8221; in Larnaca and she was granted work permit for three months, which 
was renewed on 19 May 2004. 
 
205. On 22 March 2004 she married  K.J.M., a British citizen, 55 years old. On 23 March 2004 
she visited with her husband the British High Commission in Nicosia, requesting visa to enter 
Great Britain, which  was refused, because she was required to have stayed at least one year in 
Cyprus, before being granted with a visa. T. S. has subsequently abandoned her husband and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 39 
</p>
<p> 
found refuge at the Russian Church in Limassol. On 11 June 2006 her husband applied 
(application n&#176; 149/04) to the District Court of Lamaca for a divorce and on 09 June 2006 the 
Court delivered its decision for divorce. 
 
206. During the above mentioned period, T. S. repeatedly applied to the Migration Officer for 
work permit in other areas of activity and in early 2005 she applied to the Movement for 
Equality, Support and Anti-racism for assistance. On 26 April 2005, T. S. was informed by the 
Migration Officer that her request for a work permit was not accepted. On 03 June 2006 she 
complained to Larnaca Police that she had been forced to prostitution by her employer at 
&#8220;Chiquito&#8221; night club, from 15 November 2003 to 22 March 2004. In her submission to the 
Police, T. S. included much inaccurate information and did not provide enough evidence for the 
prosecution of her employer. She also provided contradicting information as regards the 
submissions made by other people and did not provide critical information and adequate answers 
to the Cypriot Authorities. Furthermore, when she applied to Larnaca Police on 23 March 2004, 
when asked whether she had any complaint against her employer her answer was negative. 
 
207. After thorough investigation of the above case according to the relevant laws of the 
Republic of Cyprus and the European Union, as well as the international obligations of Cyprus 
vis-&#224;-vis the United Nations Conventions and with the involvement, inter alia, of the Office of 
the Attorney-General of the Republic of Cyprus, T. S. was deported to her country on 28 May 
2006. It is noted that the complaints made by T. S. were given the necessary attention and were 
thoroughly investigated and that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus showed and remains 
highly sensitive to issues concerning sexual abuses and trafficking in persons, especially women 
and children. 
<b> 
Observations 
 
</b>208. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to her 
communication of 9 June 2006. <b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
 
Allegation letter 
 
</b>209. On 20 December 2005, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, sent an allegation letter concerning allegations of 
trafficking of female citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China. The problem is exacerbated by their cruel, inhuman and degrading 
punishment upon their deportation from China to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p> 
210. According to information received nationals of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
commit a criminal offence if they leave the country without official permission. Article 233 of 
the revised 2004 Criminal Code makes the crossing of an international border without 
permission a criminal offence punishable by up to two years in a labour training camp (<i>nodong 
danryundae</i>) or a detention centre (<i>jipkyulso</i>), in grave cases up to three years. According to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 40 
 
article 62 of the Criminal Code, defection to a foreign country or to the enemy in betrayal of the 
country and the people is a criminal offence punishable by no less than five years of detention in 
a political labour camp (<i>kwanliso</i>) or a re-education labour camp (<i>kyohwaso</i>). In extremely grave 
cases the offence allegedly carries the death penalty.   
</p>
<p> 
211. Despite these harsh penalties, a considerable number of citizens of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea clandestinely cross international borders. Reportedly, there are at 
least 50,000 citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who have an irregular visa 
status in the Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Yanbian (Jilin Province, China), which borders 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and is home to about one million Chinese citizens of 
Korean ethnicity. While a considerable number of them leave Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea to escape persecution by the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
for reasons of religion, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, many others 
flee from the dismal socio-economic situation.  
 
212. The People&#8217;s Republic of China has a general policy of arresting and deporting Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea citizens who do not possess a valid visa. The Chinese authorities 
reportedly consider them to be irregular migrants who cross the border for purely economic 
reasons. Upon their return to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, deported persons are 
usually first taken to the State security agency (<i>bowibu</i>) where they are subject to beatings, 
humiliating body searches, and interrogated on their activities in China. After the interrogations, 
which can take a week or longer, the majority of persons are sent without trial or any form of 
judicial process to a labour training camp (<i>nodong danryundae</i>) or a provincial detention centre 
(<i>jipkyulso</i>), close to their hometown. Upon arrival, they are usually again stripped, searched, 
interrogated and beaten. Detained for several months in inhuman conditions in overcrowded, 
unsanitary cells, they are forced to perform long hours of hard labour. Some detention centres 
force prisoners to attend re-education sessions every night. Food rations usually consist of corn 
gruel or soup with a bit of cabbage, three times a day. The combination of hard labour, sub-
standard food and unsanitary living conditions results in high illness rates. Detainees who 
become seriously ill are often released since there is no medical care available in these 
institutions and the authorities do not want to be burdened with a dying inmate. 
</p>
<p> 
213. Citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, who the authorities believe to have 
made contact with churches, citizens of the Republic of Korea or journalists or to have engaged 
in any other conduct officials consider to be political betrayal, are usually sent without trial or 
any form of judicial process to a political labour camp (<i>kwanliso</i>) or a re-education labour camp 
(<i>kyohwaso</i>), and detained for periods ranging between several years and a lifetime. Detainees 
have to perform hard labour while being perpetually kept on the verge of starvation. Reports also 
indicate that many detainees are subjected to various forms of torture.  
</p>
<p> 
214. Summary executions have also been reported to occur in detention facilities. In 1999, for 
instance, two women were reportedly executed in Onsong Detention Centre after they confessed 
to having converted to Christianity.  
</p>
<p> 
215. The cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment of Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
citizens who clandestinely crossed the border into China and were then deported also exacerbates 
the human trafficking of women from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, who make up 
about half of all those who cross the border. Upon arrival in China, many of these women are </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 41 
</p>
<p> 
trafficked and forced to marry or become the concubines of Chinese men. Human traffickers 
systematically target the women, who are usually hungry and desperate, by approaching them in 
the border region and promising them food, shelter, employment and protection. Once the 
traffickers have gained the women&#8217;s confidence, the women are lured to an apartment, confined 
and then sold to local men. The buyers often lock the women in the house, tie them up take away 
their clothing to prevent them from escaping the forced relationship. In many cases, the women 
are also physically abused and raped by their buyers. Some women are also trafficked into the 
sex industry in Jinlin Province and other parts of China. They are forced to prostitute themselves 
in brothels, which are often disguised as karaoke bars. 
</p>
<p> 
216. Since they fear deportation to and punishment in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, the women are effectively denied access to the protection of the Chinese authorities. 
Human traffickers are well aware of this fact and use it to subdue their victims by threatening to 
report them to the Chinese authorities if they resist.  
</p>
<p>217. The situation is particularly dire for women who have become pregnant as a result of 
sexual exploitation in forced marriages or the sex industry and are then deported. Pregnant 
women who the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea authorities suspect of being 
impregnated by Chinese men are often subjected to particularly harsh treatment and also torture.  
Their pregnancies are considered evidence of indecent sexual relations with foreigners and a 
betrayal of the home country. In the past, there have also been reports about cases in which 
women were forced to have abortions or newly born infants were murdered. 
<b> 
Response from the Government 
 
</b>218. By letter dated 4 January 2006, the Government returned the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letter 
dated 20 December 2005 stating that the forces hostile to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea were becoming ever more reckless in their attempts to defame, disintegrate and overthrow 
the state and social system of the country. As part of these attempts they were resorting to every 
possible means in the international human rights field including by continuing to circulate 
fabricated information on and forcing the allies and various individuals of the world to join their 
plot against the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In the light of its political motives, 
provocative nature and fabricated contents, the joint letter, was construed as a product of a 
conspiracy undertaken in line with hostile forces&#8217; attempts. The Government stated that it 
therefore rejected the joint letter. 
 
<b>Urgent Appeal  
</b> 
219. On 24 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography sent an urgent appeal concerning the 
forced repatriation of a female national of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea by the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China  on 28 February 2006.   
 
220. According to the information received: Six years ago, the woman referred to above, and 
her one-year-old daughter, were sold for 3,000 RMB to a Chinese man, who she was forced to 
marry. The woman became pregnant soon thereafter and gave birth to a second daughter named 
K.Y. It is reported that the mother was arrested by a Chinese police raid squad at 11.30 p.m. on 
25 February 2006 and handed over to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea security police </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 42 
 
three days later. Concern is expressed that the woman may face harsh punishment since she had 
already been deported on two previous occasions, but managed each time to return to her 
children in China. 
 
221. Reportedly, this is not a singular incident. In cities near the border, including Yanji and 
Longjin, an intensified information exchange on defectors between Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea and Chinese authorities has reportedly led to an increase in deportations of 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea nationals. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs 
referred to their communication of 20 December 2005, in which they expressed their deep 
concern about to the cruel and inhuman punishment facing nationals of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea upon their forced return to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
<b> 
Response from the Government 
</b> 
222. By letter dated 12 April 2006, the Government responded and stated that the joint letter of 
24 March 2006, like an earlier letter dated December 20, 2005, also represents a product of 
conspiracy undertaken in pursuit of the ill-minded aim of spreading fabricated information while 
following the attempts of those hostile forces to defame, disintegrate and overthrow the state and 
social system of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on the pretext of human rights. The 
letter has no relevance to genuine human rights, the Government stated. 
 
223. Therefore, the Government resolutely and categorically rejected the letter. The 
Government stated that it had already made it clear that it does not even recognize the Special 
Rapporteur known as appointed pursuant to the resolution on Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea forcibly adopted with the aim of overthrowing the country&#8217;s social system and this 
position of ours will continue to remain invariable. 
 
224. The Government was also of the opinion that, since three thematic Rapporteurs listed in the 
letter chose to pursue unilateral confrontation in disregard of the sincerity and generosity of the 
Government over the last years, it does not feel any further need to deal with them. 
 
225. Finally, the Government asserted: &#8220;Moreover, addressing letters to countries by the special 
rapporteurs in the name of the Commission on Human Rights such as this constitutes an illegal 
and impertinent behaviour as their mandates were suspended with the conclusion of the work of 
the Commission. And in this context, the Government was doubtful as to why such insolent 
maneuvers on the part of the special rapporteurs were not frustrated. For this reason the 
Government sends back the joint letter of special rapporteurs dated 24 March 2006.&#8221; 
<b> 
Observations 
 
</b>226. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the letter concerning the communication of 24 March 
2006 and draws the Government&#8217;s attention to Economic and Social Council resolution 2006/2 
on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 60/251, which decided to abolish the 
Commission on Human Rights with effect from16 June 2006.

<p><b>Carta de alegaciones 
</b></p>
<p>227. El 10 agosto 2006, la Relatora Especial, conjuntamente con el Relator Especial sobre los 
derechos humanos de los migrantes y el Relator Especial sobre la venta de ni&#241;os, la prostituci&#243;n 
infantil y la utilizaci&#243;n de ni&#241;os en la pornograf&#237;a, transmiti&#243; una carta de alegaciones en 
relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n de los colombianos en riesgo de ser objeto de la trata de personas en el 
Ecuador. 
 
228. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, en el a&#241;o 2004, el n&#250;mero de ciudadanos colombianos 
refugiados, solicitantes de asilo en el Ecuador, ascender&#237;a aproximadamente a 44.800 personas. 
En a&#241;os recientes, el gobierno ecuatoriano habr&#237;a implementado nuevas restricciones para los 
colombianos que desean ingresar al pa&#237;s, as&#237; como para aqu&#233;llos que desean permanecer en &#233;l. 
 
229. Los retos que enfrentar&#237;an los refugiados colombianos, los solicitantes de asilo y los 
migrantes, les podr&#237;an poner en riesgo de ser objeto de tr&#225;fico hacia el Ecuador. Entre los 
factores que aumentar&#237;an el peligro de ser objeto de trata figura el aumento en las medidas de 
control en las fronteras recientemente implementadas por el gobierno ecuatoriano, incluida la 
exigencia del pasado judicial para cruzar la frontera. El pasado judicial es un registro oficial de 
no tener historia criminal, emitido por las autoridades colombianas. Este documento ser&#237;a muy 
dif&#237;cil de obtener por las personas que viven en las zonas rurales de Colombia, ya que s&#243;lo se 
puede obtener en las grandes zonas urbanas, a donde les es dif&#237;cil y peligroso llegar. Adem&#225;s, 
ser&#237;a excesivamente costoso para los campesinos colombianos sin recursos, lo cual lo volver&#237;a 
inaccesible para ellos. 
 
230. En este sentido, el hecho de que los colombianos reaccionen ante este nuevo requerimiento 
cruzando la frontera en &#225;reas remotas en lugar de hacerlo en los sitios oficiales de cruce, aumenta 
la preocupaci&#243;n de que se extienda la trata de personas. La presunta corrupci&#243;n entre las 
autoridades ecuatorianas, incluyendo oficiales de frontera, tambi&#233;n crear&#237;a un ambiente 
conducente a la trata de personas.  
 
231. Se informa del hecho de que los colombianos que ingresan indocumentados al Ecuador, 
generalmente evitar&#237;an registrarse para solicitar asilo. De todas maneras, incluso si cruzan la 
frontera con los documentos requeridos, muchos escoger&#237;an permanecer no registrados por el 
temor de que al hacer notoria su presencia en Ecuador, ello atraer&#237;a represalias por parte de la 
guerrilla colombiana o de ciertos elementos paramilitares. 
 
232. Asimismo, si bien el permanecer indocumentados puede que proteja a los colombianos de 
ser objeto de abusos por parte de los insurgentes, ir&#243;nicamente ello podr&#237;a volverles m&#225;s 
vulnerables a la explotaci&#243;n, incluyendo la trata de personas. La falta de estatus legal les 
dificultar&#237;a el poder denunciar a las autoridades ecuatorianas explotaciones o abusos de los 
cuales hayan sido objeto. Ello tambi&#233;n convertir&#237;a a los colombianos en un blanco para la trata 
de personas, ya que ser&#237;an controlados m&#225;s f&#225;cilmente por los traficantes. La reciente 
disminuci&#243;n del &#237;ndice de concesiones de asilo podr&#237;a exacerbar este problema, ya que los 
individuos a los que se les deniega el asilo pasan a vivir en la sombra de la sociedad ecuatoriana, 
con la esperanza de no ser detectados por las autoridades. Ellos tambi&#233;n se tornar&#237;an presa f&#225;cil 
para los traficantes.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 44 
 
 
233. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, los colombianos, especialmente las mujeres, se 
enfrentar&#237;an a una significativa discriminaci&#243;n dentro del Ecuador. Ello les obligar&#237;a a ingresar 
en la econom&#237;a informal, incluyendo el trabajo sexual. En muchas ocasiones, se ver&#237;an obligadas 
a buscar protecci&#243;n de hombres ecuatorianos, quienes a su vez frecuentemente las explotar&#237;an. 
Pueblos fronterizos, como Lago Agrio, tienen ya de por s&#237; un alto nivel de delincuencia y 
prostituci&#243;n, por lo que las mujeres y ni&#241;os colombianos frecuentemente terminar&#237;an como 
trabajadores sexuales. 
 
234. Precisamente en Lago Agrio se constata un elevado n&#250;mero de ni&#241;os no acompa&#241;ados. Se 
informa de que existe un orfanato en ese lugar, pero solamente pueden ingresar los ni&#241;os 
menores de 12 a&#241;os. Los ni&#241;os mayores ser&#237;an entregados a familias de la zona y se volver&#237;an 
vulnerables a abusos. 
 
235. Se informa del hecho de que los ni&#241;os colombianos tendr&#237;an dificultades para recibir 
educaci&#243;n a causa de la discriminaci&#243;n o por los costos prohibitivos de la educaci&#243;n. Como 
resultado, frecuentemente dejar&#237;an de estudiar y se pondr&#237;an a trabajar para ayudar a mantener a 
sus familias. Ello tambi&#233;n les tornar&#237;a vulnerables a la trata de personas.

<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations 
</b> 
237. Par lettre dat&#233;e du 3 mars 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les droits de l'homme des 
migrants et la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale ont attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement sur des all&#233;gations 
concernant la l&#233;gislation fran&#231;aise. 
 
238. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, certaines des modifications propos&#233;es &#224; la l&#233;gislation 
fran&#231;aise sur l&#8217;immigration (Code de l&#8217;entr&#233;e et du s&#233;jour des &#233;trangers et du droit d&#8217;asile) 
auraient pour cons&#233;quence de restreindre le droit &#224; la vie de famille en introduisant des d&#233;lais et 
des conditions suppl&#233;mentaires au regroupement familial, ainsi que des limitations au droit de 
mariage. Les d&#233;lais et restrictions suppl&#233;mentaires cr&#233;eraient une situation de pr&#233;carit&#233; du statut 
d&#8217;&#233;tranger et de ce fait, une d&#233;pendance entre les membres de la famille, qui pourraient 
contribuer au maintien des situations de violence familiale et conjugale.  
 
239. Les modifications annonc&#233;es devraient dans les faits toucher davantage les femmes, qui 
repr&#233;senteraient environ 80 % des conjoints rejoignant, en ce qu&#8217;elles renforceraient les 
situations de d&#233;pendance conjugale<b> </b>et pourraient<b> </b>favoriser des situations de violence. 
 
240. Selon les rapports re&#231;us, le projet pr&#233;voirait que le titre de s&#233;jour des conjoints de Fran&#231;ais 
pourrait &#234;tre retir&#233; si les &#233;poux se s&#233;parent pendant les quatre ann&#233;es qui suivent le mariage. Il ne 
contiendrait aucune r&#233;f&#233;rence sur la proc&#233;dure &#224; suivre en cas de violences conjugales.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 45 
</p>
<p> 
241. Dans le cas des personnes entr&#233;es en France par regroupement familial avec leurs &#233;poux 
&#233;trangers, le d&#233;lai pendant lequel le titre de s&#233;jour pourrait &#234;tre retir&#233; si le couple se s&#233;pare, serait 
prolong&#233; de deux &#224; trois ans apr&#232;s le mariage. Le projet d&#8217;article maintiendrait la possibilit&#233;, d&#233;j&#224; 
pr&#233;vue dans la loi actuelle, que l&#8217;autorit&#233; puisse accorder un renouvellement du titre si la 
communaut&#233; de vie est rompue en raison de violences conjugales.  Cependant, selon les rapports 
re&#231;us, en raison du manque d&#8217;information des personnes concern&#233;es et du grand pouvoir 
discr&#233;tionnaire octroy&#233; aux pr&#233;fets, cette loi a donn&#233; lieu &#224; une grande h&#233;t&#233;rog&#233;n&#233;it&#233; des 
pratiques et ne peut pas &#234;tre consid&#233;r&#233;e comme une protection ad&#233;quate. Les dispositions l&#233;gales 
propos&#233;es sembleraient dans tous les cas laisser enti&#232;rement &#224; la discr&#233;tion des autorit&#233;s 
administratives le pouvoir de renouveler les permis des personnes &#233;trang&#232;res ayant quitt&#233; le 
domicile conjugal en raison de violences conjugales.  
</p>
<p> 
242. En outre, certaines des modifications propos&#233;es rendraient les personnes concern&#233;es 
d&#233;pendantes de leurs employeurs pour obtenir et maintenir le droit de s&#233;journer l&#233;galement en 
France, sans la possibilit&#233; de changer de travail m&#234;me en cas d&#8217;abus de la part de l&#8217;employeur. 
De m&#234;me, en cas de licenciement, l'&#233;tranger serait expuls&#233; sans recours. 
</p>
<p> 
243. Le projet restreindrait &#233;galement les possibilit&#233;s de contester les d&#233;cisions de 
l'administration devant les tribunaux autorisant les pr&#233;fectures &#224; appliquer leur pouvoir 
discr&#233;tionnaire dans un grand nombre de situations. 
 
<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement  
 
</b>244. Par lettre dat&#233;e du 19 mai 2006, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que le projet de loi relatif &#224; 
l&#8217;immigration et &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;gration actuellement discut&#233; au Parlement a pour objet de mieux 
encadrer l&#8217;immigration afin de favoriser une int&#233;gration durable et r&#233;ussie des &#233;trangers en 
France. Il entend maintenir la tradition d&#8217;ouverture de la France aux &#233;trangers et garantir le 
respect des droits et libert&#233;s individuels qui leur sont reconnus. Dans le domaine particulier des 
proc&#233;dures de regroupement familial, le projet de loi maintient le droit constitutionnellement 
prot&#233;g&#233; en France de tout &#233;tranger r&#233;sidant r&#233;guli&#232;rement, &#224; se faire rejoindre par sa famille. Il 
am&#233;nage cependant les modalit&#233;s d&#8217;exercice de ce droit en portant de 12 &#224; 18 mois le d&#233;lai de 
r&#233;sidence requis pour solliciter le regroupement familial, en pr&#233;voyant que l&#8217;&#233;tranger devra 
justifier par les ressources de son travail des moyens de subvenir aux besoins de sa famille et en 
pr&#233;voyant que l&#8217;&#233;tranger devra se conformer aux principes qui r&#233;gissent la R&#233;publique fran&#231;aise. 
 
245. Le titre de s&#233;jour d&#233;livr&#233; au conjoint, admis dans le cadre d&#8217;un regroupement familial, 
pourra &#234;tre retir&#233; pendant un d&#233;lai de trois ans &#8211; et non plus deux ans &#8211; en cas de rupture de vie 
commune. Cette disposition est rendue n&#233;cessaire pour dissuader certains abus de proc&#233;dure 
actuellement constat&#233;s. Comme le pr&#233;voit d&#233;j&#224; la l&#233;gislation actuelle, le principe du retrait de la 
carte de s&#233;jour en cas de rupture de vie commune ne sera pas applicable lorsque la communaut&#233; 
de vie cessera en raison de violences conjugales.  
 
246. Par ailleurs, ce projet ne comporte pas de disposition qui puisse porter attente aux droits 
des &#233;trangers de former un recours devant la juridiction administrative ou judiciaire selon les cas, 
en cas de violation all&#233;gu&#233;e de leurs droits. Le projet de loi du Gouvernement a &#233;t&#233; examin&#233; par 
le Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat, qui a notamment v&#233;rifi&#233; sa conformit&#233; aux engagements internationaux que la 
France a souscrit dans le domaine des droits de l&#8217;homme. Il est actuellement soumis &#224; la 
repr&#233;sentation nationale qui pourra le discuter, l&#8217;amender et le compl&#233;ter. Il pourra &#233;galement, </p>

<p><b>Urgent appeal</b>  
  
</p>
<p>248. On 27 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on trafficking 
in persons, especially women and children, sent an urgent appeal to the Government to bring its 
attention to the information regarding T.B., a German citizen of Turkish descent. According to 
information received, T.B. is a German citizen from Hamburg. In April 2006, T.B. travelled with 
her mother from Hamburg to the settlement of Karastlak K&#246;y&#252; in the village of Yeni Halfeti, 
&#350;anliurfa province, southeast of Turkey, where her grandmother and other relatives reside. 
Allegedly, her family had made her believe that she was going to vacation in the village. 
 
249. Upon T.B. arrival in the village, her mother allegedly took her passport and other identity 
documents away and told her that she had to enter into an arranged marriage with a close 
relative. According to the latest information received, T.B. is still in Yeni Halfeti. Reportedly, 
she faces serious limitations of her freedom of movement and is only on rare occasions able to 
leave her grandmother&#8217;s house. 
  
250. Concern is expressed that T.B. may be forced to marry her relative against her will or face 
severe violence, if she refuses. 
<b> 
Response from the Government 
</b> 
251. By letter dated 15 August 2006, the Government informed me that T.B. (married in Turkey 
against her will) left Turkey on 2 June 2006 together with an officially appointed escort and is 
being looked after away from the threat posed by her family within the scope of a German 
programme which provides assistance for young women. 
 
252. It was possible to help T.B. so quickly thanks to the excellent close cooperation between 
the competent German guardianship court and the German Embassy in Ankara on the one side 
and the responsible Turkish institutions on the other. However, the success of this action was 
also contingent upon the young woman agreeing to return to Germany against the express will of 
her legal guardians and accepting the personal consequences. 
 
253. The German Government will remain committed to taking decisive action against forced 
marriage. In comparable cases abroad, however, it will continue to rely on the readiness to 
cooperate of host governments.

<p><b> 
Allegation letter  
 
</b>255. On 25 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children and the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography, sent a letter of allegation concerning the trafficking of newborn infants from 
Bulgaria to Greece. 
 
256. According to the information received, it is alleged that pregnant women, most of them 
from the Roma community in the region of Burgas in eastern Bulgaria, and many of them 
unemployed and living in harsh conditions, are induced by members of organized crime to come 
to work to Greece, being promised employment and good salaries.  
 
257. It is reported that instead, these pregnant women end up in small cities throughout Greece, 
where they are held together in apartments for the remainder of their pregnancy, before 
delivering at local hospitals, where, with the complicity of doctors, midwives and other hospital 
staff, their newborn babies are taken away from them and sold by organized crime members with 
the assistance of lawyers for up to 30 000 euros.  
 
258. It is alleged that after having given birth in Greece, the women are sent back to their 
hometowns in Bulgaria and receive 1,000 euros per child.  
 
259. Reports also alleged that little progress has been made by Greek and Bulgarian authorities 
in the investigations on trafficking and sale of children taking place between the two countries. It 
is further reported that the complex and long procedures for legal adoption in Greece might have 
brought to an increase in instance of trafficking and sale of children.

262. Furthermore, the provisions contained in paragraphs. 2 and 3 of article 10 of Law No. 
2447/96 have a criminal and therefore a police interest. The said provisions stipulates 
imprisonment or incarceration penalties depending on the regularity of perpetration against the 
person who gives away his child for adoption, or any intermediate person who acts with the aim 
of gaining unfair benefits. By virtue of such provisions, police authorities have been assigned 
with the task of combating illegal adoptions and certifying the related crimes.   
 
263. The Government also provided a brief overview of the different stages to a legal adoption 
in Greece. The first step is to prospect the adopting parents to come in contact with the adopted 
child&#8217;s natural parents and to obtain the latter&#8217;s consent for the adoption. Thereafter, the 
competent social service conducts an investigation, focused on the adopted child&#8217;s best interests 
and draws up a report based on its findings. Finally, the competent Court, after an application 
filed by the adopting parents, having taken into consideration the said report and any other 
information it may have, ratifies and gives approval for the adoption.  
 
264. The Government noted, thanks to statistics on illegal adoptions kept by the Directorate of 
Public Safety, Hellenic Police Headquarters, that all the cases of trafficking of new born infants 
involved Bulgarian nationals, both as offender and victims and that the police are aware of the 
places of Bulgarian pregnant women&#8217;s recruitment, the modus operandi<i>, </i>the routes followed in 
order to enter Greece. In an effort to combat such criminal activities, the Hellenic Police 
Headquarters is cooperating with its Bulgarian counterpart and several significant results has 
therefore yielded during the last two years, such as mechanisms for the exchange of information, 
the cooperation with the police authorities with liaison officers of the two sides and in cases of 
large-scale investigation, the meeting of operation officers of both sides in order to eradicate 
criminal groups.  
 
265. According to the statistics on illegal adoptions kept by the Directorate of Public Safety, 
Hellenic Police Headquarters, the following cases have been dealt with by the relevant Services: 
 
Year 2002: 
Number of cases: 1 
Offenders: 8 (5 Bulgarian and 3 Greek nationals)

<p><b>Llamamiento urgente</b> 
<b> 
</b>267. El 9 de junio de 2006, la Relatora Especial, juntamente con la Representante Especial del 
Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; un 
llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con el personal de las organizaciones no gubernamentales 
Uni&#243;n Nacional de Mujeres Guatemaltecas (UNAMG) y Sector de Mujeres. La UNAMG trabaja 
en defensa de los derechos de las mujeres. En particular, promueve la participaci&#243;n pol&#237;tica de 
las mujeres y condiciones de equidad, la justicia de g&#233;nero, y la no violencia contra las mujeres. 
Adem&#225;s, la UNAMG tiene un Proyecto de V&#237;ctimas de Actoras de Cambio para mujeres 
sobrevivientes del conflicto armado que ayuda a las mujeres victimas del conflicto armado. De 
acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
</p>
<p> 
268. El 29 de mayo de 2006 las oficinas del Sector de Mujeres en la ciudad de Guatemala 
habr&#237;an sido allanadas por personas desconocidas. Seg&#250;n se informa, los asaltantes habr&#237;an 
robado tel&#233;fonos celulares y un fax, habr&#237;an registrado archivos y habr&#237;an dejado huellas de 
sangre cerca de las ventanas y a lo largo del piso y hacia la cocina, el cuarto de ba&#241;o y oficinas 
internas.  
</p>
<p> 
269. El 5 de junio de 2006 las oficinas de la sede de Chimaltenango de la UNAMG habr&#237;an sido 
allanadas por personas desconocidas. Seg&#250;n se informa, los asaltantes habr&#237;an violentado los 
escritorios y archivos y se habr&#237;an llevado una computadora que estaba adjudicada al Proyecto 
de V&#237;ctimas de Actoras de Cambio para mujeres sobrevivientes del conflicto armado.  
 
270. Se teme que estos eventos puedan estar relacionados con la labor que hace la UNAMG y el 
Sector de Mujeres en defensa de los derechos humanos de las mujeres en Guatemala, en 
particular porque las dos organizaciones han denunciado p&#250;blicamente las violaciones en contra 
de las mujeres en ese pa&#237;s. Adem&#225;s, se expresan temores que estos allanamientos puedan formar 
parte de un intento de intimidar a los defensores de los derechos de las mujeres.

<p><b>India 
Urgent appeal 
</b> 272. On 3 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people sent an urgent appeal 
to the Government concerning the arbitrary detention and possible torture of an indigenous 
woman, M.N. resident of Yairipok Leirongthel, Khangbok Part III, Thoubal District, Manipur.  273. According to the information received, M.N. was the girlfriend of the late K.R., alias Mr. 
B., who was reportedly a member of the prohibited People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA).   
274. On 20 February 2006, Mr. B. was killed in an armed encounter with police in Thoubal 
Market. In the same incident, an Inspector and Officer-in-Charge of the Thoubal District Police 
Commandos Unit, and three other police were also killed. On 21 February 2006 at around 4.30 
p.m., police commandos reportedly came in four jeeps to the house of Mr. B.&#8217;s family, attacked 
several of his family members and arrested M.N. because of her personal relationship with Mr. 
B. No arrest memo was issued. Instead, a police report was filed, which stated that. M.N. was 
arrested on 22 February 2006, at 8 p.m. &#8211; more than 27 hours after the actual arrest. M.N. was 
charged with being &#8220;an associate of the party who ambushed the Officer in Charge and 
commandos&#8221; and &#8220;B.&#8217;s girlfriend&#8221;. A First Information Report (FIR) bearing number 25(2)06 of 
Thoubal Police Station under Section 20 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 2004 is 
registered against her.   
275. On 22 February 2006, K.D. filed a petition with the Manipur Human Rights Commission 
(MHRC), which was registered as case No. 6 of 2006. The MHRC asked the Government to 
submit a report on the incident to the Commission by 27 February 2006.   
276. On 23 February 2006, M.N. appeared before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Thoubal and 
was remanded to police custody for 9 days. Sources allege that she was visibly weak and dizzy, 
indicating severe physical and mental torture. She was wearing a new shirt since the original 
shirt had allegedly been torn by the police, raising serious concerns of possible sexual violence.<i> 
<b></b></i><b> 
Allegation Letter 
</b> 277. On 8 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences has jointly with Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning the alleged gang rape of M., a 22-year-old woman belonging to the 
indigenous Nut Community (a scheduled tribe) in Sirsi village, Chandauli District, Uttar 
Pradesh.  278. According to the information received, on 14 January 2006 at 1 a.m., four men from a 
nearby Hinauti village allegedly came to the house of M.&#8217;s family. All four men belong to the 
upper caste Singh community. The men assaulted M.&#8217;s family members and chased them away, 
leaving M. alone in the house. Allegedly, the four men then forcibly took her to the pulse plants 
field, one kilometer away from her house, where they gang raped her for three hours. When M. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 51 
</p>
<p> 
fell unconscious, they threw her onto a nearby railway line, where she was found hours later by 
another villager.   
279. The victim's family reported the incident to the Chandauli Police Station and lodged a First 
Information Report (FIR) against the four men under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and 
under Section 3(2) and Section 5 of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of 
Atrocities) Act 1989. Reportedly, however, the police tried to delay action against the alleged 
perpetrators. Under intense pressure from the Nut community, the police finally arrested the 
alleged perpetrators &#8211; more than 40 hours after the rape allegedly took place.   
280. The members of the indigenous Nut community in Sirsi village live in very poor conditions 
on government-owned land and make their living from begging. Conversely, the members of the 
Singh community are big landowners and wield considerable influence in the region. Concern is 
therefore expressed that the victim could be threatened and pressured to withdraw her complaint 
against the four Singh men.<i> 
<b></b></i><b> 
Allegation letter</b> 281. On 13 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography and Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, sent an allegation letter to the Government to bring to 
its attention the information concerning the trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nepalese girls 
in brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai, India.  282. According to the information received, Nepalese girls, at an average age of 14 to 16 years, 
are trafficked from Nepal to brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai where they are required to work as 
prostitutes in slavery. The girls are trafficked against their will and without knowledge of their 
destination. The traffickers are reported to be Nepalese men and women, who sell the girls to 
brothel owners in Calcutta and Mumbai, at a price of approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Indian 
rupees (US $ 1360-1590) in Calcutta and 100,000 to 120,000 Indian Rupees (US $ 2270- 2720) 
in Mumbai. There is no evidence of extensive networks of traffickers of Nepalese women and 
girls and trafficking seems to take place though an informal network with the collaboration of 
community members, employers, local officials, border officials and others such as those who 
operate &#8216;safe houses&#8217;  where trafficked girls are kept prior to their sale.   
283. Initially the girls are not taken to the brothels directly, but given some time to adjust to 
their new situation, in outside homes, sometimes owned by the brothel owner. After being told 
the work that is required of them, how to dress and behave and after being convinced that they 
themselves, or their families, have incurred a debt which they will have to pay off by working as 
a prostitute after which they are &#8216;free&#8217; to leave, the girls are put to work as <i>tsukri</i> (the Bengali 
word for child in slavery or debt bondage).   
284. When they start to work as tsukris, the girls are usually aged between 15 to 18 years. They 
often work in brothels that are referred to as &#8220;bungalows&#8221;: brothels that occupy a flat, usually on 
the first or higher floors of a building, often with a shop on the ground floor. The bungalow is 
distinguished by a channel gate (a sliding iron accordion gate) at the entrance to the brothel. 
When locked, the channel gate is virtually impenetrable, making escape from the brothel 
impossible for the tsukris kept inside. The area within Calcutta that contains most bungalow-type </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 52 
 
brothels with tsukris is Sonagachi, whereas in Mumbai brothels with tsukris can be found mainly 
in Kamathipura, although due to police raids these types of brothels are said to have moved to 
other cities in India or areas outside the known brothel areas.   
285. It is reported that while clients of the brothels do not have a specific preference for tsukris, 
they do have a preference for girls between 15 and 20, which in turn creates a demand for 
children.   
286. Under the tsukri system the brothel owner retains all of the fees paid by clients for the 
services provided to them by the tsukris. Considerable profits accrue from the use of tsukri 
system: brothel owners are said to earn four to twenty times the purchase price of the tsukri over 
the period of her servitude. The money that the trafficker earns is relatively insignificant 
compared to the large amount that the purchaser (brothel owner) earns.   
287. The initial purchase price is recovered by the brothel owner, on average, in little over five 
and a half months. A Nepalese tsukri is also said to cost less than an Indian tsukri and because of 
continued client demand for Nepalese girls, the returns are higher. On occasion the brothel owner 
may also offer &#8220;special services&#8221; such as a tsukri&#8217;s virginity or oral or anal sex as well as sex 
without a condom, at a special price.   
288. The total period the girls spend in confinement as tsukris varies from two to ten years. 
After being released from slavery, it is often very difficult for tsukris to go back to Nepal. They 
fear isolation and reprisals from family and community members. Many of them take up work as 
free-agent sex workers, earning their own fees by doing street prostitution or paying tenancy to 
brothel owners. Escape prior to release is difficult as there is also fear of being brought back to 
the brothels, either by police or other community members, followed by severe physical 
punishment, as well as a more general fear of &#8220;India outside&#8221; since few tsukris had a clear idea 
of where they were, could not speak the language and were easily recognized as foreigners. <i> 
<b></b></i><b> 
Allegation letter 
</b> 289. On 8 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning the reported murder of S.B., wife of B.B., their daughter P. and their two sons, S. and 
R., all belonging to the Dalit Community in the village of Khairlanji, Bhandara District, in 
Maharashtra.  290. According to information received, there are only three Dalit families in Khairlanji and, 
approximately one hundred upper caste families. In the past, Baiyyalal Bhotmange already 
clashed with upper caste community members over a land dispute. On 3 September 2006, a local 
Dalit policeman was allegedly beaten up by upper caste community members. B.B., S., P., and R. 
reportedly testified against alleged perpetrators leading to their arrest.   
291. On 29 September 2006, the alleged perpetrators were released. The same day, at about 6 
p.m.., a mob of two to three hundred upper caste villagers, many equipped with axes and <i>ubhari</i> 
(a stick with a metal spike), stormed their home, and dragged S.B. and her three children out of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 53 
</p>
<p> 
the house. They were stripped naked, beaten and driven to the main village square. B.B. 
happened to be out of the house at the time of the incident.   
292. Upper caste men then gang raped S.B. and her daughter P. for over an hour, while 
bystanders, including upper caste women, verbally incited the rapists and spurred them on. One 
of  P.&#8217;s brothers was asked to have sex with P. and after he refused, his genitals were thrashed.  P. 
was hit on her breasts with an axe and thrashed and stabbed with <i>ubhari</i> in her genitals. All four 
persons were hacked to death and the bodies were thrown in a canal.   
293. As of 30 November 2006, although a First Information Report (FIR) had been filed, the 
vast majority of the perpetrators, including those who allegedly became complicit to the gang 
rape and murder through verbal incitement, had reportedly not been arrested or charged.  Many 
of Dalit families in the village were afraid to testify. Reportedly, only one eyewitness has come 
forward to testify.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Observations 
 
</b>294. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India did not reply to any of her 
communications sent in 2006.  295. Regarding the communication dated 13 April 2006 concerning the trafficking and sexual 
exploitation of Nepalese girls in brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
the report of the previous Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, on her missions to Bangladesh, Nepal and India (E/CN.4/2001/73/Add.2). In this 
report, the Special Rapporteur found that the conditions of prostitution in some of the brothels in 
Bombay and Calcutta appeared to resemble slavery-like practices. Most of the young girls the 
Special Rapporteur spoke to were being held against their will, were tortured, degraded, beaten 
severely, and were repeatedly assaulted on the lower half of their bodies. They were deprived of 
food and water until they submitted.  
296. In view of the fact that the other reported cases concern indigenous and/or lower caste 
women, the Special Rapporteur would like to make reference to the conclusions and 
recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in its 
2000 concluding observations on India (A/55/38, paras. 42-90). The Committee found that 
discrimination against women who belong to particular castes or ethnic or religious groups is 
also manifested in extreme forms of physical and sexual violence and harassment. The 
Committee also expressed concern about the continuing discrimination, including violence, 
suffered by women of the Dalit community, despite the passage of the Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act of 1989 and urged the Government to introduce 
affirmative action programmes in such areas as education, employment and health so as to 
provide life chances to Dalit women and girls and create an environment conducive to their 
progress.   
297. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the Government 
in regard to the allegations submitted and would be particularly interested to know whether these 
cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators.

<p><b>Iran 
Urgent appeal  
</b> 
298.  On 10 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding <b>N.</b>, aged 18, who has reportedly been 
sentenced to death for a homicide committed when she was seventeen. According to the 
information we have received, on 3 January 2006, N. was sentenced to death for murder by a 
criminal court, after she reportedly admitted stabbing to death one of three men who attempted to 
rape her and her 16-year-old niece in a park in Karaj in March 2005. She was seventeen at the 
time. Her sentence is subject to review by the Court of Appeal, and if upheld, to confirmation by 
the Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>299. In this connection, the Special Rapporteurs drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the positive 
developments in a similarly situated case recently raised with your Excellency&#8217;s Government by 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. In note No. 331-
2/3459, dated 17 January 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
&#8220;according to information received from the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran legal 
counsels of D. appealed to the Supreme Court and raised the issue of her age at the time of the 
crime. On this basis the Supreme Court has overturned the sentence and has referred it to the<b> 
</b>Juvenile Legal Center for due consideration. <i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
 
</b>300. On 22 February 2006 the Government of Iran replied to the communication of 19 February 
informing that according to information received from the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, N. has been born in 1986 and that she, along with her niece, has committed murder about 
nine months ago, when she was over 19 years of age. According to the records of the Court, the 
crime has been committed based on personal reasons and not in self defense as it has been 
reported to the Special Rapporteur. She has gone through due legal proceeding and the Criminal 
Code of the province has reached its verdict, but the sentence must be presented to the Supreme 
Court and upon confirmation of the latter, it must be signed by the Head of the Judiciary. 
Therefore the case is still open and under consideration.     301. On 16 of May 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that the Court has 
ruled out self defense and sentenced N. to retaliation. The sentence has been referred to the 
Supreme Court for final decision. Should the Supreme Court endorse the verdict, the case will be 
referred to an ad hoc commission of reconciliation to acquire the consent of the victim&#8217;s heirs to 
commute the verdict to financial compensation. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran informed that this is a lengthy process; therefore, the legal process is not yet completed 
and the verdict stays for the time being.  
<b>Allegation letter 
</b> 302. On 14 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
the situation of human rights defenders sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding a 
peaceful assembly of women&#8217;s rights activists in Tehran.  303. According to information received: On 8 March 2006, anti-riot police officers, 
Revolutionary Guards and plainclothes agents surrounded Tehran&#8217;s Daneshjoo Park at 4. p.m. 
They ordered hundreds of women and men who had gathered there to celebrate International 
Women&#8217;s Day to disperse. In response, the crowd staged a sit-in and sang the anthem of the 
women&#8217;s rights movement. The security officers then proceeded to dump the contents of garbage 
bins on the women&#8217;s heads and beat the persons assembled with batons, including poet <b>S. B.</b>, 
aged over 70. The security forces also arrested foreign journalists and confiscated their 
photographic equipment and video footage before releasing them. The commander of the 
security forces stated that the gathering was held without an official permit and that the security 
forces had to prevent the gathering from taking on a political dimension.  On 7 March 2006, the 
Interior Ministry had summoned several women&#8217;s rights activists and warned them to cancel the 
gathering planned for 8 March 2006.   
304. Concern is expressed, particularly at the use of force by the authorities, to bring an end to 
what was reportedly a peaceful assembly in celebration of an internationally commemorated day. 
Concern is further expressed in view of the fact that security forces have, according to 
information received, repeatedly resorted to violence to support peaceful gatherings in past 
months. For example, in January 2006 security forces in Tehran attacked and arrested hundreds 
of striking bus drivers who were protesting their working conditions. In February 2006 in the 
city of Qom, security forces also reportedly resorted to the use of force and tear gas to detain 
hundreds of Sufi followers who had gathered in front of their house of worship to prevent its 
destruction by the authorities.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Urgent appeal 
</b> 305. On 31 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding F.H.- P. 
who was sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of her husband, a drug addict who had tried 
to rape her 15 year old daughter. F.H.-P. was already the subject of an urgent appeal by the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on Violence against women on 11 February 2005 and by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on 12 October 2004. Those 
communications drew the attention of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the fact 
that that F.H.-P. reportedly did not have access to adequate legal assistance in the course of her 
trial. We appreciate the responses of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (dated 21 
October 2004 and 27 May 2005) and welcome the review of her case by the local judicial 
authority and the likelihood of a clemency order from the Head of the Judiciary. However, we 
have recently been informed that her stay of execution has been rescinded by the Supreme Court 
and that her execution is reportedly scheduled to take place by or before 1st April. <i>

306. On 13 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding four women belonging to the Ahwazi Arab 
community in Iran and their children, namely M. K. (aged 28) and her son A. (aged 4), H. H. 
(aged 24) and her sons A. (aged 4) and O. (aged 2), S. K. and her son Z. (aged 4), and S. N.  307. According to the information received: M.K. is the wife of Ahwazi political activist  H. N., 
who has fled Iran. She was arrested on 8 March 2006 together with her son A. and is held at 
Sepidar prison, Ahwaz city, Khuzestan province. It is alleged that H.N. was informed that his 
wife and son will be tortured or killed if he does not return to Iran.  H. H. is the wife of Ahwazi 
activist  H.F. She was arrested together with her sons A. and O. on or around 31 March 2006. 
They are currently held at an unknown location. Ms. S.K. is the wife of Ahawazi activist Mr. 
K.D.K. K. and her son Z. were arrested on an unknown date and are currently held at Sepidar 
prison. S.N., the wife of Ahwazi activist A.N., was three months pregnant when she was arrested 
on 27 February 2006 and taken to Sepidar prison. As a result of health problems she had 
problems with her pregnancy and lost her baby. The authorities destroyed her husband&#8217;s family 
home in Ahwaz by bulldozers following her arrest. No charges are known to have been raised 
against any of the women and children detained. We are concerned that your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government might be depriving them of their liberty in order to exercise pressure on their 
husbands.<i> 
<b></b></i><b> 
Response from the Government 
</b> 
308. On 2 June 2006, the Government, with reference to the letter dated 13 April 2006 of L. Z., 
informed that, following receipt of the urgent appeal by the Special Rapporteurs on the situation 
of H.H., M.K., S.K. and S.M, a thorough investigation has been carried out by the judiciary. No 
legal record of H.H. and S.K. has been found. M.K. and S.N. have been charged with &#8220;measures 
against security of the State&#8221; and both have been released on bail on 15 May 2006 and 19 April 
2006 respectively.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Allegation letter  
 
</b>309. On 26 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an allegation letter to the Government to bring to its attention the 
information concerning L.M, who  had been the subject of previous transmitted communications 
(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.1 para. 97 and 112).   310. According to the information received: In February 2006, she was subjected to 99 lashes at 
the headquarters of the Justice Department in the city of Arak. She was subsequently moved to a 
women&#8217;s rehabilitation centre in Tehran, where she is obliged to stay for eight months. On 27 
March 2005, the Supreme Court overturned the death sentence, but upheld the sentence of 
flogging. The case was sent back to the Court of First Instance in Arak for a retrial. In October 
2004, L.M. was acquitted of the charge of incest (which carries the death penalty), and of 
controlling a brothel. However, she was convicted of an &#8220;unchaste act with a next of kin (other 
than fornication)&#8221; and was sentenced to 99 lashes.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Urgent appeal 
</b> 311. On 16 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 57 
</p>
<p> 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
hundreds of women and men who participated in the peaceful demonstration, demanding 
legislative change to ensure equal rights in Tehran.  312. According to the information: Hundreds of women and men gathered at Haft Tir Square in 
downtown Tehran on 12 June 2006, and participated in a peaceful demonstration in demand for a 
better recognition of women's rights and to remove discriminatory clauses against women from 
Iran's legal code.    
313. It is reported that prior to the demonstration, the Judiciary summoned and interrogated 
numerous women's rights activists. On 10 June 2006, agents of Judiciary visited prominent 
activists at their homes to issue summons. Those who were summoned include N.A.K., P.A., 
S.T., Z.A. and F.D.M. F.D.M. has been interrogated by judiciary agents of the Revolutionary 
Court in Tehran for 10 hours. In the morning of 12 June, security forces arrested another human 
rights activist S.E. at her work.   
314. On 12 June 2006, before the demonstration started, the security forces started to beat the 
participants with batons, sprayed with tear gas and color spray, and took them to custody. A 
spokesperson for the judiciary has reportedly confirmed that security forces arrested 70 people, 
including 42 women, to prevent the demonstration to take place. Those who were arrested at the 
demonstration site include: A.A.M.K., former Member of the Parliament and human rights 
activist; J.B., D.A., Ms. S.S., B.H., L.M., B.A.A., S.T. and F.S. According to the spokesperson 
for the judiciary, they are charged with participation in an illegal assembly.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 315. The Government, with reference to the letters dated 16 June 2006 informed me that 
according the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, regarding illegal demonstrations in 
Teheran, following that incident all detainees except one have been released. The one who 
remain in custody is A.A.M.K., who has been charged with disturbing public order and 
instigation against the state. He enjoys the legal services of three prominent counsels, namely 
S.E., A.S. and M.S. Investigations about the case are under way and should be sentenced in the 
court; he has to serve a term of imprisonment.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Urgent appeal</b> 
 
316. On 28 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding A.K., a mother of four 
children between the ages of nine and nineteen.    317. According to information received:  A.K. had an extra marital affair after her divorce 
request was rejected by the court, reportedly on the basis that she had children with her husband 
and therefore had to resume living with him. She was sentenced on two charges; the first was for 
participating in the murder of her husband, for which she received a sentence of 15 years 
imprisonment; the second was for adultery as a married woman, for which she was sentenced to 
execution by stoning. Article 83 of the Iranian Penal Code stipulates that the penalty for adultery 
by a married woman with an adult man is execution by stoning. A woman sentenced to stoning is </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 58 
 
to be buried in the ground up to a line above her breasts (art. 102 Penal Code) before being 
stoned that should not be large enough to kill the person by one or two strikes, nor so small that 
they could not be defined as stones (art. 104 Penal Code).  
318. A.K. has been held in Tehran's Evin prison for five years and should by law serve the 
remaining ten years of her prison sentence before she is executed. However, in July 2006, she 
received the order for the implementation of her sentence, and is reportedly due to be executed 
by stoning before the end of July.   
319. In death penalty cases where the charge is adultery, according to article 72 of the Penal 
Code, if a person confesses to adultery and subsequently repents, the Judge can ask for his or her 
pardon by the Supreme Leader. Article 4 of the Implementation of Execution Law states that, 
after repentance, the case must be referred to the Parole Commission. A.K. has reportedly 
written to the Head of the Judiciary, A.S., asking for forgiveness.  
<b>Response from the Government </b> 320. On 4 September 2006 the Government replied to the letter of 28 July 2006 and informed 
that A.K. has been charged with &#8220;adultery&#8221; and being an accomplice in her husband&#8217;s murder&#8221; 
and accordingly sentenced to stoning and 15 years of imprisonment. The case is under review 
and the final verdict is still pending. The Government informed also that moratorium of Judiciary 
on stoning sentences is still in place.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Urgent appeal 
</b> 321.   On 2 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding six women, including  S.G., K.N. and 
S.M. who have been sentenced to death by stoning for adultery.  322. According to the information received: S.G. (also known as M.), arrested in June 2005, 
was sentenced to execution by stoning for adultery by a court in Oromieh in June 2006. She is 
reportedly held in Oromieh prison. Her brothers and husband reportedly murdered a man that 
they found in her house, and she too was nearly killed after they stabbed her with a knife. S.G.&#8217;s 
case is reportedly being re-examined.  
323. K.N. was allegedly forced into prostitution by her husband, a heroin addict who was 
violent towards her. In 1995, after a severe beating by her husband, she told one of her regular 
customers that she wanted to kill her husband. The customer allegedly murdered her husband 
after K.N. took him to an arranged meeting place. He was sentenced to death, but he was 
pardoned by the victim&#8217;s family, to whom he paid <i>diyeh</i> (blood money). K.N. was sentenced to 
eight years' imprisonment for being an accomplice to the murder of her husband and to execution 
by stoning for adultery. She was scheduled to be executed after serving her prison sentence, 
which was finished two years ago. She has reportedly written to the Judicial Commission for 
Amnesty to ask for her sentence of execution by stoning to be commuted, and is awaiting a 
reply. K.N. is detained in Tabriz prison and is at imminent risk of execution.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
324. S.M. was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for being an accomplice to the murder in 
January 2004 of her husband A. and to execution by stoning for adultery. During interrogation 
she said that she was subjected to domestic violence by her husband and that she did not kill him. 
She added that on the night of the incident after A. killed her husband, she ran away with him 
because she was scared to stay at home, thinking that her brothers-in-law would kill her. A. was 
sentenced to death for the murder of S.M.&#8217;s husband and to 100 lashes for &quot;illicit relations&quot;. The 
sentences are pending examination by the Supreme Court. It is believed that S.M. is detained in 
Reja'i Shahr prison, Karaj, near Tehran.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government to an urgent appeal sent in 2005 
</b> 325. On 14 November 2005, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an urgent 
appeal concerning the imminent execution of L.M. According to information received, her death 
sentence had, at the time this communication was sent, been commuted and she then faced a 
sentence of flogging and three and a half years in prison. The Supreme Court reportedly 
overturned the verdict issued in 2004 but upheld the sentence of flogging, sending the case back 
to the Court of First Instance in the city of Arak for a retrial. The Court of First Instance 
acquitted L.M. of the charges of incest and controlling a brothel. She was however found guilty 
under article 637 of the Penal Code of an &#8220;unchaste act with a next of kin (other than 
fornication).&#8221; She was sentenced to 99 lashes for this offence. She was also found guilty of 
&#8220;providing the facilities for corruption and prostitution by being available for sexual acts&#8221; and 
sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment for this offence. 326. By letter dated 25 January 2006, the Government informed that L.M. had been ultimately 
convicted for facilitating corruption by way of sexual acts. Since she did not have a personal 
residence, the court has ruled that she will reside in a rehabilitation centre of the Social Security 
Organization at least for eight months to ensure her physical and mental integrity, and to provide 
her with adequate housing. During this period she will receive social workers&#8217; assistance to get 
prepared for reintegration into the society and to assume her normal life. The allegations of 
torture are categorically denied.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Observation 
</b> 327. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to her 
communications dated 14 November 2005, 10 February 2006, 13 April 2006, 16 June 2006, and 
28 July 2006. She would like to ask the Government to keep her informed on any developments 
with regard to these cases and would also appreciate receiving information concerning other 
cases addressed in the same communication. </p>
<p>328. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving the Government&#8217;s reply to her 
communications of 14 March 2006, 31 March 2006, 26 April 2006, and 2 October 2006.    329. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her appreciation to the Iranian authorities for their 
cooperation during her visit to the country in January 2005. She looks forward to maintaining a 
positive dialogue with the authorities and in this context deem it important to reiterate some of 
the recommendations contained in her mission report (E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.3), including that 
the Government ensure that the right to a fair trial is fully respected and that all women detained </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 60 
 
are brought to trial, with access to a lawyer and legal aid where necessary, without undue delay. 
The Government must also ensure that punishments do not discriminate against women, that 
they are proportionate to the offence, and that they are determined by a court of law in 
accordance with the principles of equality and non-discrimination.  
330. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that the moratorium on the execution of sentences of 
stoning, announced by the Chief of Judiciary in 2002, seems to be still in place. At the same time, 
however, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her recommendation to the Government 
to reform the Penal Code and abolish legal provisions foreseeing cruel punishments such as 
stoning and flogging.  
331. Finally, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her recommendation to implement 
the provisions of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in order to ensure that women 
human rights defenders are able to carry out their work with full autonomy and without being 
subjected to retaliation by the State or other actors. </p>
<p><b>Iraq 
Allegation letter 
</b> 332. On 20 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur and Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders have sent an allegation letter to the 
Government to bring its attention to the information received concerning the late F. A. J., a 
women&#8217;s rights activist from Haweeja who was the head of the women&#8217;s rights organization 
Maternity and Childhood. 333. According to information received: On 27 October 2006, a group of about 10 unidentified 
men broke into F. A. J.&#8217;s home in the town of Haweeja, 43 km from Kirkuk. The men shot and 
killed her.    
334. In the past, she had repeatedly received death threats. She had cooperated in the course of 
her human rights work with international organizations and, before it ceased to exist, the 
Coalition Provisional Authority. Sources allege that the murderers may be linked to local Islamic 
militias.  
335. As of 14 November 2006, only two suspects, both men from Haweeja, had been arrested in 
connection with the murder. Reportedly, F. A. J.&#8217;s brother has filed a criminal complaint against 
at least two more local suspects, named Y.N.A. and K.K.I.  
336. Concern is expressed that F.A.J. was murdered because of her activities in the promotion 
and defence of women's human rights.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Observation 
</b> 337. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government, while formally acknowledging 
receipt of her communication dated 20 November 2006, has not provided a substantive reply to 
the allegations and concerns shared with the Government. She expresses her wish to be kept 
informed of the outcome of any investigations and prosecutions carried out in relation to this </p>

the allegations submitted. </p>
<p><b>Israel 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal</b> <b> 
 
</b>338. On 20 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 22-year-old S.I.S. of 
Tulkarem, currently detained in Hasharon Military Prison.   339. According to the allegations received, S.I.S. was arrested by Israeli forces on 23 September 
2005 when she was pregnant.  During her arrest, she was removed from her home, forced to strip 
naked in an Israeli military vehicle and put on a white robe. Following the incident, the soldiers 
tied her hands and legs with plastic wires. While in the Maskobia Interrogation Center, S.I.S. 
was subjected to invasive body searches. She was also brutally beaten during her interrogation. 
The interrogators, who knew she was pregnant, also threatened to beat her to the point of 
miscarriage. Soldiers placed her husband in a nearby room in order to apply psychological 
pressure. Her cell was humid and had little ventilation. She said the prison food is of poor quality 
and quantity and that prison administrators use special lighting to psychologically disturb the 
prisoners.   
340. On 30 April 2006, Israeli forces took S.I.S. from the prison in Telmond to the Mei'r Kfar 
Hospital for the delivery of her baby. According the information received, her legs and hands 
were cuffed until the moment she entered the delivery room where she gave birth to her first son. 
Neither the detained husband and father of the child, nor other relatives were allowed to attend 
the birth operation, which was done by caesarean surgery.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b> 341. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not reply to her communication of 
20 June 2006 and would like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply from the Government in 
regard to the allegation submitted. </p>
<p><b>Kyrgyzstan 
</b></p>
<p> <b>Urgent Appeal</b> 
 
342. On 17 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding the alleged trafficking of over 60 women and girls from various Central Asian 
countries. 343. On 14 February 2006, Kyrgyz security forces reportedly removed more than 60 women 
and girls from a plane in the southern city of Osh, which was set to transport them to the United 
Arab Emirates, allegedly for the purpose of sexual exploitation.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 62 
 
344. According to the information received, the women and girls, aged between 17 and 38 - 
including 58 Uzbek nationals, one Tajik, one Kyrgyz and one Turkmen - were smuggled into 
Osh in small groups in early February 2006 and had been kept at private apartments prior to the 
flight. They had passed through passport and customs control at Osh airport and were sitting on 
an aircraft preparing to leave for Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates when they were 
intercepted and taken to a detention centre in the city. The basis for detaining the group was 
illegal crossing of the border and violation of Kyrgyz migration rules. However, the head of the 
regional office of the Kyrgyz National Security Service (NSS) reportedly declared &quot;We have 
evidence that all the girls were being trafficked, with trafficking gangs supposed to meet them in 
the Emirates.&quot;   
345. Sources estimate that 4,000 women and girls are trafficked annually from or through 
Kyrgyzstan for purposes of sexual exploitation. Traffickers recruit young women mainly from 
rural areas in Central Asia promising them jobs as waitresses, nannies, cooks, saleswomen and 
dancers in the United Arab Emirates or other countries. Upon arrival in the destination country, 
the women are forced to prostitute themselves. Debt bondage is very often used to subdue the 
women and perpetuate their exploitation.   
346. Osh has reportedly become a regional transit hub for the trafficking of Central Asian 
women, especially Uzbek and Tajik women. Uzbek women are increasingly trafficked via 
Kyrgyzstan because of stricter exit controls at Uzbek airports, which aim to curb trafficking in 
persons but also the free movement of political and human rights activists. Sources also allege 
that some Kyrgyz law enforcement officials collaborate with the traffickers.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government  
</b> 347. By letter dated 24 March 2006, the National Security Service of the Kyrgyz Republic 
(SNB) stated that as part of measures taken to block transborder channels for trafficking in 
persons, the SNB on 14 February 2006 stopped 60 citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan, one 
Turkmenistan citizen and one Kyrgyzstan citizen from traveling on an Osh-Al-Fujairah (UAE) 
charter flight from Osh airport.  The grounds for detaining the citizens of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan were violations of the regulations on staying in and crossing the State border of the 
Kyrgyz Republic. </p>
<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 63 
</p>
<p> 
350. On 17 February 2006, the Kyrgyz SNB Investigative Department initiated a criminal case 
in their respect based on evidence of offences under articles of the Criminal Code. However, 
taking into account the fact that four of the above-mentioned citizens of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan are victims of labour trafficking, on 21 February 2006 they were transferred to the 
custody of the Osh representative office of the International Organization for Migration. 
Furthermore, as it was established that one of the organizers and links of the transborder channel 
of people trafficking and illegal migration of citizens of Uzbekistan are representatives of tourist 
firms, criminal proceedings were also brought against them pursuant to the Criminal Code .  
351. With a view to the implementation of the National Plan of Action for Gender Equality in 
the Kyrgyz Republic, the SNB is carrying out work to prevent and reduce gender violence in 
society, prohibit trafficking in persons, and also to afford protection and support for victims of 
trafficking and to raise public awareness of the problem of violence.  
352. In particular, from 2004 up to the present the Kyrgyz SNB has initiated 10 criminal cases 
in relation to such offences and is conducting preventive and educational work through the mass 
media, as well as cooperating closely with IOM to release from forced detention citizens of the 
Kyrgyz Republic in countries further abroad.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Allegation letter 
</b> 353. On 18 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning T.  354. According to the information received, in the week following 14 January 2006 T. was 
repeatedly summoned by the Department of Internal Affairs  to testify as a witness in a case of 
theft. During one of the sessions, one of the investigators, grabbed her arms, pushed her and 
began insulting her, calling her a &#8220;prostitute&#8221; and a &#8220;thief&#8221;. When she asked what she was 
insulted and beaten for, the investigator hit her on the chest and requested that she deny her 
testimony, threatening her that he would &#8220;do everything possible to put [her] in prison and let 
[her] die there&#8221;. T. started bleeding and told the officer that she was pregnant and feared she 
could lose her baby. The officer allegedly replied that &#8220;at a temporary detention cell [she] will 
conceive another baby&#8221;. The victim managed to escape eventually.   
355. After these events, T. was taken to a Suzak maternity hospital where the head of the 
maternity department, stated that T. was at &#8220;risk of termination of pregnancy.&#8221; She recovered, 
however, and on 23 January 2006 she could return home.   
356. T. reported these facts to the Oblast Prosecutor&#8217;s office. However, she feared nothing 
would be done in this regard since similar complaints against the same officer had been filed 
with the Oblast Prosecutor earlier, in response to which no action was taken. For this reason, the 
human rights organization Spravedlivost addressed these cases directly to the Minister of the 
Interior.  
357. Subsequently, the officer in question filed a lawsuit against T. and members of the NGO 
Spravedlivost, requesting 25,000 US dollars on the basis of alleged defamation.  </p>

<b>Response from the Government  
</b> 358. By letter dated 4 July 2006, the Government informed that a judicial inquiry had been 
carried out into the alleged beating and insulting of Ms. T. by the staff member of the Internal 
Affairs Office of Jalalabad province, and by staff members of the security service of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic. 359. During the inquiry, the allegations made by T. were not substantiated. Nor was any 
substance found to the allegations made by T in previous communications submitted to various 
offices. The implicated investigator has filed an application with the Jalalabad city court for 
criminal charges to be brought against T. under articles 128 and 129 of the Criminal Code, for 
defamation and insult.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Urgent appeal 
</b> 360. On 13 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding R.I., a 20-year-old Kyrgyz 
citizen.  361. According to the information received: R.I., 10 weeks pregnant, was arrested on 20 July 
2006 and taken to the Isolation Ward of Temporary Allowance (IVS) of Jalal-Abad. She was 
reportedly beaten by a policeman, chief of the Regional Department of Internal Affairs, in order 
to force her to denounce her husband, who was suspected of involvement with an extremist 
organization called &#8220;Islamic movements of Uzbekistan&#8221;. He surrendered to the police 
immediately after he learned that his wife had been ill-treated.   
362. R.I. was subsequently taken to the Kyzyl-Jarsk psychiatric hospital, where she was once 
again severely beaten on 26 August 2006 by the same policeman. She was immediately 
transferred to the gynecologic department of the Tash-Kumyr city hospital. There, the doctors 
certified that her fetus was dead. R.I. is now at the Kyzyl-Jarsk hospital under police surveillance 
and suspected of &#8220;concealment of criminals&quot;.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Allegation letter 
</b> 363. On 23 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent an 
allegation letter concerning R.G.D., an 82-year-old woman living in Ananievo, Issyk-Kul.  364. According to the information received, during the night of 22 April 2005, R.G.D. was raped<b> 
</b>in her home by a man she was able to identify. The alleged perpetrator ordered her to cover her 
eyes with a blanket and demanded to know whether she recognized him. She denied knowing 
him, and promised not to report him to the police, fearing for her life. The next morning, R.G.D. 
reported the incident to the police. She underwent a physical examination, which confirmed that 
she was raped. R.G.D. then turned to the Oblast Prosecutor&#8217;s office. The Prosecutor informed her 
that the suspect was under investigation and that he had provided a written undertaking not to 
leave the area.  He claimed that the case would be sent to court once the investigation was </p>

<p> 
completed.  Later, however, the Assistant Prosecutor in Cholpon-Aty Mairambek informed 
R.G.D. that her case had been transferred to the Oblast authorities.   
365. To date, there has been no trial regarding this matter<b>. </b>Reportedly, the suspect was 
interrogated by three investigators, but bribed them in order to terminate the investigation.  
Sources allege that the suspect publicly boasted that he has enough money to guarantee his 
impunity.    
366. The Special Rapporteur understands that impunity for rape and alleged impunity in the 
other forms of sexual violence has recently intensified. I am concerned about the increasingly 
widespread practice of &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221;, whereby a woman or girl is taken against her will 
through deception or force and forced to marry one of her abductors. Sources allege that the 
abductors are often intoxicated and act in groups, using physical or psychological coercion to 
compel the woman to &#8220;agree&#8221; to the marriage. These marriages are reportedly rarely registered 
with the state. Instead, a Muslim cleric conducts the ceremony or the occasion is privately 
celebrated. It is further alleged that kidnapped women are often raped by the abductors, but fail 
to report the crime for fear of repercussions. The abductions occur within all parts of Kyrgyzstan, 
both urban and rural. The women involved are typically under the age of 25. Some victims are 
also minors. Despite the fact that article 155 of the Criminal Code, outlaws non-consensual 
marriage by force or kidnapping, it is reported that the perpetrators are typically not prosecuted 
for the crime and enjoy impunity for the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation that is committed. I 
was also informed that the police often fail to even investigate reported cases of bride 
kidnapping. Sources state that many police officers do not view bride-kidnapping as an issue for 
law enforcement, but consider it to be a legitimate traditional practice.<i>

367. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply of 24 March 2006 
regarding trafficking of over 60 women and girls. She would appreciate receiving follow-up 
information about the outcomes of the criminal investigations and proceedings which have 
already been initiated. The Special Rapporteur also thanks the Government for its reply of 4 July

September 2006 regarding R.I. and neither to her communication of 23 November 2006 
regarding R.G.D. and the practice of bride-kidnapping. The Special Rapporteur would therefore 
like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply from the Government with regard to the 
allegations submitted. </p>

Allegation letter  
</b> 369. On 12 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the 
rapes of two girls aged 9 and 12.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 66 
 
370. According to information received: On 27 February 2006, a 9-year old girl was allegedly 
raped by a 19-year old man in Lofa County. When the family reported the matter to the 
authorities, the Circuit Sheriff Court allegedly tried to extort a bribe of LD 350 from the victim&#8217;s 
father to arrest the alleged perpetrator. It is furthermore alleged that the Magistrate of Voinjama 
also demanded a payment of LD 300 to issue an arrest warrant. The judge reportedly claimed 
that the money was needed to cover the cost of transporting the alleged perpetrator to jail.   
371. On 7 March 2006, after the victim&#8217;s father had paid LD 100 to the Magistrate, the alleged 
perpetrator was arrested and sent to pre-trial detention. The next day, the prison authorities 
released the man pursuant to a written order by the Magistrate to the prison authorities stating 
that the man &#8220;is under bond in court with two sureties&#8221;. Since then the authorities have 
reportedly not taken any further steps in the matter.   
372. In March and April 2005, J.K., a 48-year old Pastor of the Living Word Pentecostal 
Church, allegedly raped A.K., a 12 year-old girl from Todee District (Montserrado County), on 
three separate occasions using physical force to overcome her resistance. J.K. allegedly 
threatened the victim to kill her, if she told her mother about the rapes. A.K. only told her mother 
about the alleged rapes, when the mother discovered that she was pregnant. When the mother 
confronted J.K. about the issue, he allegedly gave her 250 Liberian dollars that was meant to 
arrange an abortion.   
373. The family reported the alleged incidents to the Careysburg Police Detachment. However, 
the police initially decided that there was no need to arrest J.K. or initiate criminal proceedings 
against him since he had taken steps to settle the issue amicably with the victim&#8217;s family. 
Following an intervention by the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) J.K. was arrested, 
taken to the Careysburg Magistrates&#8217; Court and later transferred to the City Court in Monrovia.   
374. On 16 May 2005, a pre-trial conference was held in the chambers of the Stipendiary 
Magistrate of the City Court, where the defendant&#8217;s counsel attempted to settle the case by 
offering a promissory note signed by J.K. to the victim&#8217;s family. The document contained a 
pledge to provide support to the victim during her pregnancy and take financial responsibility for 
the care of the child. The family refused the settlement offer and requested the Assistant County 
Attorney to proceed with the prosecution of the case. The case was forwarded to the First 
Judicial Circuit Court Criminal Court &#8220;A&#8221; for trial.  Reportedly, the grand jury hearing the case 
later attempted to exhort LD 1,500 to allow the victim to testify. When the family refused to pay 
the requested bribe, the grand jury refused to hear the case.<i>

<b>Libya 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation letter 
 
</b>376. On 10 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning the arbitrary detention of women and girls in social rehabilitation facilities.  377. According to information received, the General Secretary of Social Affairs supervises and 
administers several so-called social rehabilitation facilities, including the Benghazi Home for 
Juvenile Girls and the Social Welfare Home for Women in Tajoura. According to an internal 
bylaw, the facilities are to provide housing for &#8220;women who are vulnerable to engaging in moral 
misconduct.&#8221;   
378. Women and girls detained in these facilities include women who are accused or have been 
convicted of having transgressed Law No. 70 (1973) criminalizing extramarital sexual relations. 
Others have already served their sentences but are transferred to the facilities because no male 
family member would take custody of them. In addition, there are women and girls, including 
victims of rape, who have never been charged or convicted of a crime, but have to fear ostracism 
or violence, because their families suspect them of having engaged in extramarital sexual 
relations.   
379. The majority of women and girls are forced to undergo intrusive and degrading virginity 
tests before being committed to a facility.   
380. Women and girls, including those who were never charged or convicted, are reportedly 
detained in the social rehabilitation facilities for indeterminate periods of time and physically 
prevented from leaving. Even adult women are usually only allowed to leave if their father or 
another close male relative agrees to take custody of them. Alternatively, they can obtain their 
release through marriage, often to a stranger who specifically approaches the facility looking for 
a bride.   
381. The facility determines which women &#8220;qualify&#8221; for marriage based on their &#8220;moral 
character&#8221;. Over the past five years, nineteen women were reportedly married this way. The 
facility personnel are authorized to discipline detained women and girls with solitary 
confinement of up to seven days. Women and girls have reportedly been sent into solitary 
confinement on grounds such as &#8220;talking back&#8221; or smoking. Girls in the Benghazi Home also 
reported that they had been hand-cuffed while in solitary confinement.   
382. Finally, it is reported that girls in the Benghazi Home are not given access to education, 
except for religious instruction and sewing lessons.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 383. On 23 March 2006, the Government replied and stated that the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; 
statements on social rehabilitation facilities show little awareness of the values of Libyan 
society.  They bespeak ignorance of the Islamic values that prevail in that society, and of the 
customs and traditions that play an important role in the forging of relationships among the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 68 
 
individuals in society and the shaping of their view of reality.  By way of illustration, the custom 
of avenging honour by means of honour killings is found in some regions.  Similarly, a woman 
suspected of immoral conduct tends to be regarded with abhorrence and rejected by her family.  
These customs, incidentally, are also found in other States in the region.  The competent 
authorities are endeavoring to eradicate them by changing the concepts associated with them 
through heightened awareness, outreach activities and education.  Nor do the customs and 
traditions of Libyan society accept that women and girls should be left to their fate in the street, 
with unknown associates.  Consequently, it is essential to develop methods of treatment and 
measures to minimize the repercussions of these matters. 384. Children&#8217;s homes, boys&#8217; homes, girls&#8217; homes, homes for the aged and infirm, homes for 
women (social rehabilitation facilities) and correctional facilities for juveniles are social 
institutions.  With the exception of correctional facilities for juveniles, they are not penal or 
correctional institutions.  All of them are run by the Social Solidarity Fund, which is responsible 
for the welfare of incompetent persons and young persons who have no legal guardian and no 
means of leading a life of dignity.  These various homes provide integrated health and social care 
free of charge in a framework of solidarity among the individuals who make up society, and in 
accordance with the values of the blessed Islamic Sharia and the principles of the Third 
Universal Theory.  
385. These facilities, their functions and the legislation that regulates their work may be 
summarized as follows.  Social rehabilitation facilities provide safe havens for women who have 
no means of support and nowhere to go, or women who are charged with a criminal offence and 
consequently must be detained pursuant to judicial procedures in one of these facilities, having 
regard to their circumstances and the circumstances of the offence with which they are charged.  
Their situation in the facility is quite different from what it would be in an institution of 
correction and rehabilitation (prison) for women:  the purpose of their detention is to avoid an 
adverse impact on their social situation, from the standpoint of the traditions and customs that 
prevail in Libyan society.  Women in the first-mentioned category enter the facility voluntarily, 
for various reasons:  Some of them have no homes because they have quarreled with their 
families, especially those who are suspected of having engaged in immoral behaviour, while 
others have no means of earning a decent living and caring for their families, perhaps because of 
the death of the person who was supporting them or other family members.  Women in this 
category have the right to leave the facility whenever they consider it appropriate to do so. 386. These social measures arise from Libyan society&#8217;s respect for women and its efforts to 
preserve their dignity and ward off any danger of their exploitation by others.  It should be noted 
that the legislation governing these facilities requires the preparation of skills development 
programmes for women residents who have no particular skills in order to enable them to obtain 
jobs.  Educational programmes are provided for them as well, and those who wish are allowed to 
complete their schooling.  In addition, the facility offers a job placement service and helps them 
to found families of their own by facilitating marriage for those whom so desire, or by 
reconciling them with their families.  
387. Women in the second category are those who are being held as a judicial measure.  They 
live in a separate wing of the facility.  They are there because they are charged with such 
offences as homicide in connection with a traffic accident.  Such matters as how long they may 
be detained in the facility and means of supervision are regulated by the Code of Criminal </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 69 
</p>
<p> 
Procedure.  The rules governing precautionary detention set forth in the Code apply in these 
cases.  
388. Residents of the Home for Juvenile Girls fall into two categories.  The first category 
comprises two groups: (a) a group consisting of girls who have been ordered held in 
precautionary detention by the Office of the Public Prosecutor pending investigation of charges 
against them, or are serving a sentence imposed by a juvenile court under the Penal Code and the 
Code of Criminal Procedure; and (b) a group consisting of girls whom a juvenile court has 
assigned to residence in the Home because they have been found to be homeless, in accordance 
with the provision of the Homeless Juveniles Act.  
389. The second category comprises girls who have served a sentence or completed court 
ordered administrative measures, and have subsequently been transferred to the Home (where 
they live in a separate wing) because their families have refused to have them back.  The 
question then arises as to how this situation should be dealt with.  Should these girls be left to 
their fate in the streets, with nowhere to live, no families and no means of support, and possibly 
at risk of revenge measures?  Or should they be placed in a social institution until they come of 
age, at which time they may decide whether to remain in the Home or to leave it?  If these 
juvenile girls are to be protected from exploitation, crime and vengeance, it is imperative for 
them to be placed in the Home, where they receive education, training and skills development 
that will enable them to become integrated safely into society or try to return to their families.  
390. The Government concluded its response by reaffirming its commitment to human rights. <i>

<p><b>Maldives 
Urgent appeal 
</b> 392. On 10 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government to bring its attention to the information regarding F.S. who is an active member of 
the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP).  393. According to information received: On 19 February 2006 at around 2.30 a.m., twelve 
policemen in plain clothes came to the house of F.S. in Male&#8217;. When her mother opened the 
door, three policemen forced their way into the house. They proceeded to arrest. F.S., who was 
only wearing a T-Shirt and pants without her underwear at the time of the arrest. She pleaded 
with the police to allow her to get appropriately dressed before being taken away but the police 
refused, apparently trying to humiliate the young Muslim woman. As of 6 April 2006, F.S. was 
reportedly still in detention.   
394. On 29 March 2006 at around 9.30 p.m., a number of women supporters of the MDP 
gathered at Minivan Park in Male&#8217; to plan a demonstration against abusive police behaviour 
during the arrest of female suspects, when a group of young men locally known as parteys hurled </p>

pellets of oil and urine at them. It is alleged that the young men acted on the instruction of 
certain government members.   
395. Concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of F.S. may represent an attempt to 
intimidate and prevent her from promoting human rights values in her work. Concern is also 
expressed that the incident of 29 March 2006 may represent an attempt to further harass, 
humiliate and prevent women human rights defenders from peacefully demonstrating against 
abusive police behaviour during the arrest of female suspects and publicly raising human rights 
concerns.<i>

et r&#233;partis dans des foyers &#224; Nwar, d&#233;partement de Tidkikja, dans la r&#233;gion du Tagant.  
400. Les  personnes retenues dans le foyer de Ehl Abidine Ould Saka sont S., 20 ans, O. L., 
orpheline de 15 ans, et S., orphelin de10 ans, T., orpheline de 5 ans, et F., orpheline de 6 ans. Le 
foyer de Ehl Hamady Ould Saka retiendrait O., une femme d'environ 70 ans ainsi que deux 
gar&#231;ons, E.K.O.M., 13 ans, et B.O.M., &#226;g&#233; d'environ 16 ans.  
401. Dans cette affaire, une organisation non-gouvernementale (ONG) qui lutte contre 
l'esclavage aurait &#233;t&#233; confront&#233;e &#224; l'opposition des autorit&#233;s, dont le gouverneur adjoint de la

vieille femme aurait &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;e du foyer de Ehl Hamady Ould Saka.  
402. Dans cette r&#233;gion du Tagant o&#249; seraient retenues les personnes susmentionn&#233;es et o&#249; les 
militants anti-esclavagistes seraient accus&#233;s de nuire &#224; l'image du pays, un sentiment d'impunit&#233; 
r&#232;gne et l'esclavagisme demeure. Les autorit&#233;s charg&#233;es de l'application des lois refuseraient 
souvent de reconna&#238;tre des situations d'esclavage. En Mauritanie, la possibilit&#233; d'une &#233;radication 
de ce fl&#233;au d&#233;pendrait surtout de la volont&#233; des autorit&#233;s administratives et judiciaires d'appliquer 
la l&#233;gislation nationale et les normes internationales dans leur pays.  
403. En 1981, suite &#224; la publication d'une ordonnance, l'esclavage a &#233;t&#233; aboli en Mauritanie. 
Cependant, aucune loi d&#8217;application de ce texte n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; vot&#233;e afin de parvenir &#224; une abolition 
effective. Cette ordonnance, qui proclame l'ill&#233;galit&#233; de l'esclavage, n'en donne pas de d&#233;finition

identificaci&#243;n y en las exequias.  
415. El 31 de enero de 2006, la Procuradora General de Justicia se reuni&#243; con los parientes de 
S.D.A.M. para informarles acerca de la investigaci&#243;n y para presentarles a los encargados de 
realizarla. Asimismo, se les ha brindado informaci&#243;n oportuna de los progresos realizados dentro

ordenando en el inciso <i>a</i> del articulo 120 del c&#243;digo de Procedimientos Penales del Estado de 
Chihuahua, establecer las medidas particulares de vigilancia de los domicilios de los familiares 
de S.D.A.M.  
417. Se han practicado diversas diligencias con el objeto de recolectar las pruebas pertinentes 
para la comprobaci&#243;n de la probable responsabilidad de quien perpetr&#243; el delito; para tal efecto, 
se han recabado diversos testimonios y se han establecido diversas l&#237;neas de investigaci&#243;n.  
418. Ya que a&#250;n no se ha ejercido la acci&#243;n penal en contra de ninguna persona, no es

<b></b></i><b>Llamamiento urgente 
</b> 419. El 18 de julio de 2006, la Relatora Especial, juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre la 
independencia de los magistrados y abogados y el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, transmiti&#243; un llamamiento 
urgente al Gobierno sobre el caso de S.M.J., estudiante ind&#237;gena de 20 a&#241;os, quien vive en el 
Estado de Guerrero. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida: 420. El 6 de abril del 2005, en su camino hacia la escuela, S.M.J. fue violada por un agente de 
polic&#237;a, quien le puso una pistola en la espalda y la oblig&#243; a tener relaciones sexuales. La 
estudiante pudo observar a su captor quien portaba un uniforme de polic&#237;a. Despu&#233;s de la 
violaci&#243;n, su captor la amenaz&#243; dici&#233;ndole que ser&#237;a in&#250;til que denunciara los hechos ante las 
autoridades puesto que &#233;l trabajaba en la polic&#237;a y no recibir&#237;a ninguna sanci&#243;n.  
421. Los familiares de S.M.J. denunciaron los hechos ante el Ministerio p&#250;blico investigador. El 
mismo d&#237;a fue detenido A.G.A., un polic&#237;a preventivo del Municipio de Tlapa de Comonfort, 
quien fue reconocido por la v&#237;ctima sin temor a equivocarse como responsable del delito de 
violaci&#243;n. El 7 de abril de 2005, A.G.A. fue puesto a disposici&#243;n del Juzgado de Primera 
Instancia en materia Penal de la ciudad de Tlapa, bajo el cargo judicial de violaci&#243;n, en el 
expediente penal 58/2005-III. Sin embargo, hasta el d&#237;a de hoy el juez no ha dictado sentencia.  
422. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, durante el proceso judicial el juez no ha actuado de manera 
imparcial. Por una parte, se alega que &#233;ste tuvo una conducta hostigante hacia S.M.J., puesto que 
la oblig&#243; en tres ocasiones a enfrentarse a su agresor, haciendo preguntas sobre su vida privada, 
y poniendo varias veces en duda sus alegaciones, a pesar de que ella hab&#237;a manifestado su total 
certidumbre frente a los hechos. Por otra parte, el juez habr&#237;a recurrido a m&#233;todos de dilaci&#243;n. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 74 
 
As&#237;, se habr&#237;a negado a resolver el caso aduciendo que a&#250;n faltaban pruebas por practicar, a 
pesar de que ninguna de las dos partes ha solicitado mayores medios probatorios. Asimismo, el 
Juzgador de oficio habr&#237;a  pedido recientemente la pr&#225;ctica de una prueba de muestras de semen 
del inculpado; sin embargo, esta prueba no tendr&#225; ninguna utilidad, puesto que a pesar de que 
hace m&#225;s de un a&#241;o en el cuerpo de Socorro se detect&#243; semen de su violador, ya ha pasado 
demasiado tiempo para que se pueda determinar el ADN de dichas muestras.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Respuesta del Gobierno 
 
</b>423. El 13 de septiembre de 2006, el Gobierno transmiti&#243; la informaci&#243;n siguiente: 424. S.M.J. present&#243; una denuncia ante la autoridad  ministerial el 6 de abril de 2005. Derivado 
de dicha denuncia, la autoridad ministerial dio inicio a una averiguaci&#243;n previa por el delito de 
violaci&#243;n cometido en contra de S.M.J., perpetrado por A.G.A., Polic&#237;a del Municipio de Tlapa 
de Comonfort, Estado de Guerrero. Una vez recabada la declaraci&#243;n ministerial de S.M.J., el 
ministerio p&#250;blico dio fe del estado f&#237;sico de victima, del billete que exhibi&#243; la agraviada en su 
declaraci&#243;n, e instruy&#243; al m&#233;dico legista a realizar el certificado m&#233;dico ginecol&#243;gico, que arroj&#243; 
las siguientes conclusiones:  
425. Seg&#250;n el certificado m&#233;dico ginecol&#243;gico, S.M.J. &#8220;&#8230; es p&#250;ber, presenta huellas de 
violencia f&#237;sica; tres excoriaciones d&#233;micas de 2.5 cm x 3mm. de forma separada y oblicua, 
ubicada en regi&#243;n externa del muslo izquierdo a nivel del tercio medio; presenta sugilaci&#243;n 
(chupet&#243;n) de 1.5cmm x 5mm ubicado en cuadrante extremo seno derecho; presenta dos 
desgarros de caracter&#237;sticas recientes, ubicadas a las 6 y 11 horas comparativamente con la 
car&#225;tula de un reloj; presenta huellas de c&#243;pula reciente, no presenta, signos ni s&#237;ntomas de 
enfermedad ven&#233;rea; no presenta signos ni s&#237;ntomas de embarazo; presenta edema (inflamaci&#243;n 
moderada) e hiperemia (enrojecimiento moderado) de vulva y cavidad vaginal, observ&#225;ndose 
l&#237;quido seminal en moderada cantidad en cavidad vaginal, con presencia de arena en genitales 
externos y en borde interno de ambos gl&#250;teos. A la palpaci&#243;n refiere dolor de mediana intensidad 
de regi&#243;n p&#250;bica; asimismo, se tom&#243; muestras de cavidad vaginal para la b&#250;squeda e 
identificaci&#243;n esperm&#225;tica&#8221;.  
426. Las muestras de exudado vaginal de la agraviada fueron remitidas al &#225;rea de Servicios 
Periciales, para que se designara perito en materia de qu&#237;mica forense y que previo estudio y 
an&#225;lisis de las muestras, determinara la existencia de l&#237;quido seminal en las mismas. De acuerdo 
a los resultados obtenidos, se identificaron espermatozoides de 2 a 3 por campo de cavidad 
vaginal.  
427. El 6 de abril de 2005, A.G.A. fue puesto a disposici&#243;n del ministerio p&#250;blico, como 
presunto responsable del delito de violaci&#243;n. En ese mismo acto se orden&#243; la retenci&#243;n legal y 
practic&#243; las siguientes diligencias:

Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations 
</b> 434. Le 13 juin 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la 
vente d'enfants, la prostitution d'enfants et la pornographie impliquant des enfants, et le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la traite des personnes, en particulier les femmes et les enfants, a envoy&#233; 
une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations concernant<b> </b>des abus perp&#233;tr&#233;s contre des enfants travaillant comme 
domestiques. 435. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, il semblerait qu&#8217;un nombre &#233;lev&#233; d&#8217;enfants domestiques 
dans des maisons priv&#233;es commencent &#224; travailler avant d&#8217;avoir atteint l&#8217;&#226;ge de 10 ans. Selon les 
statistiques officielles provenant d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te sur la main d&#8217;&#339;uvre dat&#233;e de l&#8217;an 2000, il 
semblerait que 11 % des enfants &#226;g&#233;s de 7 &#224; 14 ans seraient actifs dans le march&#233; du travail.   
436. Cette situation concernerait surtout les filles, &#226;g&#233;es de moins de 15 ans, appel&#233;es 
commun&#233;ment &#171; petites bonnes &#187;. La situation de leur exploitation &#233;conomique avait d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; </p>

signal&#233;e dans le rapport de la visite de la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale de l&#8217;&#233;poque lors de sa visite au 
Maroc en 2000 (. E/CN.4/2001/78/Add. 1, par.10 &#224; 20).  
437. Les informations re&#231;ues pr&#233;cisent que les &#171; petites bonnes &#187; employ&#233;es comme 
domestiques ou servantes dans les maisons priv&#233;es seraient originaires de r&#233;gions rurales du 
Maroc o&#249; la pauvret&#233; et le manque d&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; l&#8217;enseignement seraient &#224; l&#8217;origine de leur 
embauche comme domestiques. La majorit&#233; des enfants seraient recrut&#233;s &#224; travers des 
interm&#233;diaires, des agents recruteurs connus comme &#171; samasra &#187; qui, sur sollicitation des parents 
ou autres membres de la famille des enfants accepteraient de &#171; placer &#187; ceux-ci chez un 
employeur &#224; travers leurs connaissances, amis, contacts ou voisins. Dans d&#8217;autres cas, les enfants 
seraient plac&#233;s directement chez l&#8217;employeur par les parents eux-m&#234;mes.  
438. Les enfants travaillant comme domestiques recevraient un salaire tr&#232;s minime (l&#8217;&#233;quivalent 
de 0,04 $ &#224; 0,11 $ par heure) ou, dans de nombreux cas, ne seraient pas pay&#233;s du tout, 
l&#8217;employeur se chargeant seulement de les loger et les nourrir et de leur acheter parfois quelques 
biens n&#233;cessaires. La majorit&#233; des enfants embauch&#233;s comme domestiques seraient astreints &#224; 
des horaires de travail ext&#233;nuants, pouvant aller de 14 &#224; 18 heures par jour. Beaucoup de ces 
enfants seraient victimes d&#8217;abus physiques ou &#233;motionnels de la part de leur employeur. 
Certaines filles seraient aussi victimes d&#8217;abus sexuels de la part de leur employeur.  
439. Bien que l&#8217;emploi des mineurs de moins de 15 ans soit interdit par le Code du travail, le 
travail des enfants domestiques se ferait de fa&#231;on informelle et ils ne seraient pas prot&#233;g&#233;s par les 
normes du Code du travail. De plus, les inspecteurs du travail ne seraient pas habilit&#233;s &#224; entrer 
dans des maisons priv&#233;es et enqu&#234;ter sur les violations aux normes du Code du travail qui 
interdit sous toute forme le travail des mineurs de moins de 15 ans, et les autres formes d&#8217;abus 
dont seraient victimes les enfants employ&#233;s comme domestiques.  
440. De plus, les pouvoirs publics, notamment la police, le parquet et les juges seraient r&#233;ticents 
&#224; appliquer les sanctions pr&#233;vues dans le Code du travail pour l&#8217;emploi de mineurs en dessous de 
l&#8217;&#226;ge autoris&#233; et de celles pr&#233;vues dans le Code p&#233;nal interdisant les abus dont seraient victimes 
ces enfants. Les parents de ces enfants seraient aussi r&#233;ticents &#224; intenter des poursuites au nom de 
leurs enfants, &#233;tant donn&#233; que de telles proc&#233;dures sont co&#251;teuses, longues et ne garantissent 
aucun r&#233;sultat ni b&#233;n&#233;fice. De plus, dans beaucoup de cas ce sont ces m&#234;mes parents qui ont 
plac&#233;s leurs enfants &#224; travailler comme domestiques.   
441. Les informations re&#231;ues concluent qu&#8217;il serait difficile, voire impossible pour les enfants 
plac&#233;s comme domestiques de pouvoir se soustraire &#224; cette exploitation. Beaucoup craindraient 
des actes violents ou d&#8217;autres repr&#233;sailles de la part de leur employeur s&#8217;ils &#233;taient rattrap&#233;s apr&#232;s 
leur fugue. Les filles auraient aussi peur d&#8217;&#234;tre attaqu&#233;es ou abus&#233;es seules dans la rue. Certains 
d&#8217;entre eux profiteraient de f&#234;tes publiques ou de jours f&#233;ries pour pouvoir sortir de la maison et 
rentrer dans leur famille<i>

<b>Myanmar

<p><b> 
Allegation letter  
 
</b>443. On 28 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the 
trial against the alleged rapists of M.S.S., a 30-year old mother of three children residing in 
Myathida ward, Twente town, Yangon Division.  444. According to information received, on 12 June 2005 at around 10.30 p.m. three police 
officers allegedly raped M.S.S. in the Nyaung area of Twente town. Subsequently, the two police 
constables offered her money so that she would not press criminal charges. When she refused, 
the investigating police of Twente Township Police Station subjected her to hostile interrogations 
and other forms of intimidation. Nevertheless, she managed to register her case in Twente 
Township court.   
445. There are reports about undue delays in the trial against the two constables. According to 
section 78 (c) (d) of the Attorney General Regulations, it is required that a criminal case is 
opened within six months after the offence occurred. In the event that this is not the case, the 
concerned law office must report on the reasons for the delay and superior authorities may give 
instructions to expedite the case. However, the Twente Township Court, with Judge U Zaw Zaw 
Thein presiding, reportedly opened the proceedings only on 2 January 2006.   
446. As of 1 March 2005, long after the prosecution had closed its case, only the three 
defendants themselves had been heard by the court. Ostensibly to further delay the proceedings, 
the lawyer of the accused has called seven witnesses who reportedly cannot contribute any 
relevant testimony. Nevertheless, the court has admitted all seven witnesses.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Observations 
</b> 447. The Special Rapporteur regrets for not having received a reply to communication of 
28 March 2006. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply 
from the Government in regard to all allegations submitted in 2006 and 2005.

<p><b>Nepal 
Allegation letter</b> 448. On 6 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an allegation letter to the Government of Nepal concerning police 
harassment and beatings of persons who are men by birth but identify as women (known as <i>metis</i> 
in Nepal).   449. In a communication dated 7 November 2005, the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women already brought to the 
Government&#8217;s attention allegations that police had harassed and physically abused several <i>metis</i>. 
Since then, additional attacks have reportedly occurred.   </p>

450. Early in the morning on 7 December 2005, police from the Shore Khutte station raided a 
hotel in the Thamel district of Kathmandu. The raid was reportedly a retaliatory measure against 
the hotel for refusing to provide a room free of charge to four policemen where they intended to 
have sexual relations with two <i>metis</i>. During the raid, eleven <i>metis</i> were arrested. Eight were 
held without charge for five days, before they were released. The other three were even detained 
for six days.   
451. On 27 December 2005, a <i>meti</i>, S., was detained in Shore Khuttee Police Station. She was 
not promptly informed of the reasons for her arrest and detention, was not given access to a 
lawyer and did not have adequate access to a toilet.   
452. On 28 December 2005 at about 1.30 a.m., police arrested S., another <i>meti</i>, and took her to 
Shore Khutte police station. Police at the station verbally abused her and commanded her to 
strip. When she refused, they stripped her forcibly of her clothes and touched her genitals while 
mocking her. They also threatened to cut her hair off as punishment for wearing women&#8217;s 
clothes. She was released the next day.   
453. On 31 December 2005 at about 11 p.m., police from Shore Khutte police station detained a 
<i>meti</i> from the Thamel district. One policeman beat her with a bamboo baton calling her 
derogatory names. She escaped, but her right hand is reportedly swollen and badly bruised.   
454. On 3 January 2005 at about 10 p.m., three <i>metis</i> were walking in the Thamel district, when 
four police from Durbar Marg police station reportedly saw them and shouted: &#8220;<i>Metis</i>! Kill 
them!&#8221; One <i>meti</i> was beaten with a baton on her back; one policeman pulled his gun and pointed 
it at her, threatening that &#8220;These <i>hijras </i>[local Nepali term for transgender persons] pollute the 
society and must be cleaned out.&#8221; The other two <i>metis</i> were also severely beaten. All three 
reportedly had bruises on various parts of their bodies.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Allegation letter  
</b> 455. On 13 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning the trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nepalese girls in brothels in 
Calcutta and Mumbai, India. 456. According to the information received, Nepalese girls, at an average age of 14 to 16 years, 
are trafficked from Nepal to brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai where they are required to work as 
prostitutes in debt bondage. The girls are trafficked against their will and without knowledge of 
their destination. The traffickers are reported to be Nepalese men and women, who sell the girls 
to (Nepalese) brothel owners in Calcutta and Mumbai, at a price of approximately 60,000 to 
70,000 Indian rupees (US $ 1,360-1,590) in Calcutta and 100,000 to 120,000 Indian Rupees (US 
$ 2,270- 2,720) in Mumbai. There is no evidence of extensive networks of traffickers and 
trafficking seems to take place though an informal network with the collaboration of community 
members, employers, local officials, border officials and others such as those who operate &#8216;safe 
houses&#8217;  where trafficked girls are kept prior to their sale.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 79 
</p>
<p> 
457. Initially the girls are not taken to the brothels directly, but given some time to adjust to 
their new situation, in outside homes, sometimes owned by the brothel owner. After being told 
the work that is required of them, how to dress and behave and after being convinced that they 
themselves, or their families, have incurred a debt which they will have to pay off by working as 
a prostitute after which they are &#8216;free&#8217; to leave, the girls are put to work as <i>tsukri</i> (the Bengali 
word for child in slavery or debt bondage).   
458. When they start to work as <i>tsukris</i>, the girls are usually aged between 15 to 18 years. They 
often work in brothels that are referred to as &#8216;bungalows&#8217;: brothels that occupy a flat, usually on 
the first or higher floors of a building, often with a shop on the ground floor. The bungalow is 
distinguished by a channel gate (a sliding iron accordion gate) at the entrance to the brothel. 
When locked, the channel gate is virtually impenetrable; making escape from the brothel 
impossible for the <i>tsukris</i> kept inside. The area within Calcutta that contains most bungalow-type 
brothels with <i>tsukris</i> is Sonagachi; whereas in Mumbai brothels with <i>tsukris</i> can be found mainly 
in Kamathipura, although due to police raids these types of brothels are said to have moved to 
other cities in India or areas outside the known brothel areas.   
459. It is reported that while clients of the brothels do not have a specific preference for <i>tsukris</i>, 
they do prefer Nepalese prostitutes to other prostitutes.   
460. Under the <i>tsukri</i> system the brothel owner retains all of the fees paid by clients for the 
services provided to them by the <i>tsukris</i>. Considerable profits accrue from the use of <i>tsukri</i> 
system: brothel owners are said to earn four to twenty times the purchase price of the <i>tsukri</i> over 
the period of her servitude. The initial purchase price is recovered by the brothel owner, on 
average, in little over five and a half months. A Nepalese <i>tsukri</i> is also said to cost less than an 
Indian <i>tsukri</i> and because of continued client demand for Nepalese girls, the returns are higher. 
On occasion the brothel owner may also offer &#8216;special services&#8217; such as a <i>tsukri&#8217;s</i> virginity or oral 
or anal sex as well as sex without a condom, at a special price. The total period the girls spend in 
confinement as <i>tsukris</i> varies from two to ten years.   
461. After paying their &#8216;debt&#8217; and being released from bondage, it is often very difficult for 
<i>tsukris</i> to go back to Nepal. They fear isolation and reprisals from family and community 
members. Many of them take up work as free-agent sex workers, earning their own fees by doing 
street prostitution or paying tenancy to brothel owners. Escape prior to being released is not only 
very difficult because the girls are kept in confinement; there is also fear of being brought back 
to the brothels, either by police or other community members followed by severe physical 
punishment, as well as a more general fear of &#8216;India outside&#8217; since few <i>tsukris</i> had a clear idea of

</b></p>
<p>462. On 23 January 2007, the Government responded to the letter dated 13 April 2006 
informing the Special Rapporteur that Nepal had adopted a series of both policy and programs to 
control the crime of trafficking in persons. Broad-based and multi-pronged strategies are put in 
place to address this problem in its entirety that involves prevention, strengthening of 
administrative and law enforcement measures and, rescue and rehabilitation. Towards the 
preventive front, the issue of poverty, especially among women, is being addressed within the 
framework of the Tenth five-year development plan (2002-2007). In addition, other sectoral </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

plans and programs of the government ministries including micro-finance schemes are geared to 
reducing women&#8217;s poverty. These efforts are supported by skills promotion programs and 
vocational training schemes. Particular emphasis is given to enhancing educational opportunities 
for girls at the formal and informal level such as programs of scholarships, enforcement of 
compulsory universal primary education. The Government noted that it was also working with 
civil society organizations, social workers, media persons, and girl students in promoting 
awareness among people, focusing on trafficking-prone areas. 463. As the Government&#8217;s legal commitment and institutional arrangements, national laws have 
been formulated, amended and reformed, action plans devised to effectively deal with the 
problem. The Trafficking in Persons (Control) Act, 1987, as amended in 2003, which has 
incorporated harsher penalties to the culprits and elaborated provisions to address new 
complexities of trafficking, is a comprehensive legal framework that governs investigation, 
prosecution and punishment of the crimes related to human trafficking. Furthermore, a National 
Plan of Action against Trafficking in Children and their Commercial Sexual Exploitation (NPA) 
was formulated in 1998. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare (MWCSW) has 
outlined 13 priority areas to control trafficking of women and children such as public awareness 
campaign, non discriminatory laws, cooperation with NGOs and donor agencies, harsh penalties 
to the traffickers and exploiters or rehabilitation programs for the rescued women and children. 
In July 2001, a review of the National Program of Action was undertaken and the issue of 
trafficking of women was included with 8 broad strategic objectives.  464. Concerning the targeted activities, it added that the MWCSW is currently working as the 
national focal point for implementing the NPA and all other activities geared against the 
trafficking of women and children. A high level National Coordination Committee to Control 
Trafficking in Women and Children (NCC) headed by the Minister of MWCSW, is in place and 
includes representatives from various line ministries and NGOs. Under the NCC, there is a 
broad-based National Task Force, representing senior officials of the relevant government 
departments and NGOs and INGOs working in this area, which coordinates activities at the 
national level and provide guidelines. Moreover, there are District and Village/Municipality level 
task forces that are implementing preventive and curative activities against trafficking and 
Women Development Offices are entrusted to work as the Secretariat.    
465. The Government indicated that the Nepal Police has created a Women&#8217;s Cell at its 
headquarters, which has also launched awareness programs in various districts with regard to 
trafficking and related exploitation. It has set up 16 Women&#8217;s Cell in its district level security 
units and has also implemented a five year long project to train and mobilize the police in 
awareness raising and prevention of trafficking. There are also several instances of apprehension 
of the traffickers and victims by the vigilant Nepal Police, often in collaboration and cooperation 
of civil society actors, before the traffickers sneak the girls from Nepal-India borders. Such girls 
are then either handed over to their parents or sent to rescue homes for education and income 
generating training. In addition, the Government of Nepal has established a rescue/emergency 
fund in certain districts which are considered as major transit points of trafficking victims. The 
Ministry of Labour also prepared in 1995, and a revised version in 2001, a National Master Plan 
on Child Labour that includes trafficking in children as an important component of the action 
programs. Other activities were mentioned such as a &#8220;women self-reliance and rehabilitation 
home&#8221; run by the MWCSW since 1998. </p>

acquits an accused, the Office of the Government Attorney files appeal to the higher court for the 
review of the verdict. Finally, the Government specified that there are instances of compensation 
to the victims. Half of the penalty amount accrued from the convicted criminal of trafficking is 
awarded to the victim or her/his minor children, in case the victim has already died.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Allegation letter  
</b> 470. On 1 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning M.R.C., a human rights outreach worker and member of the Blue 
Diamond Society.  471. Members of the Blue Diamond Society were subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health on 12 August 2004. The Blue Diamond Society is a NGO working with sexual minorities, 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons on health issues, including outreach 
education and prevention of HIV/AIDS, and campaigns for non-discrimination against persons 
based on their sexual orientation in Nepal.   
472. According to the information received: On 7 July 2006 evening, M.R.C. and other <i>metis</i> 
working in the Tri Devi Marg area in Thamel were verbally abused by members of the Durbar 
Marg Police when M.R.C. questioned them as to why photos and videos were being taken of the 
<i>metis</i>. Previously that day, the Durbar Marg Police had arrived in Thamel, and proceeded to 
record on video a group of <i>metis</i>. One of the police officers gave instructions to the cameraman 
as to the whereabouts of the <i>metis</i>. The <i>metis</i> attempted to escape and hide their faces from the 
camera, but were reportedly forced to show their faces. The police threatened to arrest and detain 
them if they didn&#8217;t cooperate. Furthermore, it is alleged that the police falsely told the <i>metis</i> that 
they were sent by the Director of Blue Diamond Society in an attempt to film them.   
473. Concern was expressed that the above acts of verbal abuse against M.R.C. may be related 
to her human rights activities, specifically her outreach work with Blue Diamond Society. In 
addition, concern was expressed that the events represent a sustained campaign by police to 
harass, intimidate and humiliate <i>metis</i> in Nepal, including by sexual violence. <i>

Allegation Letter 
</b> 490. On 3 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning the murders of S. B., her husband A. N. B., her 5-year old son L. A. and her 3-year-
old daughter H.  491. According to information received, S.B. and her two children were shot and killed in their 
home village of Mohammad Bux Odhu, Taluka Garhi Khero, District Jacobabad, Sindh Province

492. Eight years earlier, S.B. had married A.N.B. against her family&#8217;s will. Subsequently, the 
married couple fled their hometown of Ratodero, District Larkana to live in Mohammad Bux 
Odhu. Sources allege that the brothers committed the murders with the intent to restore their 
family&#8217;s &#8220;honor,&#8221; which they considered tarnished by S.B.&#8217;s decision to exercise her right to 
choose her husband and marry.   
493. Reportedly, neither brother nor any of their accomplices have been arrested and all six men 
remain at large.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government

<b></b></i><b>Allegation letter 
</b> 495. On 18 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the alleged kidnapping 
and abuse of G.S. and her mother M. M., and her father M.H., from Chak Sher Khan, Kabirwala 
Town, all members of the lower Batti caste. 496. According to allegations received on 25 August 2006, G.S. returned to her home village to 
announce that she graduated first class with a Master of Arts in Education from Zakarya 
University. The educational success of a lower caste person allegedly aroused the envy of 
villagers belonging to the Mirali upper class.   
497. During the night from 25 to 26 August at approximately 1:00 a.m., a group of about 12 
men, including several police officers in uniform, forcibly entered G.S.&#8217;s family home. The men 
beat her father with boots, iron sticks and gun butts.<b> </b> They then kidnapped G.S. and M.M. They 
dragged them from their home while continuously beating and sexually taunting them. They 
were subsequently imprisoned in a house in Kabirwala Town, where they both were gang raped 
over the course of several days. Despite complaints by their relatives, the local police initially 
refused to register the case and only raided the house on 5 September 2006. In the course of the 
raid, police officers allegedly arranged for the perpetrators to escape and take their victims with 
them. However, concerned local citizens managed to free the two women and arrest and hand 
over to the police three of the suspected perpetrators.   
498. Local police officials, whose names are known to the Special Rapporteur, have allegedly 
pressured the victims not to speak to anyone about the case. The Deputy Superintendent and Sub 
Inspector, a relative of one of the suspects who was reportedly appointed on short notice as 
Saddar Station Head Officer, also ordered them to leave the area or face dire consequences. 
G.S.&#8217;s teaching contract at a local school was also abruptly terminated. As of 28 September 2006, 
no criminal action had been taken against any of the perpetrators.   </p>

<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 500. On 14 December 2006, the Government replied to the allegation letter regarding G.S. The 
Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the matter was referred to the District Police 
Officer for report. He has stated that the case FIR NO.395/06 dated 26.82006 u/s PPC, Police 
Station Saddar Kabirwala, was registered on the report of M.H., complainant to the effect that on 
the intervening night of 25 to 26 August 2006 accused known suspects of forcibly abducting his 
daughter and his wife from his house. Motive behind the occurrence was that the brother of the 
said complainant had allegedly abducted the wife of one of the accused.   501. Initial investigation of the case was conducted by Sub Inspector Falak Sher, Incharge 
Investigation Cell, Police Station Saddar Kabirwala. Many raids were conducted on the possible 
hideouts of the accused, but they could not be arrested. The accused, along with their families, 
left their homes due to fear of arrest. The accused N. is a resident of District Jhang. Raids were 
also conducted in districts Jhang and Layyah. After strenuous efforts both abductees were 
recovered on 5 September 2006. He was arrested, and the weapon along with black shirt and 
pants were recovered from him. In this connection, case FIR No. 428/06 dated 11 September 
2006 u/s 13/20/65 AO was registered at the Police Station Saddar Kabirwala and he was sent to 
the judicial lock-up.  
502. G.S. in her statement u/s 164 Cr. P.C recorded by the Illaqa Magistrate did not mention the 
commission of <i>zina</i> (rape). Her application for medical examination was turned down by the 
Illaqa Magistrate as she refused to get herself medically examined. Subsequently, on 13 
September.2006, the compliant party submitted an application with the Illaqa Magistrate for the 
medical examination of G.S., wherein, the Lady Medical Officer stated that rape had been 
committed. Therefore, section 10 (4)/7/79 ZO was added. Later on, the accused received interim 
bails from the court of the learned Additional Session Judge, Kabirwala until 13 October 2006.   
503. On 13 October 2006, the pre-arrest bails of the accused were fixed for argument in the 
court of learned Additional Session Judge, Kabirwala. SHO, Police Station Saddar K. along with 
the case file presented himself before the court. The counsel for the accused requested the court 
for the adjournment. On 19 October 2006, the bails of five accused were cancelled. They were 
arrested and their physical remand was obtained till 24 October 2006. However, the pre-arrest 
bail of two accused was confirmed by the said court on the statement of the complainant that 
they had taken Safaee from both the said accused and they were innocent. Three of the accused 
are military personnel. Therefore, the concerned Commanding Officers have been moved to 
direct the said accused to join the investigation.   
504. Regarding complaints contained in the letter of the Asian Human Rights Commission 
against the police and others, the matter was referred to SP/Investigation, Khanewal to inquire 
into the matter and submit a factual report. As per his report, he heard both parties and also 
recorded their statements including those police officers who have been allegedly involved in the 
matter under reference on the following:  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 88 
 
</p>
<p>(a) Involvement of the police officials in the abduction and rape of G.S.: during inquiry, 
neither any police officer/official has been found involved in the abduction and rape nor has any 
police officer/official been found involved in extending help of any sort to the accused after the 
recovery of G.S.. During the inquiry, it was also found that all sympathies of police 
officers/officials including DSP K. were with the complainant side.  
</p>
<p>(b) Provision of shelter by the DSP, K. to the accused persons: The DSP/SDPO, K. never 
extended any help of any sort to the accused party. He was found to be supervising the 
investigation of the case properly with zeal and zest extending all efforts with the complainant 
party. One of the accused has been arrested and sent to jail, whereas the pre-arrest bails of five 
accused have been cancelled from the court and the learned ASJ and now they are on physical 
remand and are being interrogated.  
</p>
<p>(c) Involvement of local politicians in this case as per police record: No politician of Sub-
Division Kabirwala has been found directly or indirectly involved in this case seeking help for 
accused and opposing the complainant side. However, it has come to light that S.H.J.G., 
Provincial Minister, is extending moral support to the complainant in this case.  
</p>
<p>(d) Threats to the victim and her family by the DSP K. and SHO S.K. to leave the town 
immediately: The alleged allegation has been found absolutely baseless and frivolous. The said 
officers as well as local police have found extending all out efforts to provide justice to the 
complainant side.

Letter of allegation 
 
</b>506. On 17 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants sent a letter of allegation regarding the alleged abusive work conditions 
and ill treatment of L.D.O., a Philippine domestic helper working in Qatar. According to the 
information received, L.D.O, age 25, went to work as a domestic helper in Qatar in October of 
2005. In December 2005, she telephoned her mother to complain that her employer ( A.M.A.K.) 
had beaten her and that, contrary to the contract she had signed; she was forced to work from 
7.00 to 10:00. On April 22, 2006, L.D.O. called her mother again to complain that three members 
of her employer&#8217;s family ( A.A.K.,  M.A.K. and  R.A.K.) had seriously beaten her, resulting in 
multiple abrasions on her upper body and upper lip, and pain at the back of her body. She was 
then taken to the airport and forced to board an airplane back to the Philippines. Various items of 
her property were taken and wages owed for the last two months of her employment remained 
unpaid. Once in the Philippines, she was admitted to hospital as she complained of headaches 
and pain all over her body. Complaints have allegedly been lodged with: the Department of 
Foreign Affairs in Manila, the Philippine National Police in Manila, the Office of the 
Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Administration in Manila, and the Philippine Overseas </p>

Embassy in Qatar and also the Qatar Embassy in the Philippines. It is unclear if any action has 
been taken. <i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 507. By letter dated 15 June 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 17 May 
2006 concerning L.D.O. The Government stated that the Philippine Embassy in Doha, Qatar, 
could not make a definite determination on the accuracy of the facts and that its knowledge of 
the case is based on documents submitted by the victim, which include police and medical 
reports. Embassy officials had no opportunity to interview L.D.O. as the complaint was filed 
when she was already in Manila. The Embassy has requested the assistance of a local lawyer to 
handle the filing of a case with the Qatari police. The lawyer has requested for a Special Power 
of Attorney authorizing her to file both criminal and civil cases. This authorization is yet to be 
received from the victim. The Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
Embassy would discuss the case with Qatari authorities, including the office responsible for 
human rights, to avoid similar cases in the future. The Embassy also recommended that the 
Special Rapporteur refer the case to the local office in Doha of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. The Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs is closely monitoring the case and is in constant 
communication with the sister of the victim concerning developments in the case. Finally, the 
Embassy indicated that it planned to negotiate a Philippines-Qatar labour agreement that would 
include provisions on the safety and welfare of overseas Filipino workers in Qatar.<i>

a motorcycle and entered the shop. A. Abanador-Gandia suffered eight gun shot wounds to her 
head and body.   
510. Grave concern is expressed that the killing of A. Abanador-Gandia may be connected with 
her activities in defense of human rights, in particular because of her pro-democracy activism. 
Particular concern is expressed that the killing of A. Abanador-Gandia forms part of a campaign 
to silence human rights defenders in the Philippines.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 511. By a letter dated 8 September 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 3

Office of the City Prosecutor, Balanga City. Both suspects belong to the National Police 
Commission. At the time of writing, the case was pending preliminary investigation before the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office and the complaint was docketed as I.S. No. CP-162-06.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Urgent appeal  
</b> 512. On 30 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal concerning W.M,, aged 26, 
detained at Quezon Provincial Jail in Lucena City. According to the information received, W.M. 
was arrested on 25 November 2005 in Barangay village, Plaridel Ilaya, Plaridel, Quezon, on 
suspicion of being a member of the New People&#8217;s Army (NPA). She was detained at various 
venues since then. She was also pregnant at the time of her arrest. The arrest was carried out by 
members of the 76th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army, (commanded by Lieutenant 
Juanito Paraso.) 513. The military produced no warrant to W.M. upon arrest. She was held at the military 
headquarters until 30 November 2005. While in the military&#8217;s custody, she was intimidated, 
forcibly interrogated, and denied sleep, food, and medicine. Death threats were uttered against 
her to make her agree to join the Civilian Auxiliary Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU). The 
military provided a physician to examine her, who prescribed medicine for her pre-natal care. 
However, the military interrogators, (led by Lt. Paraso,) allowed her food and medicine only on 
condition of her cooperation in order to secure a confession and information about her alleged 
comrades of the NPA.  
514. W.M. gave birth at the Southern Luzon Command Hospital (SOLCOM) on 22 December 
2005. She did not receive adequate medical attention for her postnatal care. On several occasions 
a member of the 76th Infantry Battalion (Lt. Paraso) called on her in the hospital, where she 
remained under arrest. W.M. suffered from bleedings when she was interrogated and intimidated 
during these visits.    
515. On 27 January 2006, the military forcibly removed W.M. from the hospital despite the fact 
that her health was still precarious. She was taken back to the military camp of the 76th IB in 
Barangay Villa Principe, Gumaca, Quezon, where the authorities failed to provide her with 
adequate medical attention and facilities. She was detained at the military camp in an 
overcrowded cell with little ventilation. She was not permitted to leave her cell or to contact her 
relatives. More attempts were made to force W.M. to join the CAFGU and become a speaker for 
the counter-insurgency campaign in village assemblies organized by the military.  
516. After more than eight months in detention, W.M. was still not aware of the exact charges 
against her. W.M. was not provided with access to legal counsel for the first five months of her 
detention. It was only in the first week of April 2006 that she was finally taken to the Regional 
Trial Court, Branch 62, in Gumaca, Quezon, for the preliminary trial of her case, at which time 
she found out that she was being charged with rebellion.   
517. On 17 July 2006, the Court ordered the transfer of W.M. from military custody to the 
Quezon Provincial Jail in Lucena City, where she is presently detained. Her seven-month-old son 
is living in Lucena City under the care of her aunt.  W.M.&#8217;s health condition has been negatively 
affected by a lack of nutrition and adequate medical care. </p>

</p>
<p> 
 
518.  W.M. has been suffering from intermittent cold and fever. Her health condition has been 
affected by a lack of nutrition and medical facilities.&#8221;  
519. Concern is expressed as regards the health and physical integrity of  W.M. caused by 
alleged ill-treatment, malnutrition and lack of medical care both before and after the birth of her 
child.<i>

<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government to an allegation letter sent in 2005 
 
</b>537. On 3 May 2005, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Rapporteur on the question of 
torture sent a letter of allegation concerning ABI, aged 60, Anastacia Mission Village in Brgy, 
Lumbayao, Aloran, Misamis Occidental. According to the allegations received, on 8 March 2005 
at 2 pm, she was arrested at her house by 10 masked and armed men, wearing fatigue shorts, who 
identified themselves as members of the Criminal Investigation and Detention Group. No 
reasons were given for her arrest. She was blindfolded and handcuffed and taken in a panel truck 
in the direction of Ozamis City. Three hours later she was brought to the headquarters of the 1st 
Infantry &quot;Tabak&quot; Division, Philippine Armed Forces, Pulacan, Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 93 
</p>
<p> 
For the first four days in custody, she was held in solitary confinement, left in a room, hog-tied 
and blindfolded. On the fifth day, she was taken to the Southern Command Headquarters, 
Zamboanga City. There she was tortured to force her to confess her involvement with the 
communist movement and to an ambush of personnel of the 10th Infantry Battalion in Sapang 
Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. She was slapped and punched on the waist every time she refused 
to reply, stripped naked, sexually assaulted, insulted, hogtied, blindfolded, and was left naked in 
a cold room. On 15 March 2005, she was presented to the media. She was later taken back to her 
detention cell and blindfolded. She was denied visitors. On 17 March 2005, the Southern 
Command announced that she had been transferred to Molave, Zamboanga del Sur, though she 
was not taken to Pagadian City Jail until 21 March. She was charged with rebellion and was not 
granted bail by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 23, Molave, Zamboanga del Sur. 
Although she was arrested on 8 March her arrest warrant was issued only on 17 March. 538. By letter dated 31 October 2006, the Government informed that according to the Criminal 
Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), on 6 March 2006, ABI, together with at least twenty 
persons, rented the Anastacia Mission Village Function Hall located at Barangay Lumbayao, 
Aloran, Misamis Occidental. The group of ABI introduced themselves to the employees of the 
Anastacia Mission Village as &#8220;herbalist&#8221; who were conducting a seminar on herbal medicine. On 
8 March 2005, while the group was about to leave the village compound, a panel truck loaded 
with at least fifteen armed men forcibly entered the compound and told the group &#8220;<i>wag kayong 
matakot, mga pulis kami, ito lang ang kailangan namin&#8221;. </i>Then the armed men took ABI and 
hurriedly left the place. When interviewed to determine the involvement of any police personnel 
in this case, the Police Supt., the then Police Officer of the Criminal Investigation and Detection 
Team (CIDT) of Misamis Occidental, vehemently denied involvement of any CIDT-CIDG 
personnel under his command in the alleged illegal arrest, maltreatment, torture and sexual abuse 
of ABI. Further investigation is being undertaken by CIDG to identify the suspects. By letter 
dated 27 November 06, the Government informed that ABI is among the co-accused in Criminal 
Case No. 92-10-292 for rebellion, which is pending before Regional Trial Court Branch 23, 
Molave, Zamboanga del sur.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Observations  
</b> 539. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its responses. She would like to thank 
the Government for its reply to the allegation submitted on 30 November 2006 as well as for the 
allegation letter sent 3 May 2005.  </p>
<p><b>Qatar 
Allegation letter  
</b> 540. On 17 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding the alleged abusive work 
conditions and ill treatment of L.D.O., a Philippine domestic helper working in Qatar.  541. According to the information received, L.D.O., a 25 year old Philippine national, went to 
work as a domestic helper in Qatar in October of 2005. In December of 2005, she telephoned her 
mother to complain that her employer, A.M.A.K., had beaten her and that, contrary to the 
contract she had signed; she was being forced to work from 7 am to 10 pm.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 94 
 
542. On April 22, 2006, L.D.O. called her mother again to complain that three members of her 
employer&#8217;s family, A.A.K.,  M.A.K. and  R.A.K. had seriously beaten her, resulting in multiple 
abrasions on her upper body and upper extremities, her upper lip and pain at the back of her 
body. She was then taken to the airport and forced to board an airplane back to the Philippines. 
Various items of her property were taken and wages owed for the last two months of her 
employment remained unpaid.   
543. Once in the Philippines, she was admitted to hospital as she complained of headaches and 
pain all over her body.   
544. Complaints have allegedly been lodged with: the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila, 
the Philippine National Police in Manila, the Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers 
Administration in Manila, and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration POEA in 
Manila; as well as with the Office of The Ambassador, Philippine Embassy in Qatar and also the 
Ambassador Qatar Embassy in the Philippines. It is unclear if any action has been taken.   
545. The Special Rapporteur appeal to the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee to the above-mentioned person the right to be free from any gender-based violence, 
discrimination and abuse.<i> 
 
<b></b></i><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 
546.  By letter dated on 12 July 2006, the Government responded that no complaint or 
communication had been submitted to the competent authorities before this woman left the 
country.  Thus, no judicial or other kind of investigation was conducted into the allegations in 
question. 547. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, as soon as the competent 
authorities were informed about her letter, the Department of Public Prosecutions filed a criminal 
complaint with the Department of Security in the capital, which was registered under the number 
2221/2006 and promised to inform her promptly of any new developments.  
548. The Constitution of Qatar, which was adopted by a popular referendum held in 2003 and 
ratified by His Royal Highness the beloved Emir of the country in 2004, entering into force in 
June of that year, devotes its third chapter (arts. 34-58) to the protection of fundamental rights 
and freedoms. The Constitution espouses the principle of the indivisibility and interdependence 
of human rights, thus guaranteeing economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. Among 
the rights which the Constitution guarantees, the Governement mentions, by way of a non-
exhaustive example, equality before the law, non-discrimination, personal freedom and the 
prohibition of torture.  
549. The rights enshrined in the Constitution have been strengthened and promoted through the 
adoption of a series of statutes and laws and through safeguards established to ensure the 
independence of the judiciary in its capacity as one of the main mechanisms for protecting 
human rights.  The constitutional and legal systems have been further strengthened by the 
creation of institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights both at the 
governmental level (for example, the Human Rights Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and the Department of Human Rights at the Ministry of the Interior), and at the civil level (for </p>

of Women and Children).<b> 
 
Urgent appeal 
 
</b>550. By letter dated on 5 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government to bring its attention to the information regarding three Sudanese citizens currently 
held at the women&#8217;s detention quarters of the Follow-Up and Search Department (i.e. the 
deportation holding facility), M.A.I., and her two daughters F.I.M.A and. H.I.M.A. F.I.M.A., 
who has been a resident of Qatar for 22 years, is married to K.T.F.A., a Qatari national who is 
the father of her two children, A. born in 2003 and M. born 2005. <b> 
 
</b>551. According to information received from the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, who visited the female section of the Follow-Up and Search 
Department on 12 November 2006: On 28 or 29 September 2006, M.I.M.A. (age and current 
location unknown), son of  M. and brother of  F. and  H., was involved in a brawl with a plain 
cloth policeman who did not identify himself as police officer. During that incident M. herself 
was hit by the policeman. On 29 September 2006, before M. and F. could lodge a complaint to 
the police, as they intended to, about 6 police vehicles with more than 20 officers came to their 
house. M. and F. were interrogated and their statement written down. However, they were not 
allowed to control the accuracy of the transcript of their statements. On the same day, 29 
September 2006, they were arrested and transferred to the Follow-Up and Search Department.<b> 
</b> 
552. The three women have neither been informed of any criminal charges against them, nor 
been given a written decision on their deportation, nor been informed of the reasons for their 
detention or of any remedy against their detention or deportation.  <b> 
</b> 
553. K.T.F.A. has not visited his wife at the Follow-Up and Search Department or otherwise 
communicated with her, nor has she been able to see her children. Persons held at the detention 
quarters of the Follow-Up and Search Department have access to a telephone, but they can use 
the phone only to make international calls, not local ones.<b> 
</b> 
554. Without in any way making any determination on the facts and circumstances of this case 
and on whether the detention of M.A.I., and her two daughters  F.I.M.A. and H.I.M.A., is 
arbitrary or not, we would like to appeal to your Excellency's Government, to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee their right not to be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair 
proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Response from the Government  
 
</b>555. By letter dated on 9 February 2007 the Government responded to this urgent appeal. At the 
time of the finalization of this report the response had not been translated from Arabic and will 
be reflected in the next report. <b>

</b> 
563. Par une lettre en date du 6 avril 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la vente d'enfants, la prostitution d'enfants et la pornographie impliquant 
des enfants, a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations au Gouvernement concernant le viol de L.S.K., 13 
ans, et de C.L.N., 17 ans. 
 
564. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, le 15 janvier 2006 aux environs de 19 heures, de retour 
de chez le tailleur de la Commune de Makala, L.S.K. aurait &#233;t&#233; abord&#233;e par un jeune homme 
d&#8217;une vingtaine d&#8217;ann&#233;es qui avait d&#233;j&#224; tent&#233; de l&#8217;approcher sur le chemin de l&#8217;&#233;cole. Ils auraient 
&#233;t&#233; rejoints par six amis du jeune homme. Apr&#232;s avoir b&#226;illonn&#233; la jeune fille avec un foulard 
pour l&#8217;emp&#234;cher de crier, les sept hommes auraient viol&#233; la jeune fille, et ce, de 19 heures &#224; 5 
heures du matin. Ce n&#8217;est que le lendemain qu&#8217;elle aurait &#233;t&#233; retrouv&#233;e par des passants, baignant 
dans son sang. 
 
565. Apr&#232;s avoir retrouv&#233; leur fille, les parents de L.S.K. auraient alert&#233; les officiers de police 
judiciaire du rond point de Ngaba du district de Mont Amba. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, les 
officiers de police conna&#238;traient l&#8217;identit&#233; des auteurs du viol mais auraient indiqu&#233; aux parents 
de la jeune fille ne pas disposer des moyens n&#233;cessaires pour mener des actions &#224; l&#8217;encontre des 
auteurs de ces viols. Actuellement soign&#233;e dans un centre de sant&#233;, L.S.K. souffrirait de 
dommages physiques et psychologiques graves, ne pourrait plus marcher correctement et 
risquerait, selon les m&#233;decins, de ne plus pouvoir avoir d&#8217;enfants. 
 
566. Les Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;s du fait que le 18 f&#233;vrier 2006, 
C.L.N. aurait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; victime d&#8217;un viol collectif. Aux environs de 20 heures dans la 
Commune de Kalamu, elle aurait &#233;t&#233; abord&#233;e par cinq hommes, alors qu&#8217;elle se rendait &#224; une 
veill&#233;e de pri&#232;re avec une amie. Alors qu&#8217;elle tentait de se d&#233;faire de l&#8217;emprise des hommes, 
celui qui semblerait &#234;tre le chef du groupe, aurait ordonn&#233; &#224; l&#8217;un de ses complices de la br&#251;ler 
avec une cigarette pendant que trois hommes du groupe emmenaient son amie. Malgr&#233; leurs 
appels au secours, personne ne serait venu en aide aux jeunes filles. Alors que deux des membres 
du groupe tra&#238;naient &#224; terre C.L.N., deux policiers en civil habitant le quartier auraient interpell&#233; 
les deux hommes mais les auraient finalement laiss&#233;s poursuivre leur m&#233;fait. Conduite de force 
dans une chambrette derri&#232;re un d&#233;bit de boisson, la jeune fille aurait &#233;t&#233; immobilis&#233;e et viol&#233;e 
par les deux hommes, au moyen d&#8217;une bouteille de soda. Par la suite, pendant que les deux 
hommes se disputaient, la jeune fille aurait r&#233;ussi &#224; s&#8217;enfuir et &#224; obtenir le secours d&#8217;un passant 
pour rejoindre son domicile.  
 
567. Le chef du groupe aurait &#233;t&#233; appr&#233;hend&#233; deux jours apr&#232;s les faits par la police suite &#224; la 
plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e par la victime &#224; l&#8217;&#201;tat major du District de la Funa. Pendant son interrogatoire, </p>

l&#8217;officier de police judiciaire instructeur se serait rendu compte qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agissait d&#8217;une bande 
organis&#233;e commettant r&#233;guli&#232;rement de telles actions. Le chef du group l&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233; &#224; 
l&#8217;Inspection provinciale puis au Centre p&#233;nitentiaire et de r&#233;&#233;ducation de Kinshasa et 
l&#8217;instruction poursuivie afin de d&#233;manteler le r&#233;seau. La jeune fille, manifestant des tendances 
suicidaires, serait soign&#233;e dans un centre de sant&#233; et suivie par un psychologue. Aucune 
information ne permettrait &#224; ce jour de savoir ce qu&#8217;il est advenu de la jeune fille enlev&#233;e. 
 
<b>Appel urgent 
 
</b>568. Le 2 mai 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteur du

570. Selon les informations re&#231;ues : Le 28 ao&#251;t 2004, vers 7 heures du matin,  M.K.M. serait 
rentr&#233; dans sa r&#233;sidence du quartier Lukunga de la Commune de Ngaliema &#224; Kinshasa et aurait 
trouv&#233; la maison saccag&#233;e, et d&#233;sert&#233;e par les membres de sa famille, tous les effets emport&#233;s. 
S&#8217;informant aupr&#232;s de ses voisins, il aurait apprit qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agissait d&#8217;une op&#233;ration de l&#8217;arm&#233;e et 
que les assaillants auraient enlev&#233; son &#233;pouse, ses neveux et beaux-fr&#232;res apr&#232;s les avoir frapp&#233;s 
et brutalis&#233;s, pour les conduire ensuite vers une destination inconnue. Parti &#224; la recherche des 
membres de sa famille, il aurait &#224; son tour &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233; &#224; Kinshasa par les agents de l&#8217;&#201;tat major de 
renseignements militaires (ex-DEMIAP) sur la route de Ndolo vers 10 heures du matin. Il aurait

aper&#231;u son &#233;pouse et les autres membres de sa famille. 
 
571. M.K.M. aurait alors pass&#233; deux mois dans une cellule sans contact avec l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur, les 
membres de sa famille ou un avocat. Pendant cinq jours et cinq nuits, il aurait &#233;t&#233; soumis &#224; des 
interrogatoires brutaux, accompagn&#233;s de menaces de mort et autres traitements inhumains et 
d&#233;gradants. 
 
572. Apr&#232;s deux mois de d&#233;tention dans le cachot de Services de renseignements militaires, il

par des militaires en tenue civile qui r&#244;deraient quotidiennement autour de sa r&#233;sidence. 
 
<b>Appel urgent</b> 
 
574. Le 27 octobre 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur 
l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, a envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant l&#8217;extraction forc&#233;e 
de la prison de Beni de M. A.M., chef d&#8217;agence de la Banque Commerciale du Congo, poursuivi 
pour viol.  
 
Selon les informations re&#231;ues : 
 
575. Quand le 9 octobre 2006 A.M. aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; par le Procureur de la R&#233;publique pour des 
accusations de viol sur une mineure de 14 ans, des interventions et des menaces auraient &#233;t&#233; 
formul&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;encontre du Procureur de la R&#233;publique pour le pousser &#224; revenir sur sa d&#233;cision. Il 
n&#8217;aurait toutefois pas c&#233;d&#233; face &#224; ces actes d&#8217;intimidation, et aurait confirm&#233; sa d&#233;cision de 
maintenir A.M. d&#233;tenu &#224; la prison de Beni. Au cinqui&#232;me jour de sa d&#233;tention par le parquet, le 
Procureur aurait demand&#233; que le conseil de chambre se r&#233;unisse, le samedi 14 octobre 2006, pour 
d&#233;cider de la prolongation de la mise en d&#233;tention provisoire. C&#8217;est alors que le Pr&#233;sident du 
tribunal de paix (si&#233;geant en l&#8217;absence d&#8217;un tribunal de grande instance &#224; Beni) aurait d&#233;cid&#233; 
d&#8217;&#233;mettre un avis favorable &#224; la demande de mise en libert&#233; provisoire pr&#233;sent&#233;e en faveur du 
mis en cause en &#233;change d&#8217;une caution de 2 500 dollars am&#233;ricains. Le Procureur ayant 
consid&#233;r&#233; cette d&#233;cision abusive, il aurait introduit un appel qui serait suspensif de la d&#233;cision du 
Pr&#233;sident du tribunal de paix. 
 
576. Le m&#234;me jour, les proches du mis en cause auraient alors eu recours au Maire adjoint de 
la ville de Beni, J.M., pour faire lib&#233;rer l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;. Le samedi 14 octobre 2006 vers 17 heures 30, 
le Maire adjoint, le Chef de poste principal de l&#8217;ANR, (le Lieutenant-Colonel J.T.), commandant 
de la 89&#232;me brigade, et d&#8217;autres membres du Comit&#233; Urbain de S&#233;curit&#233; de la ville de Beni 
seraient arriv&#233;s &#224; la prison de Beni et auraient extrait de force A.M. et l&#8217;aurait remis en libert&#233;, en 
flagrante violation de la d&#233;cision de justice applicable. Le Maire adjoint aurait justifi&#233; son acte 
en indiquant que le comit&#233; de s&#233;curit&#233; de la ville de Beni aurait tenu une r&#233;union extraordinaire 
le m&#234;me jour pour des raisons d&#8217;ordre public. Les amis, sympathisants de parti politique et 
originaires de la m&#234;me province (Kasai Occidental) du mis en cause auraient prof&#233;r&#233; des 
menaces de troubler l&#8217;ordre public en manifestant jusqu&#8217;&#224; la prison pour sortir l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;. Pour 
&#233;viter des troubles de l&#8217;ordre public, il aurait donc d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;aller lib&#233;rer A.M.

Allegation letter 
 
</b>578. On 13 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture sent an 
allegation letter to the Government concerning M.S., aged 23, from Argun in Chechnya.  
According to the allegations received, on 19 March 2006, she was detained by local law </p>

enforcement officers, following allegations by her husband that she had committed adultery with 
a serviceman of Christian faith.<b> 
</b> <b> 
</b>579. M.S. was taken to a law enforcement compound in Argun where she was allegedly beaten, 
while being told &#8220;Turn around and be condemned by Allah&#8221;. Her eyebrows and head were 
shaved and her scalp was painted green, the colour associated with Islam. A cross was also 
smeared on her brow.  She was ordered to strip, and beaten with wooden rods and hoses on her 
buttocks, arms, legs, hands, stomach and back. She was forced to confess to being unfaithful, and 
then taken to her husband&#8217;s home and made to dance before her neighbours while they verbally 
insulted her.  Several of the law enforcement officials kicked her. On 21 March 2006, she 
suffered a miscarriage. The local authorities initially failed to investigate the events, despite the 
fact that they had been recorded on mobile phone videos, and widely circulated in the region.  
On 29 August 2006, the Chechen Premier, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, reportedly stated that he had 
order the Chechen Interior Ministry to investigate the events.<b> 
</b> 
 <b>Response from the Government 
 
</b>580. By letter dated 28 December 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
on 18 March 2006, when M.S. underwent a medical examination at the central district hospital in 
Shali, scars on her face, hands and back and a concussion were detected. On the same day, the 
police received reports that she had been abducted. Consequently, the Prosecutor of Argun 
investigated the case. During the course of this investigation M.S. explained that she had not 
been abducted, that she had not been subjected to any physical or moral pressure and that she 
had sustained the injuries as a result of family-internal unhealthy relations. She never 
complained about her injuries to the police. Therefore, on 7 May 2006 the Prosecutor of Argun 
refused to open a criminal case for reason of the &#8220;absence of a crime&#8221; (art. 24, para 1 (1) of the 
Criminal Procedure Code).  However, given the numerous contradictions in testimonies of the 
persons involved and of eye-witnesses and allegations of wrong-doing by police officers, the 
case has been referred to the Republican Prosecutor, following which, on 16 October 2006, on 
the basis of the statement of M.S. a criminal case was opened with reference to art. 117, para. e 
(2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (harassment by a group of persons).<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>581.  The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for the response to the 
allegation letter sent 13 September 2006. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her 
interest in receiving any further information regarding the allegations submitted.<b> 
</b> <b> 
</b>582. The Special Rapporteur also recalls the report on her mission to the Russian Federation 
(E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.2), in which she made reference to testimonies from relatives of women 
who had disappeared and had been victims of extrajudicial execution, torture, rape and ill-
treatment allegedly by members of the security forces and provided a number of 
recommendations on how to better protect the human rights and physical integrity of women in 
the North Caucasus.<b>

<b>Saudi Arabia

<b>Allegation letter  
</b> 
583.  On 10 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
allegation letter to the Government concerning W.A.H., a member of the group Human Rights 
First in Saudi Arabia.<b> 
</b> 
584. According to information received, Officers of the Mabahith security force detained 
W.A.H. in Khobar on 20 September 2006. They interrogated her for six hours about a women's 
rights protest she was organizing. During the interrogation, the Mabahith officers demanded that 
W.A.H. provide written answers to prepared questions concerning her internet writings and 
human rights activities. They then demanded that she sign a pledge not to engage in any future 
human rights activities, including writing articles, organizing protests and speaking to journalists 
or foreign organizations. They did not provide her with a copy of the signed pledge. Officers also 
threatened that she would lose her job with Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, if she were 
to break the pledge made.<b> 
</b> 
585. Following her release, she tried to return to Bahrain where she resides. Reportedly, border 
officials told her that her name appeared on a list of persons banned from travel, and that she was 
not allowed to leave Saudi Arabia. Only on 28 September 2006, officials lifted the ban and 
allowed her to return to Bahrain.<b> 
</b> 
586. Reportedly, W.A.H. has been arrested before due to her advocacy for women&#8217;s rights. In an 
urgent appeal dated 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders already brought to the Government&#8217;s 
attention information that she had been arrested on 4 August 2006, while walking on the bridge 
connecting Saudi Arabia with Bahrain holding a banner that stated &#8220;Give women their rights&#8221;.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Urgent appeal 
 
</b>587. On 8 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
F.a-T., aged 34, and her children, N. and S. <b> 
</b> 
588. According to information received: F. a.-T.and M.a.-T. had been married for over three 
years when two of F.a.-T.&#8217;s half-brothers demanded that they get a divorce on the grounds of 
&quot;tribal incompatibility&quot; and took the case to court. They claimed that M.a.-T. did not tell the truth 
about his tribal background in order to enhance his social status, a claim that he denies. These 
incidents developed soon after the death of F.a.-T.&#8217;s father, who had approved her marriage. In 
July 2005, Judge Ibrahim Al-Farrj divorced the couple against the will of both husband and wife. 
F.a-T.&#8217;s lawyer has lodged an appeal against the decision, which is still pending. <b> 
</b> 
589. In July 2006, the pair was arrested in Jeddah by police agents for living together as an 
unmarried couple. M.a-T. was eventually released. According to the latest information received, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 102 
 
F.a-T. remains imprisoned in Dammam together with her two children. The authorities informed 
her that she may only leave prison, if she agrees to return to her estranged blood-family. She 
refuses to agree to this demand and requests to be reunited with M.a.-T.<b> 
</b> 
590. A committee of the Ministry of Justice reportedly questioned Judge Al-Farrj. The results of 
this inquiry are unknown.<b> 
</b> 
<b>Response from the Government 
</b> 
591. By letter dated on 29 January 2007, the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia responded to the urgent appeal and indicated that this matter, involving family social 
disputes, has been referred to the court at the request of the persons concerned.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>592. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply to her communications of 10 
November 2006. She would like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply from the 
Government in regard to the allegations submitted.<b> 
 
</b>593. The Special Rapporteur thanks for the reply on her communication sent on 8 December 
2006 and looks forward to receiving information on the outcome of the investigations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
Sierra Leone 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
Allegation letter  
 
</b>594. By letter dated on 25 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning usurpation of judiciary power by local chiefs resulting in violence and 
discrimination against women.<b> 
 
</b>595. According to information received, customary law forms part of the Common Law in all 
parts of the country, except for the capital Freetown, and is relevant to 85 per cent of the 
population. Under the Courts Act of 1963, the Local Courts are the only institution competent to 
adjudicate customary law. Furthermore, the Statute foresees that the presiding judge of a Local 
Court is appointed by the local paramount chief with the approval of the Ministry of Local 
Government and Community Development. The Local Courts&#8217; rulings are supposed to be 
monitored by officers of the Ministry of Justice and may be overturned by these officers.<b> 
</b> 
596. In practice, however, most customary law cases are dealt outside the Local Court system 
and decided by local chiefs. The practice is allegedly widely tolerated by officials of the Justice 
Ministry. Sources allege that some of the chiefs, who usurp judiciary powers, routinely issue 
rulings that violate the human rights of women and basic precepts of gender equality. In some 
criminal cases referred to them by community members, chiefs have reportedly carried out 
functions as both prosecutor and judge. Examples include chiefs who have levied arbitrary 
charges against women such as &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; (a charge that does not exist in Sierra Leonean Law) 
Reportedly, there have also been cases, where chiefs have determined guilt without evidence, 
imposed arbitrary and exorbitant fines, imprisoned women unlawfully in their homes or in illegal </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 103 
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;tribal prisons&#8221; or threatened to, or actually carried out, expulsions of women from the 
community as a form of punishment.<b> 
</b> 
597. Moreover, chiefs also routinely fail to bring to the attention of the competent state 
authorities cases of rape, which members of local communities often first refer to the chiefs. 
Moreover, many chiefs also condone violence against women committed by the husband. The 
customary law, as applied in the Local Courts, furthers these attitudes since it also condones 
domestic violence below a certain intensity threshold, regarding it as a justified &#8220;chastisement&#8221; 
of the wife.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>598. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply from the Government to her 
communication dated 25 August 2006. <b> 
 
</b>599. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall the report of the previous Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences, on her mission to Sierra Leone 
(E/CN.4/2002/83/Add.2). The Special Rapporteur encouraged the Government to review the 
formal and customary judicial systems to ensure that gender discriminatory provisions are 
removed and that adequate protection is provided, in line with the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Violence against Women. Inheritance rights and legislation preventing domestic 
violence are specific concerns. The allegations transmitted would indicate that this 
recommendation has yet to be implemented. <b> 
</b> 
600. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply from the 
Government in regard to the allegation submitted to the Government.<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Singapore 
Allegation Letter 
 
</b>601. On 16 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women 
and children sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning allegations about norms and 
procedures that discriminate against women domestic migrant workers and make them more 
vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and restrictions of their physical freedom.<b> 
 
</b>602. According to information received, there are 150,000 women domestic migrant workers in 
Singapore who are in the majority from Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Private 
employment agencies typically recruit the women in their countries of origin and place them 
with Singaporean employers. These agencies usually charge significant recruitment, transfer and 
placement fees (S$1,400-2,100), which the women often have to repay by working the initial 4 
to 10 months of their contract without pay. Additional fees are often charged and have to be 
worked off, if a domestic worker decides to change employers during her stay. Some 
employment agents, especially unlicensed ones, have threatened workers with severe reprisals, 
including trafficking into prostitution, if they try to leave their job and return home before they 
have worked off their debt. Other agents have also intimidated workers by way of physical 
abuse.<b> 
</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 104 
 
603. Once in Singapore, many domestic migrant workers are required to work between 13 and 
19 hours a day, seven days a week. In a large number of cases, the women also experience verbal 
abuse and food deprivation at the hands of their employers. <b> 
</b> 
604. Employers often prohibit their domestic migrant workers from leaving the house 
unaccompanied and also confiscate their passports and other identity documents. These 
restrictions isolate the workers and make them more vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse in 
the employer&#8217;s home. <b> 
</b> 
605. While commending the Government on a number of important measures implemented in 
recent years to prevent abuse and exploitation of domestic migrant workers, the Special 
Rapporteur also noted that certain discriminatory norms and policies continue to exist, which 
inadvertently render them more vulnerable to abuse, trafficking, exploitation and restrictions of 
physical freedom:<b> 
</b> 
606. Domestic workers are explicitly excluded from the protection of the Employment Act, 
which guarantees the right to one day of rest per week and a maximum of 44 work hours per 
week. The Employment Act also limits salary deductions to 25 per cent of the monthly salary for 
a maximum period of 12 months. The Employment of Foreign Workers Act, which applies also 
to domestic migrant workers, does not provide for equivalent rights.<b> 
</b> 
607. The Employment Agencies Act stipulates that employment agencies must not charge job 
seekers more than 10 per cent of their first month&#8217;s earnings. However, the Ministry of 
Manpower considers the recruitment, transfer and placement fees, which domestic migrant 
workers are charged by their agents, to be private loans that are not subject to the limit imposed 
by the Employment Agencies Act.<b> 
</b> 
608. Employers hiring domestic migrant workers have to take out a S$ 5,000 bond, which they 
forfeit if they fail to pay for the domestic worker&#8217;s repatriation costs or if the domestic worker 
runs away from the employer&#8217;s home. The latter gives employers an incentive to prohibit their 
domestic workers to leave their workplace in the employer&#8217;s home unaccompanied.<b> 
</b> 
609. Domestic migrant workers also face limitations of their reproductive and marriage rights:<b> 
</b> 
610. Singaporean labour regulations prohibit domestic migrant workers from becoming 
pregnant or giving birth during the course of their stay in Singapore. Unless pregnant workers 
agree to an abortion, they will be deported. For employers, who have economic and personal 
interests not to see their domestic workers deported, this limitation of reproductive rights 
provides further incentive to limit their workers&#8217; outside contacts and prohibit them from leaving 
the house on their own. <b> 
</b> 
611. The same set of labour regulations prohibits domestic workers from marrying Singaporean 
citizens or permanent residents during their stay, unless they receive a special permission from 
the Comptroller of Work Permits.<b>

<b>Response from the Government 
 
</b>612. By letter dated 5 April 2006, the Government informed that Singapore is committed to 
protecting the well-being of the 160,000 foreign domestic workers (FDWs) working in 
Singapore. The vast majority of FDWs experience safe, productive and fulfilling work in 
Singapore. Over 80 per cent of FDWs have indicated that they are happy to work in Singapore, 
according to an independent poll conducted by the Singapore Press Holdings in December 2003. 
One in three FDWs extend their two-year employment contracts with the same employer. Thus, 
FDWs who choose to work in Singapore do so because of better pay and working conditions 
compared to their home and other countries.<b> 
 
</b>613. FDWs in Singapore receive full protection under Singapore laws including the 
Employment of Foreign Workers Act (EFWA), Employment Agencies and the Penal Code. The 
Singapore Government has been taken firm enforcement actions against errant local employers 
and employment agents. In addition, the Government has extensive outreach programmes to 
educate the FDWs in Singapore on their rights under the law and the channels of assistance 
available to them. Please see attached Annex for the response of the Government to the specific 
issues raised in the letter of the Special Rapporteurs.<b> 
</b> 
614. Clarification of the actual foreign domestic worker (FDW) situation in Singapore:<b> 
 
</b>Protection of the Rights of FDWs 
<b> 
</b>615. The Employment of Foreign Domestic Act (EFWA) imposes work permit conditions on 
employers to provide adequate rest and meals, and ensure work safety, proper housing and 
prompt salary payment. Errant employers who breach these conditions can be punished with a 
fine of up to $5,000 and a jail term of up to 6 months.<b> 
 
</b>616. FDWs also receive special protection under the Penal Code. In 1998, the Penal Code was 
amended to increase by one-and-a-half times the penalties for acts of abuse against FDW by their 
employers or household members, compared to the same acts against any other persons 
including Singaporeans. This has lead to a marked decrease in abuses against FDWs, from 157 in 
1997 to 59 cases last year.<b> 
</b> 
617. In 2005, Five employers were fined for failing to pay their FDWs and ordered to make full 
restitution of the outstanding salary. Three of these employers were subsequently jailed when 
they defaulted on the court order. From 2001 to 2005, a total of 26 FDW employers or their 
household members were also jailed for abusing their FDWs. All convicted employers and their 
spouses are permanently barred from employing FDWs.<b> 
</b> 
618. To ensure that FDWs are equipped to protect themselves and are fully aware of their rights, 
Singapore has in place extensive measures to educate FDWs on these aspects, and various 
channels of assistance that FDWs can turn to for help. Upon their arrival in Singapore, each 
FDW is given a pocket-sized handy guide published in their native languages, containing the 
Ministry of Manpower&#8217;s dedicated hotline number for FDWs to seek help or report grievances. It 
also contains the contact numbers of the Police, the relevant Embassies and volunteer 
organizations.<b> 
</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 106 
 
619. All first-time FDWs are also required to attend a Safety Awareness Course to acclimatize 
them to working in a high-rise urban environment. The channels of assistance they can turn to 
are again highlighted during the course. As the FDWs attend these course on their own, without 
their employers or agents present, it also accords them ample opportunity to express any 
problems on their employment freely or seek help if they so wish.<b> 
</b> 
620. To ensure that FDWs are better able to understand and exercise their rights under 
Singapore law, with effect from 1 January 2005, all new FDWs entering Singapore must be at 
least 23 years of age (the previous minimum age being 18 years) and have undergone eight years 
of formal education.<b> 
</b> 
621. In addition, to remind employers of their responsibilities and empower FDWs to exercise 
self-help in safeguarding their rights and safety, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been 
stepping up its public outreach efforts to emphasize key messages such as safety in high-rise 
buildings the rights and obligations of employers, as well as avenues through which FDWs can 
seek help. These outreach efforts include posters displayed in residential neighbourhoods and 
bus stops, as well as the distribution of goody bags containing collaterals imprinted with MOM&#8217;s 
helpline at community events.<b> 
</b> 
Regulation of the Employment Agency Industry<b> 
</b> 
622. MOM closely regulates the employment agency (EA) t prevent any exploitation of FDWs. 
All EAs are licensed, and can be punished with a fine up to $5,000 and/or two years&#8217; jail if 
convicted under any offence under the EA Act. EAs also risk losing their license permanently for 
any infringements under the Act. Since January 2004, the Ministry has revoked the licenses of 
three EAs and not renewed the licenses of another ten EAs.<b> 
</b> 
623. MOM also requires all EAs involved in placing FDWs to be accredited by independent 
bodies. One key accreditation criterion is that EAs must ensure the employers and FDWs enter 
into employment contracts, which specify the terms of employment. As such, FDWs have the 
same right as all employees to accept or reject work conditions imposed, including the number of 
rest days.<b> 
</b> 
624. To further shape the behaviour of the EA Industry, the Ministry has introduced a demerit 
point system (DPS) for EAs since 1 February 06. This awards demerit points to EAs for 
regulatory infringements. The points that each EA has accumulated are also made public. EAs 
that accumulate excessive demerit points will also have their licenses removed by the Ministry.<b> 
</b> 
625. Nonetheless, while MOM regulates the commission charged by Singapore-based EAs, the 
loans that FDWs take in their home countries fall outside Singapore&#8217;s jurisdiction. Thy have to 
be handled within the jurisdictions of the labour exporting countries.<b> 
</b> 
Freedom of Movement of FDWs<b> 
</b> 
626. It is a serious offence under the Penal Code to wrongfully confine any person.<b> 
 
</b>627. Anyone found wrongfully confining a person faces a jail term up to one year, and/or a fine 
of up to $1,000 under the Penal Code. It is also an offence under the EA Rules for the EA to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 107 
</p>
<p> 
withhold either the passport or work permit of an FDW. The Police and MOM take such 
offences serious and will prosecute any EA seeking to restrict the FDW&#8217;s movements.<b> 
 
</b>Marriage Restriction for FDWs<b> 
</b> 
628. As a small city-state of four million people with limited land resources, it is necessary for 
Singapore to maintain a strict immigration policy. Singapore therefore requires work permit 
holders to obtain prior approval from the Controller of Work Permits to go through any form of 
marriage or apply to marry a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident (CS/PR). A key 
consideration in determining the grant of approval is whether the couple would be financially 
self-reliant.<b> 
</b> 
629. The Government noted that other countries also impose certain restrictions of marriage on 
foreign workers. For example, since 1 February 2005, the United Kingdom has stipulated that 
any foreign worker (including higher-skilled foreign workers) must obtain permission before 
getting married in the United Kingdom.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>630. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply to her communication of 16 
February 2006.<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>South Africa 
 
Letter of Allegation  
 
</b>631.  By letter dated on 28 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences has sent a letter of allegation concerning the murder of Z.N., a 19-
year old lesbian woman, outside her house in Khayelitsha, Cape Town.<b> 
 
</b>632. According to information received, on 4 February 2006, Z.N. and a lesbian friend, age 17, 
were approached by a woman who taunted them about their sexual orientation, saying that they 
&#8220;wanted to get raped.&#8221; The woman gathered a group of about 20 young men and boys who then 
attacked the two women. Z.N. was beaten, stoned and stabbed to death. Her friend managed to 
escape. Fearing for her life, she is currently under the protection of a non-governmental 
organization. <b> 
</b> 
633. The police have since identified and arrested six of the alleged perpetrators, aged 17-19 
years. Reportedly, however, no official has publicly condemned the incident as a hate crime. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that this case does not constitute an isolated incident and that 
lesbian women face an increased risk of becoming victims of violence, especially rape, because 
of widely held prejudices and myths. Some parts of the population believe, for instance, that 
lesbian women would change their sexual orientation if they are raped by a man.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>634. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government, while formally acknowledging 
receipt of her communication, has not yet provided a substantive response to the allegations </p>

submitted. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her interest in receiving a substantive 
response from the Government.<b>

<p><b>Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation Letter  
</b></p>
<p>635. On 16 January 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent a letter of allegation to the Government of Sri 
Lanka concerning two incidents of killing of Tamil civilians.<b> 
</b> 
636. According to the reports received, I.T., a woman aged 20 from Pungudutivu, Jaffna 
Peninsula, was last seen alive on 16 December 2005, when she left her home at 6.15 pm. on her 
way to the Sri Lankan Navy camp in Pungudutivu. On the evening of 17 December 2005, her 
body was found in a well. It had been weighed down with heavy stones. The following morning, 
her body was taken to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, where a post mortem was performed. The 
Judicial Medical Officer reportedly found stab wounds in her chest and near her hips. He 
concluded that I.T. had been raped before being killed. The medical report was given to police, 
who submitted it to the Magistrate&#8217;s Court on 20 December 2005. The Criminal Investigation 
Department (CID) has been at the crime scene and has heard from the victim&#8217;s relatives. <b> 
</b> 
637. The second set of allegations transmitted in this joint communication concerned five male 
Tamil youths and is therefore not repeated here.<b> 
 
Response from the Government 
</b> 
638.  On 3 July 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka replied to the communication of 16 January 
2006. With respect to the death of I.T., the Government stated that initial investigations were 
carried out by the Kayts police and were later taken over by the Criminal Investigation Division 
(CID) under the directions of the Inspector General of Police. Initial investigations were a great 
deal hampered due to agitation campaigns covertly organized by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE) and the interference by various other disruptive elements brining frivolous and 
baseless accusations. The police were prevented from guarding the scene until the arrival of the 
Magistrate due to public agitations which resulted in tampering of evidence at the scene as well 
as destroying valuable evidence. The Government reported that the Magistrate was only able to 
visit the scene a day after the alleged incident, on 18 December 2005. Even then, when the 
Magistrate visited the scene, there was a public agitation covertly organized by the LTTE. The 
Magistrate ordered the conduct of a post mortem inquiry which revealed that the death had been 
caused due to strangulation subsequent to committing vigorous rape. Evidence had been gathered 
by both the Kayts police and the CID, including a camouflage cap numbered 410836. The cap 
was similar to those used by the security forces. The CID made inquiries regarding the cap and 
revealed that the number corresponded to a certain (Cpl. WWNAK Weerasuriya of the 8th 
battalion Gemunu watch of the Sri Lanka Army, based in Batticoloa)<i>. </i>The man questioned was 
based in Batticola and the Government has assured the Special Rapporteur that inquiries were 
continuing.<b> 
 
</b>639. The Government also reported that the security situation in the area has restricted the 
movements of the investigators in the gathering of information and intelligence. The lack of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 109 
</p>
<p> 
cooperation by the public has also hindered the ongoing investigations. Meanwhile, the facts 
have been reported to the Magistrate Courts, Kayts, under case No. B212/2005. The case was 
called on 12 July 2006 to report the progress of the investigations. A further investigation has 
been conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy due to public agitation and accusations levelled at the 
personnel. Further inquiries, the Government stated, were being conducted to identify and 
apprehend the culprits, in spite of lack of public cooperation and in the midst of campaigns and 
interferences by various fronts acting at the behest of the LTTE. <b> 
 
Response from the Government to an allegation letter sent in 2005 
 
</b>640. By letter dated 6 October 2006, the Government responded to an allegation letter sent by 
the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child pornography and 
child prostitution on 28 November 2005 concerning the abduction and rape of S.D.R. The 
Government indicated that the victim, aged 15, had been abducted on 19 September 2005 by 
three persons in a three wheeler taxi that took her to the town of Nagastenna in Thalawakele 
Police area where she was raped by all three of them in an abandoned building previously used 
as a printing press. The full details of the allegations submitted have been reflected in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s previous Report on Communications sent and received (E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.1).<b> 
 
</b>641. On receipt of this complaint, the Government mentioned that officers of Talawakelle 
Police produced the victim before the Judicial Medical Officer at Base Hospital, Nuwara Eliya 
under Judicial Medical form No. 20 A/000049 and was warded after consultations for necessary 
examination. <b> 
</b> 
642. Moreover, acting on information given by the victim, the Police visited the scene and made 
necessary examinations. Therefore, on 26 September 2006, Police arrested the two perpetrators 
who are alleged to have committed the said crime: P.M.S. of Devon Tea Estate, Talawakelle and 
S.S. of Pharmston Tea Estate, Talawakelle. The police also recovered three wheeler taxis and 
produced the same together with the suspects before Magistrate Court/Nuwara Eliya under Case 
No: B668/05 and the suspects were remanded. <b> 
</b> 
643. At the identification parade held on 11 October 2005, the victim identified the above two 
suspects, out of the three who raped her. In fact, the third suspect T.S. of Chandirigama Estate, 
Talawakelle who was said to be absconding was finally arrested on 21 June 2006 and remanded. 
And at the investigation parade, held on 27 June 2006 at Magistrate Court, Nuwara Eliya, the 
victim identified him as the third person who raped her. <b> 
</b> 
644. The Government also noted that investigations in this case were completed and the reports 
of the medical examinations together with the statements of witnesses and of the suspects were 
forwarded to Hon. Attorney General to contemplate direct indictments in High Court of Nuwara 
Eliya. His advice is currently awaited. As for the suspects, they are presently on court bail and 
the Magistrate Court Case No. B 668/05 is to be called on 21 November 2006. <b> 
</b> 
645. Furthermore, the Government indicated that the names of the perpetrators given in the 
summary of the case were incorrect. In fact, the correct names and addresses, who are actually 
all residents of Tea Estate Quarters, are the one in its report. Finally, it noted that the victim had 
not made any request for special protection but the Police, however have taken adequate security 
measures to take care of the victim from reprisals.<b> </b></p>

<b>Observations 
</b> 
646.  With respect to the rape and murder of I.T., the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
Government&#8217;s detailed reply of 3 July 2006, but requests information about the outcome of the 
12 July 2006 proceedings. The Special Rapporteur would also appreciate being kept informed of 
any developments of the investigations by the Sri Lanka Navy of its personnel. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply to her communication sent on 29 November

Urgent Appeal 
 
</b>647. On 20 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur has together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding the Sudan Social Development Organization 
(SUDO), a humanitarian and development NGO which works in West Darfur, Sudan. SUDO 
also monitors human rights violations in Darfur and assists women who have suffered gender 
based violence as a result of the conflict in Darfur. <b> 
 
</b>648. According to the information received: On 11 March 2006 the Humanitarian Aid 
Commission (HAC), a Government agency, issued a formal notice to the directors of SUDO in 
Zaillingiee and Geneina, ordering the suspension of all its activities within West Darfur. It is 
reported that the directors of SUDO were ordered to hand over all the assets of the organization 
and to close down its health and nutrition centers and its food distribution unit. It is alleged that 
the legal grounds for this suspension are based in the &#8220;Organization of Humanitarian and 
Voluntary Work Act&#8221;, but the HAC did not specify which provisions of the Act SUDO had 
violated. This legislation was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 16 November 2005. In 
that communication, concern was expressed regarding the powers granted to the HAC by this 
legislation. Particular concerns were expressed regarding the HAC&#8217;s powers to suspend NGO 
activities, dissolve their executive committee and replace it with a transitional committee, cancel 
registration, and expel International NGOS from the Sudan upon approval from the Minister, 
without judicial review.<b> 
</b> <b> 
</b>649. Concern is expressed that the suspension of the activities of SUDO is connected with its 
work in defense of human rights and will prevent it from carrying out its humanitarian and 
development work.<b> 
 
Allegation letter  
 
</b>650. By letter dated on 15 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning the rape of a group of women at Kalma Internally Displaced Camp in 
Nyala, Southern Darfur.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 111 
</p>
<p> 
<b> 
</b>651. According to information received: On 24 July 2006, approximately 25 armed militias, 
some wearing army uniforms, attacked a group of twenty women aged 19-42 outside Kalma 
Internally Displaced Camp, while the women were collecting firewood. All women belong to the 
African Fur ethnic group. The militiamen beat the women with the butts of their guns and 
flogged them before raping seventeen of the women. According to the information received, 
there has been a steady gathering of armed militias, reportedly the Arab Janjaweed, in the 
surrounding areas of Kalma camp. In the past, these militias have attacked humanitarian workers 
and undertaken nightly armed incursions into the camp in order to loot property.<b> 
</b> 
652. Strong concern is expressed about these allegations of sexual assault committed by militia 
men against internally displaced women. We strongly urge the Government to protect internally 
displaced persons, especially women and girls, from all forms of sexual and other violence and 
to arrest, disarm and prosecute the perpetrators.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>653. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not reply to any of her 
communications sent in 2006 and reiterates the recommendations contained in the report on her 
mission to the Darfur region of Sudan (E/CN.4/2005/72/Add.5). The Special Rapporteur 
provided follow-up information to this report in her oral statement to the second session of the 
Human Rights Council in September 2006, where she noted that, according to reports from 
numerous credible sources, the situation of women in Darfur has regrettably not improved. The 
signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement has not resulted in a decline in the incidence of rape or 
other acts of violence against women. Throughout Darfur a surge in sexual violence continues as 
militia and rebel factions target women who are perceived to support opposing factions and those 
in the IDP camps.<b> 
  
</b>654. The Special Rapporteur<b> </b>reiterates her interest in receiving replies from the Government in 
regard to allegations submitted.<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thailand 
</b></p>
<p><b>Allegation Letter </b> 
</p>
<p>655. On 18 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning 
the women and children refugees from Myanmar at risk of trafficking. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>656. According to the information received: It is reported that hundreds of thousands of people 
from Myanmar, many of them women and children, have fled into neighboring Thailand in the 
course of the past two decades, escaping armed conflict and rampant human rights violations in 
their homeland. Concern has been expressed about their vulnerable situation, which reportedly 
puts them at risk of continued human rights abuses. It is also reported that these women and 
children are particularly at risk of trafficking, and the sexual and physical exploitation and forced 
labour associated with it.<b> 
</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 112 
 
657. It is further alleged that these persons seek assistance in crossing the border. Sometimes 
family or community members offer such help. At other times, people pay &#8220;carriers&#8221; to help 
them cross the border undetected. Such transportation can sometimes be accompanied by an 
offer of employment.<b> 
</b> 
658. It is also reported that people from Myanmar who wish to enter Thailand and do not have 
enough money when they arrive at the border to pay a carrier have to wait at the border area 
anywhere from a few days to months before crossing it. It seems that trafficking often occurs 
during this vulnerable time. It is further reported that sometimes carriers themselves are in fact 
engaged in trafficking. The carriers tell relatives of women or children that life is better in 
Thailand. These persons are then forced to work without pay. It is alleged that some Thai 
officials could collaborate with the traffickers.<b> 
</b> 
659. Concern has also been expressed about the fact that, after being trafficked, women and 
children may end up in a range of abusive situations, including forced prostitution, forced 
begging, abusive domestic work, or work in substandard labour conditions in textile factories, 
fishing or other industrial settings. According to the allegations received, sometimes, the victims 
are not paid at all or are paid a wage far below that promised or allowed under Thai law. Labour 
conditions for trafficked persons are reportedly characterized by long hours and physical and 
sexual abuse. Some women working as domestic servants reported that their inability to speak 
Thai left them isolated, and the nature of their work, which often involves living in their 
employer&#8217;s homes, left them vulnerable to abuse.<b> 
</b> 
660. Moreover, the fear of deportation haunts people living without status, including victims of 
trafficking. Women and children may be especially susceptible to ill-treatment, and are reluctant 
to complain due to fear of persecution by the Myanmar military if returned as well as the fear of 
stranding their families without economic support if they lose their source of income, as abusive 
as their employment situation might be.<b> 
</b> 
661. Sources also allege that the number of children who arrive alone in Thailand has 
significantly increased in the past four years. The families are often separated once in Thailand. 
In other cases, children may be left alone while their parents are at work. Children who are alone 
are reportedly more vulnerable to abuses such as trafficking.<b> 
</b> 
662. It is further alleged that some children are trafficked from inside Myanmar across the 
border into Thailand. The traffickers then collect a large group of children in Mae Sot (Thailand), 
directly across the border and transport the children to Bangkok. The traffickers lie to the 
children&#8217;s parents, telling them that the children will live &#8220;an easy, better life&#8221;.<b> 
</b> 
663. Once they arrive in Bangkok, the traffickers reportedly force the children to communicate 
to their parents that they are well cared for. Gradually, however, the traffickers tell the parents 
that the children are misbehaving, that they are not working hard enough, and that the children 
are forgetting them. Therefore, when a child does not send money back to the parents, the parents 
assume it is because the child is not working hard enough or is no longer gainfully employed. 
This is to drive a wedge between the children and their parents in order to sever the child&#8217;s 
familial ties. If the parents continue to insist that they want to see their children, the trafficker 
may send the child back in order to avoid trouble and unwanted attention. In most cases, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 113 
</p>
<p> 
however, the parents are unable to investigate the whereabouts of their child and thus are forced 
to give up finding them, at which point the trafficker may sell the child to someone else.<b> 
</b> 
664. It is alleged that a common strategy is to force the children to sell flowers or trinkets or to 
beg on the streets of Bangkok. If the child does not make the required amount of money each 
day, he is reportedly deprived of food, beaten or forced to stay on the street.<b> 
</b> 
665. Concerning the sex industry in Thailand, in addition to the lack of legal residence and 
employment options, trafficked persons who are removed from the brothels are reportedly not 
screened for refugee status. Sources alleged that these trafficked victims are reluctant to share 
information because they typically do not want to return home in Myanmar. Besides, according 
to the information received, the witness protection in Thailand is insufficient and if the trafficked 
person presents testimony, the person would be at risk of retaliation.<b> 
</b> 
666. Furthermore, prosecutions that are supposed to result from the brothel raids are often 
unsuccessful. The prosecution effort is primarily aimed at actors who are only minor figures in 
the trafficking networks, such as the pimps and brothel owners. In the meantime, the trafficking 
victims may be held at the shelters indefinitely, waiting to testify in the proceedings. After 
testifying, the victims are reportedly deported, including those under age 18.<b>

<p><b>Urgent Appeal  
 
</b>675. By letter dated on 23 June 2006 the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, has jointly with Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding T. B., a 
German citizen of Turkish descent. According to information received:<b> 
 
</b>676. T. B. is a German citizen from Hamburg. In April 2006, T. B. traveled with her mother 
from Hamburg to the settlement of Karastlak K&#246;y&#252; in the village of Yeni Halfeti, &#350;anliurfa 
province, Southeast Turkey, where her grandmother and other relatives reside. Allegedly, her 
family had pretended that she was going to vacation in the village.<b> 
</b> 
677. Upon T. B. arrival in the village, her mother took her passport and identity documents 
away and told her that she had to enter into an arranged marry with a close relative. According to 
the latest information received, T. B. is still in Yeni Halfeti. Reportedly, she faces serious 
limitation of her freedom of movement and is only on rare occasions able to leave her 
grandmother&#8217;s house.<b> 
</b> 
678. Concern is expressed that T. B. may be forced to marry her relative against her will or face 
severe violence, if she refuses.<b> 
</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 115 
</p>
<p> 
679. We appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government to intervene in this case and ensure that the 
competent Turkish authorities undertake all necessary action to protect T. B. from forced 
marriage, any form of violence or the threat thereof.<b> 
 
Response from the Government 
 
</b>680. By letter dated 29 June 2006, the Government informed that it was established that T. B. 
during her vacation in Turkey, contacted the Provincial Gendarmerie Command in &#350;anliurfa by 
phone on 30 May 2006 and requested help from the authorities, stating that there were attempts 
to force her to get married to her uncle&#8217;s son. The gendarmerie authorities had to refer the matter 
to the Foreigners Section of the Police, since T. B. was a German citizen. T. B. was then assisted 
by the authorities to return to Germany on 2, June, 2006. On 27 June 2006, the Provincial 
Gendarmerie Commander in Yeni Halfeti visited T. B.&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s premises and confirmed 
that she was not in Turkey.<b> 
 
</b>681. According to a relative in Germany whom the Turkish authorities have contacted, T. B. has 
been granted protection at a social institution in Germany under the German laws and she will be 
hosted in this institution until October 2006 when she will complete the age of 18.<b> 
</b> 
682. In this framework, it has been confirmed that a forced marriage has not taken place during 
her stay in Turkey.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>683. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its reply to the 
communication of 23 June 2006 and would like to welcome the steps which the Government 
took to protect T.B. The Special Rapporteur would like to receive follow-up information on 
whether criminal action was taken against any of the alleged perpetrators.<b>

Allegation Letter  
 
</b>684.  On 18 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur has jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning S.M., the founder of Villa N. 18 - City of Hope, a shelter for abused and/or exploited 
women, including abused migrant domestic workers, trafficked women and minor girls. In early 
August 2006, the competent authorities have reportedly accused S.M. of having assaulted a 15-
year old girl who had sought refuge in the shelter. The authorities have reportedly also threatened 
to close the shelter, although no formal decision to that effect has yet been taken.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>685. Sources allege that the criminal charges against S.M. are fabricated. Concerns are 
expressed that these charges and the possible closure of the shelter may be in retaliation for her 
activities in defense of women's rights since the shelter&#8217;s work is reportedly viewed as a threat to 
the traditional culture and family values of the country and its continued operation largely 
depends on S.M.'s work.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1

<b> 
</b>686. We are also concerned that the charges against S.M. and the possible closure of the women 
and children shelter could lead to a protection gap for women and children at risk of violence, 
including migrant domestic workers and minor girls. We call on your Excellency's Government 
to investigate the allegations against S.M. in an objective, impartial, fair and speedy manner 
awarding her all procedural guarantees set out in international and national law.<b> 
 
Observations

sent on 18 October 2006 and would like to reiterate her interest in receiving a reply from the

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response from the Government to an allegation letter sent in 2005 
</b></p>
<p>688. On 28 April 2006, the Government responded to the communication sent jointly by the 
Special Rapporteur, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child 
pornography and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, on 28 November 2005 concerning the situation of children trafficked to and abused in 
the United Kingdom.<b> </b>According to information received, children, particularly girls, as young as 
2 years old, were reported to be increasingly trafficked into the country for domestic servitude, 
prostitution or to facilitate benefit fraud. The full details of the allegations submitted have been 
reflected in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous Report on Communications sent and received 
(E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.1).<b> 
 
</b>689. The Government assured the Special Rapporteur that it remained committed to providing 
support for all victims of trafficking and that it was fully committed to the implementation of the 
Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Crime. Its strategy to 
combat human trafficking is multi-faceted and aims to assure that there is legislation in place to 
criminalize trafficking, that there is cooperation with international partners to work to prevent 
trafficking at its source and that enforcement action against traffickers is effective. <b> 
</b> 
690. Legislation has actually been strengthened in order to cover trafficking for all purposes. 
The offence of trafficking for prostitution was introduced in the Nationality, Immigration and 
Asylum Act 2002 and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Moreover, the 
Sexual Offence Act 2003 introduced new wide-ranging offences covering trafficking into, out of 
or within the United Kingdom for any form of sexual offence, which also carriers a 14 year 
maximum penalty. The Act also introduced a range of new offences covering the commercial 
sexual exploitation of a child, protecting children up to 18. These include buying the sexual 
services of a child (for which the penalty ranges from imprisonment for seven years to life 
depending on the age of the child) and causing or inciting, arranging or facilitating and 
controlling the commercial sexual exploitation of a child in prostitution or pornography, for 
which the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. Another new offence, of &#8220;trafficking for 
exploitation&#8221;, which covers trafficking for forced labour and the removal of organs, was 
introduced in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. All these 
measures have taken into account the UK&#8217;s international obligations and fully comply with all </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 117 
</p>
<p> 
legislative requirements under the United Nations Protocol to Prevent and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons (Palermo Protocol).<b> 
</b> 
691. The Government added that there had been a number of arrests and convictions since the 
new legislation received Royal Assent. In April 2004, L. P. was sentenced to 23 years in prison 
for trafficking women for prostitution. In December 2004, two men were the first to be 
prosecuted under the specific offences of trafficking contained in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, 
together with associated charges such as rape and false imprisonment. This was quickly followed 
by three further successful prosecutions in March 2005 for human trafficking.<b> 
</b> 
692. In order to strengthen enforcement, a multi-agency task force was set up, under the name 
of REFLEX, which is overseen by the National Crime Squad. Reflex aims to reduce the harm 
caused by the serious and organized crime involved in people smuggling and human trafficking. 
Its establishment has enhanced coherence of the UK&#8217;s broad response to organized immigration 
crime and brings government departments and law enforcement agencies together to foster an 
intelligence-led operational response.<b> 
</b> 
693. Knowledge of child trafficking amongst appropriate professionals has also improved and a 
best practice toolkit on trafficking has even been published (available at 
www.crimereduction.co.uk/toolkits). This acts as a guide for immigration officers, police and 
other professionals who might potentially deal with the victims of trafficking, whether they are 
adults or children. In particular, it helps those concerned to treat victims of trafficking fairly and 
appropriately. <b> 
</b> 
694. In addition, the Immigration Service has reviewed and updated the Unaccompanied Minors 
Best Practice Guide to include a chapter on child trafficking. The guide aims to equip officers 
with the tools they need to recognize children who may have been trafficked and contains also a 
section on trafficking, the aim of which is to enable Immigration Officers to refer any children 
who may have been trafficked to the appropriate practitioners. An Interviewing Minors training 
course has been made available to border control staff since November 2003. Recognizing signs 
of trafficking is an important aspect of this course. Staff who have received this training have 
formed &#8220;Minors Teams&#8221; at ports, and deal with cases of unaccompanied minors arriving from 
the United Kingdom and work closely with social services, police and child protection officers.<b> 
</b> 
695. The Government recognized that when victims of trafficking are children, they are likely to 
be in need of welfare services and, in many cases, protection under the Children Act 1989. 
Children&#8217;s Services have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of trafficked children 
following an assessment of their circumstances. Where there is risk to the life of the child or a 
likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, such as the police 
or councils with Children&#8217;s Services responsibilities, should act quickly to secure the immediate 
safety of the child. Under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989, a local authority may also 
provide accommodation for any child within its area if it considers that this would safeguard or 
promote the child&#8217;s welfare.<b> 
</b> 
696. The Government added that after the murder of Victoria Climbi&#233;, the United Kindgom 
Government announced in January 2001 a statutory inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, to look at 
every aspect of the case. In January 2003, the Laming report was published (and can be viewed 
at httt://www.victoria-climbie-inquiry.org.uk/.) In response to the said report, the Government </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 118 
 
published a Green Paper, entitled &#8220;Every Child Matters&#8221;. Following extensive public 
consultation on it, the Children Act 2004 was introduced. In conjunction with the legislation a 
highly significant cross-government strategy known as the &#8220;Every Child Matters: Change for 
Children Programme&#8221; is also currently underway. Moreover, officers in the Department for 
Education and Skills will be publishing revised and updated multi-agency guidance to all 
statutory bodied which have a role in safeguarding children and protecting their welfare. This 
guidance entitled &#8220;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#8221; provides focused guidance to 
practitioners working with children who may be particularly vulnerable to abuse or exploitation.<b> 
</b> 
697. Regarding the identification of children missing education, the Government mentioned that 
it had strengthened arrangements. Local authorities have now a named individual responsible for 
receiving details of children found to be missing education and for brokering support for them 
through the most appropriate agencies. This is supported by the good practice guide, Identifying 
and Maintaining Contact with Children Missing or At Risk of Going Missing from Education&#8221; 
that has provided a practical model of process steps to help Local Education Authorities (LEAs) 
in their implementation of effective systems for identifying and maintaining contact with 
children missing, or at risk of going missing, from education. Nevertheless, it noted its deep 
concern about any child missing from education, as it is not just the child&#8217;s educational 
development that is at risk, but also potentially his/her safety and welfare. The Department for 
Education and Skills, the Home Office, and the policing service are continuing to work together 
to reinforce local procedures to ensure that any children at risk will be identified and appropriate 
safeguarding action taken (further information on this and the other elements of the change for 
children programme is made available on www.everychildmatters.gov.uk).<b> 
</b> 
698. Furthermore, there have been circumstances where concerns about the safety and welfare 
of children missing from school are sufficient to warrant police involvement. Initial enquiries 
made by the Metropolitan Police officers investigating the &#8220;Adam&#8221; murder (the case of the torso 
of a boy found in the Thames) actually identified 300 cases where African or Caribbean children 
had not returned to school following the 2001 summer break. However, no evidence was 
uncovered to suggest that any of them had come to harm, and there were no allegations from any 
of their families or schools that the welfare of these children was significantly at risk. The 
Metropolitan Police Service has made it clear that they believe the type of crime of which Adam 
was the victim to be extremely rare. This case did, nevertheless, increase concerns about a type 
of abuse which it was thought might emanate as a consequence of some belief systems in 
African communities. As a result, Operation Violet was launched by London&#8217;s Metropolitan 
Police to support the education of new community groups and representatives in acceptable and 
legal methods of child discipline in this country. The operation will also initiate intelligence-led, 
pro-active investigations into allegations of ritualistic belief-related child abuse to identify and 
prosecute any offenders.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>699. On the question pertaining to children brought to the United Kingdom to cure sufferers 
from HIV through sexual intercourse, the Government indicated that it had no information to 
support this, although they were aware that it is a belief in some regions of Africa where 
HIV/AIDS has reached endemic proportions.<b> 
 
</b>700. The United Kingdom Government was furthermore surprised about the claim mentioned in 
the communication on the shortcomings within the children&#8217;s services, police, and the 
immigration service resulting in children becoming victims of abuse. It indicated that there had </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 119 
</p>
<p> 
been several operational projects dedicated to the investigation of children entering the United 
Kindgom who may be at risk from different forms of exploitation. For example, in order to 
improve the sharing of information between the Immigration Services and Local Authorities, 
joint Treasury and Home Office funding has been used to set up a National Register of 
Unaccompanied Children (NRUC) database. By linking the databases with others concerning 
children at risk, the Government noted that it would be able to better address their needs, and 
ultimately improve child protection amongst this group of vulnerable children. <b> 
</b> 
701. Information on the work from Operation Paladin Child, an operation led by London&#8217;s 
Metropolitan Police Service between August and November 2004 to explore the nature of child 
migration from non-EU countries to the United Kingdom through London was also provided. 
The communication referred to 1,738 children at Heathrow under &#8220;suspicious circumstances&#8221; 
between August and November 2004, but the Government notes that this is surely a 
misunderstanding. The number actually refers to the results of Operation Paladin Child, where 
1,738 non asylum-seeking unaccompanied minors were purposely identified by British 
Immigration Service during a three month study period, so that the researchers could evaluate 
their circumstances in detail. Of these, 551 (30 per cent) were identified as potentially 
vulnerable. Social Services departments were unable to trace 12 of the 551 unaccompanied 
minors, and police enquires into their whereabouts continue. Operation Paladin did not find 
conclusive evidence that children were being trafficked into the UK through Heathrow, although 
it was acknowledged that the study was too limited in scale to predict fully the level of illegal 
child migration to the UK. Moreover, it is to be mentioned that the Metropolitan Police Child 
Abuse Investigation Command (CAIC), with funding from REFLEX have continued a presence 
at Heathrow airport as a result of Operation Paladin as part of a permanent multi-agency 
partnership to address the specific safeguarding needs of unaccompanied minors. They also have 
safeguarding responsibilities at Lunar House Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon, at Waterloo 
Station, and at London City and Gatwick Airports, together with other smaller airports within 
London, such as Biggin Hill. Police forces in other parts of the country are now working with 
immigration officers to use experience gained during Operation Paladin to work more effectively 
to safeguard children at other ports of entry.<b> 
</b> 
702. The Government also added that by 2006 a Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) 
aiming to reducing the harm caused to the United Kingdom and its citizens by organized crime 
including the trafficking of drugs and people would be created. This will surely have a United 
Kingdom-wide remit. The Home Secretary has made it clear that people smuggling and 
trafficking should be SOCA&#8217;s second priority after tackling drugs trafficking. <b> 
</b> 
703. Furthermore, on 1 April 2005, the Home Secretary announced plans to create a new 
national centre to protect children from sexual exploitation and combat online child abuse. This 
new centre will be called the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) and will be 
affiliated to SOCA and will provide a specific service to address internet-based child abuse, as 
well as developing a strategic role in using its international networks to raise awareness, collect 
intelligence and combat child trafficking.<b> 
</b> 
704. Finally, the Home Office recently published a draft United Kingdom Action Plan to 
combat Human Trafficking, which was out for public consultation until April 2006 
(http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/TacklingTrafficking.pdf). This action plan sets out 
the progress the United Kingdom has made so far in the fight against people trafficking, and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 120 
 
proposes future plans for building on the existing work in this area. It also aims at addressing all 
forms of trafficking, and covering the prevention, investigation, law enforcement, prosecution, 
and the provision of protection and assistance to all victims of trafficking.<b>

Allegation letter  
 
</b>706. By letter dated on 19 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences has sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning J.L. from 
Castle Rock in Colorado. <b> 
 
</b>707. According to information received: In 1999, a court in Colorado granted J.L. a protective 
order barring her estranged husband, S.G. from contact with her and the couple&#8217;s three daughters 
(aged 7, 9 and 10 at the time) outside specified visitation periods. Allegedly, S.G. had subjected 
J.L. and the three children to continued emotional violence and also stalked J.L. following the 
couple&#8217;s separation.<b> 
</b> 
708. On 22 June 1999, S.G. kidnapped the three girls from J.L.&#8217;s yard violating the protection 
order. J.L. reported her daughters missing to the Castle Rock Police Department and was later 
able to contact S.G. on his mobile phone, learn his location and verify that he still had the three 
girls with him. Even though J.L. called and visited the local police station numerous times during 
that night and informed them that her husband was with the children at a local amusement park, 
the police failed to investigate the situation, to apprehend S.G. and to take steps to return the 
children to their mother. Later that night, S.G. drove to the police station and opened fire with a 
semi-automatic handgun he purchased earlier that day. The police shot and killed S.G. Upon 
searching the truck, they discovered the bodies of his three daughters, whom he had murdered 
earlier that evening.<b> 
</b> 
709. In 2000, J.L. filed a federal lawsuit against the Town of Castle Rock and sought 
compensation based on the Police Department&#8217;s failure to enforce the protective order. She 
argued that both Colorado&#8217;s domestic violence mandatory arrest law and the court order require 
the police to enforce the terms of the order by arresting Mr. G. if he violated it. Although she lost 
at the district court level, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that J.L. had the right to sue the 
Town of Castle Rock. Castle Rock appealed the decision and the United States Supreme Court 
agreed to hear the case. In the judgment of Castle Rock vs. Gonzales, handed down in 2005, the 
Supreme Court reportedly held that J.L.&#8217;s rights under the United States Constitution had not 
been violated and that she had no personal entitlement to police enforcement of the protective 
order.<b>

the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary 
General on the situation of human rights defenders on 6 September 2005. Ms T.H. was the 
subject of a letter of urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary General on 
the situation of human rights defenders on 26 October 2005.<b> 
 
</b>712. According to the information received: On 26 December 2005 M.D. was arrested and 
accused of murder. It is reported that M.D. had been tortured while in detention. <b> 
</b> 
713. On 3 January 2006, G.Y. was arrested and taken to the Regional Department of the 
Ministry of the Interior. It is reported that G.Y. was so badly beaten during her detention that she 
could not walk. She was subsequently released. G.Y. had been due to meet with representatives 
from foreign embassies before these events.<b> 
</b> 
714. On 15 March 2006 M.M. was attacked by strangers at a bus stop and suffered injuries as a 
result of the attack. It is reported that E.U., along with  S.Y., was the signatory to a letter 
published on 15 March 2006 condemning repressive acts by the authorities against Muslims.<b> 
</b> 
715. On 17 March 2006 S.Y. was arrested and beaten by police officers. She is currently being 
held in a psychiatric hospital in Karchi. It is reported that S.Y., along with E.U., was the 
signatory to a letter published on 15 March 2006 condemning repressive acts by the authorities 
against Muslims.<b> 
</b> 
716. On 17 March 2006 L.V., a 69 year old human rights activist, was arrested and is currently 
being held in a psychiatric hospital in Tashkent. It is reported that L.V. had made written 
complaints about illegal actions taken by police officers. In 2004, L.V. was forcibly detained in a 
psychiatric hospital.<b> 
</b> </p>

717. It is reported that I.M. has been under constant surveillance and has been receiving 
constant threats ordering her to cease her human rights activities. It is alleged that on 3 August 
2005 she was detained and beaten after she visited the home of the chair of the Human Rights 
Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU). At the time of these events she was three months pregnant. As a 
result of the beating, I.M. miscarried. <b> 
</b> 
718. B.B. is also reported to be under constant surveillance and is not allowed to exit Jizzak 
province. It is alleged that B.B. was dismissed from her position of Chair of the Women&#8217;s 
Council her village after the Andijan massacre.<b> 
</b> 
719. T.H., K.S. and F.G. are all reported to be under constant surveillance. K.S. and  F.G. are 
not allowed to receive their respective regions. <b> 
</b> 
720. Grave concern was expressed that the above events are connected with the legitimate 
activities of the aforementioned women in defense of human rights, in particular their reporting 
of human rights violations by the Uzbek authorities. Furthermore, concern was expressed that 
this alleged pattern of intimidation against women human rights defenders and their families, 
which includes forced psychiatric detention, beatings and politically-motivated trials; may be an 
attempt to prevent women human rights defenders from carrying out their work.<b> 
 
Urgent Appeal</b>  
<b> 
</b>721. By letter on 10 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences has jointly with Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, sent an Urgent Appeal to the Government to bring its attention to the situation 
regarding A.F., chairman of the Sydaryn regional branch of the Human Rights Society of 
Uzbekistan (HRSU), T.Y., chairman of the HRSU, O.Y., the pregnant wife of A.F., B.K., 
chairman of the Dzhisak regional branch of the HRSU, M. M., chairman of the Samarkand 
branch of the HRSU and  A.K., chairman of the Mirzaabad regional branch of the HRSU.<b> 
 
</b>722. According to the information received: On 29 April 2006 police officers entered the 
apartment of  A.F. and conducted a search without presenting a search warrant. They left the 
apartment but returned one hour later and attempted to search it again.  O.Y., who was alone in 
the apartment at the time, called her husband T.Y., and  B.K. and  M.M., who came to the 
apartment to assist her. It is reported that when  O.Y., B.K and M.M. requested a search warrant 
from the police officers, the officers produced an order from a prosecutor but the document did 
not have an official stamp. Consequently O.Y., B.K. and M.M. objected to the search continuing 
and the police officers left the apartment. It is alleged that thirty minutes later a group of 30 men, 
who included police officers, entered the apartment and physically attacked O.Y. and his wife, as 
well as B. K and M.M. As a result of the attack O.Y.&#8217;s wife, who was pregnant, lost 
consciousness and was taken to hospital. It is reported that the police officers confiscated office 
equipment from the apartment.<b> 
</b> 
723. Furthermore, on 29 April 2006, A. F. and B. K. were arrested and detained in Gulistan, 
Syrdaryn region. It is reported that they are currently being held in the office of the Gulistan city 
police department but that no charges have been brought against them to date.<b> 
</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 123 
</p>
<p> 
724. Grave concern is expressed that these events may be connected with the activities of the 
above mentioned people in defense of human rights. Further concern is expressed that the above 
events form part of a campaign of intimidation and harassment against human rights defenders in 
Uzbekistan.<b> 
 
Follow-up urgent appeal</b>  
<b> 
</b>725. By letter dated on 21 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government to bring its attention to the information regarding M.T., a 
female human rights activist, who was already subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences on 18 July 2005. 
According to the information received: On 7 July 2006, M.T. was transferred to the psychiatric 
department of the Tashkent women&#8217;s prison. On 13 July 2006, her two lawyers went to visit her 
and reported that her physical condition had markedly deteriorated, one of her hands was 
bandaged and she uncharacteristically talked very slowly. When asked by one of her lawyers 
how her hand was damaged, she did not reply. She did say, however, that she has to take pills 
every day without being informed about what type of pills she is given. She is kept in a room 
with 16 drug users and persons with mental problems. On 14 July 2006, her lawyers sent a letter 
to the prison director to find out why M.T was transferred to the psychiatric department, but they 
did not receive a reply. Grave concern is expressed regarding the conditions under which M.T is 
surviving and it is feared that her treatment may be a direct result of her human rights activities.<b> 
 
Response from the Government  
 
</b>726. On 26 January 2006, the Government provided a response in Russian, which was still 
being translated at this time this report was finalized. The response will be reflected in the next 
Report on Communications Received and Sent.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response to an urgent appeal sent in 2005 
 
</b>727. On 27 October 2005, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Representative of the Secretary- 
General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning M.T., head 
of the Ut Yuraklar human rights organisation, an unregistered women&#8217;s rights organisation, 
member of the Organisation for the Defense of Rights and Freedoms of Uzbek Journalists, the 
Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) and the Committee for Freedom of Speech and 
Expression. M.T. also a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate (part of the initiative &quot;1000 Women for the 
Nobel Peace Prize&quot;) was the subject of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 18 
July 2005. According to the information received, on 7 October 2005, at approximately 11 p.m., 
M.T. was arrested at her home in the Ferghana Valley by a group of heavily armed police and 
Special Forces officers. The full details of the allegations submitted have been reflected in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous Report on Communications sent and received 
(E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.1).<b> 
 </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 124 
 
728. On 18 April 2006 the Government responded and stated that on 6 March 2006 MT was 
convicted by the criminal court of Tashkent province under articles 165, para. 3 (a), 167, para. 3 
(a), 168, para. 2 (b), 184, para. 2 (b), 189, para. 3, 197, 209, para. 1, 28, 209, para. 2 (a), 216, 
228, para. 2 (b), 228, para. 3, 229 and 244-1, para. 3 (b), of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan, 
and sentenced under articles 59 and 61 of the Criminal Code to eight years deprivation of liberty 
and stripped of the right to occupy managerial and financially responsible posts and to engage in 
business activity for a period of three years.<b> 
</b> 
729. According to the court judgment, the Government stated, M.T. was convicted of various 
fraudulent activities in a commercial context.<b> 
</b> 
730. The Government also stated that, in 2002, M.T. set up an illegal voluntary association 
called the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221;.  She thereupon used funds received from abroad to organize 
unauthorized demonstrations in front of buildings housing local authorities and government 
bodies in Tashkent and Fergana provinces for the purpose of putting pressure on them and their 
representatives.  During these demonstrations she disseminated information that she knew to be 
false, aimed at provoking panic and destabilization.<b> 
</b> 
731. Furthermore, M.T. did not declare the financial assistance received for organizing the 
activities of the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221; to the tax authorities and deliberately evaded payment of 
taxes and other charges to the value of 2,042,900 sum.<b> 
</b> 
732. According to the Government the criminal prosecution of M.T. was not related to her 
human rights work.  She was convicted for perpetrating specific criminal acts. This criminal case 
was currently being prepared for review by the court of appeal.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>733. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses to her letters dated 27 
October 2005 and 21 July 2006. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply to 
her communications dated 4 April and 10 May 2006 and would like to reiterate her interest in 
receiving replies from the Government in regard to the allegations submitted.<b>

<p><b>Zimbabwe 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent Appeal  
</b></p>
<p>734. By letter dated on 15 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government to bring to its attention the information 
regarding the on-going harassment of members of the NGO <i>Women of Zimbabwe Arise</i> 
(WOZA). WOZA is a grassroots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s 
activism, whose members have already been the subject of previous communications by the 
Special Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 16 February 2006, 20 May 2005, 29 
September 2004 and 26 September 2003.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 125 
</p>
<p> 
<b> 
</b>735. According to the information received: On 21 August 2006, over 200 activists from 
WOZA reportedly took the streets in the city of Bulawayo in order to protest over the 
introduction and implementation of the Monetary Policy by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. 
Among the concerns of the women&#8217;s organisation were the arbitrary searches, confiscation and 
subsequent depositing of old bearer cheques with authorities from the Reserve Bank; 
furthermore, in terms of the regulations issued by the President and being implemented by the 
Reserve Bank Governor, there is reportedly no remedy before the courts to challenge a 
confiscation. In the open letter that WOZA members wanted to deliver to the Governor, they 
protested against the government&#8217;s alleged solution to Zimbabwe&#8217;s economic crisis, the so-called 
&#8220;Operation Sunrise&#8221;.<b> 
</b> 
736. At around 11.15 a.m., the activists reportedly began their procession along Main Street. 
They were then intercepted by the police at the corner of Leopold Takawira Avenue and Main 
Street. It is alleged that the police arrested 153 of the women, who were brought to five separate 
holding places and police cells, namely: Bulawayo Central, Saucitown Police Station, Mzilikazi, 
Queens Park, and Barbourfields Police. Later on that day, their lawyers managed to secure the 
release of 39 persons, on condition that they report to Bulawayo Central Police everyday until 
the date of the initial appearance in court.<b> 
</b> 
737. During their arrest, E.K., one of WOZA activists, reportedly fell from the police truck and 
sustained a fractured arm. Besides, several juveniles complained of beatings while being 
interrogated by members of the Law and Order Section at Bulawayo Central before being 
released into the custody of their lawyers.<b> 
</b> 
738. On 23 August 2006, the activists appeared in court and were charged for contravening 
section 37(1) (b) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, which provides that &#8220;any 
person acting together with one or more other persons present with him or her in any place or at 
any meeting performs any action, utters any words or distributes or displays any writing, sign or 
other visible representation that is obscene, threatening, abusive or insulting, intending thereby to 
provoke a breach of the peace or realising that there is a risk or possibility that a breach of the 
peace may be provoked shall be guilty of participating in a gathering with intent to promote 
public violence, a breach of the peace or bigotry, as the case may be, and be liable to a fine not 
exceeding level ten or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or both&#8221;. However, on 
the same day, all the WOZA activists were granted free bail and remanded out of custody. They 
are due to appear in Court on 10 October 2006.<b> 
</b> 
739. Concern is expressed that these arrest, detention and conviction of WOZA members are 
linked to their activities in defense of human rights, in particular women&#8217;s rights, and may form 
part of a campaign of harassment and intimidation against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe.<b> 
 
Urgent appeal</b> 
<b> 
</b>740. By letter dated 7 December 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.1  
Page 126 
 
an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation of members of Women of Zimbabwe 
Arise (WOZA) and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA). WOZA, and its subdivision MOZA, is a 
grassroots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s activism, whose members have 
already been the subject of previous communications by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 
15 September 2006, 16 February 2006, 28 June 2005, 20 May 2005, 29 September 2004 and 26 
September 2003.  On 31 August 2005, the Government of Zimbabwe replied to the 
communication of 28 June 2005, which had concerned events similar to those now reported to 
us. While we welcome that reply, it does not allay our concerns as explained below.<b> 
 
</b>741. According to the allegations recently received: On 29 November 2006, more than 60 
WOZA members and four MOZA members were arrested while demonstrating peacefully and 
marching through central Bulawayo to the Government offices at Mhlanhlandlela. The march, 
composed of 200 participants, was to mark the launch of the People&#8217;s Charter and the &#8220;16 Days 
of Activism against Gender Violence&#8221;, an international campaign running until International 
Human Rights Day on 10 December, as well as to protest against the Public Order Security Act 
(POSA). <b> 
</b> 
742. A large group of riot police officers allegedly assaulted the group with baton sticks, 
forcefully dispersing most of it. Many people &#8211; including a baby &#8211; were beaten, and received 
medical care at Mpilo Hospital. 41 persons were reportedly taken to Drill Hall by police officers 
who subsequently beat them, before releasing them without charge on the same day. The other 
marchers, including WOZA leaders  J.W. and  M.M., were taken to Bulawayo Central Police 
Station, and 36 members, including six mothers with babies, spent the night there. On 30 
November 2006, the six mothers with babies were released. As of 1 December 2006, 34 
WOZA/MOZA members reportedly remained in police custody, beyond the 48-hours limit 
provided for by law.<b> 
</b> 
743. The WOZA and MOZA members, including the six mothers released, were charged on 1 
December 2006 under two separate sections of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act: 
Chapter 46 section 2 (v) &#8211; &#8220;employing any means whatsoever which are likely materially to 
interfere with the ordinary comfort, convenience, peace or quiet of the public, or does any act 
which is likely create a nuisance or obstruction&#8221; and Chapter 37 &#8211; &#8221;participating in a public 
gathering with the intent to cause public disorder, breach of peace or bigotry&#8221;. If found guilty, 
the members could be fined or imprisoned for a period not exceeding six months or both. <b> 
</b> 
744. A lawyer for WOZA was also threatened with arrest for &#8220;interfering with the course of 
justice&#8221; whilst trying to attend to her clients. She only managed to see the group on 30 
November 2006, in the afternoon, several hours after being in police custody.<b> 
</b> 
745. Serious concern is expressed that these new arrests of WOZA/MOZA members and the 
charges against them are in relation to their legitimate activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights. This concern is reinforced by the fact 
that this incident took place on the occasion of the first International Day on Women Human 
Rights Defenders celebrated every 29 November. Further concern is expressed that this new 
instance of repression against WOZA/MOZA members may form part of a campaign of 
harassment and intimidation against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe.<b> </b></p>

<b> 
Response from the Government 
</b> 
746.  By letter dated 14 December 2006, the Government of Zimbabwe sent a reply to the 
urgent appeal from 7 December 2006. The Government provided the following information: On 
29 November 2006, the Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) numbering more than forty (40) 
were dropped at the corner of Herbert Chitepo and 11th Avenue in Bulawayo by a white T35 
lorry and a red combi. Both vehicles had no registration numbers but it was noted that a white 
man was driving the lorry while a black man was driving the combi.<b> 
 
</b>747. Soon after, the woman started singing, shouting, and waving placards and a big banner. 
They were also distributing fliers to passers by while marching towards Mhlahlandlela 
Government Complex. On arrival, their leader Jennifer William addressed them, urging them not 
to run away from the police. When police arrived to disperse the rowdy and illegal gathering, 
they managed to arrest forty and not forty-one members of WOZA. Among the arrested was 
their leader Jennifer Williams.<b> 
</b> 
748. The members of WOZA were taken to Bulawayo Police Station where they were detained 
in Police Cells. They were all charged for contravening section 37 (1) (b) of the Criminal 
Codification Act Chapter 9:23 &#8220;Participating in gathering with intent to promote public violence, 
breach of peace or bigotry&#8221;. It is therefore not true that they were released without any charges 
and that they were released on the same day. We have it on record that they were taken to court 
on the 1st of December 2006 where the Public Prosecutor declined to place them on remand, 
advising the police to proceed by way of summons.<b> 
</b> 
749. None among those arrested was ever assaulted by the police and there is no record of any 
child having been among those who were arrested. If ever anyone was injured, it could be among 
those who ran away from the police and were never arrested. The police in this case are therefore 
not answerable for that which happened without their knowledge. We do not have any report of 
any compliant against the Police from any member of WOZA who had engaged in the illegal 
demonstration. <b> 
</b> 
750. The group&#8217;s lawyer,  P.D. was allowed to see her clients and at no stage was she ever 
threatened. There is also no record to indicate that she ever made a compliant about the alleged 
threat.<b> 
</b> 
751. It is important to note the contradiction in the issue raised in the document by OHCHR 
where at one stage it is indicated that the WOZA members were arrested and released on the 
same day without charge, and yet on another paragraph it is indicated that their lawyer visited 
them on the 30th of November while they were still in custody.<b> 
</b> 
752. Conclusion by the Government: Women of Zimbabwe Arise led by J.W. have become a 
law unto them and have the propensity to engage in illegal demonstrations contrary to the laws 
of the land. The ZRP has reiterated that its main duty is to reinforce the laws of the country and 
this it does without fear or favour. If members of the WOZA turn these illegal demonstrations 
into regular rituals, they should do so fully cognisant of the fact that they will be courting the 
wrath of the law. None of Zimbabwe is above the law.<b>

<b>Response from the Government to an allegation letter sent in 2005 
</b> 
753. On 16 November 2005, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal concerning <b>NM</b>, Coordinator of the Women&#8217;s Coalition, an umbrella body of 
women&#8217;s rights groups in Zimbabwe. According to the information received, on 8 November 
2005, NM was arrested and detained, allegedly for convening a meeting under the name of 
&#8216;Women Peacemakers International&#8217;. The meeting was a workshop aimed at training women in 
the use of non-violent means as a tool for dispute resolution. On 10 November 2005, NM was 
charged with contravening section 24 (6) of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), that is, 
organizing a political meeting without informing a regulatory authority. She was released on the 
same day but had been warned by the police that she would be summoned to appear in court 
once they had completed their investigations.<b> 
 
</b>754. On 23 January 2006, the Government responded stating that the allegation letter did not 
contain enough particular information to enable the Government to respond meaningfully to the 
case. The Government was aware, however, that some sections of the community have vowed to 
defy the provisions of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). The POSA requires that, save 
for certain exempted categories, all public gatherings, meetings or processions must be notified 
to the police four days in advance to enable the police to determine whether the 
gathering/processions requires protection or not. The Government further stated that persons not 
happy with a certain law can challenge it in the Constitutional Court (Supreme Court). That 
Court, however, had declared that the relevant POSA provision was reasonably necessary in a 
democratic society.<b> 
 
Observations 
 
</b>755. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Zimbabwe for its response to her letter 
dated 16 November 2005 and 7 December 2006. Regarding the response of 14 December 2006, 
she would like to receive further information on why the women concerned were charged with 
&#8220;Participating in gathering with intent to promote public violence, breach of peace or bigotry&#8221; 
considering that, according to the Government&#8217;s reply, they merely engaged in singing, shouting, 
waving placards and a big banner and the distribution of flyers.<b> 
 
</b>756. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply to her communication dated 15 
September 2005 and would like to reiterate her interest in receiving reply from the Government 
in regard to the allegation submitted.<b>
