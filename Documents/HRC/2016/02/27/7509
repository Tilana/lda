<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April 7 to 9 May 2014. The review of Norway was held at the 1st meeting, on 28 
April 2014. The delegation of Norway was headed by B&#248;rge Brende, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 2 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on 
Norway. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Norway: Congo, Indonesia and United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Norway: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/NOR/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/NOR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/NOR/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom 
was transmitted to Norway through the troika. The questions are available on the extranet 
of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the UPR mechanism was an important pillar of the Human 
Rights Council. Human rights were well protected in Norway and Norway had a 
longstanding commitment to human rights at both the international and national levels. In 
preparing the national report, Norway had consulted civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. The Norwegian State was established on the territory of two peoples: the 
Norwegians and the Sami, who were recognized as an indigenous people. There were five 
national minorities in Norway: Kven, Jews, Forest Finns, Roma and Romani. 
</p>
<p>7. In order to strengthen and simplify the legal framework on discrimination, the 
Government was currently working on a new comprehensive equality and anti-
discrimination act. The delegation reaffirmed that Norway was waging a continuous battle 
against forced marriage and female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>8. In response to questions from the Netherlands and Portugal, the delegation stated 
that the Government had decided to establish a new independent national human rights 
institution that complied with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for 
the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). </p>


<p>9. The delegation stated that combating domestic violence was a priority for the 
Government. Domestic violence was totally unacceptable and perpetrators must expect to 
be prosecuted and punished. Important measures for combating domestic violence were 
prevention and early identification, help and protection for victims, prosecution and 
treatment of perpetrators, and competence-building within the police and welfare services.  
</p>
<p>10. Regarding asylum seekers who were minors, the delegation stated that the 
Government attached great importance to ensuring a rapid asylum process with legal 
safeguards for those children, as well as good living conditions during the process.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the interactive dialogue, 89 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in section II below. 
</p>
<p>12. Iraq noted that Norway had acceded to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD) and ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), and had 
made efforts to establish a national human rights institution that could make 
recommendations to improve the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>13. Ireland noted the concerns expressed by the Committee against Torture and the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention about the lack of statistics on the use of solitary 
confinement. It also noted that, in 2012, the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions had recommended that the Norwegian Centre for Human Rights be 
downgraded from A to B status. 
</p>
<p>14. Iran (Islamic Republic of) expressed concern about a number of human rights issues. 
</p><p>15. Israel drew attention to a survey on the Norwegian population&#8217;s attitudes towards 
the Jewish community which revealed that anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish harassment 
persisted. It asked what specific measures would be adopted to strengthen and support 
efforts to combat anti-Semitism.  
</p>
<p>16. Italy noted that despite the efforts that had been made, statistics on cases of domestic 
violence had not improved since the first UPR cycle. 
</p>
<p>17. Japan noted the unequal status of immigrants in the labour market and the low 
employment rate for immigrant women, and encouraged Norway to take further steps to 
address such issues. 
</p>
<p>18. Jordan commended the Human Rights Commission for recommending the 
incorporation of a number of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights in the 
Norwegian Constitution.  
</p>
<p>19. Kyrgyzstan noted the measures to combat violence against children that were 
included in the new action plan against domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>20. Libya highlighted the action being taken by Norway to protect the rights and well-
being of children.  
</p>
<p>21. Malaysia enquired about the Government&#8217;s plan of action on establishing a new 
national human rights institution and asked whether a timetable had been set to move the 
process forward. It encouraged the Government to implement the key national priorities set 
for its human rights agenda. 
</p>
<p>22. Maldives said that the new anti-discrimination legislation, particularly the act on 
accessibility for persons with disabilities, would help ensure equal opportunities in the </p>


<p>workplace. However, more efforts were needed to promote tolerance and respect for 
diversity. 
</p>
<p>23. Mexico recognized the legislative and institutional progress made since the first 
UPR cycle, such as the ratification of international instruments and the introduction of 
legislation against discrimination. It encouraged Norway to establish a national human 
rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>24. The Republic of Moldova noted the progress made in implementing the 
recommendations of the first UPR cycle and the international and national efforts to combat 
human trafficking, but challenges remained regarding procedures and criteria for 
identifying victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>25. Montenegro recognized the steps the Government had taken to promote human 
rights and implement new mechanisms to address problem areas, in particular 
discrimination and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>26. The Netherlands noted the external review of the Norwegian Centre for Human 
Rights, which was not in compliance with the Paris Principles, and highlighted concerns 
about the situation of detainees, specifically the length of police custody. 
</p>
<p>27. New Zealand encouraged Norway to move to full implementation of CRPD, 
particularly regarding the use of coercion in mental health care, and noted the 
Government&#8217;s desire to reduce the use of coercion in that context.  
</p>
<p>28. Nicaragua noted the growing number of women victims of trafficking and the 
prevalence of violence against women in Norway. It encouraged Norway to continue its 
leadership role in the Human Rights Council and to promote dialogue and cooperation 
between countries. 
</p>
<p>29. The Niger noted the new legislation enacted to combat discrimination, especially on 
the grounds of ethnicity, religion and disability, and the measures adopted to promote the 
rights of indigenous peoples, minorities, refugees and asylum seekers. 
</p>
<p>30. Nigeria invited Norway to accede to the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) and urged it to continue 
improving conditions for migrants, denounce racial discrimination in more practical terms 
and expedite the process of establishing a fully-fledged national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>31. Pakistan was encouraged by efforts made by Norway to implement the 
recommendations from the first UPR cycle and steps taken over the previous four years to 
protect and promote human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>32. Paraguay highlighted progress in terms of respect for human rights in Norway, but 
expressed concern that in 20 to 30 per cent of murders committed in the previous decade, 
the victim and perpetrator had been a couple. 
</p>
<p>33. The Philippines believed that Norway had much to share in terms of best practice on 
protecting and promoting human rights, but regretted that it had still not acceded to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families (ICRMW), despite its steadfast advocacy for equality and non-
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>34. The Norwegian delegation, in response to questions concerning the situation of the 
Roma, said that improving their situation was a priority for the Government. Norway was 
supporting measures for the social inclusion of the Roma through 80 programmes in 10 
European countries.  
</p>
<p>35. A grant scheme had been established to provide humanitarian assistance to foreign 
beggars. Migrant Roma had not been targets of serious hate crime. </p>


<p>36. In response to a question from Mexico, the delegation said that the consultations 
between the central Government and the Sami Parliament would to be undertaken in good 
faith with the objective of achieving agreement. The consultation mechanism ensured that 
decision makers were well acquainted with the views of the Sami Parliament. 
</p>
<p>37. In response to a question from Mexico on how indigenous people participate in 
decisions on the use of land and natural resources, the delegation referred to the Finnmark 
Act, which had established the Finnmark Estate, an independent entity that owned all the 
land in Finnmark county that had previously belonged to the State. The Sami Parliament 
appointed half of the Finnmark Estate board members.  
</p>
<p>38. In response to a question from Germany regarding indigenous peoples and mining 
activities, the delegation emphasized that the mineral industry played an important role in 
securing jobs and development in rural areas. Norwegian legislation included a number of 
provisions that safeguarded Sami interests in that context.  
</p>
<p>39. In response to a question from the Netherlands, the delegation emphasized that rape 
was a serious and totally unacceptable crime. In the Penal Code, rape was defined by listing 
factors that negate consent. The Government&#8217;s ambition was to reduce the incidence of 
rape, assist victims in the best way possible and improve the way rape cases were handled 
in the criminal justice system.  
</p><p>40. In response to a question from the Netherlands about prolonged detention in police 
holding cells, the delegation stated that regulations required detainees to be transferred from 
police custody to a normal prison within 48 hours of their arrest, unless practical 
considerations made that impossible.  
</p>
<p>41. In response to questions from Ireland and the Netherlands on the use of solitary 
confinement in detention, the delegation said that major improvements had been made in 
that regard in recent years. The courts could approve isolation only if stringent conditions 
were satisfied and the time limits were strict. There had been a significant reduction in the 
use of solitary confinement, which was normally reserved for the most serious cases and 
lasted for short periods only. Concerning solitary confinement during the execution of 
sentences, the delegation described measures to ensure that solitary confinement was 
applied more selectively. 
</p>
<p>42. In response to questions and recommendations from Kyrgyzstan and Mexico on 
education for minors seeking asylum, the delegation indicated that all children in Norway 
had the same legal right and duty to attend primary and lower secondary school, regardless 
of background.  
</p>
<p>43. In response to a question from the United Kingdom concerning the standard of 
emergency shelters and social housing, especially for families with children, the delegation 
stated that Norwegian municipalities were obliged to find temporary accommodation for 
persons who were unable to find accommodation by themselves. The accommodation had 
to be of a sufficient standard to meet the needs of the persons concerned. 
</p>
<p>44. Responding to a question from Mexico on the export of arms or munitions, the 
delegation said that Norway had a strict, long-standing arms export policy. It did not permit 
the sale of arms or munitions to areas in which there was a war, civil war or threat of war. 
</p>
<p>45. Responding to a question from Spain, the delegation answered that the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights were a cornerstone of the Government&#8217;s 
approach to human rights and business. 
</p>
<p>46. Responding to a question from Israel about combating anti-Semitism, Norway 
emphasized that knowledge was a key factor and described measures aimed at preventing 
anti-Semitism in schools. </p>


<p>47. Responding to questions from, inter alia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia 
and Timor-Leste about the gender pay gap, the delegation stated that it had decreased over 
time, but that on average, women continued to earn 12.7 per cent less than men per hour, 
primarily owing to the gender divide in the labour market. The Government hoped to 
further reduce the gender pay gap. 
</p>
<p>48. In response to recommendations from Italy and New Zealand, the delegation 
emphasized that the Government would pursue efforts to reduce the use of coercion in the 
mental health services. The use of coercion was strictly regulated by law and could be used 
as a last resort only, in order to care for patients with serious mental illness. 
</p>
<p>49. Responding to recommendations that Norway should accede to ICRMW, the 
delegation said that Norway had ratified all the International Labour Organization core 
conventions on workers&#8217; rights, which also applied to residents who were foreign nationals. 
Norway had, however, decided not to accede to ICRMW.  
</p>
<p>50. The delegation noted that some States had recommended that Norway should accede 
to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
procedure, OP-ICESCR and the Optional Protocol to CRPD. The Government was 
thoroughly investigating the legal implications before making a decision. Two legal studies 
had been commissioned and circulated for general review and those questions were still 
under consideration. 
</p>
<p>51. Norway was currently considering the question of ratification of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPED). 
</p><p>52. In response to questions from Mexico and others concerning hate crime, the 
delegation underlined the seriousness of such offences and reiterated that hatred towards 
specific groups was considered an aggravating circumstance by the courts. The Penal Code 
had been amended in 2013 to extend criminal liability for certain kinds of statements made 
in public to statements made on the Internet.  
</p>
<p>53. Poland noted efforts made by Norway to comply with the recommendations of the 
first review, but acknowledged that, despite many positive developments in the field of 
human rights, certain challenges remained. 
</p>
<p>54. Portugal observed that the dropout rate in upper secondary schools in Norway was 
higher among immigrant students. It requested further information about the Government&#8217;s 
ongoing process to re-establish its national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>55. The Russian Federation drew attention to problems relating to freedom of belief. It 
also noted that, when children were removed from parental care and placed with new 
families, insufficient attention was paid in some cases to their cultural, linguistic and 
religious identity. Moreover, foster children had reportedly been subjected to violence. 
</p><p>56. Rwanda noted efforts made by Norway to fulfil its human rights commitments since 
its last UPR, including improving gender equality and accessibility for persons with 
disabilities and combating forced marriage, female genital mutilation and domestic 
violence. It also commended Norway for its handling of the cases of genocide suspects 
through prosecution and extradition. 
</p>
<p>57. Saudi Arabia expressed concern about persistent cases of domestic violence, rape 
and hate crime targeted at certain ethnic groups and minorities, particularly Muslims. It 
urged the Government to take vigorous action against hate crimes and to promote the 
equality of all citizens.  
</p>
<p>58. Serbia acknowledged positive developments in strengthening human rights in the 
country. It suggested that Norway step up its efforts to address discrimination of vulnerable 
groups in the context of its national integration policy. </p>


<p>59. Sierra Leone commended Norway for its generous assistance to development 
overseas. It stressed the importance of developing strategies to promote tolerance and 
diversity and strengthening measures to ensure greater equality for women and minorities. 
It was concerned about reports of hate speech and hate crime against minority groups, 
asylum seekers and immigrants. 
</p>
<p>60. Slovenia recognized Norway as a role model in terms of safeguarding democracy, 
ensuring the rule of law and focusing efforts on addressing key human rights challenges 
currently facing States globally in a turbulent world.  
</p>
<p>61. South Africa expressed appreciation for the continued and consistent contribution of 
Norway to development projects in Africa. It noted efforts made by Norway since its last 
review and encouraged it to continue its efforts to promote, protect and fulfil human rights 
in the country. 
</p>

independent international human rights institution and that measures were being taken to 
tackle the problem of gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>63. Cuba expressed concern about persistent discrimination against Romani, indigenous 
and immigrant communities, incitement to hatred, and xenophobic, anti-Semitic and 
Islamophobic statements. 
</p>
<p>64. The State of Palestine noted that Norway had taken measures to ascertain the nature, 
extent and causes of discrimination in various areas of society. 
</p>
<p>65. The Sudan enquired about the main achievements and lessons learned through the 
implementation of the Action Plan to Promote Equality and Prevent Ethnic Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>66. Switzerland expressed concern regarding the duration of police custody and of 
solitary confinement in both police custody and pretrial detention. It was also concerned 
about allegations of arbitrary deprivation of liberty and arbitrary constraint measures in 
mental health-care centres. 
</p>
<p>67. Thailand noted with interest the establishment of Children&#8217;s Houses providing 
assistance to child victims of exploitation and abuse.  
</p>
<p>68. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia referred to treaty body concerns 
regarding gender inequality and inadequate representation of women with minority 
backgrounds in prominent societal roles. It enquired about the results of the work 
undertaken by KOMpakt, the Government&#8217;s consultative body, and requested details of the 
2013 white paper concerning domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>69. Timor-Leste noted that there were areas, such as gender equality, equal 
remuneration for men and women, and the right to education of indigenous peoples, in 
which further improvements were required.  
</p>
<p>70. Togo expressed concern about discrimination against the immigrant population, 
especially in the labour market, housing, education and health care.  
</p>
<p>71. Tunisia encouraged Norway to ratify CPED and to expedite the establishment of a 
national human rights institution that complied with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>72. Turkey noted the increase in Islamophobic, anti-Semitic and racially motivated hate 
crimes.  
</p>
<p>73. Turkmenistan expressed concern about reports of an increase in xenophobic

remained a problem and noted with concern reports that the number of victims was steadily 
increasing.  </p>


<p>74. Ukraine noted the establishment of an interministerial coordination group to 
strengthen the implementation of recommendations accepted by Norway and improve its 
reporting to the human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>75. The United Kingdom urged Norway to intensify its efforts to ensure that emergency 
shelters and social housing units met an adequate standard, especially for families with 
children, and to strengthen strategies to prevent discrimination against migrant Roma and 
provide for their basic needs.  
</p>
<p>76. The United States of America was concerned that preventive measures had not 
reduced the incidence of domestic violence and rape, and concerned at the high level of 
acquittals, lenient sentences and the legal definition of rape, which required the use or 
threat of force. It was also concerned at the treatment of asylum seekers and stateless 
persons, especially minors. 
</p>
<p>77. Uruguay encouraged Norway to complete the process of ratification of OP-ICESCR 
and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
communications procedure. 
</p>
<p>78. Uzbekistan noted concerns about discrimination against immigrants, particularly in 
the labour market, education, health care and housing, and expressions of racial hatred and 
intolerance, especially against the Sami people, as well as high rates of violence against 
women and of human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>79. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) expressed concern about the persistence of 
crimes motivated by prejudice and incitement to hatred against specific minority groups, 
such as the Roma. 
</p>
<p>80. Viet Nam noted that the strengthened legal framework in Norway better ensured 
gender equality and improved living standards for indigenous peoples and minorities. 
Norway participated in education, training and international cooperation in the field of 
human rights and was committed to the protection of vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>81. Albania said that Norwegian citizens benefited from the highest standards of 
democracy and freedom. Norway had developed human rights standards in respect of 
gender equality, the rights of persons with disabilities and those of minorities. 
</p>
<p>82. In response to questions from Liechtenstein and Spain and recommendations from 
the United States on asylum and immigration, the Norwegian delegation stated that the 
Government would continue to fulfil its international obligations in the areas of migration 
and asylum policies.  
</p>
<p>83. The Government maintained that the asylum system was a key tool in providing 
protection to those who were genuinely in need, and that it must not be abused. Asylum 
status was granted on the basis of individual processing and a thorough assessment of each 
application. 
</p>
<p>84. Responding to issues raised by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Republic of 
Moldova and Nicaragua concerning trafficking in human beings, the delegation described, 
inter alia, the 2010 action plan on measures to fight all forms of human trafficking, steps to 
provide safe housing and appropriate follow-up of victims and provisions in the 
Immigration Act strengthening the protection of victims. The question of establishing a 
national referral mechanism to better identify and assist victims of trafficking was being 
assessed. 
</p>
<p>85. Responding to questions from India, the Russian Federation and Turkey, the 
delegation said that the purpose of the Child Welfare Act was to protect children. A care 
order was relevant only if the child&#8217;s situation was serious and could not be alleviated 
through the application of voluntary assistance measures. The underlying principle of the </p>


<p>Act was that a child should grow up with its biological parents. A care order could be 
issued only if a child&#8217;s care was seriously deficient or the child was a victim of abuse.  
</p>
<p>86. Responding to questions about ethnic discrimination from, inter alia, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland and the Sudan, Norway referred to the Action 
Plan to Promote Equality and Prevent Ethnic Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>87. Algeria encouraged Norway to expedite the process of establishing a new national 
human rights institution and to ratify ICRMW.  
</p>
<p>88. Angola, while noting the progress Norway had made on human rights, not least on 
gender equality issues, drew attention to the continuing problem of the integration of 
migrants, since that group suffered the highest levels of unemployment.  
</p>
<p>89. Argentina noted that Norway had indicated that it would prioritize ratification of 
ICPED. Argentina shared its concern about and commitment to the elimination of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>90. Armenia appreciated the help Norway had provided to the survivors of the 
Armenian genocide, its integration policy for migrants and minorities and its commitment 
to the elimination of hate speech and hate crime.  
</p>
<p>91. Australia observed that the UPR report highlighted the consistent promotion by 
Norway of human rights and democratic principles. Norway had introduced four new anti-
discrimination acts in January 2014, covering sexual orientation, gender equality, ethnicity 
and persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>92. Austria recognized the high standards that Norway had achieved in the promotion 
and protection of human rights, its contributions to the system of international human rights 
protection and its commitment to the advancement of human rights globally. 
</p>
<p>93. Azerbaijan highlighted concerns about discrimination against migrants, persons 
from immigrant backgrounds, asylum seekers and refugees in accessing public services, 
health services and employment, and allegations of ill-treatment of, and hate speech 
directed at, minorities and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>94. Bahrain expressed concern about reports of discrimination against minorities and 
indigenous peoples, especially women and children. It was also concerned about persistent 
hate speech and incitement to xenophobia and to religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>95. Bangladesh observed that Norway had not yet ratified ICRMW and that there 
remained scope for further attention to preventing discrimination against immigrants.  
</p>
<p>96. Belarus expressed concern about migrant integration and employment issues and the 
problems encountered by Roma, especially in the education system. It was also concerned 
about reports of incitement to hatred and other forms of intolerance, including by political 
parties. 
</p>
<p>97. Benin noted that Norway had ratified a number of international conventions on 
human rights, including CRPD and OP-CAT, in response to the recommendations received 
in 2009. 
</p>
<p>98. Botswana noted efforts made to address discrimination against migrants and asylum 
seekers, but encouraged Norway to do more to prevent violence. It also noted that 
challenges remained in gender mainstreaming and in combating substance abuse by 
children and young people.  
</p>
<p>99. Brazil referred to policies introduced to encourage gender equality, religious 
tolerance and access to social security by foreign residents. It indicated that immediate </p>


<p>attention should be given to the best interests of the child, specifically in all immigration 
matters, and to the situation of migrants. 
</p>
<p>100. Canada asked what progress Norway had achieved since 2009 in generating data on 
manifestations of racial discrimination and the situation of minority groups in order to 
identify patterns of direct and indirect discrimination. 
</p>
<p>101. Chile noted that human rights had been strengthened through recent amendments to 
the Norwegian Constitution and that the country had the capacity to renew its efforts to 
tackle domestic violence, promote equality of opportunity and combat all forms of 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>102. China noted the progress made in protecting children&#8217;s rights and in combating 
domestic violence and human trafficking. However, violence against women continued, 
Roma and migrants suffered discrimination and the Sami language and culture could not be 
guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>103. The Republic of the Congo noted that more action was required to combat 
discrimination against women, minorities, indigenous peoples and persons of foreign 
origin. The fact that minors were detained together with adults was a cause for concern. 
</p>
<p>104. Costa Rica noted that Norway had ratified several international human rights 
instruments, introduced measures to combat discrimination against minorities and made 
commitments to improve the situation of asylum seekers and refugees. 
</p>
<p>105. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire noted the institutional and legislative reforms undertaken by Norway 
in respect of human rights, including gender equality and the rights of persons with 
disabilities, national minorities, migrants and asylum seekers. 
</p>
<p>106. Sri Lanka noted the progress made in the area of children&#8217;s rights but stated that 
gender equality remained a challenge; higher education programmes were gender-divided 
and women earned lower wages than men. It acknowledged that targeted measures were 
being taken to tackle the high unemployment rate among immigrants. 
</p>
<p>107. The Czech Republic noted the efforts being taken in Norway to improve access to 
education for Roma. Reducing absenteeism required addressing the underlying social 
causes and the full cooperation of all stakeholders, including parents.  
</p>
<p>108. Denmark indicated that continuous monitoring and reporting of the human rights 
situation in Norway would be essential to track results of efforts made. It welcomed work 
on the draft Nordic Sami Convention, which would advance the rights of the Sami across 
country borders. 
</p>
<p>109. Ecuador was concerned at the situation of ethnic minorities, particularly the Roma, 
and at the high number of complaints by migrants of ill-treatment at the hands of the police
