         interest in any distribution from the Trust (whether of net income, net
         realized capital gains or other amounts) and in any net assets of the
         Trust in the event of termination or winding-up of the Trust. All Trust
         Units outstanding from time to time shall be entitled to equal shares
         in any distributions by the Trust and, in the event of termination or

         Units shall rank among themselves equally and rateably without
         discrimination, preference or priority.

         such person purchasing or agreeing to purchase Trust Units from the
         Trust or from any other person or procuring or agreeing to procure
         purchasers for Trust Units. Without limitation of the foregoing, AOG
         may authorize the Trust to create and issue rights, warrants (including
         so-called "special warrants" which may be exercisable for no additional
         consideration), or options or other securities (including unit
         appreciation rights payable in whole or in part with Trust Units) to
         subscribe for, purchase, convert into or exchange for Trust Units which
         rights, warrants, options or other securities may be exercisable at
         such subscription price or prices and at such time or times as AOG may
         determine. The rights, warrants, options or other securities so created
         may be issued for such consideration or for no consideration, all as
         AOG may determine. A right, warrant, option or other security (whether
         convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Trust Units or not) shall
         not be a Trust Unit and the holder thereof shall not be a Unitholder.
<PAGE>
                                       13
(b)      AOG may authorize the creation and issuance of debentures, notes and
         other evidence of indebtedness of the Trust which debentures, notes or
         other evidence of indebtedness may be created and issued from time to
         time on such terms and conditions, to such persons and for such
         consideration as AOG may determine.
(c)      Subject to Section 3.1(a), Trust Units are only to be issued as fully
         paid and non-assessable and the consideration received by the Trust in
         connection with the issuance of Trust Units may consist of money or
         property or past service, provided that property will include a
         promissory note or promise to pay given by the allottee.
3.3      TRANSFER OF TRUST UNITS
The Trust Units may be transferred by the holder thereof, subject to
Section 3.7 and Article 12 hereof, and to compliance with any laws applicable to
the holder thereof.
3.4      CONSOLIDATION OF TRUST UNITS
Immediately after any PRO RATA distribution of additional Trust Units
to all Unitholders pursuant to Section 5.8, the number of the outstanding Trust
Units will be consolidated such that each Unitholder will hold after the
consolidation the same number of Trust Units as the Unitholder held before the
distribution of additional Trust Units. In this case, each Trust Certificate
representing a number of Trust Units prior to the distribution of additional
Trust Units is deemed to represent the same number of Trust Units after the
distribution of additional Trust Units and the consolidation.
3.5      NO PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS
No person shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or
purchase any Trust Unit.
3.6      NO FRACTIONAL TRUST UNITS
Fractions of Trust Units shall not be issued, except pursuant to
distributions of additional Trust Units to all Unitholders pursuant to Section
5.8.
3.7      RE-PURCHASE OF INITIAL TRUST UNITS BY FUND
The parties hereto confirm that immediately after May 24, 2001, the
Trust purchased the ten initial Trust Units from the Settlor, and the Settlor
sold the ten initial Trust Units to the Trust for a purchase price of $100 and,
upon the completion of such purchase and sale, the ten initial Trust Units were
cancelled and are no longer outstanding for any of the purposes of this
Indenture and the Settlor is no longer a party to this Indenture for any
purpose.
3.8      NON-RESIDENT OWNERSHIP CONSTRAINT
(a)      From time to time, the Corporation, shall take reasonable steps under
         the circumstances to monitor the number of Trust Units beneficially
         owned by non-residents of Canada (within the meaning of the Income Tax
         Act) with a view to generally determining that the level of
         non-resident ownership remains at not more than 45% of the issued and
         outstanding units on a diluted basis (the "Ownership Threshold"). Upon
         the Board of Directors being advised that the level of non-resident
         ownership has exceeded the Ownership Threshold and continues to do so
         for four consecutive months, the Board of Directors shall review
         strategies to maintain majority ownership of Trust Units by Canadian
         residents in order to ensure that the Trust is not being maintained
<PAGE>
                                       14
primarily for the benefit of non-residents of Canada. In addition to
         other strategies to maintain majority Canadian ownership which the
         Board of Directors may approve from time to time, the Corporation be
         authorized hereunder and entitled to implement non-resident ownership
         constraints, including the following measures:
(i)      the Corporation may advise the Trustee and the Transfer Agent,
                  and the Trust may make a public announcement advising that the
                  Ownership Threshold has been exceeded and:
(A)      neither the Corporation, on behalf of the Trust, nor
                           the Transfer Agent shall accept a subscription for
                           Trust Units from or issue or register a transfer of
                           Trust Units to a person unless (i) the person
provides a declaration that the person is not a
                           non-resident of Canada; or (ii) the person provides a
                           declaration from the transferor that the transferor
                           of the Trust Units is a non-resident of Canada; and
(B)      the Transfer Agent shall (upon receiving a direction
                           from the Corporation and a suitable indemnity from
                           the Trust) send a notice to non-resident holders of
                           Trust Units, chosen in inverse order to the order of
                           acquisition or registration or in such manner as the
                           Corporation may consider equitable and practicable,
                           requiring them to sell their Trust Units or a portion
                           thereof within a specified period of not less than 60
                           days. If the Unitholders receiving such notice have
                           not sold the specified number of Trust Units or
                           provided the Corporation with satisfactory evidence
                           that they are not non-residents of Canada within such
                           period, the Corporation may on behalf of such
                           Unitholders sell such Trust Units and, in the
                           interim, shall suspend the voting and distribution
                           rights attached to such Trust Units. Upon such sale
                           the Unitholders thereby affected shall cease to be
                           holders of Trust Units and their rights shall be
                           limited to receiving the net proceeds of sale of such
                           Trust Units.
The Corporation shall inform the Transfer Agent of the provisions of
         this subsection 3.8(a), and the Corporation or the Transfer Agent may
         require declarations as to the jurisdictions in which beneficial owners
         of Trust Units are resident in order to effect this subsection 3.8(a).
(b)      It is acknowledged that the Corporation will not be able to
         definitively determine the number and percentage of Trust Units held by
         non-residents of Canada. Accordingly, the Corporation may exercise its
         discretion in determining whether or not such Trust Units are held by
         non-residents of Canada, and any reasonable and bona fide exercise by
         the Corporation of its discretion shall be binding for the purpose of
         this Section 3.8 and shall not subject any of the Trustee, the Transfer
         Agent or the Corporation or their respective directors, officers,
         employees or agents to any liability for any violation of the
         non-resident ownership restrictions which may occur during the term of
         the Trust.
(c)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, non-residents of
         Canada shall not be entitled to vote in respect of any Special
         Resolution to amend this Section 3.8.

         including without limitation, facilities of any kind and whether
         effected through the acquisition of assets or the acquisition of shares
         or other form of ownership interest in any entity, the substantial
         majority of the assets of which are comprised of like assets;
(f)      undertaking such other business and activities including investing in

and to pay the costs, fees and expenses associated therewith or incidental
thereto.
4.2      QUALIFICATION
Under no circumstances shall the Trustee, AOG or the Manager purchase
or authorize the purchase of any security, asset or investment on behalf of the
Trust or using any Trust assets or property which is defined as "foreign
property" under subsection 206(1) of the Income Tax Act or is a "small business

Tax Act or would result in the Trust not being considered either a "unit trust"
or a "mutual fund trust" for purposes of the Income Tax Act at the time such
investment was made.
ARTICLE 5
                                  DISTRIBUTIONS
5.1      DETERMINATION OF DISTRIBUTABLE INCOME OF THE TRUST
In this Article 5, the "Distributable Income of the Trust" for the
period ending on a Distribution Record Date shall be the Distributable Income,
for the period commencing immediately following the preceding Distribution
Record Date (or, for the first Distribution Record Date of July 3, 2001, the
period commencing immediately after the Closing) and ending on such Distribution
Record Date (each, a "Distribution Period").
Items of income or expense not provided for in the definition of
Distributable Income or in Section 5.3 shall be included in such calculation on
such basis as may be considered appropriate by the Trustee.
<PAGE>
                                       16
5.2      DISTRIBUTABLE INCOME OF THE TRUST TO BECOME PAYABLE
The Trustee may, on or before each Distribution Record Date within a
fiscal year, declare payable, to the Unitholders of record on such Distribution
Record Date, all or any part of the Distributable Income of the Trust
(determined in accordance with Section 5.1) for the Distribution Period ending
on such Distribution Record Date, or the Distributable Income of the Trust
(determined in accordance with Section 5.1) for any previous Distribution Period
which has not been distributed, and the proportionate share of each Trust Unit
of the amount so payable shall be determined by dividing such amount by the
number of Trust Units in the Trust outstanding on that Distribution Record Date.
Each Unitholder's share thereof shall be equal to the proportionate share per
Trust Unit multiplied by the number of Trust Units owned of record by the
Unitholder on that Distribution Record Date and shall be payable to each such
Unitholder on the Distribution Payment Date next following the Distribution
Record Date, subject to Sections 5.7(b) and 5.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the amount of any Distributable Income of the Trust that is determined by the
Trustee to be required to be retained by the Trust in order to pay any tax
liability of the Trust shall not be payable by the Trust to the Unitholders. In
addition, Unitholders may, at the discretion of the Trustee, receive
distributions in respect of repayments of principal made by AOG to the Trust on
the Notes.
5.3      NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS TO BECOME PAYABLE
The Trustee may, on or before each Distribution Record Date, declare
payable to the Unitholders of record on such Distribution Record Date all or
part of the net realized capital gains of the Trust to the extent not previously
declared payable, and the proportionate share of each Trust Unit of the amount
so payable shall be determined by dividing such amount by the number of Trust
Units in the Trust outstanding on that Distribution Record Date. Each
Unitholder's share thereof shall be equal to the proportionate share per Trust
Unit multiplied by the number of Trust Units owned of record by the Unitholder
on that Distribution Record Date and shall be payable to each such Unitholder on
the Distribution Payment Date next following the Distribution Record Date,
subject to Section 5.8. For the purposes of this Article 5, "net realized
capital gains" of the Trust means the total of all capital gains realized by the
Trust less the total of all capital losses realized by the Trust, excluding any
capital gains or losses arising from the distribution of Common Shares or Notes
pursuant to Section 9.5 in respect of Trust Units tendered for redemption, all
as determined for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.
5.4      DISTRIBUTABLE INCOME AND NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS FOR INCOME TAX
PURPOSES TO BECOME PAYABLE
(a)      On December 31 of each fiscal year, an amount equal to the income of
         the Trust for the fiscal year ending on such date (excluding net
         realized capital gains) determined in accordance with the Income Tax
         Act, other than paragraph 82(1)(b) thereof, to the extent not
         previously payable pursuant to Section 5.2 on any Distribution Record
         Date in the fiscal year (including December 31 of that fiscal year) to
         any Unitholder, shall be payable to Unitholders of record at the end of
         that fiscal year, and the proportionate share of each Trust Unit of the
         amount so payable shall be determined by dividing such amount by the
         number of Trust Units in the Trust outstanding at such time. Each
         Unitholder's share thereof shall be equal to the proportionate share
         per Trust Unit multiplied by the number of Trust Units owned of record
         by the Unitholder as at the end of that fiscal year and shall be
         payable to each such Unitholder on the Distribution Payment Date next
         following the end of such fiscal year, subject to Sections 5.7(b) and
         5.8.
(b)      On December 31 of each fiscal year, an amount equal to the net realized
         capital gains of the Trust for the fiscal year ending on such date, to
         the extent not previously payable pursuant to Section 5.3 on any
         Distribution Record Date in the fiscal year (including December 31 of
<PAGE>
                                       17
that fiscal year) to any Unitholder, shall be payable to Unitholders of
         record at the end of that fiscal year, and the proportionate share of
         each Trust Unit of the amount so payable shall be determined by
         dividing such amount by the number of Trust Units in the Trust
         outstanding at such time. Each Unitholder's share thereof shall be
         equal to the proportionate share per Trust Unit multiplied by the
         number of Trust Units owned of record by the Unitholder at the end of
         that fiscal year.
5.5      OTHER AMOUNTS
Any amounts not otherwise payable to Unitholders prior to the end of a
particular fiscal year of the Trust pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5
may be declared by the Trustee to be payable to Unitholders in the same manner
as provided for in Section 5.2.
5.6      ENFORCEMENT
Subject to Section 2.6(d), each Unitholder shall have the right to
enforce payment of any amount payable to the Unitholder under this Article 5 on
and after the later of (i) the time that amount became payable and (ii) the
applicable Distribution Payment Date, except in the case of the amounts payable
on the Distribution Record Date on December 31 in each year which may be
enforced on December 31.
5.7      PAYMENT OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE
(a)      Subject to Section 5.8, distributions shall be paid in cash.
(b)      Notwithstanding Sections 5.2 and 5.4(a), the amount of any
         Distributable Income of the Trust for a Distribution Period that is
         determined by the Trustee to be required to be retained by the Trust in
         order to pay any tax liability of the Trust in respect of that or any
         prior Distribution Period shall not be payable by the Trust to
         Unitholders.
5.8      DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL TRUST UNITS
(a)      Where after any Distribution Record Date and on or before the next
         Distribution Record Date an amount or amounts of cash has or have been
         or is or are being paid under Section 9.3 in respect of Trust Units
         tendered for redemption, the distribution payable to Unitholders on
         such next Distribution Record Date shall include a distribution of
         additional Trust Units (to which Trust Units, Section 3.6 applies)
         having a value equal to the aggregate of such amounts, in which case
         the amount of cash to be distributed on the distribution shall be
         reduced by the aggregate of such amounts.
(b)      If on any Distribution Record Date the Trustee determines that the
         Trust does not have cash in an amount sufficient to pay the full
         distribution to be made on such Distribution Record Date in cash or if
         any cash distribution should be contrary to any Subordination Agreement
         or provisions referred to in Section 2.6(d), the distribution payable
         to Unitholders on such Distribution Record Date may, at the option of
         the Trustee, include a distribution of additional Trust Units having a
         value equal to the cash shortfall, in which case the amount of cash to
         be distributed on the distribution shall be reduced by the amount of
         such cash shortfall and Section 3.6 shall apply to any Trust Units so
         distributed.
(c)      For the purposes of this Section 5.8, the value of each additional
         Trust Unit to be issued shall be the closing trading price (or if there
         was no trade, the average of the last bid and the last ask prices) of
         the Trust Units on the applicable Distribution Record Date (or, if that
         Distribution Record Date is not a Business Day, on the last Business
         Day preceding that Distribution Record Date)
<PAGE>
                                       18
on the principal stock exchange on which the Trust Units are listed or,
         if not so listed, such other value as the Trustee shall reasonably
         determine.
5.9      WITHHOLDING TAXES
For greater certainty, in the event that withholding taxes are exigible
on any distributions or redemption amounts distributed under this Indenture, the
Trustee shall withhold the withholding taxes required and shall promptly remit
such taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. In the event that withholding
taxes are exigible on any distributions or redemption amounts distributed under
this Indenture and the Trustee is, or was, unable to withhold taxes from a
particular distribution to a Unitholder or has not otherwise withheld taxes on
past distributions to the Unitholder, the Trustee shall be permitted to withhold
amounts from other distributions to satisfy the Trustee's withholding tax
obligations.

in the manner set out in Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Trustee is not reappointed at the meeting of Unitholders held immediately before
the term of office of such Trustee expires and if no successor to such Trustee
is appointed at that meeting, such Trustee shall continue to hold the office of

6.2      RESIGNATION OF TRUSTEE
The Trustee may resign from the office of trustee hereunder on giving

such appointment by, a new Trustee in the place of the resigning Trustee has
been made in the manner set out in Section 6.4, and (ii) the legal and valid
assumption by the new Trustee of all obligations of the Trustee related hereto
in the same capacities as the resigning Trustee.

all of the requirements in Section 6.6, or shall be declared bankrupt or
insolvent, or shall enter into liquidation, whether compulsory or voluntary (and
not being merely a voluntary liquidation for the purposes of amalgamation or
reconstruction), or if the assets of the Trustee shall otherwise become liable
to seizure or confiscation by any public or governmental authority, or if the
Trustee shall otherwise become incapable of performing, or shall fail in any
material respect to perform its responsibilities under this Indenture or as a
result of a material increase in the fees charged by the Trustee. No decision to
remove a Trustee under this Section 6.3 shall become effective until (i)

that purpose (ii) the appointment of, and acceptance of such appointment by, a
new Trustee under Section 6.4 in the place of
<PAGE>
                                       19
the Trustee to be removed, and (iii) the legal and valid assumption by the new
Trustee of all obligations of the Trustee related hereto in the same capacities
as the resigning Trustee.

(a)      A successor Trustee to a Trustee which has been removed by a Special
         Resolution of Unitholders under Section 6.3, shall be appointed by an

         purpose, provided the successor meets the requirements of Section 6.6.
(b)      Subject to Section 6.6, AOG may appoint a successor to any Trustee
         which has been removed by a Special Resolution of the Unitholders under
         Section 6.3, or which has not been reappointed under Section 6.1, if
         the Unitholders fail to do so at such meeting.
(c)      Subject to Section 6.6, AOG may appoint a successor to any trustee
         which has given a notice of resignation under Section 6.2.
No appointment of any successor Trustee shall be effective until such successor
Trustee shall have complied with the provisions of Section 6.2.
6.5      FAILURE TO APPOINT SUCCESSOR
In the event that no successor Trustee to a Trustee who has delivered a
notice of resignation in accordance with Section 6.2, or who has received notice
of removal in accordance with Section 6.3, has accepted an appointment within
120 days after the receipt by AOG of the notice of resignation, or 60 days after
the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of removal, the Trustee, AOG or any
Unitholder may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor to the Trustee. The appointment of such successor by such court
shall not require the approval of Unitholders.
6.6      QUALIFICATIONS OF TRUSTEE

(a)      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture or other
         contracts or obligations of the Trustee or the Trust, the Trustee may
         exercise from time to time in respect of the Trust Fund any and all

         all powers and authorities pertaining thereto; and
(b)      all other costs, charges, taxes, penalties and interest in respect of
         unpaid taxes and all other expenses and liabilities sustained or

not apply.

and which result from or relate, directly or indirectly, to
(c)      the presence or release or threatened presence or release of any
         contaminants, by any means or for any reason, on or in respect of the
         Properties, whether or not such presence or release or threatened
         presence or release of the contaminants was under the control, care or
         management of the Trust, the Trustee, AOG or the Manager, or of a
         previous owner or operator of a Property,
(d)      any contaminant present on or released from any property adjacent to or
         in the proximate area of the Properties,
(e)      the breach or alleged breach of any federal, provincial or municipal
         environmental law, regulation, by-law, order, rule or permit by the

omission of the Trustee to have given such notice, provided the Trustee has
complied with Section 7.6.

         by the Trust, and exercise all rights of an owner of such assets as if
         it were not a trustee;
(d)      carry on its business as a trust company in the usual course while it
         is the Trustee, including the rendering of trustee or other services to

ARTICLE 9
                            REDEMPTION OF TRUST UNITS
9.1      RIGHT OF REDEMPTION
Each Unitholder shall be entitled to require the Trust to redeem at any
time or from time to time at the demand of the Unitholder all or any part of the
Trust Units registered in the name of the Unitholder at the prices determined
and payable in accordance with the conditions hereinafter provided.
9.2      EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHT
(a)      To exercise a Unitholder's right to require redemption under this
         Article 9, a duly completed and properly executed notice requiring the
         Trust to redeem Trust Units, in a form approved by the Trustee, shall
         be sent to the Trust at the head office of the Trust, together with the
         Trust Certificate or Trust Certificates representing the Trust Units to
         be redeemed and upon receipt of such notice and certificates, the Trust
         Units shall be deemed to have been surrendered (the date of receipt,
         herein the "Redemption Date"). No form or manner of completion or
         execution shall be sufficient unless the same is in all respects
         satisfactory to the Trustee and is accompanied by any further evidence
         that the Trustee may reasonably require with respect to the identity,
         capacity or authority of the person giving such notice.
(b)      Upon receipt by the Trust of the notice to redeem Trust Units, the
         Unitholder shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
         the Trust Units tendered for redemption (other than to receive the
         redemption payment therefor) including the right to receive any
         distributions thereon which are declared payable to the Unitholders of
         record on a date which is subsequent to the Redemption Date. Trust
         Units shall be considered to be tendered for redemption on the date
         that the Trust has, to the satisfaction of the Trustee, received the
         notice, Trust Certificates and other required documents or evidence as
         aforesaid.
9.3      CASH REDEMPTION
(a)      Upon receipt by the Trust of the notice to redeem Trust Units in
         accordance with Section 9.2, the holder of the Trust Units surrendered
         for redemption shall, subject to Sections 9.4 and 9.5, be entitled to
         receive a price per Trust Unit (hereinafter called the "Redemption
         Price") equal to the lesser of:
(i)      85% of the market price of the Trust Units on the principal
                  market on which the Trust Units are quoted for trading during
                  the 10 trading day period commencing immediately after the
                  Redemption Date; and
(ii)     the closing market price on the principal market on which the
                  Trust Units are quoted for trading, on the Redemption Date.
For the purposes of Section 9.3(a)(i), the "market price" shall be: an
         amount equal to the simple average of the closing price of the Trust
         Units for each of the trading days on which there was a closing price;
provided that if the applicable exchange or market does not provide a
         closing price but only provides the highest and lowest prices of the
         Trust Units traded on a particular day, the "market price" shall be an
         amount equal to the simple average of the average of the highest and
<PAGE>
                                       32
lowest prices for each of the trading days on which there was a trade;
         and provided further that if there was trading on the applicable
         exchange or market for fewer than five of the 10 trading days, the
         "market price" shall be the simple average of the following prices
         established for each of the 10 trading days: the average of the last
         bid and last ask prices for each day on which there was no trading; the
         closing price of the Trust Units for each day that there was trading if
         the exchange or market provides a closing price; and the average of the
         highest and lowest prices of the Trust Units for each day that there
         was trading, if the market provides only the highest and lowest prices
         of Trust Units traded on a particular day. For the purposes of Section
         9.3(a)(ii), the "closing market price" shall be: an amount equal to the
         closing price of the Trust Units if there was a trade on the date if
         the exchange or market provides a closing price; an amount equal to the
         average of the highest and lowest prices of Trust Units if there was
         trading and the exchange or other market provides only the highest and
         lowest trading prices of Trust Units traded on a particular day; and
         the average of the last bid and last ask prices if there was no trading
         on the date.
(b)      Subject to Sections 9.4 and 9.5, the Redemption Price payable in
         respect of the Trust Units tendered for redemption during any month
         shall be paid by cheque, drawn on a Canadian chartered bank or a trust
         company in lawful money of Canada, payable at par to or to the order of
         the Unitholder who exercised the right of redemption on or before the
         last day of the calendar month following the month in which the Trust
         Units were tendered for redemption. Payments made by the Trust of the
         Redemption Price are conclusively deemed to have been made upon the
         mailing of a cheque in a postage prepaid envelope addressed to the
         former Unitholder unless such cheque is dishonored upon presentment.
         Upon such payment, the Trust shall be discharged from all liability to
         the former Unitholder in respect of the Trust Units so redeemed.
9.4      NO CASH REDEMPTION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
Section 9.3(b) shall not be applicable to Trust Units tendered for
redemption by a Unitholder, if:
(a)      the total amount of Redemption Price determined under Section 9.3(a)
         payable by the Trust pursuant to Section 9.3 in respect of such Trust
         Units and all other Trust Units tendered for redemption prior thereto
         in the same calendar month exceeds $100,000 ("Monthly Limit"); provided
         that the Board of Directors of AOG may, in their sole discretion, waive
         such limitation in respect of all Trust Units tendered for redemption
         in any calendar month and, in the absence of such a waiver, Trust Units
         tendered for redemption in any calendar month in which the total amount
         of Redemption Price determined under Section 9.3(a), payable by the
         Trust pursuant to Section 9.3(b) exceeds the Monthly Limit will be
         redeemed for cash pursuant to Section 9.3(b) and Notes and/or
         Redemption Notes under Section 9.5 on a PRO RATA basis as between
         Unitholders who have tendered their Trust Units for redemption in such
         calendar month;
(b)      at the time the Trust Units are tendered for redemption, the
         outstanding Trust Units are not listed for trading or quoted on any
stock exchange or market which the Board of Directors of AOG consider,
         in their sole discretion, provides representative fair market value
         prices for the Trust Units; or
(c)      the normal trading of the outstanding Trust Units is suspended or
         halted on any stock exchange on which the Trust Units are listed for
         trading or, if not so listed, on any market on which the Trust Units
         are quoted for trading, on the date that such Trust Units tendered for
         redemption were tendered to the Trust for redemption or for more than
         five trading days during the 10 trading day period commencing
         immediately after the date on which such Trust Units tendered for
         redemption were tendered to the Trust for redemption.
<PAGE>
                                       33
9.5      IN SPECIE REDEMPTION
If, (i) pursuant to Section 9.4(b) or (c), Section 9.3(b) is not
applicable to Trust Units tendered for redemption by a Unitholder, such
Unitholder shall, instead of the Redemption Price per Trust Unit determined
under Section 9.3(a), be entitled to receive a Redemption Price per Trust Unit
equal to the Fair Market Value, or (ii) pursuant to Section 9.4(a), a portion of
the Redemption Price specified in Section 9.3(a) is to be payable in Notes
and/or Redemption Notes, then (in either such case) the Redemption Price or
portion thereof (as applicable) shall, subject to receipt of all necessary
regulatory approvals, be paid and satisfied by way of a distribution in specie
to such Unitholder of Notes (each in the principal amount of $100), on the
basis, for such Trust Units tendered for redemption, of Notes (each in the
principal amount of $100) having a principal amount equal to the product of (A)
the Redemption Price or, in the case of Section 9.4(a), the portion thereof, to
be redeemed for Notes, per Trust Unit of the Trust Units tendered for redemption
and (B) the number of Trust Units tendered by such Unitholder for redemption;
provided that if Section 9.3(b) is not applicable to Trust Units tendered for
redemption by a Unitholder and the Trust does not hold sufficient Notes to
effect such payment, the Trust may create, issue and deliver promissory notes of
the Trust (each in a principal amount of $100) having terms and conditions
substantially the same as the Notes ("Redemption Notes") in satisfaction of the
Redemption Price, except that the recourse of the holder of the Redemption Notes
for payment thereof or any judgment in respect thereof shall be expressly
limited to the Trust Fund. No fractional Notes (or, as applicable, Redemption
Notes) shall be distributed and where the number of Notes (or, as applicable,
Redemption Notes) to be received upon redemption by a Unitholder of Trust Units
tendered for redemption would otherwise include a fraction, that number shall be
rounded to the next lowest whole number. The Redemption Price payable pursuant
to this Section 9.5 in respect of Trust Units tendered for redemption during any
month shall, subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, be paid
by the transfer, to or to the order of the Unitholder who exercised the right of
redemption, on the first day following the last day (the "Transfer Date") of the
second calendar month following the month in which the Trust Units were tendered
for redemption, of the number of Notes or, as applicable, Redemption Notes (each
in the principal amount of $100) determined as aforesaid. The Trust shall be
entitled to all interest paid or accrued and unpaid on the Notes (or, as
applicable, Redemption Notes) being transferred to but not including the
Transfer Date. Payments by the Trust of the Redemption Price are conclusively
deemed to have been made upon the mailing of the Notes (or, as applicable,
Redemption Notes) by registered mail in a postage prepaid envelope addressed to
the former Unitholder. Upon such payment, the Trust shall be discharged from all
liability to the former Unitholder in respect of the Trust Units so redeemed.
Notes and/or Redemption Notes so distributed may be subject to a security
interest granted by the Trust and, if required by the terms of any agreement
binding on the Trust, the notes so distributed in satisfaction of the Redemption
Price hereunder shall remain subject to such security interest and the
Unitholder shall execute and deliver any required acknowledgments of the
continuation thereof.
9.6      CANCELLATION OF CERTIFICATES FOR ALL REDEEMED TRUST UNITS
All certificates representing Trust Units which are redeemed under this
Article 9 shall be cancelled and such Trust Units shall no longer be outstanding
and shall not be reissued.
9.7      PURCHASE FOR CANCELLATION
The Trust may from time to time purchase for cancellation, in
accordance with applicable law, some or all of the Trust Units in the market or
upon any recognized stock exchange on which such Trust Units are traded or
pursuant to tenders received by the Trust upon request for tenders addressed to
all holders of record of Trust Units, at the lowest price at which in the
opinion of the Trustee such Trust Units are obtainable, but not exceeding an
amount per Trust Unit equal to the Redemption Price (except that the 10 day
period referred to in subsection 9.3(a)(i) shall refer to the 10 day trading
<PAGE>
                                       34
period commencing immediately prior to the Redemption Date) at the date of
purchase, plus reasonable costs of purchase, provided the Trust has sufficient
funds to satisfy its obligations under Article 5 and Article 9 hereof after
making such purchase.

The provisions of this Trust Indenture, except where specifically
provided otherwise, may only be amended by Special Resolution; provided that the
provisions of this Trust Indenture may be amended by the Trustee without the
consent, approval or ratification of the Unitholders or any other person:
(a)      prior to Closing; or
(b)      at any time or times for the purpose of:
(i)      ensuring that the Trust will comply with any applicable laws
                  or requirements of any governmental agency or authority of
                  Canada or of any province;
(ii)     ensuring that the Trust will satisfy the provisions of each of
                  subsections 108(2)(a) and 132(6) of the Tax Act as from time
                  to time amended or replaced;
(iii)    ensuring that additional protection or benefit is provided for
                  the interests of Unitholders as the Trustee may consider
                  expedient;
(iv)     providing for the electronic delivery by the Trust to
                  Unitholders of documents relating to the Trust (including
                  annual and quarterly reports, financial statements, notices of
                  Unitholder meetings and information circulars and proxy
                  related materials) once applicable securities laws have been
                  amended to permit such electronic delivery in place of normal
                  delivery procedures, provided that such amendments to the
                  Trust Indenture are not contrary to or do not conflict with
such laws
(v)      removing or curing any conflicts or inconsistencies between
                  the provisions of this Indenture or any supplemental
                  indenture, the Management Agreement, the Shareholder Agreement
                  or the Royalty Agreement and any other agreement of the Trust,
                  the Note Indenture, the 10?% Note Indenture, the 9?% Note
                  Indenture, the 8.5% Note Indenture or any applicable law or
                  regulation of any jurisdiction, provided that in the opinion
                  of the Trustee the rights of the Trustee and of the
                  Unitholders are not prejudiced thereby;
(vi)     which, in the opinion of the Trustee, are necessary or
                  desirable as a result of changes in taxation laws;
(vii)    curing, correcting or rectifying any ambiguities, defective or
                  inconsistent provisions, errors, mistakes or omissions,
                  provided that in the opinion of the Trustee the rights of the
                  Trustee and of the Unitholders are not prejudiced thereby; or
(viii)   making any modification in the form of Trust Unit Certificates
                  to conform with the provisions of the Indenture, or any other
                  modifications, provided the rights of the Trustee and of the
                  Unitholders are not prejudiced thereby.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment shall reduce the percentage of votes
required to be cast at a meeting of the Unitholders for the purpose of amending
this Section 10.1 without the consent of the holders of all of the Trust Units
then outstanding.
10.2     NOTIFICATION OF AMENDMENT
As soon as shall be practicable after the making of any amendment
pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee shall furnish written notification of
the substance of such amendment to each Unitholder.
ARTICLE 11
                             MEETINGS OF UNITHOLDERS
11.1     ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS OF UNITHOLDERS
Annual meetings of the Unitholders shall be called by the Trustee,
commencing in 2002, on a day, at a time and at a place to be set by the Trustee.
The business transacted at such meetings shall include the transaction of such
business as Unitholders may be entitled to vote upon as hereinafter provided in
this Article 11, or as the Trustee may determine. Special meetings of the
Unitholders may be called at any time by the Trustee and shall be called by the
Trustee upon a written request of Unitholders holding in the aggregate not less
than 20% of the Trust Units then outstanding, such request specifying the
purpose or purposes for which such meeting is to be called. Meetings of
Unitholders shall be held in the City of Calgary, or at such other place as the
Trustee shall designate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, meetings of
Unitholders may be held partially or entirely by means of a telephonic,
electronic or other communication facility, including teleconferencing,
videoconferencing, computer link, web casting or other similar means. The
Chairman of any annual or special meeting shall be a person designated by the
Trustee for the purpose of such meeting except that, on the motion of any
Unitholder, any person may be elected as Chairman by a majority of the votes
cast at the meeting instead of such designated person or in the event that no
person shall be designated by the Trustee.
11.2     NOTICE OF MEETINGS
Notice of all meetings of Unitholders shall be given by unregistered
mail postage prepaid addressed to each Unitholder at his registered address,
mailed at least 21 days and not more than 50 days before the meeting. Such
notice shall set out the time when, and the place where, such meeting is to be
held and shall specify the nature of the business to be transacted at such
meeting in sufficient detail to permit a Unitholder to form a reasoned judgment
thereon, together with the text of any resolution in substantially final form
proposed to be passed. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without
further notice. The accidental omission to give notice to or the non-receipt of
such notice by the Unitholders shall not invalidate any resolution passed at any
such meeting.
11.3     QUORUM
At any meeting of the Unitholders, subject as hereinafter provided, a
quorum shall consist of two or more Persons either present in person or
represented by proxy and representing in the aggregate not less than 10% of the
outstanding Trust Units. If a quorum is not present at the appointed place on
the date for which the meeting is called within one half hour after the time
fixed for the holding of such meeting, the meeting, if convened on the
requisition of Unitholders, shall be dissolved, but in any other case it shall
stand adjourned to such day being not less than fourteen (14) days later and to
such place and time as may be appointed by the Chairman of the meeting. If at
such adjourned meeting a quorum as above defined is not present, the Unitholders
present either personally or by proxy shall form a quorum, and any business may
<PAGE>
                                       36
be brought before or dealt with at such an adjourned meeting which might have
been brought before or dealt with at the original meeting in accordance with the
notice calling the same.
11.4     VOTING RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS
(a)      Only Unitholders of record shall be entitled to vote and each Trust
         Unit shall entitle the holder or holders of that Trust Unit to one vote
         at any meeting of the Unitholders. Every question submitted to a
         meeting, other than a Special Resolution, shall, unless a poll vote is
         demanded, be decided by a show of hands vote, on which every Person
         present and entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote. At any
         meeting of Unitholders, any holder of Trust Units entitled to vote
         thereat may vote by proxy and a proxy need not be a Unitholder,
         provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall
         have been placed on file with the Trustee, or with such agent of the
         Trustee as the Trustee may direct, for verification twenty-four hours
         prior to the commencement of such meeting. If approved by the Trustee,
         proxies may be solicited in the name of the Trustee. When any Trust
         Unit is held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at
         any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Unit, but if
         more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by
         proxy, and such joint owners of their proxies so present disagree as to
         any vote to be cast, the joint owner present or represented whose name
         appears first in the register maintained pursuant to Section 12.3 shall
         be entitled to cast such vote.
(b)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Trustee may from time to
         time make, vary or revoke such regulations as it shall think fit
         providing for and governing the depositing and tabulation of proxies by
telephonic, electronic or other communication means. To the extent
         permitted by applicable law, a person entitled to vote at a meeting of
         Unitholders may vote by means of a telephonic, electronic or other
         communication facility that the Trustee has made available for that
         purpose.
11.5     RESOLUTIONS
(a)      The Trustee shall in accordance with an Ordinary Resolution passed by
         the Unitholders change the Auditors as provided in Section 16.3.
(b)      The Trustee shall in accordance with a Special Resolution passed by the
         Unitholders:
(i)      subject to Section 10.1, amend this Indenture;
(ii)     subdivide or consolidate Trust Units;
(iii)    sell or agree to sell the property of the Trust Fund as an
                  entirety or substantially as an entirety;
(iv)     terminate the Management Agreement, choose a replacement
                  Manager and enter into a replacement Management Agreement;
(v)      resign if removed pursuant to Section 6.3; and
(vi)     commence to wind-up and wind-up the affairs of the Trust if
                  requested pursuant to Section 13.2.
<PAGE>
                                       37
Except with respect to the above matters set out in this Section 11.5 and the
matters set forth in Sections 6.3, 6.4 and 13.2 hereof, no action taken by the
Unitholders or resolution of the Unitholders at any meeting shall in any way
bind the Trustee. Any action taken or resolution passed in respect of any matter
at a meeting of Unitholders shall be by Special Resolution unless the contrary
is otherwise expressly provided for under any specific provisions of this
Indenture.
11.6     MEANING OF "SPECIAL RESOLUTION"
The expression "Special Resolution" when used in this Indenture means,
subject as hereinafter in this Section provided, a resolution proposed to be
passed as a special resolution at a meeting of Unitholders (including an
adjourned meeting) duly convened for the purpose and held in accordance with the
provisions of this Section at which two or more holders of at least 10% of the
aggregate number of Trust Units then outstanding are present in person or by
proxy and passed by the affirmative votes of the holders of not less than 66
2/3% of the Trust Units represented at the meeting and voted on a poll upon such
resolution.
If, at any such meeting, the holders of 10% of the aggregate number of
Trust Units outstanding are not present in person or represented by proxy within
30 minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, then the meeting, if
convened by or on the requisition of Unitholders, shall be dissolved; but in any
other case it shall stand adjourned to such date, being not less than 21 nor
more than 60 days later, and to such place and time as may be appointed by the
chairman. Not less than ten days' prior notice shall be given of the time and
place of such adjourned meeting in the manner provided in Section 11.2. Such
notice shall state that at the adjourned meeting the Unitholders present in
person or represented by proxy shall form a quorum but it shall not be necessary
to set forth the purposes for which the meeting was originally called or any
other particulars. At the adjourned meeting, the Unitholders present in person
or represented by proxy shall form a quorum and may transact the business for
which the meeting was originally convened, and a resolution proposed at such
adjourned meeting and passed by the requisite vote as provided in this Section
11.6 shall be a Special Resolution within the meaning of this Indenture,
notwithstanding that the holders of less than 10% of the aggregate number of
Units then outstanding are present or represented by proxy at such adjourned
meeting.
Votes on a Special Resolution shall always be given on a poll and no
demand for a poll on a Special Resolution shall be necessary. No Special
Resolution changing or amending any provision hereof relating to or affecting:
(i) the Trustee, including the qualification, powers, authorities, appointment,
removal or resignation thereof; or (ii) the provisions of Article 10, Article 11
or Article 13 shall be effective prior to 60 days from the adoption thereof in
accordance with the provisions hereof or such shorter period as may be approved
by Unitholders.
11.7     RECORD DATE FOR VOTING
For the purpose of determining the Unitholders who are entitled to vote
or act at any meeting or any adjournment thereof, the Trustee may fix a date not
more than 50 days and not less than 21 days prior to the date of any meeting of
Unitholders as a record date for the determination of Unitholders entitled to
vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, and any Unitholder who was a
Unitholder at the time so fixed shall be entitled to vote at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof even though he has since that time disposed of his Trust
Units, and no Unitholder becoming such after that time shall be so entitled to
vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. In the event that the Trustee
does not fix a record date for any meeting of Unitholders, the record date for
such meeting shall be the Business Day immediately preceding the date upon which
notice of the meeting is given as provided under Section 11.2.
<PAGE>
                                       38
11.8     BINDING EFFECT OF RESOLUTIONS
Every Ordinary Resolution and every Special Resolution passed in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture at a meeting of Unitholders
shall be binding upon all the Unitholders, whether present at or absent from
such meeting, and each and every Unitholder shall be bound to give effect
accordingly to every such Ordinary Resolution and Special Resolution.
11.9     SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
A Unitholder shall have the right to appoint a proxy to attend and act
for the Unitholder at any meeting of Unitholders. The Trustee shall solicit
proxies from Unitholders in connection with all meetings of Unitholders. In
connection therewith, the Trustee shall comply, as near as may be possible, with
all provisions of the ABCA and the requirements of Canadian securities
legislation applicable to the solicitation of proxies.
11.10    NO BREACH
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture, Unitholders shall
have no power to effect any amendment hereto which would require the Trustee to
take any action or conduct the affairs of the Trust in a manner which would
constitute a breach or default by the Trust or the Trustee under any agreement
binding on or obligation of the Trust or the Trustee.
ARTICLE 12
CERTIFICATES, REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER OF TRUST UNITS
12.1     NATURE OF TRUST UNITS
The nature of a Trust Unit and the relationship of a Unitholder to the
Trustee and the relationship of one Unitholder to another is as described in
Sections 2.4 and 2.5(c) and the provisions of this Article 12 shall not in any
way alter the nature of Trust Units or the said relationships of a Unitholder to
the Trustee and of one Unitholder to another, but are intended only to
facilitate the issuance of certificates evidencing the beneficial ownership of
Trust Units and the recording of all such transactions whether by the Trust,
securities dealers, stock exchanges, transfer agents, registrars or other
persons.
12.2     CERTIFICATES
(a)      The form of certificate representing Trust Units shall be substantially
         as set out in the Schedule hereto or such other form as is authorized
         from time to time by the Trustee. Each such certificate shall bear an
         identifying serial number and shall be certified manually on behalf of
         the Trustee. Any additional signature required by the Trustee to appear
         on such certificate may be printed, lithographed or otherwise
         mechanically reproduced thereon and, in such event, certificates so
         signed are as valid as if it had been signed manually. Any certificate
         which has one manual signature as hereinbefore provided shall be valid
         notwithstanding that one or more of the persons whose signature is
         printed, lithographed or mechanically reproduced no longer holds office
         at the date of issuance of such certificate. The Trust Certificates may
         be engraved, printed or lithographed, or partly in one form and partly
         in another, as the Trustee may determine.
(b)      Any Trust Certificate validly issued prior to the date hereof in
         accordance with the terms of this Indenture in effect at such time
         shall validly represent issued and outstanding Trust Units,
         notwithstanding that the form of such Trust Certificate may not be in
         the form currently required by this Indenture.
<PAGE>
                                       39
12.3     REGISTER OF UNITHOLDERS
A register shall be maintained at the principal corporate trust office
of the Trustee in the cities of Calgary and Toronto by the Trustee or by a
Transfer Agent designated to act on behalf and under the direction of the
Trustee, which register shall contain the names and addresses of the
Unitholders, the respective numbers of Trust Units held by them, the certificate
numbers of the certificates representing such Trust Units and a record of all
transfers thereof. Branch transfer registers shall be maintained at such other
offices of the Trustee or Transfer Agent as the Trustee may from time to time
designate. The Trustee shall designate an office in the City of Toronto at which
a branch register shall be maintained. Except in the case of the registers
required to be maintained at the Cities of Calgary and Toronto, the Trustee
shall have the power at any time to close any register of transfers and in that
event shall transfer the records thereof to another existing register or to a
new register.
Only Unitholders whose certificates are so recorded shall be entitled
to receive distributions or to exercise or enjoy the rights of Unitholders
hereunder. The Trustee shall have the right to treat the person registered as a
Unitholder on the register of the Trust as the owner of such Trust Units for all
purposes, including, without limitation, payment of any distribution, giving
notice to Unitholders and determining the right to attend and vote at meetings
of Unitholders, and the Trustee shall not be bound to recognize any transfer,
pledge or other disposition of a Trust Unit or any attempt to transfer, pledge
or dispose of a Trust Unit, or any beneficial interest or equitable or other
right or claim with respect thereto, whether or not the Trustee shall have
actual or other notice thereof, until such Trust Unit shall have been
transferred on the register of the Trust as herein provided.
The register and the branch transfer register referred to in this
Section 12.3 shall at all reasonable times be open for inspection by the
Unitholders, the Manager, AOG and the Trustee.
12.4     TRANSFER OF TRUST UNITS
(a)      Subject to the provisions of this Article 12, the Trust Units shall be
         fully transferable without charge as between persons, but no transfer
         of Trust Units shall be effective as against the Trustee or shall be in
         any way binding upon the Trustee until the transfer has been recorded
         on the register or one of the branch transfer registers maintained by
         the Trustee or Transfer Agent. No transfer of a Trust Unit shall be
         recognized unless such transfer is of a whole Trust Unit.
(b)      Subject to the provisions of this Article 12, Trust Units shall be
         transferable on the register or one of the branch transfer registers of
         Unitholders of the Trust only by the Unitholders of record thereof or
         their executors, administrators or other legal representatives or by
         their agents hereunto duly authorized in writing, and only upon
         delivery to the Trustee or to the Transfer Agent of the Trust if
         appointed, of the certificate therefor, if certificates representing
         Trust Units are issued, properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly
         executed instrument of transfer and accompanied by all necessary
         transfer or other taxes imposed by law, together with such evidence of
         the genuineness of such endorsement, execution and authorization and
         other matters that may reasonably be required by the Trustee. Upon such
         delivery the transfer shall be recorded on the register of Unitholders
         and a new Trust Certificate for the residue thereof (if any) shall be
         issued to the transferor.
(c)      Any person becoming entitled to any Trust Units as a consequence of the
         death, bankruptcy or incompetence of any Unitholder or otherwise by
         operation of law, shall be recorded as the holder of such Trust Units
         and shall receive a new Trust Certificate therefor only upon production
         of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee thereof and delivery of the
         existing Trust Certificate to the Trustee, but until such record is
         made the Unitholder of record shall continue to be and be deemed to be
<PAGE>
                                       40
the holder of such Trust Units for all purposes whether or not the
         Trustee shall have actual or other notice of such death or other event.
12.5     TRUST UNITS HELD JOINTLY OR IN A FIDUCIARY CAPACITY
The Trustee may treat two or more persons holding any Trust Units as
joint owners of the entire interest therein unless their ownership is expressly
otherwise recorded on the register of the Trust, but no entry shall be made in
the register or on any Trust Certificate that any person is in any other manner
entitled to any future, limited or contingent interest in any Trust Units;
provided, however, that any person recorded as a Unitholder may, subject to the
provisions hereinafter contained, be described in the register or on any Trust
Certificate as a fiduciary of any kind and any customary words may be added to
the description of the holder to identify the nature of such fiduciary
relationship. Where any Trust Certificate is registered in more than one name,
the distributions (if any) in respect thereof may be paid to the order of all
such holders failing written instructions from them to the contrary and such
payment shall be a valid discharge to the Trustee and any Transfer Agent. In the
case of the death of one or more joint holders, the distributions (if any) in
respect of any Trust Units may be paid to the survivor or survivors of such
holders and such payment shall be a valid discharge to the Trustee and any
Transfer Agent.
12.6     PERFORMANCE OF TRUST
The Trustee, the Unitholders and any officer or agent of the Trustee
shall not be bound to be responsible for or otherwise inquire into or ensure the
performance of any trust, express, implied or constructive, or of any charge,
pledge or equity to which any of the Trust Units or any interest therein are or
may be subject, or to ascertain or enquire whether any transfer of any such
Trust Units or interests therein by any such Unitholder or by his personal
representatives is authorized by such trust, charge, pledge or equity, or to
recognize any person as having any interest therein except for the person
recorded as Unitholder.
12.7     LOST CERTIFICATES
In the event that any Trust Certificate is lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated, the Trustee may authorize the issuance of a new Trust Certificate for
the same number of Trust Units in lieu thereof. The Trustee may in its
discretion, before the issuance of such new Trust Certificate, require the owner
of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Trust Certificate, or the legal
representative of the owner, to make an affidavit or statutory declaration
setting forth such facts as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation as the
Trustee may deem necessary, to surrender any mutilated Trust Certificate and may
require the applicant to supply to the Trust a "lost certificate bond" or a
similar bond in such reasonable sum as the Trustee may direct indemnifying the
Trustee and its agent for so doing. The Trustee shall have the power to require
from an insurer or insurers a blanket lost security bond or bonds in respect of
the replacement of lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Trust Certificates. The
Trustee shall pay all premiums and other funds of money payable for such purpose
out of the Trust Fund with such contribution, if any, by those insured as may be
determined by the Trustee in its sole discretion. If such blanket lost security
bond is required, the Trustee may authorize and direct (upon such terms and
conditions as the Trustee may from time to time impose) any agent to whom the
indemnity of such bond extends to take such action to replace any lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Trust Certificate without further action or approval by
the Trustee.
12.8     DEATH OF A UNITHOLDER
The death of a Unitholder during the continuance of the Trust shall not
terminate the Trust or any of the mutual or respective rights and obligations
created by or arising under this Indenture nor give such Unitholder's personal
<PAGE>
                                       41
representative a right to an accounting or take any action in court or otherwise
against other Unitholders or the Trustee or the Trust Fund, but shall entitle
the personal representatives of the deceased Unitholder to demand and receive,
pursuant to the provisions hereof, a new Trust Certificate for Trust Units in
place of the Trust Certificate held by the deceased Unitholder, and upon the
acceptance thereof such personal representatives shall succeed to all rights of
the deceased Unitholder under this Indenture.
12.9     UNCLAIMED INTEREST OR DISTRIBUTION
In the event that the Trustee shall hold any amount of interest or
other distributable amount which is unclaimed or which cannot be paid for any
reason, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to invest or reinvest the same
but shall only be obliged to hold the same in a current interest-bearing account
pending payment to the person or persons entitled thereto. The Trustee shall, as
and when required by law, and may at any time prior to such required time, pay
all or part of such interest or other distributable amount so held to the Public
Trustee (or other appropriate Government official or agency) whose receipt shall
be a good discharge and release of the Trustee.
12.10    EXCHANGES OF TRUST CERTIFICATES
Trust Certificates representing any number of Trust Units may be
exchanged without charge for Trust Certificates representing an equivalent
number of Trust Units in the aggregate. Any exchange of Trust Certificates may
be made at the offices of the Trustee or at the offices of any Transfer Agent
where registers are maintained for the Trust Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 12. Any Trust Certificates tendered for exchange
shall be surrendered to the Trustee or appropriate Transfer Agent and shall be
cancelled.

Unless the Trust is terminated or extended earlier, the Trustee shall
commence to wind up the affairs of the Trust on December 31, 2095.
13.2     TERMINATION BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION OF UNITHOLDERS
The Unitholders may vote by Special Resolution to terminate the Trust
at any meeting of Unitholders duly called for that purpose, whereupon the
Trustee shall commence to wind up the affairs of the Trust, provided that such a
vote may only be held if requested in writing by the holders of not less than
20% of the outstanding Trust Units and a quorum of holders of not less than 50%
of the outstanding Trust Units are present in person or represented by proxy at
the meeting or any adjournment thereof at which the vote is taken.
13.3     PROCEDURE UPON TERMINATION
Forthwith upon being required to commence to wind up the affairs of the

shall designate the time or times at which Unitholders may surrender their Trust
Units for cancellation and the date at which the register of the Trust shall be
closed.

                                       42
13.4     POWERS OF THE TRUSTEE UPON TERMINATION
After the date on which the Trustee is required to commence to wind up
the affairs of the Trust, the Trustee shall carry on no activities except for
the purpose of winding up the affairs of the Trust as hereinafter provided and
for these purposes, the Trustee shall continue to be vested with and may
exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Trustee under this
Indenture.
13.5     SALE OF INVESTMENTS
