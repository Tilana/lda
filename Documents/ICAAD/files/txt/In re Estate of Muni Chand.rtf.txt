She had authorized her son Avinash Chand to make the affidavit marked as Annexure "A" to her affidavit and facts and deeds deposed in it are true and to treat as the Respondent had sworn the said affidavit of Avinash Chand.

7.      
Accordingly, I consider the averments in the affidavit of Avinash Chand dated 22nd August 2012 as the Affidavit in Response by the Respondent.

The said affidavit it was deposed:

The Respondent is the widow of the deceased Muni Chand;

(iv)    
Will is not clear as to whether when distribution to the said beneficiaries should take place i.e. whether it is to take place after the death of the Respondent or whether during the life time of the Respondent and raised an issue if distribution to take place during the life time of the Respondent then how the beneficiaries are to be paid.

(j)     
The concern of the Respondent and her children are that the Applicant may sell the estate property without reference to other beneficiaries when there is no need for a sale. The property should be conveyed to the beneficiaries including the Respondent and they (including the Applicant) will become owners of the property and any ownership issue could be sorted out among them and sale could be effected among themselves;

Analysis and Conclusions

9.      
The following issues were agreed and admitted by the parties:

(a)     
The Last Will and Testament dated 16th December 2011;

(b)     
The Deed of Renunciation by the applicant dated 2nd March 2012 executed by the Respondent;

(c)     
The main asset of the estate is the Crown Lease No. 3402.

10.     
Prior to analyzing the issues to be decided the following conclusions are arrived:

(i)     
The Applicant had deposed that the Avinash Chand's affidavit did not carry the authorization from the Respondent.

I am not accepting this position for the following reasons:

(a)     
Proper authorization was given by the Respondent to Avinash Chand by the Respondent by the affidavit marked "A" annexed to the affidavit of Evelyn Hing, Law Clerk of Parshotam deposed on 2nd October, 2012. Paragraph 4 of the affidavit of the Respondent marked "A" stated:

"4. I authorized my son to make this affidavit on my behalf".

(b)     
It is noted that the Respondent had read the affidavit of Avinash Chand and further stated in paragraph 5 of the affidavit marked "A":

"5. I have read the said affidavit and state that such of the facts deposed in it as relate to any acts and deed on my part are true and such of the facts deposed in it as relate to the acts and deeds of any other persons I believe to be true".

Accordingly, I conclude that the affidavit of Avinash Chand dated 22nd August 2012 filed on the same day together with Annexures marked "A" to "I" is accepted and further conclude that the said affidavit carries due authorization from the Respondent and the court accepts this affidavit as the affidavit in Response to the affidavit in Support filed by the applicant.

11.     
Considering the Notice of Motion filed by the Applicant and the Summons for Directions filed by the Respondent the issues to be decided are:

(i)     
As to whether the Respondent's Caveat No. 6 of 2012 lodged by the Respondent be renewed or removed?

(ii)    
As to whether the Probate be granted in favour of the applicant in terms of the Last Will and Testament dated 16th December 2011?

(iii)   
Whether the Deed of Renunciation dated 16th December 2011 is conditional if so as to whether the Applicant should give an undertaking to transfer and convey the Estate to the beneficiaries named in the Will?

12.     
The provisions applicable to the application for removal of caveat the contentious rule Order 1 Rule 11 of the High Court Rules. Order 1 Rule 11 states:

"11. The Rules for the time being in force in Her Majesty's High Court of Justice in England, and the practice and procedure of that Court with respect of non-contentious probate business shall apply so far as they are applicable, with such modifications as may be necessary, to grants of probate and administration issued in common form from the Registry of the High Court".

The other provisions in Section 47 of the Succession, Probate and Administration Act is dealt in paragraph 16.1 of this Judgment.

13.     
The warning to the Caveator was filed by the applicant through her Solicitors.

14.     
On 28th March 2012, the Respondent's solicitors on behalf of the Respondent, filed Summons for Directions under Rule 44(10) of the Non-Contentious Probate rules that no probate be granted until the applicant gives undertaking as per preceding paragraph 3 of the this Judgment. The applicant's counsel submitted that the Respondent had renounced her rights of the Estate and the Orders sought are contrary to the wishes of the Testator.

15.     
Now, I deal with the Deed of Renunciation dated 2nd day of March 2012. Under Clause 9 it is stated:

"It is my intention as follows:

(a)     
That the said Urmila Verma proceeds to apply for probate of the said Will;

(b)     
That there is no opposition to the grant of the probate as aforesaid by any of the beneficiaries named in the said Will;

(c)     
That I will renounce any interest I may have in the estate of the said deceased;

(d)     
That the said Urmila Wati will immediately upon grant of probate in her name convey all estate property including the lease comprised in Crown Lease No. 3402 to the beneficiaries named in the said Will in accordance with the terms of the said Will."

15.1    
What did Last Will and Testament stated with regard to the Respondent? There was Clause No. 4 which stated:

"Clause 4. I direct my Trustee to pay my wife Phul Mati Chand the sum of $1000 per month for her life as her maintenance and for her up keep". 

15.2    
Apart from the benefit stated in Clause 4 of the Last Will and Testament, the Respondent had not been given any beneficial interest over the assets of the Deceased.

15.3    
It is evident the Respondent was not given any right to obtain an undertaking from the Applicant as stated in the Deed of Renunciation. The only renunciation the Respondent would have made was renouncing the right to have the payment of $1000 per month for life for her maintenance and up keep. As such, I conclude that the Deed of Renunciation has no effect and it's an obsolete document, for the reason that the Respondent do not have any contrary interest over the estate except for the monthly payment of $1000 by the Trustee.

16.     
I further agree with the submission made by the applicant's counsel that Respondent had not shown any contrary interest for the Respondent to maintain a caveat.

16.1    
Having concluded that the Respondent do not have any contrary interest, I draw attention o Section 47 of the Succession and Probate and Administration Act:

"(1) In every case which a caveat is lodged, he court may, upon application by the person applying for probate or administration or for the sealing of any probate or letter of administration, as the case may be, remove the same;

(2) Every such application shall be served on the caveator by delivering a copy of the same at the address mentioned on the caveat;

(3) Such application may be heard and order made upon affidavit or oral evidence, or as the court may direct".

16.2    
In the case of Reddy v Manchama Webb and Lawrence Webb Civil Appeal No. ABU 00014 of 1994S, the Court of Appeal stated:

"The application before the Trial Judge was to remove the Caveat under Section 47(1) of the Act. On what grounds should a Caveat be removed? The Section does not give any indication. It simply says "such application may be heard and order made upon affidavit or oral evidence". This gives the Court a discretion.

In formulating the discretion of the court in such an application, we are of the opinion that the court may have regard to the practice set out in the Rules as a guide. This is not the same as applying the rules. The relevant rule in this regard is Rule 44(7). "For the purposes of warning, a caveator is required to give particulars of a contrary interest. We would adopt this and formulate that a caveator should establish a contrary interest to the person applying for removal of a caveat". (Emphasis mine) 

The submissions made by the Respondents with regard to Rule 44(7) did not carry any merits. As I concluded in the preceding paragraphs, the Respondent do not have contrary interest but also failed to establish any beneficial interest over the Crown Lease No. 3407. As such I conclude, Respondent's Caveat No. 6 of 2012 should be removed.

17.     
Further, the Last Will and Testament was not in dispute and the Respondent was contesting over an interest which was not provided in the Last Will and I conclude, the Probate should be granted to the Applicant.

18.     
The other issues in this matter I have already concluded that as per wishes of the Testator in the Last Will and Testament, the Applicant is not obliged to give any undertaking to the Respondent and the Respondent has no locus standi to claim for such undertaking with regard to Transfer of the Property. However, I take into account the undertaking given by the Applicant in the paragraph 8(v) of her affidavit in reply (referred in paragraph 8.5(iv) in this Judgment stated:

"I undertake to this Honourable Court that I will properly administer and distribute the Estate as per my father's wish as stated in his Will".

This is an adequate and reasonable undertaking given by the Applicant and the Respondent or any other beneficiary cannot claim redress at this stage prior to grant of the probate. If the Applicant makes any breach, her duty as the Executor and Trustee of the Last Will at that stage, the Respondent and/or any other beneficiary could sought orders in that regard. Further, I conclude even if there is locus standi for the Respondent to file summons, it should have been filed after grant of the probate.

19.     
Accordingly, I make the following Orders:

(a)     
Caveat No. 6 of 2012 lodged by the Respondent removed;

(b)     
Ordered to grant probate in favour of the Applicant in terms of the Last Will and Testament of the deceased dated 16th December 2011;

(c)     
Summons for Directions filed by the Respondent on 28th March 2012 dismissed;

(d)     
No order made for costs and parties should bear their own costs.

Delivered at Suva this 9th Day of April 2013.
