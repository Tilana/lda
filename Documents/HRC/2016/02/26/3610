<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh 
session from 2 to 13 May 2011.  The review of Sudan was held at the 14th meeting on 10 
May 2011. The delegation of Sudan was headed by Mohamed Bushara Dosa, Minister of 
Justice of the Republic of the Sudan. At its 17th meeting held on 13 May 2011, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Sudan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Sudan: Belgium, China and Mauritania.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Sudan:  
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Sudan through 
the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation reiterated the sincere desire of Sudan to cooperate with the Council. 
It pointed out the need to pursue the recommendations of the working group in a practical 
manner, geared towards technical support and capacity-building, which had proved 
successful in reducing violations and strengthening protection. Sudan thanked Switzerland 
for its support in building capacities for human rights work in Sudan, in particular in 
Darfur. It thanked the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) for its contribution, as 
well as the network of national human rights organizations for the valuable information 
which helped in the preparations for the review. The delegation explained the difficulties 
that have made this report a unique one. In 2005, the Government of National Unity was 
established in Sudan on the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that 
granted Southern Sudan autonomy within the framework of a united Sudan for a 
transitional period of six years. In light of the different institutional systems and legislative 
institutions in northern and southern Sudan, it was not possible to have one consolidated 
report. Therefore, a committee representing the Government of Southern Sudan undertook 
the preparation of the special report on Southern Sudan, while another committee covered 
the situation in Sudan, so as to enable the Working Group to consider the situation 
objectively and make recommendations to address priorities on each side. Each side will 
follow up the implementation of the recommendations addressed to them, respectively, and 
undertake their implementation. </p>


<p>6. The delegation stressed that its presence at the UPR was in itself recognition of the 
importance given to improving the situation of human rights, in cooperation with United 
Nations and regional mechanisms, to implement its treaty obligations together with both 
UNMIS and the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID). 
</p>
<p>7. Sudan is convinced that human rights can only be achieved in an atmosphere of 
security, tranquility, peace and democracy; therefore the establishment of peace through 
negotiation and dialogue in all parts of the country was an urgent priority. The CPA signed 
in January 2005 opened up opportunities for the transition to peace and prosperity. It also 
contained provisions for the protection and promotion of human rights.  
</p>
<p>8. The CPA envisaged a referendum on self-determination for Southern Sudan at the 
end of the transitional period in January 2011. The Government of Sudan kept its promise 
and conducted the referendum in a timely manner. This constituted a milestone in the 
history of Sudan, resulting in the establishment of a new independent state following the 
transitional period. The Government of Sudan accepted and formally recognized this result, 
as it is convinced that it represents the will of the people of Southern Sudan expressed in a 
free, fair and transparent manner. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation noted that popular consultation had been completed by the provinces 
of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, which now enjoy security, stability and development. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation underlined that the process in Sudan would be incomplete without a 
just and lasting solution to the problem of Darfur. Negotiations have been ongoing in Doha, 
since the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) (also known as the Abuja 
Agreement) in Abuja in 2006. The absence of a number of factions required that there be 
another platform to negotiate in Doha, and for the success of the negotiations, in 2010, the 
Government of Sudan signed framework agreements for a ceasefire and peace with both the 
Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM). 
The mediator had submitted the final draft beforehand in order to obtain feedback from the 
negotiating parties so as to narrow the gap leading to the signing of the final agreement. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation said that Sudan had formulated a new strategy for peace, security and 
development aimed primarily at alleviating the suffering of those affected by the crisis, 
restore the normal situation, the voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees, 
harmony and tribal reconciliation, consolidation of justice and equity, and a climate to 
achieve comprehensive peace through negotiations. This strategy led to the voluntary return 
of displaced people in numbers exceeding expectation. The Government of Sudan allocated 
1.<footnote name="9">The recommendation was read during the interactive dialogue as &#8220;Consider abolishing the death 
penalty, especially to children under 18.&#8221; </footnote> billion dollars to the implementation of the strategy for development programs in 
education, health and clean drinking water, roads and infrastructures. However, the strategy 
is not intended to replace the negotiations in Doha. The delegation called on the 
international community to support the efforts of the Government and other efforts to 
resolve the crisis through a final settlement. 
</p>
<p>12. In the area of applying justice and the rule of law in Darfur, the Office of the 
Attorney General for Darfur crimes has been restructured to undertake investigations of all 
the crimes that have occurred in the region since 2003. The Government has also succeeded 
in repairing the social fabric through support of tribal reconciliation initiatives and the 
signing of a number of charters of peaceful coexistence between the tribes of the three 
states of Darfur. The Government envisioned putting into practice the rules and 
mechanisms of transitional justice following the accomplishment of full peace in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation stated that legislative reform was an ongoing process. The 
Government had recently approved amendments to a number of existing national laws as 
well as envisaged new legislation in some areas designed to fulfill the obligations of Sudan 
under international human rights treaties. It noted that there was a standing committee in 
the Ministry of Justice charged with legislation review.  </p>


<p>14. In the area of promotion and protection of children's rights, a number of legislative 
and executive measures have been taken aimed at the best interest of the child, especially 
children in difficult circumstances, such as children of unknown parents and deprived of 
parental care. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation hoped that the UPR mechanism could allow for replacing other 
mechanisms, including special procedures country mandates which are characterized by 
selectivity and double standards and used for purposes unrelated to human rights, and 
which have proven to be ineffective and in need of reform.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the interactive dialogue, 52 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations noted the broad consultations involving multiple stakeholders during the 
preparations for the UPR exercise. Additional statements which could not be delivered 
during the interactive dialogue owing to time constraints are posted on the extranet of the 
UPR when available.<footnote name="1">1 The recommendation was read during the interactive dialogue as &#8220;Commute sentences to death to

</p>
<p>41.<b> </b>Ireland was concerned by the reported targeting of civilians in Darfur and asked 
whether Sudan would grant UNAMID unhindered access to the area and lift all access 
restrictions on humanitarian agencies. Ireland expressed concern at reports of arbitrary 
arrest and detention of journalists, civil society activists and others by the NISS. Ireland 
made recommendations. </p>


<p>42. On the question of coordination between domestic and international human rights 
mechanisms, Sudan noted that there were many domestic mechanisms, including the 
Advisory Council on Human Rights (ACHR) which is composed of both governmental and 
non-governmental bodies. Also, the law establishing the independent National Commission 
on Human Rights has been passed and the appointment of members would take place soon. 
Furthermore, there are a number of national and international NGOs. Cooperation between  
domestic and international mechanisms is manifested in the two joint forums between the 
Government of the Sudan and UNMIS and UNAMID, three joint sub-forums in the three 
Darfur States as well as the Independent Expert on the human rights situation in the Sudan, 
appointed by the Council. All these mechanisms work independently and without any 
influence from the Government to tackle human rights issues in Sudan. 
</p>
<p>43. With regard to Sudan's efforts in dealing with situation in the Darfur, the delegation 
noted that negotiation was the basis for the solution of the problem in Darfur. The 
delegation also noted that there was a new strategy encompassing peace, security and 
development in Darfur with components for the return of internally displaced refugees to 
their homeland. 
</p>
<p>44. On the questions of oversight of detention by the national security apparatus and 
freedom of expression for the press and journalists, the delegation noted that the legal 
system in the Sudan was made up of legislation passed by Parliament after various stages of 
legal reviews. The National Security Forces Act of 2010 was not an exception in this 
process. The Minister of Justice has appointed an Attorney/Prosecutor to monitor detention 
by the NISS and the Prosecutor is working independently and impartially. Also, aggrieved 
persons can have recourse to the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>45. In relation to freedom of expression, the delegation noted that there are 60 daily 
newspaper published in Sudan, 37 of which are political papers that publish on a daily basis 
critical articles on the activities of the Government without pre-censorship. The detention of 
journalists is only ordered by the court in cases initiated by individuals affected by what is 
written in the newspapers; there is no political arrest, but rather arrest for the purpose of the 
law. 
</p>
<p>46. On the question of abolition of the death penalty, the delegation noted that the death 
penalty was practiced in the most restricted manner and imposed for the most serious 
crimes and it is associated with the right to practice religion as guaranteed by international 
human rights treaties. There are strict legal safeguards in trials of cases punishable by the 
death penalty. 
</p>
<p>47. Regarding the steps taken by the State to ensure access to education for all children, 
the delegation noted that there is a strategy in Sudan to make education free of charge and  
available to all children, including nomadic children. There is also a strategy for the 
education of girls. 
</p>
<p>48. With regard to empowerment of women, a national strategy was adopted in 2008 
which covers all the aspects relating to the empowerment of women, including legislative, 
health, education and participation in the decision making. Regarding wage equality 
between men and women, equal pay for equal work has been in place for a long time. 
Women in Sudan are subject to the same terms of employment and have the same 
opportunities as men to apply for public posts. Participation of women in political life is 
further enhanced by the allocation of the 25 per-cent quota in national and state 
parliaments. Consequently, there are 112 female members in the national Parliament and 
200 female members in state parliaments. Furthermore, women are also in many high-level 
positions in Sudan. 
</p>
<p>49.<b> </b>Spain praised the conducting of the referendum on the independence of Southern 
Sudan and expressed concern over the increased violence in Darfur against civilians. It </p>


<p>noted that years of conflict, unfair distribution of resources and economic mismanagement 
had deteriorated the economic, social and cultural rights of the Sudanese population. Spain 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50.<b> </b>India recalled that the CPA had ended one of the longest conflicts in Africa and 
noted the institutional mechanisms established since then to promote human rights. It 
considered the independence of Southern Sudan both promising and challenging. It urged 
Sudan and Southern Sudan to tackle concerns relating to sexual violence and impunity. 
India made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51.<b> </b>Japan welcomed the establishment of a human rights forum in Southern Sudan. 
Japan remained concerned over continued civilian casualties and displaced persons in 
Darfur, as well as widespread impunity and gender-based violence. Strengthening the rule 
of law in all regions is vital to a successful transition in Sudan. Japan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Azerbaijan positively noted the efforts to eliminate poverty and the measures to 
promote women&#8217;s rights, combat violence against women and protect children. Azerbaijan 
pointed out the constraints and challenges confronting Sudan, especially from the conflict 
in Darfur, which adversely affected limited resources, the restoration of security, protection 
of citizens and humanitarian assistance for victims. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53.<b> </b>Mauritania commended the positive interaction of Sudan with the UPR process, 
particularly in light of the difficult challenges that Sudan has faced in recent times, 
including in connection with the referendum on Southern Sudan. Mauritania made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54.<b> </b>The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted the efforts relating to human rights, 
despite the difficult political context, and to gender equality, despite the existing customs. It 
also welcomed the Zakat system and the Government&#8217;s political maturity on Darfur which 
led to the new situation in Southern Sudan. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Bangladesh considered that peace, security, stability and development are key to 
ensuring human rights in Sudan and hoped that the international community would support 
the peace process. It noted efforts by the Government to improve the human rights situation 
and understood the difficulties it faced, including poverty. Bangladesh made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56.<b> </b>Norway commended Sudan and Southern Sudan for their efforts to organize the 
referendum. It expressed concern about the ongoing conflict in Darfur and called on the 
Government to commit to lasting peace and justice. It stressed the burden on civilians of the 
armed clashes in Southern Sudan. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57.<b> </b>Uruguay noted that peace, stability, security, development and the rule of law are 
necessary elements for the enjoyment of human rights in Sudan, and acknowledged that 
recent elections did foresee the full participation of women. It remained concerned by 
sexual violence in the country. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58.<b> </b>France noted the new situation emerging from the independence of Southern Sudan 
and the opportunity to hold a state of emergency. France noted the human rights violations 
attributed to the National Intelligence and Security Service and inquired whether Sudan 
intended to decriminalize &#8220;indecent and immoral acts&#8221; and end child recruitment. France 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59.<b> </b>Honduras expressed understanding for the challenges faced by Sudan and noted the 
progress in its human rights situation. It recognized the reforms undertaken by the 
Government in the area of human rights.  Nevertheless, it was concerned by the situation of 
girls and women victims of constant abuse.  Honduras made recommendations. </p>


<p>60.<b> </b>Turkey acknowledged that Sudan was party to most international human rights 
agreements, submitted periodic reports and received rapporteurs regularly. It commended 
the Government for promoting peace and security and for the peaceful conduct of the 
referendum. It expressed concern at the continued violence in Darfur. Turkey made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61.<b> </b>Belgium echoed the concerns about the application of the death penalty for children.

detention, divorce or right to property. Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>

a recommendation.
