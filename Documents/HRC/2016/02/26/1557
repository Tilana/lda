</p>

<p>Future We Want&#8221;, and aiming to contribute to follow-up processes, including the 
identification and realization of sustainable development goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
development, that the right to development must be fulfilled in order to meet the 
development and environment needs of present and future generations equitably, and that 
the human person is the central subject of development and should be the active participant 
in and beneficiary of the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as endorsed by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that sustainable development and the protection of the environment can 
contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i>, conversely, that climate change, unsustainable management and 
use of natural resources and the unsound management of chemicals and wastes may 
interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that 
environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the 
effective enjoyment of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> that, while the human rights implications of environmental 
damage are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt 
most acutely by those segments of the population who are already in vulnerable situations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human 
rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, including 
the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the reports of the Independent Expert on the issue of 
human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
environment submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second1 and the twenty-
fifth2 sessions;

</p>
<p>3. <i>Also welcomes </i>the work of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue of human rights and the environment; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Recognizes</i> that human rights law sets out certain obligations on States that 
are relevant to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that 
the enjoyment of the corresponding human rights and fundamental freedoms can be 
facilitated by assessing environmental impact, making environmental information public 
and enabling effective participation in environmental decision-making processes, and that 
in that regard a good practice includes adopting, strengthening and implementing laws and 
other measures to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the 
context of environmental legislation and policies;

territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises, as provided for 
in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also</i> <i>reaffirms</i> the importance of non-discrimination in the application of 
environmental laws, but also of paying due attention to the members of groups particularly 
vulnerable to environmental harm, bearing in mind that environmental damage is felt most 
acutely by those segments of the population already in vulnerable situations; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recognizes</i> the role of human rights obligations and commitments in

obligations relevant to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment 
while shaping the post-2015 development agenda; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Stresses</i> the particular relevance of international cooperation in addressing 
the impact on the enjoyment of human rights that may result from environmental harm; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to clarify further the scope of human rights obligations 
of States as they relate to environmental harm; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Welcomes</i> the cooperation extended to date to the Independent Expert by 
different actors, and calls upon all States to continue to cooperate with the Independent
