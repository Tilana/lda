Review of operations 
 
On 24 March 2016 the company offered a share purchase plan (SPP) to eligible shareholders which was 
taken up by 70 shareholders and resulted in the issuing of 9,612,896 shares at 3.1 cents each.  Following 
the shareholder approval  at the Annual General Meeting a further 6,700,000 shares were issued to the 
major shareholder on a placement at the same price per share as the share purchase plan of 3.1 cents.  
This raised equity of A$505,700 for working capital.
The focus continues to be on significant gold resource expansion opportunities within and proximal to the 
existing Feasibility Study pits, as well as prospects within trucking distance to the proposed plant site.
Tight  cost  management  continues  at  Project  and  corporate  level,  whilst  the  management  and  staff 
continued  with  community  projects,  stakeholder  engagement  and  maintaining  the  Project  assets  and 
infrastructure. 
 
On  11  July  2016  the  company  executed  an  earn-in  agreement  with  Geopacific  Resources  Limited 
(“Geopacific”) where Geopacific can earn up to 75% of the project for project expenditure of up to $18.65m, 
based on level of spend, metres of diamond drilling and achievement of targeted resource ounces of gold 
over a three to four year period.
Significant matters relating to the ongoing viability of operations
At 30 June 2016, the Company had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $681,992. The group reported 
a net loss of $6,229,706 for the current half-year, of which $5.85m was asset impairment as a result of 
changes in exchange rates, and comparable market transactions for resource project sales.
Should Geopacific progress to Tranche 2 of the agreement, they will then take over all on island costs while 
earning in and for the Company there will be significant cost savings. Refer to note 1(b) to the Financial 
Statements for further detail.
Auditor's independence declaration
A copy of the auditor's independence declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 
2001 is set out on page 6.

(continued)
1. Basis of preparation of half-year report
This  consolidated  interim  financial  report  for  the  half-year  reporting  period  ended  30  June  2016  has 
been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the 
Corporations Act 2001.
This consolidated interim financial report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in 
an annual financial report.  Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by Kula Gold Limited during 
the  interim  reporting  period  in  accordance  with  the  continuous  disclosure  requirements  of  the 
Corporations Act 2001.
The  accounting  policies  adopted  are  consistent  with  those  of  the  previous  financial  year  and 
corresponding interim reporting period, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations as 
of 1 January, 2016. Newly adopted standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the 
consolidated interim financial report. 
 
(a) Significant matters relating to ongoing viability of operations 
  
The consolidated entity recorded a loss of $6,229,706 for the six months ended 30 July 2016 (2015: 
$875,789) and had a net cash outflow from operating and investing activities of $861,000 for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 (2015: $2,361,000). The consolidated entity had cash and cash equivalents 
at 30 June 2016 of $681,992 (2015: $593,184).  Cash at 26 August 2016 was $485,404.
The Group’s cashflow forecast for the period ending 31 December 2017 reflects that the Group will need 
to  raise  additional  working  capital  to  enable  it  to  continue  to  fund  its  activities  in  connection  with 
development of the Woodlark Island Gold Project in PNG.
The Directors are satisfied they will be able to raise additional working capital as required and thus it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. In arriving at this position the 
Directors have considered the following pertinent matters:
  On  11  July  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  an  earn-in  agreement  with  Geopacific 
Resources (“Geopacific”) which will enable Geopacific to fund $18.65 million over 3.5 years 
to earn up to a 75% interest in the Woodlark Island Gold Project.
  The Directors are satisfied that they will be able to raise additional funds via a form of equity
raising or by other funding arrangements.
In the  event that the Group  is  unable to raise  additional  funds to meet the  Group’s  ongoing  working 
capital and development funding requirements when required, there is a significant uncertainty as to 
whether the Group will be able to meet its debts as and when they fall due and thus continue as a going 
concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification 
of  recorded  asset  amounts,  nor  to the  amounts or  classification  of  liabilities  that might  be  necessary 
should the Group not be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
 
(b) Fair value measurements 
 
The  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  must  be  estimated  for  recognition  and 
measurement or for disclosure purposes.
The carrying value less impairment provision of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate 
their fair values due to their short-term nature.

The Feasibility Study was completed in a prior period and determined where mining was to occur.  At 
this time the previously capitalised mineral exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred in areas of 
interest where mining is not presently anticipated in the mine plan have been written off through the 
statement of comprehensive income. This is in line with the Group’s accounting policy for this type of 
expenditure.

The  recoverability  of  the  carrying  amount  of  the  mineral  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is 
dependent  on  successful  development  and  commercial  exploitation,  or  alternatively,  sale  of  the 
respective areas of interest.  Given the adverse movements in commodity prices and following obtaining 
all  necessary  permitting  approvals,  a  review  of  the  carrying  value  of  exploration  and  evaluation 
expenditure has been conducted as at 30 June 2016.
Impairment of exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggests 
that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount.  
The Company has reviewed the carrying value of its exploration and evaluation expenditure using the 
“Market Transaction Valuation” or ‘yardstick approach’.

Kula Gold Limited 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

(continued)
The  valuation  analysis  is  based  on  actual  transactions  for  gold  exploration  projects  over  the  twelve 
months  preceding  the  year  end  and  after  deducting  estimated  transaction  costs  of  2.5%  of  the 
transaction value.  A risk analysis was applied, taking into consideration project permitting, securing of 
capital funds, location and stakeholder relationships and market conditions to determine the position of 
the project value in the valuation range.
The above indicative evaluation of the carrying value and the recoverability of this asset has resulted 
in an impairment charge of $5,859,417 (31 December 2015: $26,189,526).
