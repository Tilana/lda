<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur has participated in numerous meetings and discussions on the 
</p>
<p>subject of the normative gap in international law in respect of violence against women. The 
</p>
<p>following sections highlight edited versions of submissions received from organizations 
</p>
<p>and individuals who are continuing their research and advocacy on this issue. The objective 
</p>
<p>of including this addendum to the thematic report of the current Special Rapporteur is to 
</p>
<p>highlight and institutionalize memory regarding the efforts of civil society, and to provide 
</p>
<p>an historical perspective for the next mandate holder, and also the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>This has become imperative in light of the experience of attempts at silencing and stifling 
</p>
<p>discussion on the normative gaps, and also the criticisms by individuals about how such 
</p>
<p>discussions undermine the existing frameworks. The Special Rapporteur expects that there 
</p>
<p>will be contestations about developments and discussions that have occurred over the past 
</p>
<p>five years on the normative gap in international law as regards violence against women, and 
</p>
<p>thus this document will serve as a valuable historical record.  
</p>
<p>A further reason to include this addendum is the lack of discussion, documentation and 
</p>
<p>acknowledgement of a historical, yet seminal, UN expert group meeting (EGM) that 
</p>
<p>occurred in 1991 in Vienna. The EGM was devoted to discussions on the development of a 
</p>
<p>specific instrument on violence against women, with the Government of Canada presenting 
</p>
<p>a Working Paper titled &#8220;Issues in the Development of an International Instrument on 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women&#8221; (1991) UN DOC EGM/VAW/WP.1). In this paper, there is an 
</p>
<p>acknowledgement of the limited applicability of existing international treaties to violence 
</p>
<p>against women. The rationale of the Government of Canada for proposing a treaty dealing 
</p>
<p>with violence against women was that &#8220;there are currently no international instruments that 
</p>
<p>deal with this issue in an express and comprehensive fashion&#8221;.1 The only document that the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur had access to, which had emanated from the EGM, is a submission 
</p>
<p>written by Andrew Byrnes who reacted to the idea of a draft treaty as proposed by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Canada.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur has been unsuccessful in obtaining other documents, despite 
</p>
<p>approaching relevant UN agencies and participants who were at the EGM. The responses 
</p>
<p>received indicate that either people had no knowledge of such a meeting, or that they do not 
</p>
<p>have the documents. This again reinforces the need to record the views and the historical 
</p>
<p>aspects of current efforts in this regard, to avoid a similar situation of the loss of 
</p>
<p>institutional memory of developments. The addendum also serves an important educative 
</p>
<p>purpose, for further research and advocacy. As is apparent in the submissions received, the 
</p>
<p>research and advocacy will continue in the future.

<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>In her 2014 report to the Human Rights Council, Special Rapporteur Manjoo expressed her 
</p>
<p>concerns about the seriousness of the normative gap existing in international law as relates 
</p>
<p>to violence against women. The current situation is, she says, one of &#8220;&#8216;normativity without 
</p>
<p>legality&#8217; and is reflected in the endorsement of principles by States, through resolutions, but 
</p>
<p>without the development and adoption of specific binding legal commitments as regards 
</p>
<p>violence against women.&#8221;2 
</p>
<p>Currently the treatment of violence against women in binding international law is rather 
</p>
<p>limited and indirect. The most prominent treatment is indeed indirect: General 
</p>
<p>Recommendation 19 of CEDAW, which incorporates violence against women into the 
</p>
<p>treaty&#8217;s anti-discrimination framework. Also indirectly, international legal entities such as 
</p>
<p>the ICTY and ICTR may use treaty law on torture and genocide (e.g., Prosecutor v Kunarac 
</p>
<p>et al. and Prosecutor v. Akayesu, respectively) to punish acts of gender-based violence such 
</p>
<p>as rape in times of conflict. In terms of direct legal address, however, the only avenue is via 
</p>
<p>regional treaties such as the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and 
</p>
<p>Eradication of Violence against Women (1994), the Protocol to the African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (2003), and The Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence (2011).  
</p>
<p>Despite the indirect and limited character of international legal avenues available to treat 
</p>
<p>the entrenched pandemic that is violence against women, there exists resistance to the call 
</p>
<p>for a dedicated, binding, legal framework establishing violence against women as a 
</p>
<p>specific, grave, and widespread human rights violation. For example, Dr. Palitha Kohona, a 
</p>
<p>former chief of the U.N. Treaty Section, says &#8220;The promoters of a treaty will have to 
</p>
<p>convince the international community there is a real need for such a legal instrument.&#8221;3 It is 
</p>
<p>our goal here to provide some preliminary evidence demonstrating exactly the need to close 
</p>
<p>the normative gap. 
</p>
<p><b>  Examining the consequences of the normative gap 
</b></p>
<p>Data currently does not exist which allows for a direct empirical test of the consequences of 
</p>
<p>the international normative gap on outcomes. However, there are corollary issues within 
</p>
<p>domestic legal frameworks which can be investigated using data created for our book 
</p>
<p>Violence Against Women and the Law (Paradigm/Routledge 2015), many of which speaks 
</p>
<p>to the consequences of the normative gap.  
</p>
<p>First, we can look at the status of domestic gender-based violence laws. Since CEDAW&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Article 2, incorporated with General Recommendation 19, is the existing legal mandate for 
</p>
<p>the creation of laws prohibiting violence against women, we can assess how successful has 
</p>
<p>been that regime. Second, there exists a normative gap in domestic legal codes&#8217; addressing 
</p>
<p>of violence against women that is akin to the international normative gap, where states do 
</p>
<p>not provide explicit legal guarantees against gender-based violence but, rather, offer other 
</p>
<p>existing laws that might be used to provide some recourse to victims. A good example 
</p>
<p>would be a state that does not have a domestic violence law, but has a general assault law 
</p>
<p>that can be used by victims, and this is similar to the indirect way current international law 
</p>
<p>is used with regard to violence against women. 
</p>
<p>In our research, we audited 196 states&#8217; domestic laws regarding four forms of violence 
</p>
<p>against women (rape, marital rape, domestic violence, and sexual harassment), from 2007 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>to 2010, and rated them on the following scale: 0: No law or discriminatory law; 1: 
</p>
<p>Incomplete law; 2: Corollary law; 3: Explicit, full law.4 Our findings indicate that the 
</p>
<p>average strength of these laws, globally, was: Rape: 2.56; Domestic Violence: 1.94; Sexual 
</p>
<p>Harassment: 1.61 and Marital Rape: 1.17. Clearly, for three of these four types of laws 
</p>
<p>addressing violence against women, there is a long way to go to reach the point where one 
</p>
<p>could even say that, on average, women in the world have basic, explicit legal prohibitions 
</p>
<p>protecting them from violence; this, 35 years after CEDAW was adopted. In some regions, 
</p>
<p>the status of these laws is far worse than the averages shown here. Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>difference between a corollary law (2) and an explicit guarantee (3) is of great interest as, 
</p>
<p>the greater extent to which women realize lives of dignity in countries with explicit 
</p>
<p>guarantees, as opposed to the lesser enjoyment of dignity by those in countries with 
</p>
<p>corollary laws, is the extent to which the domestic normative gap negatively affects women. 
</p>
<p>We would expect a similar phenomenon at the international level. 
</p>
<p>Our findings, for states that have closed the domestic normative gap, include the following: 
</p>
<p>5 States with explicit domestic violence laws score higher on the UN Gender Development 
</p>
<p>Index (GDI) and the UN Human Development Index (HDI), have lower fertility rates, and 
</p>
<p>have fewer women among their population living with HIV, than do those with corollary 
</p>
<p>laws. States with explicit marital rape laws score higher on the GDI, HDI and UN Gender 
</p>
<p>Empowerment Measure (GEM), and they have better enforcement of gender-violence laws, 
</p>
<p>than do those with corollary laws. States with explicit sexual harassment laws score higher 
</p>
<p>on the HDI and GEM, have fewer women among their population living with HIV, and 
</p>
<p>have better enforcement of gender-violence laws, than do those with corollary laws. 
</p>
<p>These results point to the fact that there is a reliable difference in the degree of dignity 
</p>
<p>afforded to women&#8217;s lives in states with explicit guarantees against gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>and those states with only corollary laws. While the complete set of factors affecting 
</p>
<p>dignity is complex, from our findings we believe laws to be an important component of the 
</p>
<p>differences as reflected above. Further, we believe that knowing this about the effect of the 
</p>
<p>domestic normative gap on women&#8217;s dignity obliges us to engage in a serious discussion 
</p>
<p>about what are the consequences of the international normative gap. 
</p>
<p><b>  Factors explaining the strength of national laws 
</b></p>
<p>During the 59th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women, the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>echoed UN Women in asserting that 50-50 gender representation in government needs to 
</p>
<p>happen by 2030 and that governments need to make national commitments to eliminate 
</p>
<p>gender inequality.6 UN Women argues that one way to reach this goal is by passing new 
</p>
<p>laws or strengthening those in place.7 Thus, examining the factors associated with the 
</p>
<p>adoption and strength of gender-violence laws represents an important step in making the 
</p>
<p>2030 goal achievable.  
</p>
<p>In our book, we explore various political, economic, and social factors associated with the 
</p>
<p>adoption and strength of legal protections related to violence against women. Some of our 
</p>
<p>key findings include the following: First, incorporation of women into the political process 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 In our book we go into detail about the guidelines dictating into what category any particular law 
</p>
<p>falls. We also discuss the advantages of this approach relative to others used by UN Women and the 
</p>
<p>OECD. Inter-rater reliability for these ratings was .88 and above, demonstrating great confidence in 
</p>
<p>these guidelines. 
</p>
<p> 5 Results in the list were found statistically significant from a difference of means test with unequal 
</p>
<p>variance specified. All but one result (p&lt; .07) were statistically significant at p&lt; .05. We did not test 
</p>
<p>rape laws, as there is insufficient variance, globally, in this legal prohibition.

</b></p>
<p>is crucial for the adoption and strength of gender-violence laws. We find that as the 
</p>
<p>percentage of women in a national legislature increases by about 10 percent, countries are 
</p>
<p>about 10 percent more likely to adopt explicit, full laws against marital rape, domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, and sexual harassment. The evidence suggests that women in government are 
</p>
<p>representative of women&#8217;s interests and they have an influence on policymaking related to 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s issues, specifically violence against women, including by introducing and passing 
</p>
<p>relevant legislation. Second, improved respect for women&#8217;s economic rights and greater 
</p>
<p>capability are associated with the adoption of relatively stronger legislation related to 
</p>
<p>violence against women. In terms of enforcement of such laws, increased respect for 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s economic rights is associated with a 12 percent increase in the probability of a 
</p>
<p>country engaging in better enforcement of legal protections addressing violence against 
</p>
<p>women. Third, we find that laws addressing violence against women diffuse globally, and 
</p>
<p>our research on sexual harassment laws indicates that countries look to neighboring 
</p>
<p>countries in their emulation and adoption of such legislation.  
</p>
<p>The global diffusion of laws reinforces the call for a specific international instrument on 
</p>
<p>violence against women for two reasons. First, an important part of the strength of 
</p>
<p>international norms lies in homogeneity of concepts and application; and second, with the 
</p>
<p>guidance of a universal norm (emanating from a specific international instrument), 
</p>
<p>domestic laws should diffuse somewhat evenly across countries, providing a more-
</p>
<p>equitable pattern of access to redress for this human rights violation. Our research indicates 
</p>
<p>that international law does influence the strength of gender-violence laws. As the number of 
</p>
<p>years to which a country has been party to CEDAW increases, usually by 8 years or more, 
</p>
<p>the likelihood of adopting explicit, full legal protections against domestic violence 
</p>
<p>increases by about 23.4 percent. Resistance to international law is associated with a reduced 
</p>
<p>likelihood of adopting gender-violence legislation. Countries that hold a reservation to 
</p>
<p>Article 2 of CEDAW are 15.8 percent less likely to adopt full marital-rape legal protections 
</p>
<p>and 26.2 percent less likely to adopt full domestic violence legal protections.  
</p>
<p>Whether international law influences the strength and adoption of legislation directly, or 
</p>
<p>indirectly, by providing legitimacy to rights-related demands, the evidence suggests that 
</p>
<p>international law is influential in the adoption of strong gender-violence laws at the national 
</p>
<p>level. When this finding is viewed in isolation, it may seem to make the case that CEDAW 
</p>
<p>is sufficient, but this is not the case. When paired with our finding that legal protections in 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence laws, other than rape laws, are sorely lacking in most countries, 
</p>
<p>CEDAW, which has been in force for over 35 years, helped change the picture of legal 
</p>
<p>protections from abysmal to lacking - but has failed to nudge legal protections any further 
</p>
<p>towards being at the required standard. Social movements and organizations also require a 
</p>
<p>stronger, specific, international standard with regards to ensuring effective monitoring of a 
</p>
<p>state&#8217;s obligation to prevent and ultimately eliminate violence against women.

<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>In November 2012 we read the following statement in a press release: &#8220;Speaking at a side 
</p>
<p>event of the 67th session of the UN General Assembly, the United Nations Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on violence against women, Ms. Rashida Manjoo, called on UN bodies and 
</p>
<p>NGOs to discuss how best to collaborate in advancing the international agenda for 
</p>
<p>preventing and eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls&#8230; The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommended forging a new UN Convention on Violence against Women, a 
</p>
<p>suggestion echoed by Deputy Executive Director of UN Women Lakshmi Puri. &#8220;It would </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>be a dream outcome of CSW,&#8221; Ms. Puri said, and invited panelists to begin working 
</p>
<p>together on this goal.&#8221; 8 
</p>
<p>It seemed evident to us that CEDAW, whilst having many positive qualities and being an 
</p>
<p>essential piece of international legislation preventing discrimination against women in the 
</p>
<p>world, did not specifically provide the normative tools for effectively holding states to 
</p>
<p>account for their lack of protection of women and girls from violence. In addition, having 
</p>
<p>been written in the 1970s, at a time when partner violence, the most common form of 
</p>
<p>violence against women (VAW) was seen globally as a private issue, it did not put this 
</p>
<p>issue at the top of the gender inequality agenda. Today the world view on VAW, including 
</p>
<p>prevention strategies, has moved on to such a degree that the time is ripe to draft a 
</p>
<p>convention incorporating prevention and &#8216;newer&#8217; forms of violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls, including lessons learned in the interim period.  
</p>
<p><b>  The process of consulting on and drafting a Convention against Violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women and Girls 
</b></p>
<p>As academics and activists in the women&#8217;s rights sector, we decided to initiate a series of 
</p>
<p>discussions on the issue, while at the same time also starting the process of writing a 
</p>
<p>Convention against violence against women and girls. One of the most important steps in 
</p>
<p>the process was to gather momentum around a campaign in favour of a new international 
</p>
<p>instrument before any concrete draft convention could be widely disseminated. Funding to 
</p>
<p>enable us to hold a series of events to garner grassroot, legal and activist support for the 
</p>
<p>idea of a new instrument was obtained in September 2012 from the University of the West 
</p>
<p>of England (UWE).  
</p>
<p>Our discussions and consultations have included numerous activities, including the 
</p>
<p>following:  
</p>
<p>1) Prof. Rashida Manjoo giving a Distinguished Professorial Address at UWE 
</p>
<p>outlining the current legal framework relating to the protection of women under 
</p>
<p>international law as well as illustrating its failings.  
</p>
<p>2) Prof. Jones conducting a series of presentations on the topic, for example via 
</p>
<p>video link for the Study Programme at the Carr Centre, Harvard University and at 
</p>
<p>the Feminist Legal Theory Workshop, Emory University.  
</p>
<p>3) The draft Convention on violence against women and girls was presented at 
</p>
<p>the London meeting of the UK National Alliance of Women&#8217;s Organizations.  
</p>
<p>4) The draft was also presented at the European Women Lawyers Association 
</p>
<p>meeting in Brussels and was warmly received with several suggestions for the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of certain issues and for further necessary action.  
</p>
<p>5) The draft was &#8216;taken&#8217; to CSW by Prof Jones, Chair of Wales Assembly of 
</p>
<p>Women and Secretary General of European Women Lawyers Association, and it 
</p>
<p>was discussed among activists and lawyers from a variety of countries. It was 
</p>
<p>mooted that the idea of a new Convention should be put on the agenda of the 5
th
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>World Conference on Women.  
</p>
<p>6) In parallel to these developments in Europe, other activists had also rallied to 
</p>
<p>the call for a new convention, most notably the Carr Centre at Harvard University, 
</p>
<p>where Prof. Jones was invited to speak at a symposium discussing a grass roots 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>campaign around a new Convention. Strong links have since been made with this 
</p>
<p>campaign and Prof. Jones regularly inputs into the global campaign.9  
</p>
<p>7) With a view to explore such gap, with a wider audience a panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>the International Legal Gaps in the Protection of Women from Violence was 
</p>
<p>organized in London. Over 100 delegates, including activists, lawyers, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and academics, from across Europe attended the event. The meeting 
</p>
<p>generated a fruitful conversation on the legal gaps in the protection of women from 
</p>
<p>violence as well as considered the possibility of drafting a universal convention 
</p>
<p>against violence against women.10  
</p>
<p>8) At CSW 58 in 2014 at least three side events focused on the idea of a new 
</p>
<p>international legal instrument. The campaign was also mentioned at many different 
</p>
<p>meetings and events, including the <i>EveryWoman EveryWhere</i> campaign event at 
</p>
<p>which several panelists had a frank exchange on the pros and cons of a new 
</p>
<p>international legal instrument, thereby clearly demonstrating a demand for such a 
</p>
<p>debate.  
</p>
<p>9) Further input from organizations was sought, including a presentation to the 
</p>
<p>UK End Violence against Women Coalition. 
</p>
<p>10) A meeting of experts from across Europe was convened by IMKAAN in 
</p>
<p>London to discuss whether a new international legal instrument was required, useful, 
</p>
<p>and mandated. It was agreed at the meeting that there was a legal gap and that this 
</p>
<p>contributed to the impunity of state and non-state actors in the systematic and 
</p>
<p>widespread prevalence of violence against women and girls around the globe, 
</p>
<p>including Europe. The expert meeting allowed for a frank conversation on the 
</p>
<p>process of drafting an international convention against violence against women and 
</p>
<p>girls, the pitfalls of drafting and adopting international conventions, and discussions 
</p>
<p>on the expertise required. It was agreed that further amendments should be made to 
</p>
<p>the draft already in existence. Whilst the Istanbul Convention was welcomed and 
</p>
<p>needed, the addition of a global instrument would be highly beneficial to all of 
</p>
<p>humanity, rather than it being viewed as a rival to a Europe-specific legal 
</p>
<p>instrument.  
</p>
<p>11) Prof. Jones attended an expert meeting analyzing the draft chapter on 
</p>
<p>&#8216;Human Rights of Women&#8217; for the EU Beijing +20 Report organized by the EU 
</p>
<p>Institute for Gender Equality, Vilnius, where she discussed the developments to date 
</p>
<p>and many delegates expressed an interest in discussing the draft Convention. 
</p>
<p>12) At CSW59, several organizations held (full and partial) panels on a new 
</p>
<p>international legal instrument. 
</p>
<p>The first draft of the instrument was written and discussed by several colleagues in 
</p>
<p>December 2012 at an internal university meeting and has subsequently been shared with 
</p>
<p>selected partners, including lawyers and activists at various meetings and gatherings, as 
</p>
<p>illustrated above. It has been amended several times as a result of this process. The draft 
</p>
<p>convention draws on international instruments, including the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment; regional 
</p>
<p>instruments such as the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating

<p><b> 4. Submission received from The Everywoman Everywhere Coalition  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>The Everywoman Everywhere Coalition was created by and for the rapidly-growing 
</p>
<p>community of women&#8217;s rights advocates who see a UN treaty - the right UN treaty - on 
</p>
<p>violence against women as a major step forward in advancing women&#8217;s security in their 
</p>
<p>local contexts and worldwide. This effort was initially catalyzed in 2012 by women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>activist Lisa Shannon and Dr. Charlie Clements, a human rights activist who played a 
</p>
<p>crucial role in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. The reports and urgent calls 
</p>
<p>of the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women Rashida Manjoo for a new 
</p>
<p>legally binding norm further propelled them into action. The Carr Center for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>hosted an initial convening of women&#8217;s rights activists and scholars in June of 2013. A 
</p>
<p>seed-phase working group formed out of the initial convening, with the mission of 
</p>
<p>exploring the need for a treaty. 
</p>
<p>An extended exploratory phase, then termed &#8220;Ban VAW &#8211; Ban Violence Against Women&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>was conducted from June 2013-October 2014, under the leadership of activists and Carr 
</p>
<p>Center Fellows, Lisa Shannon and Vidya Sri, herself a survivor of VAW.  This phase 
</p>
<p>combined rigorous academic research with extensive consultations and conversations with 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights advocates from around the world. The exploratory phase and conversations 
</p>
<p>with hundreds of women&#8217;s rights activists around the world, revealed robust interest in a 
</p>
<p>new norm. Passionate interest and commitment to advancing women&#8217;s security through 
</p>
<p>new norm creation emerged through these conversations. However, an unfortunate climate 
</p>
<p>of fear and resistance often muted open discussion and exploration because of well-
</p>
<p>connected establishment voices deeply committed to preserving CEDAW&#8217;s legacy as-is, 
</p>
<p>regardless of the role a new treaty may play in complementing CEDAW or protecting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>women. This has forced many expert practitioners to take the conversation &#8220;underground&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>as opposed to exploration through open debate. 
</p>
<p>To date 115 organizations from 52 countries have signed our sign-on statement, developed 
</p>
<p>by Regional Working Groups: &#8220;I stand for the right to a life free from all forms of violence 
</p>
<p>for everywoman, everywhere. I hereby join the global call for an international treaty on 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls worldwide.&#8221; October 2014 marked the birth of The 
</p>
<p>Everywoman Everywhere Coalition, a project of the newly registered organization, The 
</p>
<p>International Commission on Violence Against Women and Girls, following and 
</p>
<p>supporting the call emerging from women&#8217;s rights advocates around the world. This highly 
</p>
<p>diverse coalition is born of and driven by survivors and practitioners, with more than 60 
</p>
<p>active working group members from more than 52 countries including every continent and 
</p>
<p>major geographic area.  Everywoman Everywhere operates with a decentralized, regional 
</p>
<p>working group structure. The Everywoman Everywhere Coalition operates on a 
</p>
<p>foundational principle: An inclusive, participatory, rights-based approach, taking full 
</p>
<p>advantage of on-the-ground expertise from practitioners and survivors, is essential for the 
</p>
<p>efficacy of any potential treaty. 
</p>
<p><b>  Aims, objectives and functioning 
</b></p>
<p>The Coalition aims to create leadership space and support for advocates who sign on to a 
</p>
<p>basic statement, developed by Regional Working Groups: &#8220;I stand for the right to a life free 
</p>
<p>from all forms of violence for everywoman, everywhere. I hereby join the global call for an 
</p>
<p>international treaty on violence against women and girls worldwide.&#8221; With a foundational 
</p>
<p>commitment to including diverse voices, this coalition-based campaign is structured from 
</p>
<p>the grassroots up. The core platform is being developed through an extensive global 
</p>
<p>consultative process, ensuring that marginalized voices play a central leadership role 
</p>
<p>through a decentralized regional working group structure. By January 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Everywoman Everywhere Coalition membership has grown to 189 members, including 116 
</p>
<p>member organizations from 54 countries around the globe. Given current outreach efforts, 
</p>
<p>this number is expected to more than double by June of 2015.  
</p>
<p>In the fall of 2014, 60 working group members from more than 52 countries assembled as a 
</p>
<p>leadership team to engage in the pursuit of a singular goal: Mobilization and execution of a 
</p>
<p>global, grassroots-up campaign for a universal legal tool in the form of a UN Convention or 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocol to CEDAW that empowers every woman and girl access to legal 
</p>
<p>remedy should their rights to personal security be violated. The goal of such an instrument 
</p>
<p>is to move violence against women and girls from soft law (declarations, recommendations, 
</p>
<p>suggestions) into a comprehensive, specific, legally binding instrument that establishes 
</p>
<p>global minimal norms and standards to outlaw violence against women, with monitoring, 
</p>
<p>evaluation, and implementation mechanisms, and clear structure for states to track progress. 
</p>
<p>Building on past hard-fought, world-changing victories of the international women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>movement, the goal of the Everywoman Everywhere Coalition is a comprehensive, 
</p>
<p>specific, legally binding instrument in the form of a UN treaty that establishes global 
</p>
<p>minimal norms and standards to outlaw violence against women in its many forms, with a 
</p>
<p>specific monitoring mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>  The Research: The Need for a new Treaty 
</b></p>
<p>With a global volunteer team of 35 research assistants, relationships with 30 law clinics 
</p>
<p>worldwide, extensive policy and legal research has been undertaken to build the core 
</p>
<p>platform. Major gaps in the current legal and implementation framework have been 
</p>
<p>examined, while identifying models for potential legislation, including progress and 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of regional conventions, including the Council of Europe Convention on 
</p>
<p>Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4

<p><b>24</b>

<p>Convention), Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol), Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
</p>
<p>Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m Do Par&#225;), 
</p>
<p>and the comparison of regional treaties to the UN Handbook on Legislation on Violence 
</p>
<p>Against Women11. Dialogue with the drafters of these regional conventions and those 
</p>
<p>involved in the implementation of CEDAW and the Istanbul Convention are ongoing to 
</p>
<p>catalogue the geo-political perspectives on VAW. Further, the effectiveness of the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review process is being assessed and the successes and lessons learned 
</p>
<p>from the National Action Planning process are being reviewed. Through the Harvard 
</p>
<p>Kennedy School and Coalition partner organizations, a pilot consultation in Pakistan has 
</p>
<p>been completed in early 2015. 
</p>
<p>The current gaps and resultant statistics are glaring. In the USA, rapists who impregnate 
</p>
<p>their victims maintain parental rights in 31 states.12 Marital rape is legal in 73% of the 
</p>
<p>world&#8217;s nations, leaving 2.6 billion women to live where they can be raped with no legal 
</p>
<p>consequence.13 There has not been a single VAW case decided by the African Court since 
</p>
<p>the inception of the Maputo Protocol.14 There are no national laws in China that define 
</p>
<p>domestic violence.15 80% of Middle East and North Africa nations have no domestic 
</p>
<p>violence laws.16 While Papua New Guinea has ratified CEDAW, domestic and intimate 
</p>
<p>partner violence affects an estimated 70% of women, and up to 100% in some communities 
</p>
<p>in the highlands.17 The police force and legal system in PNG is remarkably corrupt, with 
</p>
<p>police themselves responsible for innumerable instances of VAW including gang rape.18 In 
</p>
<p>some ASEAN countries, domestic violence laws provide exemptions for certain acts of 
</p>
<p>violence. Cambodian law, for example, defines discipline conducted with &#8220;compassion, 
</p>
<p>pity and sincerity&#8221; as acceptable.19 These facts represent just a few of the international,

<p>regional and domestic legislative shortcomings that contribute to more than one in three 
</p>
<p>women globally experiencing physical and/or sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>Violence against women and girls remains the most widespread human rights violation on 
</p>
<p>earth. Despite growing global outcry, for the most part violence against women is not a 
</p>
<p>violation of international law, and protection of women from individual states continues to 
</p>
<p>be discretionary, leaving billions of women and girls with little or no legal protection 
</p>
<p>against this breed of violence in its varied forms. Current legal remedies are failing women 
</p>
<p>and girls in every corner of the globe. There is a powerful step United Nations member 
</p>
<p>states could take to fill these gaps: UN Conventions provide a legally binding structure in a 
</p>
<p>given national territory that women&#8217;s rights advocates can use to create new laws, improve 
</p>
<p>existing laws, and drive accountability for implementation of existing law on a local, 
</p>
<p>national, regional, and global scale. 
</p>
<p><b>  The way forward - A Five-Year Strategy 
</b></p>
<p>The call for a global norm on violence against women creates significant political benefit 
</p>
<p>for United Nations member states. The creation, ratification, and implementation of a treaty 
</p>
<p>on VAW is a powerful, yet politically complex endeavor. A fast-moving top down process 
</p>
<p>could produce a weak, ineffective treaty. With major issues concerning colonialist 
</p>
<p>approaches, the success of this treaty depends largely on growth from the developing world, 
</p>
<p>as opposed to an export from Western nations - a condition which many developing nations 
</p>
<p>would be far less likely to support for political and historical reasons. The strategic focus of 
</p>
<p>the Everywoman Everywhere Campaign is not simply a new law, but the most effective, 
</p>
<p>comprehensive treaty possible. Rigorous research and analysis coupled with on-the-ground 
</p>
<p>input from those most affected by violence against women i.e. advocates and survivors, is 
</p>
<p>crucial.  
</p>
<p>A five-year strategic priority list has emerged, based on the Everywoman Everywhere 
</p>
<p>Coalition&#8217;s extensive consultations. The three primary areas of focus include: Policy 
</p>
<p>development and implementation, coordination of the coalition while supporting local-level 
</p>
<p>activists and campaigns, and mainstreaming public support mobilization. From a policy 
</p>
<p>perspective, the Everywoman Everywhere Coalition has carefully modeled the blueprint for 
</p>
<p>later stages of policy strategy based on the critical path used by the groundbreaking 
</p>
<p>International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which resulted in the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention to Ban Landmines, which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. The 
</p>
<p>Everywoman Everywhere Coalition has focused on engaging diverse voices and leaders, 
</p>
<p>activists and survivors from around the world in active debate and full participation in this 
</p>
<p>process, prior to large-scale public launch or announcing a core platform. The policy 
</p>
<p>development stages include: complete and synthesize research- 2015; complete the global 
</p>
<p>consultation- 2015; develop a core platform- 2016; identify and engage United Nations 
</p>
<p>Member States - 2016 and beyond; and ratification and implementation campaigns - 2019 
</p>
<p>and beyond. 
</p>
<p>The second area of focus, of coordination of the coalition while supporting local-level 
</p>
<p>activists and campaigns, requires recognition that cultural and systemic shifts required to 
</p>
<p>address violence against women take place primarily through the advocacy work of local 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights organizations. They are the vehicles through which those elusive long-term 
</p>
<p>shifts in societal norms happen. The ratification and implementation of the new treaty will 
</p>
<p>depend on the capacity of women&#8217;s rights advocates on the ground in every United Nations 
</p>
<p>member state. While women and girls have recently become a mainstream funding priority, 
</p>
<p>most of this work has focused on supporting women as individuals through economic 
</p>
<p>development, education, and services for survivors of violence against women. Although 
</p>
<p>supporting individual women generates powerful collective shifts on many fronts, evidence 
</p>
<p>clearly shows that education and economic empowerment alone do not prevent violence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>against women. Funders have increasingly deprioritized essential complementary work on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights. Despite their powerful impact, local women&#8217;s rights organizations are 
</p>
<p>underfunded. Although violence against women and girls is by far the most widespread 
</p>
<p>violation of human rights on the planet, women&#8217;s rights groups receive only 1% of human 
</p>
<p>rights funding. A recent survey by AWID showed that on average women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>organizations in Africa operate on a $12,000 per year budget.  
</p>
<p>The third area of focus of mainstreaming public support and mobilization will include a 
</p>
<p>public launch in 2016 and the use of the most fundamental tool for movement building: 
</p>
<p>One clear ask through a public campaign and cry for a United Nations Convention on 
</p>
<p>Violence Against Women. The development of online, social media tools around this call to 
</p>
<p>action provides a unique opportunity to educate and refocus the public eye on violence 
</p>
<p>against women through a human-rights framework, with a powerful call to action and 
</p>
<p>mobilizing tools to support the newfound interest. The movement for a Convention will 
</p>
<p>have its own social impact, engaging new individuals and communities in the movement to 
</p>
<p>end violence against women in three simple actions: Signing onto a statement of support; 
</p>
<p>Community signing events, hosted by faith groups, schools, and other community groups; 
</p>
<p>Runs and walks benefiting partner women&#8217;s rights organizations, which serve multi-layered 
</p>
<p>benefits, including education, awareness raising, engagement, and fundraising.

<p><b>Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences, Rashida Manjoo (March 16, 2015) 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>At the request of the Special Rapporteur (SR), the Center for Justice and International Law 
</p>
<p>(CEJIL) convened a closed 3-hour meeting in Washington D.C. that counted with in-person 
</p>
<p>and virtual participation of representatives of over 20 organizations working on the 
</p>
<p>promotion and defense of the rights of women in the Americas.20 The SR stated that the 
</p>
<p>purpose of the consultation was to critically asses the normative gap existing within 
</p>
<p>international law caused by a lack of a legally binding instrument on violence against 
</p>
<p>women, as well as to discuss the need, advantages, and potential drawbacks of a UN treaty 
</p>
<p>on violence against women. The discussion also focused on the Americas experience, 
</p>
<p>particularly regarding the region&#8217;s understanding of the Organization of American States 
</p>
<p>(OAS) &#8220;Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;&#8221; Convention, which provides the main point of reference for 
</p>
<p>identifying challenges associated with the implementation of international normative and 
</p>
<p>institutional frameworks on violence against women.  
</p>
<p>The SR shared the findings of her recent reports and her research findings on the normative 
</p>
<p>gap that exists when addressing violence against women, including the gaps in CEDAW 
</p>
<p>and the soft law approach of the United Nations. She argued that by highlighting this 
</p>
<p>normative gap, it is not about undermining CEDAW, but recognizing that its protection can 
</p>
<p>be strengthened by acknowledging the lack of clearly binding standards on State 
</p>
<p>obligations to prevent, investigate, punish and provide reparations for violence against 
</p>
<p>women. It is also important to recognize that, as a necessary phenomenon, laws evolve as 
</p>
<p>circumstances change.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20 Participants represented organizations from Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, 
</p>
<p>Argentina, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, M&#233;xico, Honduras, Per&#250;, Venezuela, as well as some 
</p>
<p>regional organizations. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>In some regions this normative gap has been bridged. Twenty years ago, Member States of 
</p>
<p>the OAS adopted the Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; Convention, which addresses violence against women 
</p>
<p>and outlines the State&#8217;s obligation to prevent, investigate and prosecute it. In 2014, Europe 
</p>
<p>followed suit and adopted the Istanbul Convention on violence against women and 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. Additionally, Africa has the Maputo Protocol, which includes useful 
</p>
<p>provisions on violence against women. All these regional instruments respond to regional 
</p>
<p>characteristics and specific on-the-ground realities and needs. The SR explained that, while 
</p>
<p>there are lessons learned from all these mechanisms and their implementation, they were 
</p>
<p>not designed and drafted to respond to a global perspective of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>None of these regional conventions can be taken or should be promoted as global treaties, 
</p>
<p>since they were not drafted with a global consideration and not every State participated in 
</p>
<p>their discussion.    
</p>
<p>Individuals, organizations and States may wonder why an international convention to 
</p>
<p>address the issue of violence against women is needed when CEDAW, as well as several 
</p>
<p>regional systems and mechanisms, exist. However, as the SR underscored in her response 
</p>
<p>to this question, there is an urgent need to address the global failure to prevent and respond 
</p>
<p>to violence against women, and to address the accountability deficit. Unfortunately, from a 
</p>
<p>universal system perspective and because of the normative gap that exists, this 
</p>
<p>accountability task has to be carried out based on soft law, which is not always an effective 
</p>
<p>mechanism. A global treaty will serve to overcome this, by including clear binding 
</p>
<p>standards regarding State&#8217;s obligation to prevent and to act with due diligence when 
</p>
<p>addressing violence against women. Crafting a global treaty on violence against women 
</p>
<p>will require exchanging experiences from the existing regional mechanisms and using their 
</p>
<p>best practices, but also thinking on the kind of monitoring mechanism we would like to see 
</p>
<p>created. A global treaty would also allow for the inclusion of regions that currently do not 
</p>
<p>have a binding convention on violence against women, like the Asia, the Pacific and the 
</p>
<p>MENA regions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Importance of a binding international definition of violence against women and State 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations and its implementation based on the experience of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;  
</b></p>
<p>During the dialogue, representatives of Guatemalan civil society expressed their agreement 
</p>
<p>with the SR&#8217;s presentation and conclusions. In Guatemala&#180;s experience, the existence of 
</p>
<p>Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; as a binding treaty has allowed the Government and civil society to create a 
</p>
<p>national framework for addressing violence against women, including the creation of 
</p>
<p>specific legislation, public policies, and prevention mechanisms. As a result, civil society 
</p>
<p>was able to push for the creation of a National Commission (Coordinadora Nacional para la 
</p>
<p>Prevenci&#243;n de la violencia intra-familiar y contra las Mujeres &#8211; CONAPREVI) in 2000 that 
</p>
<p>aims to guide the implementation of programs and policies for preventing and addressing 
</p>
<p>violence against women. However, members noted that this national institution is currently 
</p>
<p>facing problems since civil society has been impeded from participating in the 
</p>
<p>Commission&#8217;s composition as it was originally envisioned in the law.   
</p>
<p>Similarly, colleagues from Colombia affirmed that Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; has been crucial in 
</p>
<p>helping develop specific legal frameworks at the national level to address violence against 
</p>
<p>women. Colombian organizations also highlighted the importance that this international 
</p>
<p>instrument has had in guiding the decisions of the judiciary on issues of violence against 
</p>
<p>women, although they mentioned that more needs to be done for judges to understand the 
</p>
<p>binding nature of the international obligations and their role in implementing it. As a main 
</p>
<p>challenge, these organizations identified implementation and compliance and inquire as to 
</p>
<p>how could these challenges be overcome with a new treaty. In El Salvador, Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; 
</p>
<p>was a pivotal instrument that helped spearhead the creation of a specific legal framework 
</p>
<p>for addressing violence against women. However, representatives of civil society in this 
</p>
<p>country also identified implementing the convention as the main ongoing challenge. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>There was agreement among participants that in many ways the existence of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; 
</p>
<p>has been fundamental for identifying the issue of violence against women as a human rights 
</p>
<p>issue, as well as for prioritizing the development of specific legislations, mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>policies to address it. Although they agreed that the Convention has some shortcoming, 
</p>
<p>overall, several representatives highlighted the importance of having a basis for defining 
</p>
<p>what constitutes violence against women. In this sense, Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; allowed for the 
</p>
<p>creation of a framework where the power structures within male-female relationships could 
</p>
<p>be addressed. Most participants agreed with the SR that we are facing a time to start 
</p>
<p>discussing State&#180;s accountability for these pervasive human rights violations, not only 
</p>
<p>because of the normative gap that was evidenced, but also because there is a present 
</p>
<p>backlash on these issues. 
</p>
<p>A participant from Per&#250; referred to possible challenges that the initiative of a UN treaty 
</p>
<p>could face regarding budgetary allocations. She expressed doubts and asked the SR for 
</p>
<p>inputs on whether she thinks a new convention could financially debilitate CEDAW, 
</p>
<p>specially taking into account the difficulties that most human rights mechanisms currently 
</p>
<p>face from a financial perspective. The SR referred to the fact that, 24 years ago, when this 
</p>
<p>same discussion took place, many raised similar arguments regarding lack of funds, 
</p>
<p>proliferation of treaties, and possible implications for CEDAW and other mechanisms. She 
</p>
<p>noted that these three arguments are usually presented when discussing violence against 
</p>
<p>women, but not other human rights issues. While there are definitely budgetary 
</p>
<p>considerations, these concerns should not act as a deterrent. On the contrary, she stressed 
</p>
<p>the need to request States to pay their dues, and duly fund the mechanisms they create.  
</p>
<p>Participants agreed with these comments. Moreover, it was noted that similar challenges 
</p>
<p>were faced by the Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; Convention, when it was being promoted and drafted.  
</p>
<p>Participants also stated that a global convention could be an opportunity to address the 
</p>
<p>specific obligations attached to States when it comes to investigating, prosecuting and 
</p>
<p>punishing violence against women, as well as providing appropriate reparations. A 
</p>
<p>convention of this kind could also specifically identify the international obligation of States 
</p>
<p>when it comes to training all legal, judicial and police personnel that deal with the 
</p>
<p>investigation and prosecution of cases of violence against women. In this sense, there was 
</p>
<p>mention of the jurisprudential developments achieved in the Inter-American System of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, for which the Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; Convention has been an important 
</p>
<p>contribution. 
</p>
<p><b>  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>Several participants raised the question of whether political support existed for a treaty of 
</p>
<p>this nature. Some participants expressed concern over whether opening up the discussion on 
</p>
<p>a global level on the standards for preventing and addressing violence against women could 
</p>
<p>weaken some of the standards that have been achieved universally and regionally. 
</p>
<p>However, it was understood that the discussion still needs to take place, and that lower 
</p>
<p>standards could not be accepted as a result of a possible negotiation process. An interesting 
</p>
<p>point presented by several participants was that States that have promoted and ratified 
</p>
<p>regional obligations for preventing and eradicating violence against women should take an 
</p>
<p>active role in promoting a global treaty. 
</p>
<p>Most participants identified implementation and monitoring of compliance as one of the 
</p>
<p>main challenges faced regarding Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; Convention and the legal frameworks that 
</p>
<p>have been developed at the national levels to address and prevent violence against women. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, it was agreed by several participants that the discussion of a new global 
</p>
<p>treaty on prevention and eradication of violence against women must include a discussion 
</p>
<p>on the kind of monitoring and compliance mechanisms to be included in the treaty. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4

<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>Participants agreed that a new convention could create the necessary space and opportunity 
</p>
<p>to discuss the definition of violence against women; and the inclusion and recognition of 
</p>
<p>specific kinds of violence faced by women all over the world that have been invisible or not 
</p>
<p>correctly or specifically addressed in other legal frameworks. This would allow for the 
</p>
<p>study and the identification of the specific components of the obligations States have under 
</p>
<p>international law to prevent and investigate violence against women. In particular, 
</p>
<p>participants referred to the importance of addressing reproductive and obstetric violence, 
</p>
<p>violence in conflict and post-conflict situations, political harassment, killing of women, 
</p>
<p>torture, cyber-bulling, street harassment, forced displacement, and the situation of women

</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>On 10 February 2015, prior to the Inaugural Asia-Pacific Conference 
</p>
<p>on Gendered Violence &amp; Violations, UNSW Australia&#8217;s School of Social Sciences, Faculty 
</p>
<p>of Arts and Social Sciences and the Australian Human Rights Centre, Faculty of Law, with 
</p>
<p>support from the Gendered Violence Research Network, hosted a pre-conference 
</p>
<p>consultation led by Rashida Manjoo, UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, 
</p>
<p>its Causes and Consequences (SRVAW).  
</p>
<p>This invitation-only session took the form of a structured dialogue with participants from 
</p>
<p>the Asia-Pacific region on the challenges of holding states to their obligations in reducing 
</p>
<p>and preventing violence against women (VAW). The Special Rapporteur facilitated the 
</p>
<p>discussion with participants on how best to address the normative gap in international 
</p>
<p>human rights law in regards to VAW. In particular, the Special Rapporteur sought out 
</p>
<p>participants&#8217; views about the development of a legally binding international instrument and 
</p>
<p>a new monitoring body; as well as possible alternative mechanisms, such as proposing a 
</p>
<p>new optional protocol to Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women 
</p>
<p>(CEDAW).  
</p>
<p>Participants included a wide range of actors working on VAW in the Asia-Pacific region, 
</p>
<p>including representatives of government agencies, civil society organisations, international 
</p>
<p>organisations, and universities addressing a range of issues directly relevant to VAW, 
</p>
<p>including health, migration, indigenous engagement, LGBTI issues, law reform and legal 
</p>
<p>services, development and foreign aid.  
</p>
<p><b>  Key themes discussed 
</b></p>
<p><i>Accountability of states:</i> Ensuring the accountability of state actors, both as national 
</p>
<p>governments and as international donors, was a consistent theme throughout the 
</p>
<p>consultation. Whether this accountability takes the form of a new legally binding 
</p>
<p>commitment, a new optional protocol to CEDAW, or sustained advocacy by the UN and 
</p>
<p>civil society actors, there was broad agreement on the need for new engagement strategies 
</p>
<p>and/or accountability measures. There were questions raised, however, about how and 
</p>
<p>whether a new international preventative mechanism could be designed so as to be truly 
</p>
<p>independent. 
</p>
<p><i>Inclusive approach:</i> Participants emphasised the need for an inclusive understanding of 
</p>
<p>&#8216;violence against women&#8217;, and the need to consult with a broad range of actors, including </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>from the Global South, in the development of a legally binding instrument or other 
</p>
<p>mechanism. In particular, it was noted that a broader definition of &#8216;women&#8217; should be 
</p>
<p>considered, which recognises a wider spectrum of gender identities affected by specific 
</p>
<p>forms of violence. It was further noted that government representatives and civil society 
</p>
<p>actors do not necessarily speak for all survivors, and thus ensuring a broader representation 
</p>
<p>of survivor perspectives is paramount.  
</p>
<p><i>Empowerment of women:</i> There is a need to respect the agency of all women and empower 
</p>
<p>women themselves. This means that responses to VAW should avoid a narrative of rescue 
</p>
<p>or the provision of &#8216;band aid&#8217; responses. Governments can support women who experience 
</p>
<p>violence by providing adequate child care, appropriate skills training and sustainable 
</p>
<p>economic initiatives, all of which are crucial for women to be empowered to take up their 
</p>
<p>right to be active citizens. Further, there must be adequate legal assistance, including 
</p>
<p>through adequately funded legal aid and community legal centres, to support women 
</p>
<p>survivors of violence. 
</p>
<p><i>Causes of violence against women:</i> There was broad agreement on the importance of 
</p>
<p>understanding the broader contextual issues and social inequalities that cause violence 
</p>
<p>against women. It was noted that research plays an important role in this regard. However, 
</p>
<p>while prevalence studies are critical to understanding the proportion of women in a 
</p>
<p>population affected by violence, and can persuade governments to act, better understanding 
</p>
<p>the causes of VAW, as well as the various social and economic consequences, remains an 
</p>
<p>important task.  
</p>
<p><i>Intersectionality:</i> Reinforcing the need for an inclusive approach and addressing the social 
</p>
<p>and cultural aspects of VAW, there was a call to address the ways that the intersection of 
</p>
<p>gender, race, class, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and other factors impact on 
</p>
<p>the causes and consequences of VAW. This calls for multi-faceted and coordinated 
</p>
<p>government and international responses &#8211; so that causes of violence and survivor needs are 
</p>
<p>not responded to in a &#8216;silo&#8217; piecemeal manner, but recognise the need for holistic 
</p>
<p>comprehensive responses that address all intersections of the violence. 
</p>
<p><i>Developing synergies with related initiatives:</i> New legal instruments should also consider 
</p>
<p>and address the developments in other areas of international law and governance, including 
</p>
<p>for example, at the International Labour Organisation and World Health Organization. 
</p>
<p><i>Continuum of violence against women:</i> The divergence and overlap between &#8216;every day&#8217; 
</p>
<p>violence and extreme incidents of violence was of interest to participants. It is important to 
</p>
<p>acknowledge the serious consequences and harm of &#8216;low-level warfare&#8217; that women face 
</p>
<p>day-to-day, and to not view such violence as somehow less important than other forms of 
</p>
<p>more acute violence. Violence against women in all its forms has the potential to cause 
</p>
<p>severe harm. As such, it is important that time and resources are not disproportionately 
</p>
<p>devoted to some sites of harm, such as during conflict, or when violence is committed 
</p>
<p>against men and boys, even though these are also important issues.  
</p>
<p><i>Resourcing and capacity:</i> Women&#8217;s organisations must be adequately resourced and all 
</p>
<p>efforts should be made to build capacity and share experiences. In particular, concerns were 
</p>
<p>raised about the capacity of advocacy groups and community legal centres to report to 
</p>
<p>national and international mechanisms, given persistent funding cuts. Any new binding 
</p>
<p>institution or mechanism should be designed with due consideration given to ensuring that 
</p>
<p>it was adequately resourced, but also to facilitate pathways for participation of non-
</p>
<p>government and women&#8217;s organisations that may want to report to or engage with it. 
</p>
<p><b>  Specific questions and comments 
</b></p>
<p>1. Will States sign on to a treaty that they don&#8217;t think they can achieve. For example, 
</p>
<p>would states commit to zero VAW, or would the aim be for a reduction in VAW? What </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>will happen in post-2015: will we develop a target? Should we be aiming for zero violence 
</p>
<p>in 15 years? A target of a 10% reduction in VAW may attract support. Have prevalence 
</p>
<p>studies on VAW contributed to governments taking action against VAW?  
</p>
<p>2. What is the link between the independent monitoring system and a systemic due 
</p>
<p>diligence model of prevention and intervention? Need to emphasise the importance of an 
</p>
<p>independent monitoring body, which receives information from government and non-
</p>
<p>government sources. 
</p>
<p>3. How will the proposed accountability framework operate? How will the treaty be 
</p>
<p>executed? What would be some of the outcomes? 
</p>
<p>4. From a community organisation perspective, when thinking about domestic legal 
</p>
<p>tools, you need a clear articulation of the legal standard. A treaty on VAW would therefore 
</p>
<p>be of value, particularly in holding governments to account. Such a treaty would be 
</p>
<p>something much clearer to point to from an advocacy perspective and help provide - at the 
</p>
<p>federal level - an understanding of that there is state responsibility. There is a 
</p>
<p>disfranchisement of the human rights community with the current system, and rather than 
</p>
<p>look at different spaces to find relevant tools, a treaty on VAW would be a powerful and 
</p>
<p>useful instrument for advocates and activists working in this area.  
</p>
<p>5. Monitoring by international mechanisms: Should we be waiting five years for an 
</p>
<p>independent monitoring for our domestic plans? What constitutes independence for a 
</p>
<p>monitoring mechanism? How would an international mechanism operate in a federal 
</p>
<p>structure, such as in Australia?  
</p>
<p>6. To what extent, or at what point do we acknowledge donor interventions that mask 
</p>
<p>states&#8217; failure? In some countries, significant sums of money are being funneled to 
</p>
<p>programs, which are being implemented, but to what extent are they masking the state&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>complete failure to do anything about violence against women? In addition, are we also 
</p>
<p>silencing local leaders who develop a reliance on external funders? 
</p>
<p>7. What sort of instrument(s) would be required to address VAW? Would there be a 
</p>
<p>mix of prevention and addressing impunity? And when thinking about impunity, would it 
</p>
<p>be through a lens of criminalisation or behaviour change? 
</p>
<p>8. There is a need for understanding the importance of legal standards on VAW and the 
</p>
<p>ability to enforce those standards.  
</p>
<p>9. The issue of raising awareness globally merits thinking about. What can the UN do 
</p>
<p>to ensure that these women know about the resolutions and treaties? Also, most ministers 
</p>
<p>and government representatives are men, whose attitudes to women&#8217;s rights are heavily 
</p>
<p>compromised, and who do not understand the content of the resolutions. As a result, many 
</p>
<p>countries lack the resources and time to comply with the resolutions. What is the role of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights organisations in advocating for a legal framework on VAW? There is a 
</p>
<p>need for a legal framework, but women must be aware of this legal framework in order to 
</p>
<p>seek accountability for VAW.   
</p>
<p>10. How would the Special Rapporteur balance her views of accountability, 
</p>
<p>empowerment and social transformation in a treaty?  
</p>
<p>11. How will the &#8216;causes of violence&#8217; issue be addressed in a treaty / optional protocol? 
</p>
<p>12. There are further normative gaps in relation to the definition of &#8216;women&#8217;. Does it 
</p>
<p>include culturally specific genders such as sister-girls, for example? Sister-girls make up 
</p>
<p>10% of people in the Tiwi islands. Fa'afafine in Polynesia or Hijra in South Asia are also 
</p>
<p>important categories of gender in the region. There is an ethno-centrism in existing 
</p>
<p>declarations/treaties. Will it take into account the sterilisation of intersex people? FGM is 
</p>
<p>illegal in some countries, but if a person is born with intersex physical characteristics, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>medical intervention is needed &#8211; would this be considered a legal intervention? Are other 
</p>
<p>gender identities of women and men that need to be taken into consideration? People with 
</p>
<p>non-binary gender identity and people with intersex characteristics are often excluded 
</p>
<p>and/or discriminated against. Thus there are normative gaps within the normative gaps.  
</p>
<p>13. It was argued that some domestic programs to redress Indigenous disadvantage is 
</p>
<p>not designed or implemented in a gendered way, and thus ignores the role of VAW in 
</p>
<p>driving inequalities in Indigenous communities. How will &#8216;gender&#8217; be addressed in any new 
</p>
<p>instrument, considering the shift to gender neutrality?  
</p>
<p>14. Another frequently discussed concept at the moment is the International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organisation social protection floor recommendation. This is a very un-gendered document 
</p>
<p>but the idea of social protection is an interesting one to think about in relation to VAW and 
</p>
<p>how we can link issues of poverty to broader social security. Violence is very rarely part of 
</p>
<p>that social understanding of a right to social security. 
</p>
<p>15. The issue of ending conflict-related sexual violence has really taken off in the last 
</p>
<p>few years, as was evident in the 2014 London Summit, for example. This raises political 
</p>
<p>issues in the UN Security Council and other forums. Are the issues of &#8220;everyday&#8221; VAW 
</p>
<p>and conflict-related sexual violence seen as in tension with each other, or interconnected?   
</p>
<p>16. What is the connection between the growing inequalities globally (North/South for 
</p>
<p>example) and human rights violations? Participants also asked whether some privileged 
</p>
<p>actors took a &#8220;moralising&#8221; position in regards to VAW, without recognising issues of 
</p>
<p>inequality.  
</p>
<p><b>  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>In conclusion, the participants were appreciative of the Special Rapporteur for ensuring the 
</p>
<p>regional engagement on this important discussion. They were supportive of efforts to 
</p>
<p>ensure greater accountability by states in preventing and responding to VAW, including 
</p>
<p>through a new international treaty or other mechanism. Questions were raised on whether a 
</p>
<p>new human rights instrument focusing specifically on VAW and/or a new optional protocol 
</p>
<p>for CEDAW, which addresses many of these contextual issues, would be complementary or 
</p>
<p>competing instruments. In addition, there were concerns that a new international treaty 
</p>
<p>could potentially weaken CEDAW and erase important gains that have been made over the 
</p>
<p>years. The participants indicated strong interest in being kept informed of progress on this 
</p>
<p>discussion.

<p><b>to Address Normative Gaps in Legal Frameworks on Violence Against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>Around the globe, violence against women is an epidemic. Violence robs women and girls 
</p>
<p>of their full potential and causes untold human suffering. Violence against women impedes 
</p>
<p>economic development, threatens peace and prosperity, and inhibits full participation in 
</p>
<p>civic life. For every woman who has been beaten in her own home, for the millions of 
</p>
<p>women who have been raped as a weapon of war, for every girl who has been attacked on 
</p>
<p>her way to school, for all of the children&#8211;girls and boys&#8211;who have witnessed this brutality, 
</p>
<p>we must do better. (Vice President Joe Biden, Statement on the Anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, November 24, 2010). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/27/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>The International Violence Against Women Act (I-VAWA)21 has been introduced in the 
</p>
<p>United States Congress multiple times since 2007 but has never been passed into law. It 
</p>
<p>will be reintroduced in the 114th Congress during 2015. I-VAWA provides: It is the policy 
</p>
<p>of the United States . . . to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts to prevent and 
</p>
<p>respond to violence against women and girls internationally into United States foreign 
</p>
<p>policy and foreign assistance programs. If adopted and appropriately implemented, I-
</p>
<p>VAWA could profoundly influence efforts to address normative gaps in legal frameworks 
</p>
<p>on violence against women around the globe by tying US government policy and foreign 
</p>
<p>aid to legal reform and essential services for victims of violence. I-VAWA enumerates a 
</p>
<p>panoply of findings on violence against women, regarding the prevalence of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence and domestic violence, heightened risk of violence for women with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>displaced and refugee women, women in conflict and natural disasters, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, and susceptibility to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>I-VAWA creates a permanent Office of Global Women&#8217;s Issues in the Department of State, 
</p>
<p>headed by an Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women&#8217;s Issues.22 The Ambassador-at-
</p>
<p>Large: Shall direct activities, policies, programs, and funding relating to gender equality 
</p>
<p>and the advancement of women and girls internationally, including those intended to 
</p>
<p>prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.23 The duties of the Ambassador-
</p>
<p>at-Large also include promoting and advancing gender analysis into the programs of the 
</p>
<p>Department of State and other federal agencies; directing US government resources; 
</p>
<p>carrying out activities regarding prevention and response; conducting regular consultations 
</p>
<p>with civil society; requiring rigorous monitoring and evaluation of programs; serving as the 
</p>
<p>principle advisor to the Secretary of State on violence against women and girls as a foreign 
</p>
<p>policy matter; and representing the US in diplomatic and multi-lateral fora.24 Thus, I-
</p>
<p>VAWA gives the Ambassador-at-Large the authority to set policy that could condition 
</p>
<p>funding and other foreign policy decisions on adoption of best practices. I-VAWA also 
</p>
<p>creates a Senior Coordinator for Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s Empowerment in the US 
</p>
<p>Agency for International Development (USAID) with duties similar to those of the 
</p>
<p>Ambassador-at-Large.25  
</p>
<p>I-VAWA directs the US government to create a comprehensive five-year strategy to reduce 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls in at least five low-income and lower-middle income 
</p>
<p>countries where the problem is especially severe.26 Assistance to the selected countries must 
</p>
<p>include at least two of five identified activities, one of which is &#8220;development and 
</p>
<p>enforcement of civil and criminal legal and judicial sanctions, protections, trainings, and 
</p>
<p>capacity.&#8221;27 At least ten percent of assistance funding must be provided to community-
</p>
<p>based nongovernmental organizations, with priority given to organizations led by women.28 
</p>
<p>This program could be an instrument for requiring participating countries to address gaps in 
</p>
<p>their civil and criminal legal frameworks on violence against women.

<p><b>  Current Developments 
</b></p>
<p>Although I-VAWA has not been passed into law, the Obama administration is nevertheless 
</p>
<p>carrying out some of the activities set forth in I-VAWA. Catherine M. Russell was 
</p>
<p>appointed Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women&#8217;s Issues in 2013. Despite the fact that I-
</p>
<p>VAWA is not yet law, the Secretary's Office of Global Women's Issues, headed by 
</p>
<p>Ambassador Russell, &#8220;seeks to ensure that women&#8217;s issues are fully integrated in the 
</p>
<p>formulation and conduct of U.S. foreign policy. The Office works to promote stability, 
</p>
<p>peace, and development by empowering women politically, socially, and economically 
</p>
<p>around the world.&#8221;29 Likewise, Susan Markham was appointed Senior Coordinator for 
</p>
<p>Gender Equality and Women&#8217;s Empowerment for USAID. USAID programs support 
</p>
<p>prevention and response to gender-based violence by: addressing the root causes of 
</p>
<p>violence; improving prevention and protection services; responding to the health and 
</p>
<p>economic needs of those affected by gender-based violence; supporting legislation and its 
</p>
<p>enforcement against gender-based violence.30 
</p>
<p>President Obama issued an executive order, Preventing and Responding to Violence 
</p>
<p>Against Women and Girls Globally, on August 10, 2012. Based on that order, the 
</p>
<p>administration released <i>The United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-
</i></p>
<p><i>Based Violence Globally</i> (the <i>Strategy).</i>31 The <i>Strategy</i> not only provides insight into how 
</p>
<p>the current administration might implement I-VAWA if it were to become law, it indicates 
</p>
<p>that I-VAWA may already be the <i>de facto </i>policy and practice of the US government.  
</p>
<p>However, because I-VAWA has not been passed into law, the policy may not extend 
</p>
<p>beyond the current administration. In fact, the <i>Strategy </i>is scheduled to expire in August 
</p>
<p>2015. Therefore, its potential for influencing normative gaps in the legal frameworks of 
</p>
<p>other countries is likewise limited.  
</p>
<p>The objectives of the<i> Strategy, </i>a joint undertaking of the Department of State and USAID, 
</p>
<p>for prevention and response efforts with regard to gender-based violence, are: to increase 
</p>
<p>coordination among US government agencies and with other stakeholders; to enhance 
</p>
<p>integration into existing US government work; to improve collection, analysis, and use of 
</p>
<p>data and research to enhance prevention and response efforts; to enhance or expand US 
</p>
<p>government programming.32 The guiding principles of the <i>Strategy</i>, consistent with human 
</p>
<p>rights principles, are prevention, protection and accountability.33 The identified activities 
</p>
<p>encompass both a humanitarian and a human rights focus. According to the <i>Strategy</i>, 
</p>
<p>diplomatic focus and foreign aid directed at gender-based violence has increased since the 
</p>
<p>1990&#8217;s due in part to the use of rape as a tactic of war. The scope of the US government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>attention to gender-based violence has expanded beyond providing services to survivors to 
</p>
<p>more comprehensive programming that focuses on prevention.34 For 2013, the Department 
</p>
<p>of State and USAID requested $147.1 million for programs addressing gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence worldwide. Over half of the request was allocated to Global Health Programs.35

<p>The <i>Strategy</i> describes how several bureaus and offices within the Department of State 
</p>
<p>currently address gender-based violence. For example, the Office of Global Criminal 
</p>
<p>Justice addresses the issue of accountability as a deterrent. The Bureau of Democracy, 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and Labor funds programs that build capacity to investigate and prosecute 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence cases, provide legal and psychological resources to victims, and 
</p>
<p>educate communities. The bureau also supports the media and civil society to monitor and 
</p>
<p>report on cases of gender-based violence.36 Among the new initiatives identified in the 
</p>
<p><i>Strategy, </i>perhaps most relevant to addressing normative gaps is the following plan of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary&#8217;s International Fund for Women and Girls and the Secretary&#8217;s Office of Global 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Issues to: Advocate for development and implementation of laws and policies in 
</p>
<p>other countries to monitor, prevent, and respond to gender-based violence. This includes 
</p>
<p>work to strengthen institutions and support partner governments&#8217; efforts to develop 
</p>
<p>appropriate legislation, harmonize laws and other provisions in the legal code, develop 
</p>
<p>action plans for implementation and help train oversight of and advocacy for 
</p>
<p>implementation of the laws.37 
</p>
<p>Although the Strategy&#8217;s description of USAID&#8217;s commitment to addressing gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence does not explicitly reference normative gaps in legal frameworks, some of its 
</p>
<p>programs may have that effect. Notably, among the agency&#8217;s measures of success will be 
</p>
<p>&#8220;number of laws, policies, or procedures drafted, proposed, or adopted&#8221; with United States 
</p>
<p>government assistance aimed at improving prevention or response to gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>at the regional, national or local level.38 As currently drafted, I-VAWA does not include 
</p>
<p>specific standards for legal reform. It contains only broad outlines for integrating a response 
</p>
<p>to violence against women into US foreign policy. By comparison, the Istanbul 
</p>
<p>Convention,39 the most recent regional legal standard on violence against women, supplies 
</p>
<p>a comprehensive framework, policies and measures for preventing domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>protecting victims and holding offenders accountable.40 Thus, while I-VAWA has the 
</p>
<p>potential to influence governments to address normative gaps on violence against women, it 
</p>
<p>must do so through its implementation.  
</p>
<p>Likewise, unlike the United States&#8217; Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), I-VAWA does 
</p>
<p>not create specific criteria for receipt of US government funding. VAWA, which funds 
</p>
<p>violence against women in programs in the United States, requires that states, local 
</p>
<p>governments and advocacy coalitions comply with many best practices to receive 
</p>
<p>government grants. For example, recipients of one type of VAWA funding must develop 
</p>
<p>and promote legislation and policies that enhance best practices for responding to domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.41 Although the current I-VAWA 
</p>
<p>draft does not include such specific language, it contains the basis for creating such 
</p>
<p>requirements through the Office of Global Women&#8217;s Issues. In the United States, successful 
</p>
<p>change has resulted due to the federal law imposing conditions for the receipt of funds, 
</p>
<p>including upon adopting best practices and requiring criminal justice agencies to 
</p>
<p>collaborate with NGO service providers. This has changed the way the criminal justice

<p>specific legislative changes, where necessary, including providing adequate civil remedies for victims

<p>(Art. 29); and outlawing forced marriage (Art. 37), psychological violence (Art. 33), stalking (Art.

<p>system operates in addressing violence against women. The meaningful collaborations that 
</p>
<p>resulted from the requirements for VAWA funding have lasted long after the grants ended. 
</p>
<p>I-VAWA could incorporate such requirements through its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>The United States has the potential take a leadership role in addressing normative 
</b></p>
<p><b>gaps in legal frameworks on violence against women around the world. It has the 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources to do so and I-VAWA provides an obvious mechanism for carrying out such 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership. However, to realize that potential the United States will have to muster the 
</b></p>
<p><b>political will to pass I-VAWA. Once passed, it must establish specific standards based 
</b></p>
<p><b>on recognized best practices for addressing violence against women and require 
</b></p>
<p><b>international partners to adopt and implement best practices to receive foreign aid. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Istanbul Convention can serve as a model for establishing a framework of 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and VAWA can serve as a model for requiring implementation of best 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices in return for funding.
