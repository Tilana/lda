<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">This prospectus is part of a registration statement
on Form S-3 that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(&#147;SEC&#148;), using a &#147;shelf&#148; registration process. We have filed
the registration statement for this shelf registration process pursuant to a 
registration rights agreement dated April&nbsp;8, 2015, between us and the 
selling
unitholders. Under this shelf registration process, the selling unitholders may,
from time to time, sell up to 59,368,399 Series B Preferred Units that we have 
issued, or may issue as payment in kind, to the selling unitholders and up to
59,368,399
common units that we have issued, or may issue, upon conversion of the Series B 
Preferred Units. The initial conversion ratio is one Series&nbsp;B Preferred 
Unit in exchange for one common unit; however, the conversion ratio is subject 
to
adjustment. Each time a selling unitholder sells securities, the selling 
unitholder may be required to provide you with this prospectus and, in certain 
cases, a supplement to this prospectus containing specific information about the
selling
unitholder and the terms of the securities being offered. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

treatment of the
holders of Series B Preferred Units as partners for tax purposes is uncertain. 
The IRS may disagree with our treatment of the Series B Preferred Units as 
equity for tax purposes, and no assurance can be given that our treatment will 
be sustained. If
the IRS were to successfully characterize the Series B Preferred Units as 
indebtedness for tax purposes, certain holders of Series B Preferred Units may 
be subject to additional withholding and reporting requirements (please read

Units as partners for tax purposes and will treat distributions on the Series B 
Preferred Units
as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will generally be taxable to
the holders of Series B Preferred Units as ordinary income. To the extent that 
the Partnership pays such distributions in PIK Units or a combination of PIK 
Units and
cash, the distribution of PIK Units will be treated as a cash distribution to 
the holders of Series B Preferred Units followed by a cash contribution to the 
Partnership in exchange for the newly issued PIK Units. As such, the holders of 
Series B
Preferred Units could recognize taxable income in excess of, or in the absence 
of, a contemporaneous cash distribution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

of Series B Preferred Units could recognize taxable income from the accrual of a
guaranteed payment in the absence of a contemporaneous distribution of cash or 
PIK Units, the partnership anticipates accruing and making the guaranteed

distributions monthly. Otherwise, the holders of Series B Preferred Units are 
generally neither anticipated to share in our items of income, gain, loss or 
deduction, nor be allocated any share of our nonrecourse liabilities. If the 
Series B
Preferred Units were treated as indebtedness for tax purposes, rather than as 
guaranteed payments for the use of capital, distributions likely would be 
treated as payments of interest by us to the holders of Series B Preferred 
Units. </P>

foreign ownership of stock in a parent corporation organized under the laws of

Eligible Holder means: (1)&nbsp;a citizen of the United States; (2)&nbsp;a 
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or of any state 
thereof; or (3)&nbsp;an
association of U.S. citizens, such as a partnership or limited liability

but only if such association does not have any direct or indirect foreign 
ownership, other than
foreign ownership of stock in a parent corporation organized under the laws of 
the United States or of any state thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, onshore 
mineral leases or any direct or indirect interest therein may be acquired and 
held by
aliens only through stock ownership, holding or control in a corporation 
organized under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof and only 
for so long as the alien is not from a country that the U.S. federal government 
regards as
denying similar privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States.

of the
limited partnership, other than liabilities to partners on account of their 
partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is 
limited to specific property of the partnership, would exceed the fair value of 
the assets of
the limited partnership. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the 
assets of a limited partnership, the Delaware Act provides that the fair value 
of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited 
shall be
included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the 
fair value of that property exceeds the nonrecourse liability. The Delaware Act 
provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time
of the
distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Delaware Act shall be
liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three 
years. Under the Delaware Act, unless otherwise provided in our partnership 
agreement, a
substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the 
obligations of such limited partner&#146;s assignor to make contributions to the
Partnership, except that such person is not obligated for liabilities unknown to
him or her at
the time such person became a limited partner and that could not be ascertained 
from the partnership agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

Preferred
Units and prospective common unitholders and is based upon current provisions of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), 
existing and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations thereunder (the &#147;Treasury
Regulations&#148;), and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all 
of which are subject to change. Changes in these authorities may cause the 
federal income tax consequences to a prospective unitholder to vary 
substantially from those
described below, possibly on a retroactive basis. Unless the context otherwise

section, unless otherwise noted, are the opinion of Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins 
L.L.P. insofar
as they related to matters of U.S. federal income tax law and are based on the 
accuracy of representations made by us to them for this purpose. However, this 
section does not address all federal income tax matters that affect us, the 
holders of our
Series B Preferred Units, or our common unitholders and does not describe the 
application of the alternative minimum tax that may be applicable to certain 
unitholders. Furthermore, this section focuses on unitholders who are individual
citizens or
residents of the United States (for federal income tax purposes), who have the 
U.S. dollar as their functional currency, who use the calendar year as their 
taxable year, and who hold units as capital assets (generally, property that is 
held for
investment). This section has limited applicability to corporations, 
partnerships, entities treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes, 
estates, trusts, non-resident aliens or other unitholders subject to specialized
tax treatment, such
as tax-exempt institutions, non-U.S. persons, individual retirement accounts 
(&#147;IRAs&#148;), employee benefit plans, real estate investment trusts or 
mutual funds. <B><I>Accordingly, we encourage each unitholder to consult such 
unitholder&#146;s
own tax advisor in analyzing the federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax 
consequences that are particular to that unitholder resulting from ownership or 
disposition of its units and potential changes in applicable tax laws.

Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) regarding any matter affecting 
us. Instead, we
are relying on opinions and advice of Vinson&nbsp;&amp; Elkins L.L.P. with 
respect to the matters described herein. Unlike a ruling, an opinion of counsel 
represents only that counsel&#146;s best legal judgment and does not bind the 
IRS or a court.
Accordingly, the opinions and statements made herein may not be sustained by a 
court if contested by the IRS. Any such contest of the matters described herein 
may materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the prices at 
which such
units trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne 
indirectly by our unitholders because the costs will reduce our cash available 
for distribution. Furthermore, the tax consequences of an investment in us may 
be
significantly modified by future legislative or administrative changes or court 
decisions, which may be retroactively applied. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt;

short seller to cover a short sale of units) (please read &#147;&#151; Tax

(4)&nbsp;whether percentage depletion will be available to a unitholder or the 
extent of the

includes income and gains derived from the exploration, development, mining or

than from a financial business), dividends, gains from the sale of real property
and gains from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the

guaranteed

Partnership has issued or may issue as payment in kind to the selling

rights agreement with the
selling unitholders relating to the registered resale of (1)&nbsp;up to 
59,368,399 Series B Preferred Units, including 46,666,666 Series B Preferred 
Units that the Partnership originally issued to the selling unitholders listed 
in this prospectus on
April&nbsp;8, 2015 and up to 12,701,733 Series B Preferred Units that the 
Partnership has issued or may issue as payment in kind to the selling 
unitholders, and (2)&nbsp;up to 59,368,399 common units issuable upon conversion
of the Series B
Preferred Units. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, the Partnership 
is required to file or cause to be filed a registration statement for such 
registered resale within 75 days following April&nbsp;8, 2015 and is required to
cause the
registration statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable 
thereafter but in no event later than 180 days after April&nbsp;8, 2015. In 
certain circumstances, the selling unitholders will have piggyback registration 
rights and
rights to request an underwritten offering as described in the registration 
rights agreement. A selling unitholder will cease to have registration rights 
under the registration rights agreement on the later of the fifth anniversary of
April&nbsp;8,
2015 and the date on which the selling unitholder holds Registrable Securities 
(as defined in the registration rights agreement) that represent less than $30 
million of Registrable Securities.&nbsp;The rights to cause the Partnership to 
include
Registrable Securities in this registration statement may not be transferred or 
assigned by any selling unitholder except as provided in the definitions of 
Anchorage Holder, EIG Holder and Guggenheim Holder (each as defined in the 
registration
rights agreement) <I>provided</I> that (a)&nbsp;the Partnership is given written
notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of
each such transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which such
registration rights are being transferred or assigned and (b)&nbsp;each such 
transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the 
obligations of such selling unitholder under the registration rights 
agreement.<I> </I></P>

font-family:Times New Roman">The following table sets forth information about 
the maximum number of Series B Preferred Units and common units that may be 
offered from time
to time by each selling unitholder under this prospectus. The selling 
unitholders identified below may currently hold or acquire at any time common 
units in addition to those registered hereby. In addition, the selling 
unitholders identified below
may sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of some or all of their Series B
Preferred Units and common units in private placement transactions exempt from 
or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 
Accordingly, we
cannot give an estimate as to the number of Series B Preferred Units and common 
units that will be held by the selling unitholders upon termination of this 
offering. Information concerning the selling unitholders may change from time to
time and, if
necessary, we will supplement this prospectus accordingly. </P> <P

paragraph, none of the
selling unitholders has, or has had within the past three years, any position,

Representation and
Standstill Agreement, dated April&nbsp;8, 2015, among us, our general partner 
and the EIG Redwood Equity Aggregator, LP (&#147;EIG Equity&#148;), EIG

observer capacity, to attend all meetings of the full board of directors of our 
general partner (and meetings of committees thereof), subject to certain 
exceptions, described
in the Board Representation and Standstill Agreement. Because each selling 
unitholder may sell all or a portion of the Series B Preferred Units or common 
units registered hereby, we cannot currently estimate the number or percentage 
of Series B
Preferred Units or common units that each selling unitholder will hold upon 
completion of the applicable offering. </P>

applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan&#146;s annual report

the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities
Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for 
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the 
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling 
person of the
registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is 
asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the 
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its 
counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of 
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is 
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be

adjudication of such issue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;
