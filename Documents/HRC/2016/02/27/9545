</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of the Russian Federation and in the pursuance of 
his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance visited Moscow and Saint Petersburg from 12 to 
17 June 2006. The purpose of the mission was to gather first-hand information on the situation of 
racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia in the country, in particular in the light of the 
information from national and international NGOs and the media indicating the existence of an 
alarming trend of racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concluded that while there is no State policy of racism in the 
Russian Federation, the Russian society is facing an alarming trend of racism and xenophobia, 
the most striking manifestations of which are the increasing number of racially motivated crimes 
and attacks, including by neo-Nazi groups, particularly against people of non-Slav appearance 
originating from the Caucasus, Africa, Asia or the Arab world; the growing level of violence 
with which some of these attacks are carried out, resulting in some cases in the death of the 
victim; the extension of this violence to human rights defenders, intellectuals and students 
engaged in the combat against racism; the climate of relative impunity that the perpetrators of 
such acts enjoy from law enforcement agents, despite a substantial increase, in recent months, of 
prosecutions and convictions for acts including racial hatred or enmity as a motivating factor; the 
rise of anti-Semitism as well as other forms of religious intolerance, in particular against 
Muslims; the existence and the increasing importance of political parties with racist and 
xenophobic platforms; and the virtual correspondence of the social, economic and political 
marginalization with the mapping of ethnic minorities and other discriminated groups in the 
Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p> The alarming rise of racist and xenophobic violence is linked to two fundamental trends in 
the Russian society. On the one hand, the ideological ground of the rise of this violence is rooted 
in the ethnic interpretation, by neo-Nazi and extremist groups and some political parties, of the 
political nationalism promoted by the Russian authorities to fill the ideological void of socialism 
and internationalism left by the collapse of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the deep social 
and economic crisis of the Russian society has nourished the political instrumentalization of the 
ideology of nationalism and promoted a culture of xenophobia and racism in the growing 
marginalized groups of the society. In this context, the dominant security approach to 
immigration and the growing association between ethnic and religious minorities and 
criminality, justified by &#8220;the combat against terrorism&#8221;, are giving legitimacy to the rhetoric and 
violence of racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates a number of recommendations, including the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The official and formal recognition of the existence of racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia and the expression of the political will to combat it. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The adoption of a Federal Plan of Action to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, designed in consultation and with the participation 
of all actors concerned, including democratic political parties, independent human rights 
organizations and communities concerned. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of an independent institution aiming at the promotion and protection 
of human rights and the combat against all forms of discrimination with a particular 
emphasis on racial discrimination and xenophobia and including discrimination on 
grounds of religion, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, residence, gender, age, disability 
and sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The adoption, in parallel to the legal strategy, of a cultural and ethical strategy aimed at 
uprooting the roots of the culture and mentality of racism and xenophobia and 
promoting the construction of a democratic, equalitarian and interactive 
multiculturalism. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur visited the Russian Federation 
(Moscow and St. Petersburg) from 12 to 17 June 2006. At governmental level, he held meetings 
with the Deputy Director of the Department of Humanitarian Cooperation and Human Rights of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the first Deputy of the Ministry of Justice, several directors of 
the Ministry of Interior, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Regional Development and the 
Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health and Social Development. The Special Rapporteur also 
met with the President of the Supreme Court, the Deputy Prosecutor-General, the Chairperson 
of the Presidential Council on assistance to the development of civil society structures and 
human rights and the Federal Commissioner for Human Rights of the Russian Federation. In 
addition, he met, in Moscow, with the Governor of the city and other local personalities and, in 
St. Petersburg, with the Vice-Governor, the Prosecutor and other local officials. 
</p>
<p>2. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of civil society organizations 
active in the combat against racism and xenophobia, communities and groups victims of racism 
and racial discrimination, a high-level representative of the Department of External Affairs of the 
Russian Orthodox Church, United Nations officials, members of the diplomatic community, 
intellectuals and the press. He also visited a Kelderary Roma community in the village of Peri, in 
the Leningrad region. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Russian Government for its cooperation 
throughout the visit. He also thanks the representatives of non-governmental organizations for 
their precious cooperation, and the United Nations Country Team in Moscow, in particular the 
staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), for its outstanding 
support. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Demographic, ethnic and religious composition 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Russian Federation, one of the largest multi-ethnic and multiconfessional States 
in the world, comprises more than 170 different ethnic groups and nationalities. According 
to the 2002 census, its population is estimated at 145 million, the largest ethnic groups 
being Russians (79.83 per cent), Tatars (3.83 per cent), Ukrainians (2.03 per cent), 
Bashkirs (1.15 per cent), Chuvashs (1.13 per cent), Chechens (0.94 per cent) and 
Armenians (0.78 per cent). 
</p>
<p>5. Russia&#8217;s demographic structure has over time experienced gradual emigration and 
immigration flows. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on the one hand, Russia has 
experienced the arrival of immigrants from former Soviet republics in search of work and better 
living conditions, notably from Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
Ukraine and Georgia; on the other, an important number of people from former Soviet 
republics having long or permanently lived in Russia but only having old Soviet passports 
are being considered as illegal migrants. According to the Ministry of Interior, there are 
around 500,000 legal migrants and between 5 and 15 million undocumented migrants in Russia. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>6. Seventy-five million Russians currently identify themselves as Orthodox, mainly for 
cultural reasons, though the Russian Orthodox Church was the target of persecution by the 
secular Communist government. The second most important religion is Islam - professed by 
about 20 million people - followed by Roman Catholicism - with approximately 1.3 million 
followers - Judaism - between 400,000 and 550,000 followers - and Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses - with 
about 131,000 members. To a smaller degree, Buddhism and Hinduism are also practised in the 
country. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Historical and social context 
</b></p>
<p>7. The former Soviet Union constituted a vast territory composed of a very wide range of 
ethnicities and cultures inherited from the former Tsarist Empire, including different nationalities 
of the Caucasus and Central Asia, which moved and intermingled throughout the Soviet territory. 
Despite this configuration, the Soviet policy on nationalities carried a mixed message that 
celebrated nationalities and cultures as part of the diverse heritage of the Soviet empire - well 
illustrated by the principles of &#8220;internationalism&#8221; and &#8220;friendship among peoples&#8221; - while at the 
same time discouraged ethnic nationalism and repressed minority nationalist impulses through 
deportation and displacement of ethnic and national minorities.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 was accompanied by the collapse of the 
Communist ideology that had reigned for more than seven decades. This, together with the 
opening to globalization and a sharp increase in economic and social inequalities, led to the 
emergence of an ideological void, increasingly accompanied by a mounting nationalism, which 
has gained force in recent years. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The legal system 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Russian Federation is party to six of the seven major international human rights 
instruments, including the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its First Optional Protocol, 
the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).<b>2</b> Russia has not signed or ratified 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Deportation on ethnic grounds took place from the mid-1930s until 1950. In 1943-1944, 
</p>
<p>approximately 1 million people - Chechens, Ingush, Karachai, Balkars, Kalmyks, Meskhetian 
Turks and Crimean Tatars - were removed from the North Caucasus and Crimea and resettled in 
Kazakhstan and Central Asia, mostly charged with treason for collaborating with German 
occupiers. In 1941-1942, over 1 million ethnic Germans were also deported from the Volga 
region, Ukraine, North Caucasus and other regions to Siberia and Kazakhstan. 
<b>2
</b>  The Russian Federation is also party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC). Moreover, the Russian Federation has ratified the Optional Protocol to CEDAW 
and signed the Optional Protocol to CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights on the abolition of the death penalty, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography. Russia is also signatory of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Framework Convention on 
the Protection of National Minorities. 
</p>
<p>10. The 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation establishes the principle of equality 
before the law, determines the State&#8217;s responsibility in guaranteeing the equality of rights and 
liberties regardless of sex, race, nationality, language, origin, property or employment status, 
residence, attitude to religion, convictions, membership of public associations or any other 
circumstance (art. 19) and recognizes the right to freedom of religious worship (art. 28). It also 
establishes that foreign citizens and stateless persons shall enjoy the rights of the citizens of the 
Russian Federation and bear their duties, with the exception of cases stipulated by the Federal 
law or international treaties (art. 62). 
</p>
<p>11. Issues of citizenship and legal status of foreigners in the Russian Federation are regulated 
by specific laws, in particular, the 2002 federal laws on Russian Citizenship - which replaced the 
Law on Citizenship of the Russian Federation of 1991 - and on the Legal Status of Foreign 
Citizens in the Russian Federation - which replaced the Law on the Legal Status of Foreign 
Citizens of the Soviet Union of 1981. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The political and administrative structure 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Russian Federation is a federal presidential republic. The Russian President is the head 
of State and of a pluriform multiparty system, with executive power exercised by the 
Government, headed by a Prime Minister appointed by the President with the Parliament&#8217;s 
approval. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Federal Assembly of the 
Russian Federation: the Federation Council, with the authority to review and force compromise 
on legislation, and the State Duma, with the role of primary consideration of all legislation. The 
judiciary branch is a three court level system, with a Supreme Court as the highest court of 
appeal, a Constitutional Court with the power to decide on the constitutionality of laws and the 
conflicts of competence among State bodies, and the Superior Court for Arbitration. 
</p>
<p>13. The Russian Federation is administratively divided into 88 federal subjects, 21 republics, 
48 provinces (oblasts), 7 territories (krais), 9 autonomous districts (okrugs), 1 autonomous 
oblast, 2 federal cities (Moscow and St. Petersburg) and 7 large federal districts. All of those 
entities have a multi-ethnic composition. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur addressed the three following main questions to all his 
interlocutors: (1) Is there racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in 
the Russian Federation? (2) If this is the case, which are their manifestations and expressions? 
(3) What are the governmental policies and programmes to fight these phenomena at the 
political, legal and cultural levels? In the following sections, the Special Rapporteur exposes the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>main policies and programmes reported to him by the Federal and local authorities (section II) 
and the issues and concerns presented by the civil society and communities concerned 
(section III). Thereafter, the Special Rapporteur presents his assessment and analysis of the state 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the Russian Federation 
(section IV) and concludes with his recommendations (section V). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The legal framework to combat racism and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the view of most governmental officials, the Russian legal framework contains a wide 
range of instruments which provide a very solid and comprehensive basis to combat 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>16. The 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation, in addition to the above-mentioned 
provision outlawing discrimination on the grounds of social, racial, linguistic or religious 
grounds (art. 19), prohibits the establishment of associations and the use of propaganda or 
campaigns aiming at the incitement of social, racial, national and religious strife (arts. 13 (5) 
and 29 (2)). 
</p>
<p>17. The 1997 Criminal Code establishes the general principle that motives of national, racial or 
religious hatred or enmity constitute an aggravating circumstance leading to an increase in the 
severity of the penalty (art. 63 (1)). Specific provisions in this regard are found in the case of 
murder (art. 105), intentional infliction of bodily harm - whether grave (art. 111) or moderate 
(art. 112) - and infliction of physical or mental suffering (art. 117). Following an amendment 
made in 2003, the Code makes explicit reference to the prohibition of discrimination, defined as 
violations of rights, freedoms and lawful interests of individuals and citizens on the basis of 
gender, race, ethnicity, language, origin, residence or religion (art. 136). Particularly relevant is 
the prohibition of actions committed in public or through the use of mass media aiming at the 
incitement of national, racial or religious enmity, abasement of human dignity or propagating 
exclusion, superiority or inferiority of citizens on national, racial or religious grounds (art. 282). 
This provision was amended by the Federal Act on Counteracting Extremist Activities by adding 
the offence of organizing or being member of an extremist organization. It is worth mentioning 
in this context a provision of the Criminal Code regarding acts of hooliganism defined as a 
&#8220;gross violation of the public order which expresses patent disrespect for society, accompanied 
by the use of violence against private persons or by the threat of its use, and likewise by the 
destruction or damage of other people&#8217;s property&#8221; (art. 213). 
</p>
<p>18. The Federal Act on Counteracting Extremist Activities provides a definition of extremism 
which encompasses the activities of public and religious associations, mass media or individuals 
consisting of organizing, carrying out or funding acts aimed at inciting national, racial, religious 
and social discord associated with violence or calls for violence; the humiliation of national 
dignity; bringing about large-scale disorder, hooligan acts and acts of vandalism for reasons of 
ideological, political, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity; and the advocacy of 
exclusivity, either superiority or inferiority of citizens, on the grounds of their social, racial, 
religious, national and linguistic origin. In addition, it prohibits the propaganda and public </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>display of Nazi paraphernalia, public advocacy or encouragement to commit extremist activities, 
and financing or encouraging extremist activities. The Act foresees the adoption of precautionary 
measures, ranging from the issuance of warnings to the suspension and the closing down of 
extremist organizations. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the State Duma should 
shortly be considering a series of amendments to it regarding the classification as an offence of 
the distribution of extremist information over the Internet.  
</p>
<p>19. In the field of civil and administrative law, officials informed the Special Rapporteur about 
several provisions against discrimination in Russian legislation. Particularly relevant is the 
provision in the 2002 Labour Code entitled &#8220;Prohibition of discrimination in the sphere of work&#8221; 
which not only prohibits discrimination in the workplace on grounds of sex, race, colour or 
nationality, but also establishes that persons that consider themselves victims of discrimination 
shall be entitled to the restoration of their infringed rights, as well as financial or moral 
compensation by federal labour inspectors or courts (art. 3). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Perception and reactions of State officials and other organs 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to the significant number of statements 
recently made at the highest State level, including by President Vladimir Putin, acknowledging 
and condemning the existence of manifestations of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance in 
the country and expressing the necessity to combat them.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>21. In this line, a majority of Russian officials generally acknowledged, to a higher or lower 
degree, an increase in manifestations of different forms of extremism, including racial 
discrimination and xenophobia, and stressed that such manifestations received firm 
condemnation by the highest State authorities and an immediate, severe and unprejudiced 
response by law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  On 17 February 2006, President Putin stated: &#8220;At a recent meeting of the Prosecutor-General 
</p>
<p>we drew attention to the increase in crimes due to xenophobia, ethnic, national or religious 
intolerance. Moreover the activity of extremist groups is becoming more aggressive and taking 
on harsher forms. We must recognize that law enforcement agencies have not yet managed to 
react in an appropriate way, or established a productive and systematic way to prevent conflicts 
that have ethnic or religious motives. I think that we do not need to be reminded of the great 
danger that all these phenomena represent for our multinational and multireligious country.&#8221; 
On 3 March 2006, he noted: &#8220;Russian statehood has its roots right from the beginning in the 
coexistence of different confessions. This harmony that we have between our ethnic groups and 
religions is more than just a long-standing tradition in Russia. It is more than just harmony - it is 
a symbiosis of the various nationalities, ethnic groups and religions that together make up what 
we call Russia, and that is our strength. That is why the authorities, the President and the 
Government will pay close and constant attention to the fight against anti-Semitism, against 
manifestation of any other extremist tendencies and any form of extremism and xenophobia, 
including chauvinism and anti-Russia sentiment&#8221; (statements provided by the Russian Ministry 
for Foreign Affairs). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>22. In their view, however, this increase was not specific to the Russian Federation, but rather 
had to be viewed as a worldwide trend to the combat of which Russia was contributing. Several 
officials referred in this regard to the different resolutions sponsored by Russia on the issue of 
&#8220;Inadmissibility of certain practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221; adopted by the Commission on 
Human Rights and the General Assembly.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Many high-level officials, including the President of the Supreme Court, the 
Vice-Prosecutor General and high State officials from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry 
of Interior, expressed the conviction that a majority of such manifestations were acts of 
hooliganism and vandalism, committed mostly by teenagers who, affected by the deterioration of 
the socio-economic situation in the country, had lost all perspectives for their future and had 
integrated the ranks of extremist and neo-Nazi groups. They thus strongly rejected that racism, 
xenophobia and intolerance had deep roots within the Russian society. 
</p>
<p>24. In contrast, a few voices within the State institutions, in particular the Chairperson of the 
Presidential Council on assistance to the development of civil society structures and human 
rights<b>5</b> and the Federal Commissioner for Human Rights,<b>6</b> acknowledged that the roots of the 
expressions of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia go beyond the socio-economic 
context and had to be tackled through the deployment of concerted efforts, particularly at the 
educational level, in order to foster a dynamic of change in the mentality of Russian society. 
While welcoming recent efforts by law enforcement authorities, they indicated that one of the 
main remaining challenges was to adequately implement existing legislation in an appropriate 
and systematic way - thus avoiding the classification of nationalist and religious extremism as 
acts of hooliganism - in order to send a clear message of unacceptability to the perpetrators of 
such acts. In their view, other factors contributing to the exacerbation of extremist manifestations 
were: the growing instrumentalization of racism and discrimination for political aims, often with 
the support of the media; the lack of an adequate immigration and inter-ethnic relations policy; 
the high level of corruption among State officials, including the police; and the mounting social 
inequalities affecting an important sector of the population.

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2004/16 and 2005/5 and General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 60/143 express concern at the increase in the number of racist incidents in several 
countries, the practices of glorification of the Nazi movement and at the spread and 
multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and groups, among them 
neo-Nazi and skinhead groups. 
<b>5
</b>  The Presidential Council is entrusted with the role of advising the President of the

<b>6
</b>  The Federal Commissioner for Human Rights is an independent institution whose main

<p>25. The combat against all manifestations of extremism was presented as a priority issue by 
State officials dealing with law enforcement, particularly the Office of the Prosecutor-General, 
the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice. Officials from those institutions contended 
that since the adoption of the Federal Act on Counteracting Extremist Activities, the work and 
effectiveness of law enforcement agencies had significantly increased. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was informed that in 2005, in 17 trials that reached the 
verdict, 52 persons were convicted for attacks and murders on ethnic hatred grounds, with 
penalties ranging from one year of colony settlement to life imprisonment.<b>7</b> Although global, 
official figures for 2006 were not yet available in the months that followed his visit,<b>8</b> the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of several high profile convictions where the courts took into account 
the motives of national, racial or religious hatred.<b>9</b> Officials also noted the preparation of files to 
support a court application aimed at banning several fascist groups, including &#8220;Mad Crowd&#8221; and 
&#8220;Schulz 88&#8221;.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Particular emphasis was put by the President of the Supreme Court and officials of the 
Ministry of Justice on the measures recently implemented in order to ban or prohibit the 
registration of organizations with extremist platforms. Reference was made to the unprecedented 
ruling of the Moscow City Court in December 2005, later upheld by the Supreme Court, 
excluding Rodina - the country&#8217;s then fourth largest political party - from elections to the 
Moscow City Duma on the grounds of incitement to ethnic hatred.

</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  In comparison, in 2004, racial motivation was identified in seven sentences among finished 
</p>
<p>trials on violent crimes, resulting in 32 convictions. In 2003, only three sentences were 
pronounced for racially motivated crimes. 
<b>8
</b>  Information by the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights, dated December 2006, indicates that 
</p>
<p>in 2006, 109 persons were condemned for ethnic hate crimes. Article 282 of the Criminal Code 
was present in the verdict of 72 persons condemned. 
<b>9
</b>  Reference was made to the conviction in June 2006 of two skinheads who killed a Mauritanian 
</p>
<p>national in St. Petersburg to 4 years in a strict-regime colony; the conviction in September 2006 
to 16 years of prison of Alexander Koptsev, who on 11 January 2006 attacked a synagogue in 
Moscow; and the conviction in November 2006 of three men to sentences ranging from 12 to 
18 months of internal exile for the racially motivated beating of Zaur Tutov, Minister of Culture 
of Karbardino-Balkaria, on 1 April 2006.

</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;Mad Crowd&#8221; members were allegedly involved in several homicides in St. Petersburg and 
Leningrad Province, including the murders of Professor Nicolai Guirenko on 19 June 2004 and 
of the Senegalese student Samba Lampsar on 7 April 2006. </p>

</p>
<p>28. Regarding the reinforcement of relations among nationalities and ethnic groups, State 
officials noted the work of the approximately 300 &#8220;cultural autonomous entities&#8221; - voluntary 
associations of citizens defined by their ethnic, national or religious affiliation - in preserving, 
developing and disseminating different languages, traditions and customs. Inter-ethnic 
associations and councils, known in some regions as &#8220;Houses of friendship between peoples&#8221; - 
such as those visited by the Special Rapporteur in Moscow and St. Petersburg - allow 
representatives of ethnic groups to share their views on the issue of inter-ethnic relations. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Ministry of Regional Development of the 
establishment in 2005 of an Interdepartmental Commission on the Amendment of the Outline 
of State nationalities policy - one of the main instruments governing relations between 
nationalities - which includes an expert body to identify cases of advocacy of xenophobia, 
national and religious intolerance and extremism. In addition, a Commission on Issues of 
Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience has been created, the tasks of which include monitoring 
inter-ethnic and inter-religious relations; devising ways to ensure inter-ethnic and inter-religious 
harmony; and drawing up recommendations on these issues for the attention of legislative 
bodies, law enforcement agencies, regional and local authorities, voluntary organizations, the 
mass media, business associations and educational organizations. 
</p>
<p>30. Concerning the promotion of tolerance and interfaith dialogue, State officials indicated that 
the Ministry of Education and Science is working with voluntary organizations and religious 
associations - including representatives of the scientific community, the Russian Orthodox 
Church, leaders of the Islamic clergy and other religions - to implement a series of measures 
advocating the prevention of xenophobia and intolerance based on nationality and religion. The 
Ministry is currently working on a joint project with the Council of Europe aimed at promoting 
intercultural and inter-confessional dialogue through education and teaching of history. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the 2001-2005 Federal Programme on 
Tolerance and Prevention of Extremism in Russian society, which includes the following 
measures: the promotion of activities through mass media and public life forging the principle of 
tolerance and countering social aggression and extremism; the integration of subprogrammes 
aimed at promoting tolerance and tackling extremism in the educational programmes for 
teachers, social and law enforcement personnel and mass media professionals; and the promotion 
of a new trend in publishing aimed at cultivating tolerance and countering extremism. Currently, 
a Federal programme on ethnocultural development of the Russian regions (2006-2008) is being 
developed with a view to creating conditions for the development of all Russian peoples in a 
climate of mutual understanding and the setting of a regular monitoring mechanism in the field 
of relations between nationalities. 
</p>
<p>32. At local level, the Moscow authorities referred to the main initiatives carried out to 
prevent all manifestations of discrimination, including the creation of a council to advise the 
Moscow City government on relations among nationalities, and the implementation of the 
programme &#8220;Moscow, city of many nationalities: building civic responsibility and a culture of 
peace and harmony (2005-2007)&#8221;, as a follow-up to the programme &#8220;Moscow on the path to a 
culture of peace: building the values of tolerance, preventing extremism, developing a culture of 
peace (2002-2004)&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>33. In St. Petersburg, the Vice-Governor and other local authorities informed the Special 
Rapporteur of the Programme on Tolerance (2006-2010), which features several measures aimed 
at educating for tolerance in schools, teaching public officials - including law enforcement 
officials - on appropriate communication strategies in their interaction with foreigners, and 
providing support to media coverage of successful results in the fight against xenophobia. Within 
this programme, meetings gathering local authorities, representatives of the police and the justice 
system and potential victims of racism and xenophobia - notably foreign students - are regularly 
organized in order to discuss appropriate protection strategies against racist violence. 
</p>
<p>34. In view of strengthening the collaboration with civil society, State officials noted that the 
recently established Public Chamber, a consultative body integrated by civil society 
representatives with the aim of channelling the civil society views to the Government and the 
Parliament, will have among its major tasks the elaboration of studies on manifestations of 
extremism, including racial discrimination and xenophobia, and issue non-binding 
recommendations thereon. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  VIEWS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND COMMUNITIES CONCERNED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Concerns in response to State policies and measures 
</b></p>
<p>35. Representatives of civil society organizations generally expressed utmost concern at the 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, in particular the most recent and 
violent ones, which are viewed to be increasingly permeating the Russian society. According to a 
majority of them, racism and discrimination in Russia have deep historical and cultural roots, 
which go beyond the deterioration of the socio-economic situation. The Orthodox Church, while 
strongly condemning racism and xenophobia and calling for mutual respect for and development 
of the traditional denominations in Russia through the promotion of inter-religious dialogue, 
noted that most violent manifestations of racism and xenophobia are committed by youth 
affected by socio-economic difficulties. 
</p>
<p>36. Despite recent statements at the highest State level acknowledging the existence of racism, 
racial discrimination and xenophobia, a considerable increase of prosecutions and convictions 
including racial hatred as a motivating factor, and a greater presence of police in certain areas, 
most human rights organizations share the conviction that authorities are not properly addressing 
the situation and that major pressing efforts need to be carried out, both in the political, legal and 
cultural fields, to develop an effective and comprehensive strategy at federal level to combat 
racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>37. While some voiced the need to improve the existing legal framework, civil society 
organizations unanimously called for the improvement of the implementation of the existing 
anti-discrimination legislation. The poor record of convictions on the grounds of national, racial 
or religious hatred is attributed to several reasons: the non-application, deliberately or by 
ignorance, by many judiciary and law enforcement officials of the relevant provisions of the 
Criminal Code; the refusal or reluctance of victims, particularly ethnic minorities, to file a 
complaint fearing retaliatory, unlawful or discriminatory reactions by the police; the 
understaffing faced by the police, sometimes resulting in the lack of appropriate action when </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>racist cases are reported; and acts of intimidation of jury members or the victims themselves 
who, fearing reprisals, prefer to remain silent and not use the legal mechanisms at their disposal. 
The combination of these factors results in an atmosphere of impunity for the perpetrators of 
such acts and a sense of profound frustration, isolation and fear among the victims and the civil 
society organizations dealing with these phenomena. 
</p>
<p>38. Civil society raised concern about what is considered as a too broad and unclear definition 
of the term &#8220;extremist activities&#8221; in the Federal Act on Counteracting Extremist Activities, 
pointing out that the concept and formulations of the law allowed its arbitrary and selective 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>39. Most civil society organizations condemned the discriminatory practices linked to granting 
citizenship and the registration system, leading in many cases to the denial of the exercise of 
basic rights, such access to social insurance, medical aid, housing, education or employment. 
This situation, already declared unconstitutional by Russian courts, is dramatically affecting a 
large number of citizens of the former Soviet Union. 
</p>
<p>40. The NGO community noted an aggravation of this situation with the adoption of the 2002 
federal laws on Russian Citizenship - requiring to prove the existence of a residence 
registration or residence permit - and on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the 
Russian Federation - primarily designed to control immigration. This law actually contains no 
transitional provisions enforceable in practice, and makes no distinction between former citizens 
of the Soviet Union having permanently lived in Russia and foreigners coming to Russia at 
present. Thus, hundreds of thousands of residents of the Russian Federation, in particular large 
segments of such ethnic communities as Roma, Meskhetian Turks, Yezidi and other ethnic 
groups in Krasnodar Krai, are facing a situation of permanent irregularity and denial of basic 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ultranationalist racist attacks 
</b></p>
<p>41. Utmost concern was expressed at the number and degree of acts of physical violence 
committed by ultranationalist, racist and fascist groups, including skinheads. Their number is 
estimated at several thousands, ranging from 10,000 to 20,000, according to figures provided 
by several State officials, to an estimated 50,000, in the view of some human rights 
organizations.<b>11</b> According to NGO figures, in 2004 there were 258 victims of racist and 
neo-Nazi attacks, including 46 deaths (14 in Moscow, 9 in St. Petersburg); in 2005, there were 
437 victims of such attacks, including 36 deaths (10 in Moscow, 4 in St. Petersburg); from 
January to September 2006, the number of victims amounted to 322, including 36 deaths (26 in 
Moscow, 5 in St. Petersburg).<b>12</b> The victims of those attacks would mainly be dark-skinned 
people, people from Africa, the Caucasus and Central Asia, from the Middle East and 
</p>

</p>
<p>North Africa, from the Asia and Pacific region, as well as other people of non-Slav appearance. 
Jews and members of other religious groups, human rights defenders and members of youth 
groups would also be victims of such violence. While most attacks took place in Moscow and 
St. Petersburg, incidents have been registered in several other cities and regions, including 
Voronezh, Nizhni Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don and Volgograd. 
</p>
<p>42. Several developments within the skinhead movement give rise to increasing concern 
among civil society organizations: first, their successful penetration into the youth groups of the 
main Russian cities; second, the fact that the average skinhead profile is no longer that of a 
socially disadvantaged and uneducated youth, but rather a teenager - increasingly often a minor - 
from a middle-class family and with secondary, higher or technical education; third, the 
increasing association between skinhead groups and ultranationalist parties, such as the People&#8217;s 
National Party, the National Sovereign Party or the Freedom Party; and fourth, the increasing 
attacks committed against Russians, particularly human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Exploitation of the racist and xenophobic discourse in politics and the media</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Civil society organizations expressed particular concern at the development of a culture of 
nationalism, intolerance and xenophobia within Russian society. Reference was made, as an 
illustration, to two recent opinion polls, which respectively indicated that 53 per cent of 
respondents supported the slogan &#8220;Russia for the Russians&#8221; and that 42 per cent would support a 
decision to &#8220;deport representatives of certain ethnic groups&#8221; from their region.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>44. While these feelings are considered to have deep roots, they also need to be analysed in a 
context where the fall of the political and economic system of the Soviet Union and the 
economic and social crisis that affects the country have been felt by an important sector of the 
Russian population as a national defeat, leading to enormous frustration and to a rise of 
nationalism. Two main factors contribute to their exacerbation: the use of racism and xenophobia 
as an electoral resource and the role of the media in the dissemination of racist and xenophobic 
materials. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the growing influence of parties with racist or 
xenophobic platforms, which adopt an openly discriminatory discourse, founded upon a security 
approach towards immigration and asylum and upon negative stereotypes and prejudices against 
certain communities. Several political organizations, including parties with representation in 
Parliament, such as Rodina or the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, use xenophobic slogans in 
their programmes in order to attract votes, without facing a systematic and consistent response 
from the authorities. In this context, the ruling of the Moscow City Court banning Rodina party 
from elections to the Moscow City Duma in December 2005 on the grounds of incitement to 
ethnic hatred was interpreted by most civil society organizations as a political move to avoid any 
potential competition with United Russia. In fact, Rodina, which was emerging as the major

</p>
<p>extremist party at the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, was attributed 15 per cent of the 
voting intentions in November 2005.<b>14</b> Paradoxically, the suit against Rodina was filed by the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, a party also resorting to xenophobic slogans against certain 
ethnic groups and foreigners. Both parties sued each other for virtually identical campaigns, 
demanding that the opponent be banned from the elections. The Moscow City Court took no 
action against the Liberal Democratic Party. 
</p>
<p>46. The dissemination of racist and xenophobic ideas and stereotypes by an increasing sector 
of the media is contributing to portraying a negative image of certain communities and fostering 
feelings of intolerance and xenophobia within the population. Racist and xenophobic messages 
are said to be openly disseminated both by mainstream and &#8220;specialized&#8221; media, despite the 
reinforcement of criminal law provisions in this field, and can particularly be found in the 
association of Roma and Tajiks with drug trafficking and organized crime, Caucasians - in 
particular Chechens - with extremism and terrorism, or immigrants in general with 
unemployment of Russians, criminality and social precarity. There would be more than 
100 newspapers regularly using a highly virulent hate speech and instigating racial hatred against 
foreigners, at least seven publishing houses with links to extremist movements that would 
support the publication of revisionist literature, and over 800 websites of extremist orientation, 
which would give open space to leaders of neo-Nazi or extreme right organizations.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The view of the main communities which are victims of racism and xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur received information from various sources on the situation of 
vulnerability faced by certain groups to manifestations of racism and xenophobia in the 
Russian Federation. The following paragraphs address the situation of some of these groups, on 
the basis of the meetings that the Special Rapporteur had with their members and representatives. 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Caucasians and Central Asians 
</b></p>
<p>48. With the situation in Chechnya, the attribution of several attacks in the territory of the 
Russian Federation to Chechen groups, the generalization of the association between Caucasians 
and terrorism and extremism - particularly by extreme right political parties, the media and to a 
certain extent the Russian authorities - and a general trend of islamophobia, Caucasians and 
Central Asians have, according to civil society organizations, become major victims of 
manifestations of racism, discrimination and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>49. In the view of civil society organizations, these manifestations are particularly acute in the 
fields of law enforcement and administration of justice. In this regard, Caucasians - in particular 
Chechens - and Central Asians - notably Tajiks, Uzbeks, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz - would

</p>
<p>particularly be subjected to various forms of racial profiling, in particular, racially selective 
inspections and abusive identity checks,<b>16</b> forcible entrance into premises, searches of firms, 
fabrication of criminal accusations by law enforcement officials and arbitrary refusal of 
residence registration stamps. In a context of increasing intolerance and suspicion against 
Muslims, manifested in many cases by the profanation of Muslim graves and attacks on 
mosques, Caucasians and Central Asians would also be major targets of discrimination in the 
housing and employment sectors. 
</p>
<p>50. Members of the Caucasian and Central Asian communities, including children, are 
reported to be a major target of violence by extremist groups. Particularly disturbing is the 
assassination of Khursheda Sultonova, a 9-year-old Tajik girl murdered in St. Petersburg in 
February 2004 by a group of teenagers armed with baseball bats, chains and knives allegedly 
shouting the slogan &#8220;Russia for the Russians&#8221;. The verdict by the St. Petersburg City Court of 
March 2004 convicting the teenagers on charges of hooliganism sparked outrage among human 
rights campaigners, who considered that the lenient sentence would encourage an increase of 
racist and xenophobic violence by neo-Nazi and extremist groups in the country. 
</p>
<p>51. In the months that followed the visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed by human 
rights organizations of manifestations of growing intolerance and hostility towards Caucasians, 
particularly Chechens, in the city of Kondopoga, in the Republic of Carelia, during the first days 
of September 2006, and towards the Georgian community, following the arrest in Georgia of 
four Russian military officers on 27 September 2006. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow 
up on the allegations received. 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Roma 
</b></p>
<p>52. Despite the figures of the 2002 census estimating the Roma population at 182,766 persons, 
other sources estimate the actual size of the Roma population much higher, ranging from 
600,000 to 1,000,000.<b>17</b> Within the Roma population itself, there are a number of different ethnic 
groups: Russian Roma and groups related to them by language and culture (Polish, Latvian, 
Estonian, Lithuanian, Finnish, Siberian Roma), groups notably distinct from Russian Roma (such 
as Kelderash, Lovari, Krimi, Kishinevtsi, Plashuni, Servi and Vlach), and groups originating 
from other countries, such as Ukraine, Moldova and different countries from Central Asia. The 
majority of Roma speak one of many dialects of Romani, although almost all also speak

<p><b>16
</b>  The study &#8220;Ethnic profiling in the Moscow metro&#8221;, conducted in 2006 by the NGO Open 
</p>
<p>Society Justice Initiative and the Russian NGO Jurix, indicated that persons of non-Slav 
appearance are on average 21.8 times more likely to be stopped by police at the Moscow metro 
than those of Slavic appearance.

<p>Russian sufficiently well enough to interact socially with ethnic Russians. Contrary to the current 
prevailing perception on the nomadic nature of the Roma community, forced settlement was 
imposed by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1956.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The NGO community referred to the situation of extreme vulnerability and discrimination 
faced by the Roma community in Russia, especially affecting women and children, and 
particularly visible in the housing, education, health and employment sectors - often linked to the 
difficulties in obtaining Russian citizenship and residence registration. In addition, Roma are 
increasingly suffering from racist violence, mostly by ultranationalist groups, from violence and 
abuse from law enforcement officials, and from persistent negative stereotypes associating them 
with criminality and drug dealing, often for electoral reasons. 
</p>
<p>54. NGOs working with Roma expressed concern at the lack of a comprehensive law, policy 
or institution addressing the specific issues and concerns of the Roma community in the 
Russian Federation. They unanimously referred to the need to create a federal plan for the Roma 
community and the establishment of a federal institution in charge of Roma issues, in particular, 
the issue of land, the promotion of education for the Roma community, and the sensitization of 
the Russian society about Roma history, culture and traditions in order to eliminate the negative 
stereotypes they are recurrently associated with. 
</p>
<p>55. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited the Kelderary Roma community in the 
village of Peri, located in the district of Vsevolozshsky (Leningrad oblast), inhabited by 
approximately 1,320 persons, including 500 to 600 children. Representatives of the community 
expressed frustration and discontent at their poor living conditions, the degree of violence 
affecting the community and the lack of assistance provided by the authorities. The Special 
Rapporteur noted the precarity of the majority of the 130 houses in the settlement, exposing the 
community to particularly severe living conditions in the winter; the lack of access to drinking 
water; and the high rate of infectious diseases, particularly among children, due to lack of 
appropriate sanitary conditions. Furthermore, the community denounced the discriminatory 
treatment faced in their access to health services, including medical emergency treatment. 
Concern was also expressed at the poor school attendance rate among children, as the cost of 
transportation to the closest school was unaffordable to the majority of families, greatly affected 
by unemployment. In addition, under the pretext of difficulties with the Russian language, it was 
reported that Roma children attending school were placed in a separate school building, in a 
worse condition than the regular building for Russian children, thus hampering their integration 
with other non-Roma children. The Special Rapporteur also collected testimonies of several 
victims of violence, including those of an elderly woman and a girl who had been beaten by

</p>
<p>skinheads in St. Petersburg. The majority of those cases remain unreported, given the general 
mistrust towards the police, rather associated with inadequate protection, arbitrary identity 
checks, harassment and corruption than with protection and law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>56. Human rights organizations expressed utmost concern at what they viewed as an increasing 
trend of forced housing evictions of Roma communities throughout the Federation, often 
accompanied by use of violence and racist language. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was 
brought to the demolition campaigns carried out by Russian authorities in the region of 
Kaliningrad over the past two years, preceded by anti-Roma discourse by local politicians and 
the media. A particularly striking case was the demolition of 40 Roma homes in the village of 
Dorozhny from 29 May to 2 June 2006, resulting in the eviction of more than 200 Roma. These 
demolitions were reportedly preceded by highly criticized court procedures declaring Roma 
housing illegal and requesting Roma to leave their homes. On 3 November 2006, human rights 
organizations brought the case to the European Court of Human Rights, accusing authorities of 
demolishing the homes, separating families and forcing the victims to find makeshift shelter, 
thereby violating, inter alia, their right to life, non-discrimination, protection against inhuman 
treatment, and enjoyment of their home, private and family life, as well as freedom from 
interference with their possessions.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Discrimination against foreigners: the case of the African community 
</b></p>
<p>57. During the times of the Soviet Union, thousands of African students received scholarships 
to study in higher education institutions throughout the country. Today, among the foreign 
student community, it is with no doubt African students who currently suffer most from 
racism, xenophobia and discrimination. Very serious cases affecting students from Asia, 
Latin America and the Middle East - sometimes including the death of the victim - have also 
been registered. 
</p>
<p>58. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with African students and their 
representatives, with Africans who have long lived in the country and have even acquired 
Russian nationality, and with representatives of the African diplomatic community. All 
testimonies had a recurrent and grave story of racism and discrimination to tell, as they all had, 
to a lesser or higher degree, been victims of manifestations, ranging from insults, intimidation, 
harassment, discrimination in the employment and housing sectors, and particularly in recent 
years, acts of physical aggression, including with the use of weapons, by neo-Nazi groups. In 
2002, diplomats from 37 African States appealed to the Foreign Ministry for the provision of 
protection for their citizens. The Special Rapporteur was particularly alarmed by the feeling of 
permanent fear and profound isolation that characterized the majority of the testimonies he

<p>59. Representatives of student associations reported that between 2004 and 2006 violent 
attacks against the African community had resulted in at least six deaths, and some 90 persons 
had been beaten up and seriously injured, mainly in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Voronezh and other 
big cities in Russia. Particularly disturbing was the assassination in April 2006 of 
Samba Lampsar, a Senegalese student and active member of the NGO African Unity, an 
organization working for the promotion of tolerance and the elimination of racism in 
St. Petersburg. A shotgun decorated with a swastika and the inscription &#8220;white power&#8221; written 
on it was found in the surroundings of the place where he was murdered.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>60. Particular reference was also made to the fire which in November 2003 swept through a 
dormitory of the University of Friendship between Peoples in Moscow, causing the death of 
44 persons and severe injuries to about 150 students, mostly from Africa and China, an incident 
viewed by many students as a racially motivated act, given the number of racist threats and 
aggressions that occurred in the weeks preceding the fire. In addition, students strongly 
condemned the way in which the rescue operation was conducted, suggesting that it was 
hampered by racial prejudice.<b>21</b> 
61. In the view of the African community, the increasing intolerance among the general 
population and rising violence by extreme right groups is to be combated mainly through the 
recognition of the existence of the problem by the authorities and the expression of the 
determination to combat it; the provision of adequate protection to foreign nationals and ethnic 
minority groups at risk of racial attacks; the delivery of appropriate sanctions to the perpetrators 
of such acts, in line with relevant legal provisions; and the implementation of a federal-wide 
education campaign that takes into account the richness of cultures and traditions in Africa, thus 
contributing to the promotion of tolerance and the elimination of negative stereotypes. 
</p>
<p><b>Anti-Semitism 
</b></p>
<p>62. Anti-Semitism, like in most of Europe, has deep roots in Russia, where during both the 
times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union it was used as a tool for political aims. The 
adoption of repressive legislation and the practice of pogroms, particularly in the last years of the 
nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, propelled massive waves of 
Jewish emigration. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  In this case, the St. Petersburg Prosecutor&#8217;s Office opened a criminal case on the evidence of 
</p>
<p>an offence contrary to article 105 par. 2 (k) of the Criminal Code (homicide motivated by ethnic 
or religious hatred or enmity or blood feud). Seven members of the extremist group &#8220;Mad 
Crowd&#8221; were arrested on suspicion of committing the offence. Up to today, however, no charges 
for the murder of Samba Lampsar have been brought up against those persons. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  Following the fire, six officials, including the former acting university principal and the 
district fire inspector, were charged with negligence for lack of safety precautions and for 
violating fire safety regulations. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>63. Anti-Semitism experts noted that, while few physical attacks driven by explicitly racist 
motives against the Jewish community are registered in Russia today,<b>22</b> a more serious source of 
concern is the anti-Semitic hate speech used by a number of extremist movements and the fact 
that anti-Semitic rhetoric has gained ground in the media, including mainstream press and, most 
worryingly, in the political discourse. 
</p>
<p>64. One of the most disturbing of such cases was the &#8220;Letter of the 500&#8221;, an appeal sent to the 
Prosecutor-General on 23 January 2005, urging him to review the activity of all Jewish religious 
and cultural organizations on the grounds of &#8220;extremism&#8221;. Among the signatories, there were 
19 members of the State Duma (14 from Rodina and 5 from the Communist Party). Despite 
immediate condemnation by President Putin and the Orthodox Church, later followed by 
condemnation by the State Duma, on 21 March 2005 the letter was resubmitted to the 
General Prosecutor with 5,000 signatures, including those of several well-known personalities. 
In spite of national and international condemnation, no charge was brought against any of the 
signatories of the letter under the criminal law provisions prohibiting racial hate speech. Failure 
to act in this case is viewed by the NGO community as a dangerous precedent conferring a 
certain &#8220;democratic&#8221; legitimation to anti-Semitic speech. 
</p>
<p><b>Attacks on human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>65. Organizations and individuals engaged in the combat against racism, discrimination and 
xenophobia have also become a target of racist violence, including threats, physical assaults or 
murder by ultranationalist groups. In such context, human rights defenders expressed their 
utmost concern at a general absence of official reaction, effective investigation and failure to 
provide protection. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur heard several testimonies of human rights defenders that had been 
directly targeted through physical assaults, death threats - also to family members - and 
vandalization of workplaces, including theft of computers containing staff contact details. 
Increasingly, ultranationalist groups would be disseminating threats through the Internet, a recent 
example being the call for elimination of a list of 89 persons, including very well-known human 
rights defenders and anti-racism activists, by an extremist group called &#8220;The Russian Will&#8221;. The 
people on the list were considered &#8220;Traitors to the Nation&#8221; or &#8220;Friends of Foreigners&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was in particular brought to the assassination in 
June 2004 of Nicolai Guirenko, professor of ethnology and prominent expert on ethnic and racial 
issues in the country. The NGO community expressed its conviction that Guirenko&#8217;s murder was 
linked to his work as a researcher and expert witness in high-profile investigations and court 
cases on racially motivated attacks. This murder thus raises the issue of the safety of experts,

</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  Over the first nine months of 2006, SOVA documented four cases of physical attacks against 
</p>
<p>the Jewish community, the worst cases being the attack on a synagogue in Moscow by 
Alexander Kopsev. See: &#8220;Anti-Semitism in Russia: January-September 2006&#8221; by

<p>witnesses and other participants in criminal investigations and trials. Two years later, in 
May 2006, a special operation led to the arrest of several members of an extremist gang 
suspected of committing attacks and murders on nationalistic motives, including that of 
Mr. Guirenko. 
</p>
<p>68. Two young anti-fascist activists and students, Timur Kacharava and Alexander Ryukhin, 
were likewise assassinated on 13 November 2005 and 16 April 2006 respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>69. After having collected and analysed the views and information provided by all parties 
concerned, the Special Rapporteur reached the conclusion that, while there is no State policy of 
racism in the Russian Federation, the Russian society is facing a profound trend of racism and 
xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>70. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the most striking manifestations of this trend are the 
following: the increasing number of racially motivated crimes and attacks, including by neo-Nazi 
groups, particularly against people of non-Slav appearance originating from the Caucasus, 
Africa, Asia or the Arab world; the growing level of violence with which some of these attacks 
are carried out, resulting in some cases in the death of the victim; the extension of this violence 
to human rights defenders, intellectuals and students engaged in the combat against racism; the 
climate of relative impunity that the perpetrators of such acts enjoy from law enforcement 
agents, despite a substantial increase, in recent months, of prosecutions and convictions for acts 
including racial hatred or enmity as a motivating factor; the rise of anti-Semitism as well as other 
forms of religious intolerance, in particular against Muslims; the existence and the increasing 
importance of political parties with racist and xenophobic platforms; and last but not least, the 
virtual correspondence of the social, economic and political marginalization with the mapping of 
ethnic minorities and other discriminated groups. 
</p>
<p>71. Racism, xenophobia and discrimination in the Russian society are of a profoundly 
historical and cultural nature, as illustrated by pogroms, deportation and displacement of entire 
communities, particularly against Jews and members of other ethnic minorities, which date back 
to the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Even if modern forms of islamophobia are related 
to post-Soviet political independence developments in the Caucasus, particularly in Chechnya, 
Islam, as other non-Orthodox religions and spiritual practices, were long persecuted and 
repressed in the Soviet Union. 
</p>
<p>72. Present manifestations of racism, discrimination and xenophobia being faced in violent 
forms by non-European minorities and foreigners from Africa, Asia and the Arab world, are 
revitalized by an ideological void resulting from the shift of ideology from the &#8220;friendship 
amongst peoples&#8221; of the Soviet Union, which officially repressed manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia, to the nationalist ideology of the Russian Federation. In itself, 
however, the ideology of &#8220;friendship amongst peoples&#8221; was to a certain extent a &#8220;mask&#8221; under 
which authorities not only did not hamper the existence of inter-ethnic tensions throughout the 
Soviet Union, but also conducted deportations of entire communities and fostered anti-Semitic 
feelings. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>73. This ideological void has been filled by a rise of nationalism which, in a context of deep 
social and economic crisis, has created a fertile ground for the emergence of both ultranationalist 
groups, including neo-Nazi groups, which increasingly use physical violence, and of political 
parties that use racist and xenophobic platforms to instrumentalize the fears of Russian society. 
The instrumentalization of racism and xenophobia for political aims through the expression of a 
political discourse structured around the &#8220;defence of the national security&#8221; and &#8220;the protection of 
the national identity&#8221;, translated in the growing association between foreigners in general and 
ethnic and religious minorities in particular with criminalization, often supported by the media 
through the perpetuation of negative stereotypes, constitutes one of the major threats to the 
democratic process in Russia today. 
</p>
<p>74. The racist and xenophobic trend equally reflects the profound identity crisis of the Russian 
society, resulting from the contradiction and the tension between the new ideology of 
nationalism and the new process of multiculturalism which is structuring it. The dominant 
ideology and discourse of political nationalism articulated by the authorities for the protection 
and the cohesion of the Russian society against inner and outer &#8220;threats&#8221; is given an ethnic, racial 
and religious content by nationalist political parties and extreme right groups. The identity 
tension generated by the process of multiculturalization is both the reflection of the deep historic 
and cultural roots of the Slavic nationalism and the result of the instrumentalization of the 
&#8220;defence of the national identity&#8221; to mask the deep causes of the social and economic 
marginalization of a growing part of the society. This dominant ideology, amplified by the 
media, nourishes a culture and mentality of racism and xenophobia, articulated around the figure 
of the foreigner, the migrant worker and the ethnic, cultural or religious minority as being 
responsible for the crisis. 
</p>
<p>75. While efforts have been made to reinforce legislation, particularly the Criminal Code, the 
Special Rapporteur noted that such efforts have not sufficiently addressed non-violent forms of 
discrimination, in particular in the fields of housing, education, health care and access to justice, 
as reflected by the non-explicit prohibition of racial discrimination in most laws concerning 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>76. Despite recent statements by State officials acknowledging the existence of certain forms 
of discrimination and the need to combat them, a number of legislative texts, State policies and 
administrative measures particularly affecting ethnic minorities, foreigners and related to 
immigration, reflect the existence of institutionalized discrimination. This is illustrated by the 
insurmountable obstacles faced in particular by a large number of citizens of the former 
Soviet Union who, despite having lived long or permanently in Russia, are considered as illegal 
migrants since the entry into force of the Federal Laws on Citizenship and on the Legal Status of 
Foreign Citizens and face denial of recognition of citizenship and residence registration. Despite 
having been declared unconstitutional by Russian courts, the absence of residence registration 
continues to be used as a discriminatory element against members of certain communities, 
including people from Caucasus and Central Asia, Roma, Meskhetians and other ethnic groups 
in Krasnodar Krai. Furthermore, these communities suffer from aggravated discrimination 
deriving from policies and measures mainly inspired by a security approach, which associate 
them with terrorism and criminality and result in practices of racial profiling, mainly racially 
targeted inspections and unlawful practices by law enforcement officials. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>77. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur noted the profound social, economic and political 
marginalization faced by ethnic minorities and other discriminated groups, resulting in the 
violation of their most basic rights, including access to employment, education, housing or health 
services. The Special Rapporteur found particularly disturbing the poor living conditions of the 
Roma community and the prevailing culture of suspicion and segregation based on the traditional 
stigma, stereotypes and prejudices associated with the Roma people. 
</p><p>78. The Special Rapporteur is particularly alarmed at the failure of education and the teaching 
of history in confronting and eradicating deep root factors of racism and xenophobia. The 
strength of neo-Nazi groups and the impact of racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic political 
platforms in Russia today give rise to the question of the way education and history have failed 
in the work of memory and value systems of the evils of Nazism and the enormous human price 
paid by the Russian people in decisively breaking the military strength of Nazi Germany. 
Education also seems to have deeply failed in translating the legacy of &#8220;friendship amongst 
peoples&#8221; into a more profound culture of solidarity and knowledge and appreciation of the 
history, culture and civilizations of Africa, Asia and the Arab and Muslim worlds. Those failures 
are fertile ingredients of ignorance and prejudice, and root causes of racism and xenophobia. 
79. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, the premises of a positive trend to combat the 
dynamic of racism and discrimination, particularly reflected in the reinforcement of criminal law 
provisions aimed at combating racism and discrimination, the increasing number of arrests and 
prosecutions for racially motivated acts, the adoption and consideration of measures to promote 
tolerance and encourage inter-ethnic dialogue, the significant statements recently made by 
several high-level officials acknowledging the reality of an increase of manifestations of racism 
and xenophobia - although only few of such officials recognize the depth and the root causes of 
those manifestations - and the necessity and urgency to combat them. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Government needs to officially and publicly acknowledge the existence and the 
depth of the trend of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia permeating the Russian 
society, and express, in the strongest and most determined terms, its political will to combat 
it. Particularly important is the condemnation of any racist or xenophobic action or 
discourse, including by political parties and the media. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The rich legacy and depth of human, cultural and religious multicultural interactions 
in the deepest layers of the Russian society has to be a strategic axis for the Government in 
linking the combat against racism and xenophobia with the promotion and reconstruction 
of multiculturalism of the Russian society, aiming at the strengthening of the democratic 
political process. To this effect, the Government should strongly promote by law, education 
and information, the multicultural identity of the Russian society. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>As an immediate step, the Government should establish a commission of reflection 
composed of representatives of concerned State institutions (justice, police, education, 
culture), democratic political parties, civil society organizations, groups and communities </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p><b>concerned, as well as religious, intellectual and artistic personalities reflecting the diversity 
of the country, to collect data on manifestations and expressions of racism and xenophobia, 
analyse their deep root causes and formulate a national programme of action against 
racism and xenophobia. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Government should also consider the establishment of an independent body at 
Federal level aiming at the promotion and protection of human rights and the combat 
against racism, xenophobia and discrimination in a holistic manner, including 
discrimination on grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, residence, 
gender, age, disability, sexual orientation and any other status. The composition of this 
body, whose work would be supported by regional branches, should be representative of 
the diversity of Russian society, with its members being appointed by Parliament on the 
basis of proposals presented by the Government, civil society organizations and cultural, 
religious and linguistic communities. This body would work in close cooperation with 
relevant State and civil society actors, in particular the Office of the Ombudsman and 
regional ombudsmen, and should be given administrative, legal and normative powers to 
investigate acts of racism and discrimination and provided with adequate human, material 
and financial resources. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Government should determinedly continue to reinforce legislation aimed at 
combating racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, both at criminal and civil and 
administrative law levels. Particularly important is to explicitly prohibit racial 
discrimination, in line with article 1, paragraph 1, of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in constitutional, civil and 
administrative legislation, using a clear and comprehensive definition of discrimination. 
Issues related to immigration, asylum and the situation of foreigners should be treated on 
the basis of the pertinent international instruments and not only on the basis of the security 
dimension and the combat against terrorism. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the 
revision of the law of 2002 on &#8220;Counteracting Extremist Activities&#8221; with a view to more 
clearly defining its scope. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Strengthening of legislation should be accompanied by the continuation and 
reinforcement of current efforts in the implementation of adequate existing provisions in 
order to send a firm message of unacceptability to the perpetrators of racist and 
discriminatory practices, xenophobic violence and hate speech. These efforts should 
include the strengthening of the capacity of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, 
particularly the Office of the General Prosecutor, to effectively implement the Criminal 
Code provisions against perpetrators or racist attacks, especially through adequate 
training on the content of international human rights law instruments - in particular the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination - and 
existing national laws. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Acts of racism and intolerance against foreigners, and in particular students, human 
rights defenders, witnesses in criminal investigations, intellectuals and activists engaged in </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p><b>the combat against racism should be firmly condemned and given utmost priority by law 
enforcement officials, amongst others, by offering effective protective measures from 
racially motivated attacks, especially by ultranationalist groups. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government should also take measures to stop practices of racial profiling, 
particularly racially targeted passport and registration checks conducted against specific 
communities by law enforcement agents in the public place. These measures should include 
education and sensitization of law enforcement officials to ensure that their duties are 
carried out with no distinction as to race, colour, national or ethnic origin. The 
Government should ensure that this principle applies as well within the framework of the 
fight against terrorism. Misbehaviours by law enforcement agents towards victims of 
racially motivated acts should be exemplarily sanctioned. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Government should take firm measures to prevent that discriminatory practices 
linked to granting citizenship and residence registration continue to be used against certain 
groups, and thus ensure that decisions of the Constitutional and Supreme Courts on the 
unconstitutionality of such practices are strictly implemented and respected. The situation 
of a large number of former Soviet citizens who, despite having lived long or permanently 
in Russia, are considered as illegal migrants since the entry into force of the Federal Laws 
on Citizenship and on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens, should be addressed as a matter 
of urgency. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government should ratify the United Nations Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and harmonize its 
national legislation accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Government should firmly condemn any manifestation of racism and intolerance 
against the Caucasian and Central Asian population, ensure that they are investigated in a 
prompt, thorough and impartial manner and that those guilty of ethnically motivated 
agitation and violence are adequately prosecuted and punished. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Government should adopt a comprehensive federal plan for the Roma 
community, aiming at both promoting and respecting their cultural identity and at 
eradicating their social and economic marginalization, in particular, poor housing 
conditions, lack of documents, the high level of dropouts of Roma children at school and 
the difficulties of the Roma to access employment. The plan should also aim at sensitizing 
the Russian society to Roma history and traditions, in order to eliminate the negative 
stigma and stereotypes Roma are recurrently associated with. The problem of housing 
evictions should be treated as a matter of priority. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In parallel with a political and legal strategy, the Government should adopt an ethical 
and cultural strategy that tackles the deepest roots of racism and xenophobia and is built 
around the promotion of reciprocal knowledge of cultures and values, the interaction 
among the different communities and the link between the fight against racism, xenophobia 
and discrimination and the long-term construction of a democratic, equalitarian and 
interactive multicultural society. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.3 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>93. <b>The Government is encouraged to revise school curricula and school textbooks, 
including history books, to ensure that issues related to human, cultural and social 
advantages of multiculturalism are reflected. Issues of mutual respect, promotion of 
tolerance and also of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia need to be properly 
covered in school curricula and teacher-training courses. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Government should consider launching a process, with the participation of the 
media, to reflect on the role and responsibility of the media in the fight against racism and 
xenophobia and the promotion of tolerance, with the aim of adopting a deontological code 
of conduct. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to the establishment of an OHCHR 
human rights presence within the United Nations Country Team in Moscow and 
recommends that the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance constitute an important part of its work.</b>
