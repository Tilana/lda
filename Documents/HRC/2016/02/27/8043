<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of human rights in Colombia 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Corrigendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 47 
</b></p>
<p>For the existing text <i>substitute 
</i></p>
<p>47. Between January and October, OHCHR-Colombia continued to receive reports of violations 
</p>
<p>of the right to life and personal integrity relating to excessive or improper use of force by the 
</p>
<p>military. For example, on 7 October, army members entered a village centre in Pat&#237;a, Cauca, and 
</p>
<p>opened fire on a shop, killing a 13-year-old girl and three alleged guerrilla members, and wounding 
</p>
<p>two other civilians in violation of international humanitarian law principles, including military 
</p>
<p>necessity, precaution and non-reciprocity. In other cases, in order to cover up the execution, the 
</p>
<p>military members involved said that the guerrilla members opened fire, thus undermining truth, 
</p>
<p>accountability and prevention. Such was the case in Tambo, Cauca, on 5 April, when a member of 
</p>
<p>the army opened fire on a bus, killing two civilians and injuring eight people. In other cases, arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deprivation of life is denied, under the argument that the person responsible acted without intent of 
</p>
<p>causing the death. This was the case of a soldier who opened fire on an Embera indigenous couple, 
</p>
<p>who was fishing in Pueblo Rico, Risaralda on 21 June. The woman, who was pregnant, died as a 
</p>
<p>result. The High Commissioner is concerned that while in a number of cases there is evidence that a 
</p>
<p>human rights violation has been committed, senior officials are often too willing to accept a different 
</p>
<p>version of events that undermines internal and criminal investigations.<b>
