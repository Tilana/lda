(b) Financlal Instruments
(i) Classiﬁcation
The Fund's investments are categorised as held at fair value through profit or loss. They comprise:
~ Financial instruments designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss upon initial recognition
These include ﬁnancial assets and financial liabilities that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold. These
are investments in fixed interest securities.
Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception are those that are managed and their
performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Fund‘s documented investment strategy. The Fund's
policy is for the Responsible Entity to evaluate the information about these ﬁnancial instruments on a fair value basis
together with other related financial information.
(ii) Recognition/derecognition
The Fund recognises financial assets and financial liabilities on the date it becomes party to the contractual agreement
(trade date) and recognises changes in fair value of the financial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities from this date.
Investments are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or the Fund has
transferred substantially all risks and remrds of ownership.
(iii) Measurement
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss
At initial recognition, the Fund measures a financial asset at its fair value. Transaction costs of financial assets held at fair
value through proﬁt or loss are expensed in the Statement of comprehensive inoonie,
Subsequent to initial recognition. all ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are
measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets or financial liabilities
held at fair value through profit or loss’ category are presented in the Statement of comprehensive income within net
gains/(losses) on financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities traded in active markets is subsequently based on their quoted market prices
at the end of the reporting period without any deduction for estimated future selling costs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are determined using valuation
techniques. The Fund uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at
each reporting dater Valuation techniques used include the use of comparable recent arm's length transactions, reference
to other instruments that are substantially the same. discounted cash flow analysis. option pricing models and other
valuation techniques commonly used by market participants making the maximum use of market inputs and relying as little
as possible on entity-specific inputs.
Further details on how the fair values of ﬁnancial instruments are determined are disclosed in note 4‘
(iv) offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of ﬁnancial position when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis. or realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously
As at the end of the reporting period, there are no financial assets or liabilities offset or with the right to offset in the

Interest income is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income using the eflective interest method.

discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts throughout the expected life of the linancial instrument. or a shorter
period where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset or liability When calculating the ellective interest
rate, the Fund estimates cash ﬂows considering all contractual terms at the ﬁnancial instrument (tor example, prepayment
options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between the parties to
the contract that are an integral part ol the eﬂective interest rate. including transaction costs and all other premiums or
discounts.

Realised capital losses are not distributed to unitholders but are retained in the Fund to be oltset against any realised
capital gains, ll realised capital gains exceed realised capital losses, the excess is distributed to unitholders.
(It) Distributions
In accordance with the Fund’s Constitution. the Fund distributes its distributable (taxable) income and any other amounts
determined by the Responsible Entity, to unitholders by cash or reinvestment. The distributions are payable in accordance
with the constitution and recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income as ﬁnance costs attributable to unitholders.

standards (to the extent relevant to the Fund) and interpretations is set out below:

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements

(continued)
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
is) New accounting standards and interpretations icontinued)
(i) AASB 9 Financial Instruments (and applicable amendments). (effective from 1 January 2018)
AASB 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classiﬁcation, measurement and derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and
ﬁnancial liabilities. It has now also introduced revised rules around hedge accounting and impairment. The standard
is not applicable until 1 January 2018 but is available for early adoption.
The directors do not expect this to have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement oi the Fund's
financial instruments as they are carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
The derecognition rules have not been changed from the previous requirements. and the Fund does not apply hedge
accounting. AASB 9 introduces a new impairment model. However, as the Fund’s investments are all held at fair value
through proﬁt or loss. the change in impairment rules will not impact the Fund.
The Fund has not yet decided when to adopt AASB 9.
(ii) AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. (effective from 1 January 2018)
The AASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace AASB 118 which covers
contracts for goods and services and AASB 111 which covers construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to
a customer— so the notion of control replaces the existing notion oi risks and rewards.
The Fund's main sources of income are interest and gains on ﬁnancial instruments held at fairvalue. All of these are
outside the scope of the new revenue standard. As consequence. the directors do not expect the adoption of the new
revenue recognition rules to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Fund's accounting policies or the amounts recognised in
the ﬁnancial statements.
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that are expected to have a material impact on the Fund in the
current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable luture transactions.
3 Financial risk management
The Fund's activities expose it to a variety 0! ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including price risk. foreign exchange risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Fund‘s overall risk management programme focuses on ensuring compliance with the Fund's PDS and seeks to
maximise the returns derived for the level of risk to which the Fund is exposed. The Fund may use derivative ﬁnancial
instruments to alter certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by the Investment Manager under an Investment Mandate approved by the Board
of Directors of the Responsible Entity (the ‘Board").
The Fund uses diflerent methods to measure different types of risk to which it Is exposed. These methods are explained
below
(a) Market risk
(i) Price Risk
The Fund invests in a diversiﬁed portfolio of Australian ﬁxed rate bonds. The Fund is exposed to fixed interest securities
price risk. The risk is that the value of a Fund‘s investment portfolio will ﬂuctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
The risk is inﬂuenced by economic, technological, political and legal conditions and sentiment. all ol which can change.
This can mean that assets held by the Fund in these markets may fall in value,

3 Financial risk management (continued)
(a) Market risk lcontlnued)
(i) Price Risk (continued)
The Investment Manager manages the price risk by lollowing a clearly established investment mandate for the Fund’s
investments The majority of the Fund‘s investments are securities quoted on the S&P/AS)< Australian Fixed Interest Index
while the cash instruments are at a minimum rating of A1 or higher as rated by Standard & Poor's, The use of derivatives is
limited to a small level ol the total value of the Fund, Compliance with the Fund's PDS and investment mandate is
monitored on a daily basis and reports are provided to the Board and Compliance Committee on a regular basis.
The table on page 18 shows the impact on net asset value of the Fund of a reasonably possible shift in the 3&P/ASX
Australian Fixed Interest Index, assessed as an increase at 7% (2015: 6%) and decrease of 7% (2015: 6%) in the
S&P/ASX Australian Fixed Interest Index (with all other variables held constant). The impact mainly arises from the
reasonably possible change in the fair value 0! fixed interest securities.
(ii) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises as the value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies will ﬂuctuate
due to changes in exchange rates.
The Fund has no signiﬁcant direct loreign exchange risk exposure as the Fund operates solely in Australia and the majority
of the Fund's assets and liabilities are denominated in Australian currency.
(iii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate nsk is the risk that interest rate movements will have a negative impact on investment value or returns, interest
rate risk is managed in accordance with the underlying investment strategy ol the Fund.
The Fund’s policy is to maintain derivative adjusted exposure to cash instruments, at any point in time of no more than 25%
oi the Fund value
Compliance with the value oi cash investments held is monitored daily and reported to the Board and Compliance
Committee on a regular basis.
The table below summarises the Fund's direct exposure to interest rate risks.

An analysis of financial liabilities by maturities is provided in Note 3 paragraph (cl) below
The table in Note 3 paragraph (b) summarises the impact of an increase/decrease of interest rates on the Fund's opemting
proﬁt and net assets attributable to unitholders through changes in future cash flows. The analysis is based on the
assumption that interest rates changed by +/- 100 basis points (2015: +/- 100 basis points) from the year and rates with all
other variables held constant. The impact mainly arises from changes in the fair value of cash and cash equivalents.
(b) Summarised sensitivity analysis
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Fund's operating proﬁt and net assets attributable to unitholders to the
various market risks. The reasonably possible movements in the risk variables have been determined based on
management's best estimate. having regard to a number of factors. including historical correlation of the Fund’s
investments with the relevant benchmark and market volatlllty. However, actual movements in the risk variables may be
greater or less than anticipated due to a number of factors. including unusually large market shocks resulting from changes
in the performance of the economies, markets and securities in which the Fund invests. As a result. historic variations in
risk variables are not a definitive indicator of future variations in the risk variables.

The sensitivity factors for 30 June 2015 were +/-6% for price risk and #l—100bps for interest rate risk,
In determining the impact of an increase/decrease in net assets attributable to unilholders arising from market risk, the
Responsible Entity has considered prior period and expected future movements of the portfolio based on market
information in order to determine a reasonably posslble shift in assumptions.

Credit risk primarily arises from investments in debt securities. Other credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents.
deposits with banks and other ﬁnancial institutions and amounts due from brokers. None oi these assets are impaired nor
past due but not impaired,
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will tail to perform contractual obligations, either in whole or part. Credit risk is
managed primarily by:
- Ensuring ccunterparties. together with the respective credit limits. are approved in accordance with the Investment
Managers criteria; and
- Ensuring that transactions are undertaken with a range of counterpartles,
For derivative financial inslmments, the Investment Manager has established limits such that, at anytime. the maximum
exposure at the Fund to derivative instruments shall be limited to 10%.
Compliance with the Fund‘s mandate is monitored on a daily basis and reported to the Board and Compliance Committee
on a regular basis.
The clearing and depositary operations of the Fund's security transactions are mainly concentrated with one counterparty
namely State Street Australia Limited. At 30 June 2016. State Street Australia Limited had a credit rating oi A (2015: A). As
at 30 June 2016. substantially all cash and investments are held in custody by State Street Australia.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of each reporting period is the carrying amount oi the ﬁnancial assets. An
analysis at debt securities by rating is set out in the table below.

The Fund may, from time to time, invest in derivative contracts traded over the counter, which are not traded in an organised
market and may be illiquid. As a result, the Fund may not be able to quickly liquidate its investments in these instruments at
an amount close to their fair value to meet its liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events such as deterioration in
the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty No such investments were held at year end.

~ Derivative financial instruments
The Fund has no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a norHecurring basis in the current reporting period.

4 Fair value measurement (continued)
(b) inputs otherthan quoted prices included WIthin level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly (level 2): and
(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).
(i) Fair value in an active marker (level 1)
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities traded in active markets is based on their last traded prices at the end of the
reporting period without any deduction for estimated future selling costs.
The Fund values its investments in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2 to the financial statements.
A ﬁnancial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an
exchange, dealer, broker, industry group. pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and
regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.
(ii) Valuation techniques used to derive level 2 and level 3 fair value
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are not exchange-traded in an active market is determined using
valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm's length market transactions. reference to the current lair value
of a substantially similar other instrument, discounted cash flow techniques. option pricing models or any other valuation
technique that provides a reliable estimate of prices obtained in actual market transactions.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used. estimated future cash ﬂows are based on management‘s best estimates
and the discount rate used is a market rate at the end of the reporting period applicable for an instrument with similar terms
and conditions.
For other pricing models. inputs are based on market data at the end of the reporting period. Fair values for unquoted
equity investments are estimated, it possible, using applicable price/earnings ratios for similar listed companies adjusted to
reflect the speciﬁc circumstances of the issuer.
The fair value of derivatives that are not exchange traded is estimated at the amount that the Fund would receive or pay to
terminate the contract at the end of the reporting period taking into account current market conditions (volatility and
appropriate yield curve) and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair value of a forward contract is
determined as a net present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at appropriate market rates as at the
valuation dale.
Some of the inputs to these models may not be market observable and are therefore estimated based on assumptions
The output of a model is always an estimate or approximation of a value that cannot be determined with certainty, and
valuation techniques employed may not fully reflect all factors relevant to the positions the Fund holds. Valuations are
therefore adjusted, where appropriate, to allow for additional factors Including liquidity risk and counterparty risk.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the ﬁnancial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial report, whether due to fraud or error. In

and fair presentation of the ﬁnancial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the ﬁnancial report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

2001.
