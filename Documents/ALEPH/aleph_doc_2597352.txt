EXPLANATORY NOTE
On November 13th, 2013, Santo Mining Corp.
filed its Yearend Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year end period July 31st,
2013 (the Original Report). On November
26th, 2013, the Registrant filed
Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A the
purpose of this Amendment is solely to:
(1) make adjustments to certain XBRL
(eXtensible Business Reporting Language)
information filed as part of the Form 10-K;
and (2) amend Item 15 to include Exhibits 31.1
and 32.1, which were previously filed but not
included in the exhibit and financial
statement schedules.   This Amendment
speaks as of the original filing date
of the Form 10-K, does not reflect events
that may have occurred subsequent to the
original filing date, and does not modify
or update in any way disclosures,
financial statements or supplementary
data made in the original Form 10-K.
On August 5th, 2016, the Registrant filed
Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A is
being filed solely for the purpose of
correcting the shell company disclosure
on Item 1. Business Overview and Item 7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations. Except as described above,
this Form 10-K/A does not amend or update
any information contained in the Original
Report to reflect events occurring subsequent
to the original filing dates or otherwise.
Santo Pita Corporation was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2009.
Its business operations were divided
into two segments.  The first segment
which was launched in mid-May, ahead of
its slated completion date of June, 2011
is DR DENTAL SPA, which will be an informative
and interactive website portal, where both
dentists and patients can access dental
information and, in the future, have
video-to-video online consultations.
In September 21st, 2010 the company files
an S-1 Registration to the Securities
Exchange under the Securities Act of 1933.
Santo Pita Corporation Filed its 10-K
Fiscal Yearend July 31st, 2011 on November
3rd, 2011 File No. 333-169503/Film No. 111175531.
This filling clearly indicates that the company
has never been a SHELL.  The company clearly
check marked that it was not a SHELL.
Additionally, the company had operations,
which is evident in the first 10-K and
additional 10-Q fillings.  These filings
were Audited by GBH.
The 8-K filed on July 31st, 2012 by
Santo Mining Corp. File No. 333-169503/
Film No. 12994770 referencing FORM 10 DISCLOSURE
The Company was a shell company (as
such term is defined in Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act immediately
before the acquisition of the Claim.
Accordingly, pursuant to the requirements
of Item 2.01(a)(f) of Form 8-K, set forth
below is the information that would be required
if the Company was required to file a general form
for registration of securities on Form 10 under the
Exchange Act with respect to its common stock
(which is the only class of the Companys securities
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13
or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act upon acquiring
the Claim).  Any information required by Form 10
that is not included herein, is incorporated by
reference the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the Commission) on November 2, 2011.
Is totally a contradiction to the 10-K Fiscal
Yearend July 31st, 2011 on November 3rd, 2011
File No. 333-169503/Film No. 111175531.
In Addition, all other mentions of the
company being a SHELL under the 8-K filed
on July 31st, 2012 by Santo Mining Corp.
File No. 333-169503/Film No. 12994770, is
incorrect and evident on Santo Pita
Corporation Filed its 10-K Fiscal Yearend
July 31st, 2011 on November 3rd, 2011 File
No. 333-169503/Film No. 111175531 and including
two legal opinions by two independent SEC Attorneys
and a Sworn Affidavit from the previous CEO of
Santo Mining Corp.
