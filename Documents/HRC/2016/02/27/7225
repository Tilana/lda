<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  In its resolution 12/2, the Human Rights Council, condemned all acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation and reprisal against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate, are 
</p>
<p>cooperating or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in the field of human rights committed by State and non-State actors. As 
</p>
<p>mandated by resolution 12/2, I have reported annually on cases of alleged intimidation and 
</p>
<p>reprisals and analysed relevant developments within the United Nations system and made 
</p>
<p>recommendations on how to address this issue. 
</p>
<p>2.  As I have stressed in my previous reports, all acts of intimidation and reprisal, no 
</p>
<p>matter how subtle or explicit, are completely and utterly unacceptable and should be halted 
</p>
<p>immediately and unconditionally. The targeting of individuals or groups seeking to 
</p>
<p>cooperate, cooperating or having cooperated with the United Nations in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights, their families, legal representatives and affiliated non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>runs contrary to the principle of human dignity and violates numerous human rights, 
</p>
<p>showing complete contempt and disregard for the United Nations system as a whole.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Developments in response to acts of intimidation and reprisal 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 8 September 2014, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
</p>
<p>his opening statement to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session, 
</p>
<p>condemned all acts of reprisal against individuals for their engagement with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations stressing that their continued support and contributions are needed to realize 
</p>
<p>progress and encouraging the Council to ensure that their voices can be raised safely. On 22 
</p>
<p>October 2014, in his address to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, he added 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;if despite all the power and authority at its disposal, the future of a Government hangs 
</p>
<p>on a tweet, a street protest or a helpful report to an NGO or UN agency, then that 
</p>
<p>Government is in far deeper trouble than it believes. For it has forgotten the fundamental 
</p>
<p>principle that the State is the servant of its people &#8211; not the other way round&#8221;. On 2 March 
</p>
<p>2015, at the twenty-eighth session of the Council, he appealed to States to &#8220;focus on the 
</p>
<p>substance of the complaint rather than lash out at the critic&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>4. On 25 February 2015, the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, 
</p>
<p>during the annual civil society briefing, stated that he would continue to work closely with 
</p>
<p>the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) and remain vigilant to situations of 
</p>
<p>intimidation and reprisals. While awaiting further action on Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 24/24 by the General Assembly, I welcome the proactive stance of the different 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights representatives and mechanisms and their recent steps taken 
</p>
<p>towards providing a coherent and coordinated response to reprisals.  
</p>
<p>5. Over the past year, the Presidency of the Human Rights Council has developed a 
</p>
<p>consistent approach to all cases of intimidation or reprisal relating to the Council, its 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and procedures brought to its attention. During the twenty-seventh session, on 
</p>
<p>19 September 2014, and at each subsequent session, the President reminded those present 
</p>
<p>of the Council&#8217;s firm position that any act of intimidation or reprisal against individuals or 
</p>
<p>groups, or anyone linked to them, is unacceptable, and that all such cases brought to the 
</p>
<p>President&#8217;s attention would be followed up bilaterally with the States concerned. During his 
</p>
<p>closing statement at the twenty-eighth session, on 27 March 2015, the President expressed 
</p>
<p>his alarm at the continued reports of intimidation and reprisals against those that sought to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the Council, and stated that much more needed to be done to stop these 
</p>
<p>attacks.  </p>


<p>6. At the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council, a number of States 
</p>
<p>drew attention to the issue of reprisals by referring to my report (A/HRC/27/38) and 
</p>
<p>expressed their concern and condemnation of such acts. In addition, further to the roles and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of States and the United Nations system in addressing the issue of reprisals 
</p>
<p>specified in several Council resolutions, the Council, in its resolution 27/18, recognized the 
</p>
<p>role that national human rights institutions can play in preventing and addressing cases of 
</p>
<p>reprisal as part of supporting the cooperation with the United Nations in the promotion of 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>7.  At their 26th annual meeting, held from 23 to 27 June 2015, the Chairpersons of 
</p>
<p>human rights treaty bodies reiterated their strong condemnation of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>reprisals against persons seeking to engage with the treaty bodies and invited all treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies that had not yet done so to establish the mandate of rapporteur on reprisals 
</p>
<p>(A/69/285, paras. 107-109). In follow-up to the meeting, the Subcommittee on Prevention 
</p>
<p>of Torture announced on 26 February 2015 that it had appointment one of its members as a 
</p>
<p>reprisals focal point. At their 27th meeting, held from 22 to 26 June 2015, the Chairpersons 
</p>
<p>further developed and adopted a set of guidelines against intimidation or reprisals, the &#8220;San 
</p>
<p>Jos&#233; Guidelines&#8221; (HRI/MC/2015/6). 
</p>
<p>8. When presenting the annual report of the special procedures to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council at its twenty-eighth session (A/HRC/28/41), the Chairperson of the Coordination 
</p>
<p>Committee of Special Procedures stressed that the ability of individuals and groups to raise 
</p>
<p>concerns with special procedures without fear of reprisals was vital to their ability to 
</p>
<p>discharge their respective mandates. He stressed that reprisals are a critical challenge facing 
</p>
<p>not only special procedures but the whole United Nations system. A coordinated response 
</p>
<p>to these unacceptable practices should therefore come from the United Nations system as a 
</p>
<p>whole. While referring to Council resolution 24/24, he reiterated the support of the special 
</p>
<p>procedures for the designation of a United Nations focal point on reprisals.1 Several special 
</p>
<p>procedure mandate holders individually also raised concerns over acts of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>reprisal; some even reported that they had witnessed such acts being committed in person 
</p>
<p>during country visits, and called upon the Council to take action on these cases 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/66/Add.2, para. 84 (c) and A/HRC/29/25/Add.2, paras. 13-17). In follow-up to 
</p>
<p>the annual meeting of the special procedures in 2014, at which mandate holders had 
</p>
<p>identified the need to develop a systematic approach to the issue of reprisals, they adopted 
</p>
<p>modalities for an enhanced response to the issue at their meeting in 2015 and decided to 
</p>
<p>appoint a focal point on reprisals from among Coordination Committee members.  
</p>
<p>9. In my previous report, I referred to the concerns expressed by various stakeholders 
</p>
<p>over the large number of deferrals of applications of non-governmental organizations for 
</p>
<p>consultative status with the Economic and Social Council by the Committee on Non-
</p>
<p>Governmental Organizations (A/HRC/27/38, para. 8). The Special Rapporteur on the rights 
</p>
<p>to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association reflected similar concerns in his most 
</p>
<p>recent report to the General Assembly (A/69/365, paras. 73-74 and 88 (a)). The Committee 
</p>
<p>has a key role to play in ensuring that non-governmental organizations may participate in 
</p>
<p>the work of the United Nations and have access to human rights mechanisms. I call on the 
</p>
<p>Committee to apply the criteria for assessing non-governmental organizations in a fair and 
</p>
<p>transparent manner. 
</p>
<p>10. I reiterate my strong belief that the issue of reprisals needs a consistent approach at 
</p>
<p>international and regional levels. In this context, I reiterate my appreciation for the strong 
</p>
<p>stance taken by the Secretary-General of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Rights, as expressed on 26 June 2014 during the twenty-third African Union summit. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 OHCHR, &#8220;Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, the Chairperson of the Coordination Committee, presents the annual 
</p>
<p>report of special procedures to the Council&#8221;, 18 March 2015. </p>


<p>Commission focal point on reprisals stated at its fifty-sixth ordinary session that there was a 
</p>
<p>genuine need to pursue dialogue with all stakeholders and to put in place mechanisms that 
</p>
<p>are both persuasive and deterrent, and indicated that a road map had been elaborated for 
</p>
<p>that purpose and that a detailed report on cases of reprisals would be presented at each 
</p>
<p>session.2 Both the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Commissioner on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights of the Council of Europe have also publicly denounced acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>and reprisal against individuals and organizations cooperating with them.3 I encourage the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms and their regional counterparts to 
</p>
<p>continue to strengthen cooperation and mutually reinforce each other&#8217;s efforts in addressing 
</p>
<p>reprisals. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Information received on cases of reprisal for cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Methodological framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. The present report covers information gathered from 1 June 2014 to 31 May 2015 
</p>
<p>and, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 12/2, contains information on 
</p>
<p>acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Seek to cooperate, or have cooperated with, the United Nations, its representatives 
</p>
<p>and mechanisms in the field of human rights, or who have provided testimony or 
</p>
<p>information to them 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avail or have availed themselves of procedures established under the auspices of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and all 
</p>
<p>those who have provided legal or other assistance to them for that purpose 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Submit or have submitted communications under procedures established by human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to them 
</p>
<p>for that purpose 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are relatives of victims of human rights violations or of those who have provided 
</p>
<p>legal or other assistance to victims 
</p>
<p>12. Information about acts of intimidation and reprisal has been received in relation to 
</p>
<p>cooperation with OHCHR, including its field presences, the Human Rights Council, the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review mechanism, human rights treaty bodies, the special procedures, 
</p>
<p>the commission of inquiry on Eritrea and the independent commission of inquiry on the 
</p>
<p>2014 Gaza conflict. The information was verified and corroborated by primary and other 
</p>
<p>sources, where available, and in most cases reference was made to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>publication in which the information included in the present report was first made public. 
</p>
<p>The report also reflects public responses or reactions from Governments received by 31 
</p>
<p>July 2015.  
</p>
<p>13.  Additional information received on cases included in my previous two reports has 
</p>
<p>been included under the follow-up section (see annex). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Inter-session report of Commissioner Gansou, May 2014 &#8211; April 2015, African Commision on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, fifty-sixth ordinary session. 
</p>
<p> 3 See Organization of American States, &#8220;IACHR wraps up its 154th session&#8221;, 27 March 2015, and 
</p>
<p>annual activity report 2014 by Nils Mui&#382;nieks, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>


<p>14. It should be recalled that the cases included in the present report are not exhaustive. 
</p>
<p>They are examples of a larger number of mostly invisible cases. In accordance with the 
</p>
<p>principle of do no harm, risk assessments were conducted on a case-by-case basis, resulting 
</p>
<p>in the exclusion of those cases where the risk to the safety and well-being of the individuals 
</p>
<p>concerned was deemed too high. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Summary of cases 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 14 October 2014, a number of special procedure mandate holders raised 
</p>
<p>concerns over possible acts of reprisal against Nabeel Rajab, President of the Bahrain 
</p>
<p>Center for Human Rights, in connection with his arrest and detention on 1 October 2014, a 
</p>
<p>day after returning to Bahrain from Europe where he had met with representatives of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR (A/HRC/28/85, case BHR 13/2014). The Government, in its response dated 24 
</p>
<p>November 2014 (ibid.), stated that there had been no reprisals but that Mr. Rajab had been 
</p>
<p>charged with publicly defaming the Ministry of the Interior and security forces in relation 
</p>
<p>to statements that he had posted on his Twitter account, and that the court had ordered his 
</p>
<p>release pending trial but banned him from travelling. In its letter on reprisals of 13 May 
</p>
<p>2015, the Committee against Torture expressed its fear that Mr. Rajab might have been 
</p>
<p>rearrested and detained on 2 April 2015, this time in connection with the submission by the 
</p>
<p>Bahrain Center for Human Rights of an alternative report submitted to the Committee for 
</p>
<p>its fifty-fourth session. Following his arrest, Mr. Rajab was reportedly detained at the Isa 
</p>
<p>Twon detention centre and his house raided by government security forces. The Ministry of 
</p>
<p>the Interior reportedly subsequently announced that Mr. Rajab had been &#8220;captured&#8221; after 
</p>
<p>publishing information that would harm civil peace and insulting a statutory body. As 
</p>
<p>reported by the Committee in its letter on reprisals of 13 May 2015, on 11 May 2015, the 
</p>
<p>High Court of Bahrain reportedly extended Mr. Rajab&#8217;s detention by 15 days. At the time 
</p>
<p>of finalization of the present report, no response to the letter sent by the Committee had 
</p>
<p>been received from the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Burundi 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Committee against Torture, in its letter on reprisals of 25 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>referred to allegations of serious threats against Pacifique Nininahazwe, President of Forum 
</p>
<p>pour la conscience et le d&#233;veloppement, following his briefing to the Committee in relation 
</p>
<p>to its consideration of the second periodic report of Burundi at its fifty-third session 
</p>
<p>(CAT/C/BDI/2). On 28 November 2014, the Committee addressed a second letter to the 
</p>
<p>Government in which it stated that it had also been informed of serious threats against Mr. 
</p>
<p>Nininahazwe&#8217;s family. In its reply of 5 December 2014, the Government denied the 
</p>
<p>allegations, stating that while no one would be prosecuted for the legal exercise of their 
</p>
<p>human rights work, no one was above the law and the defence of human rights could not be 
</p>
<p>invoked as grounds  for violating the law. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. China 
</b></p>
<p>17. In its concluding observations on the seventh and eighth periodic reports of China, 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern that 
</p>
<p>some reports that it received from non-governmental organizations had been censored by 
</p>
<p>State agents and that some organization representatives feared reprisals by the State party as 
</p>
<p>a result of their submission (see CEDAW/C/CHN/CO/7-8, paras. 32-33); see also 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/SR.1251, paras. 21, 33, 58 and 61). The Committee also expressed concern at 
</p>
<p>reports of travel restrictions imposed on at least one woman human rights activist who 
</p>
<p>intended to brief the Committee, and recommended that the Government take all necessary 
</p>
<p>measures to protect women human rights defenders and to ensure that no such travel </p>


<p>restrictions would be placed on anyone in the future. It also recommended that allegations 
</p>
<p>that State agencies censored reports submitted by non-governmental organizations be 
</p>
<p>investigated, and that preventive measures for non-occurrence be taken. When requested to 
</p>
<p>comment on these concerns during the consideration of the report, a member of the 
</p>
<p>delegation of China stated that the Government welcomed the efforts of non-governmental 
</p>
<p>and civil society organizations to promote women&#8217;s rights and that they were not subject to 
</p>
<p>reprisals of any kind for their work (CEDAW/C/SR.1251, para. 61). <b> </b>  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 5 June 2014, the Committee against Torture, in a letter on reprisals, and a 
</p>
<p>number of special procedure mandate holders referred to allegations of reprisals against 
</p>
<p>Doros Polykarpou, Executive Director of Action for Support, Equality and Antiracism, for 
</p>
<p>having submitted an alternative report on the situation of detained undocumented migrants, 
</p>
<p>including at the Mennogeia Detention Centre, to the Committee prior to the consideration 
</p>
<p>of the State&#8217;s fourth periodic report (CAT/C/CYP/4) at its fifty-second session (see also 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/28/85, case CYP 3/2014). On 29 May 2014, a few days after the Committee 
</p>
<p>published its concluding observations, Mr. Polykarpou was reportedly arrested upon arrival 
</p>
<p>at the detention centre by its administration for failing to pay a parking fine and transferred 
</p>
<p>to the Central Prison in Nicosia, placed in a wing with convicted prisoners and denied 
</p>
<p>access to a lawyer and drinking water. Mr. Polykarpou was released later that day after his 
</p>
<p>organization paid the fine. The Government, in its response of 5 August 2014 to a 
</p>
<p>communication by mandate holders, stressed that it attributed great significance to human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments and had provided information on the arrest warrants issued against Mr. 
</p>
<p>Polykarpou (see A/HRC/28/85, case CYP 3/2014). Taking into account the seriousness of 
</p>
<p>the allegations, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, in his report submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
</p>
<p>eighth session, requested additional information (A/HRC/28/68/Add.1, paras. 130-133). At 
</p>
<p>the time of finalization of the present report, the Government had not responded to the 
</p>
<p>latest request of the Special Rapporteur or the letters addressed by the Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Eritrea  
</b></p>
<p>19. The risk of reprisals against anyone cooperating with the commission of inquiry on 
</p>
<p>human rights in Eritrea, or their relatives still residing in the country, was one of the main 
</p>
<p>challenges that the commission faced in carrying out its mandate. Regardless of the country 
</p>
<p>or location, almost all victims and witnesses in contact with the commission assumed that 
</p>
<p>they were still being monitored in secret and were afraid to testify, even on a confidential 
</p>
<p>basis, out of fear for reprisals by the Eritrean authorities against themselves and their family 
</p>
<p>members residing in Eritrea. The commission witnessed one specific episode of such 
</p>
<p>monitoring, and recalled that it is the primary responsibility of the States of nationality or 
</p>
<p>residence to protect all persons who cooperated with it, and urged Member States to 
</p>
<p>provide additional protection where necessary (A/HRC/29/42, paras. 17-18). During the 
</p>
<p>interactive dialogue on the report at the twenty-ninth session of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>the Government did not address the allegations of reprisals. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Gambia 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions reported that their joint visit to the Gambia early in November 2014 had been 
</p>
<p>conducted in an atmosphere of apprehension and genuine fear among civil society, victims, 
</p>
<p>witnesses and other interlocutors about possible reprisals (A/HRC/28/68/Add.4, para. 96, </p>


<p>A/HRC/29/37/Add.2, paras. 80-81).4 Despite assurances received from the Government that 
</p>
<p>none of the individuals cooperating with the mandate holders would be threatened, harassed 
</p>
<p>or punished, it was reported that some of the individuals no longer residing in the Gambia 
</p>
<p>were after the visit being pursued by the authorities. Even though it was difficult to verify 
</p>
<p>this information, the Special Rapporteur on torture received information concerning one 
</p>
<p>such case that he considered credible.With regard to the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions, the Government expressed its dismay at the &#8220;biased 
</p>
<p>manner&#8221; in which the report had been presented, stating that the allegations that it contained 
</p>
<p>were unsubstantiated and lacked merit (A/HRC/29/37/Add.6, para. 1). 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>21. On 5 May 2015, a number of special procedure mandate holders raised allegations 
</p>
<p>of acts of intimidation against members of Plataforma EPU, a network of 51 civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, for their engagement with the universal periodic review process of Honduras 
</p>
<p>prior to its review on 8 May 2015 (A/HRC/30/27, case HND 1/2015). On 6 and 7 April 
</p>
<p>2015, government officials reportedly publicly warned the national and international 
</p>
<p>community of a smear campaign initiated by certain non-governmental organizations meant 
</p>
<p>to taint the image of the country in the context of its review. On 9 April, the National 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights reportedly warned that certain groups might use events to 
</p>
<p>pursue their own interests, referring specifically to the information submitted by non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations for the review of Honduras. The media allegedly repeated these 
</p>
<p>stigmatizing declarations for several days, including on 10 April, when they alleged that

<p><b> 8. Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>22. On 11 June 2014, a number of special procedure mandate holders expressed grave 
</p>
<p>concerns at allegations of reprisals against Omid Behrouzi, Behnam Ebrahimzadeh, 
</p>
<p>Mohammad Sadiq Kabudvand, Sa&#8217;id Matinpour, Hossein Ronaghi-Maleki and Abdolfattah 
</p>
<p>Soltani, all human rights defenders, detained in Evin prison, owing to the engagement of 
</p>
<p>some of them with the United Nations human rights mechanisms (A/HRC/28/85, case IRN 
</p>
<p>9/2014). On 17 April 2014, during an inspection of detainees&#8217; personal effects in ward 350 
</p>
<p>of Evin prison, the six men, together with other detainees, were reportedly severely beaten 
</p>
<p>by prison guards and security agents and transferred to solitary confinement for a period 
</p>
<p>ranging from several days to two months. On 22 April 2014, the Speaker of the National 
</p>
<p>Security Committee of Parliament reportedly justified the raid by attributing it in part to &#8220;a 
</p>
<p>series of fabricated and unfounded reports&#8221; that had been passed on from inside Evin prison 
</p>
<p>to &#8220;defiant elements such as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Iran&#8221; (ibid.). At the time of finalization of the present report, no response had been received 
</p>
<p>from the Government. 
</p>
<p>23. On 15 July 2014, a number of special procedure mandate holders, referred to 
</p>
<p>allegations of reprisals against Hadi Esmaeilzadeh, a human rights lawyer and former 
</p>
<p>member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre, which was forcibly closed in December 
</p>
<p>2008 (A/HRC/28/85, case IRN 12/2014). On 31 May 2014, the Islamic Revolutionary 
</p>
<p>Court sentenced Mr. Esmaeilzadeh to three years in prison for his involvement with the 
</p>
<p>Defenders of Human Rights Centre, and to an additional year of imprisonment for having

</p>
<p>to the Human Rights Council and other human rights organizations. In its letter dated 7 
</p>
<p>January 2015, the Government stated that, as soon as details about Mr. Esmaeilzadeh&#8217;s case 
</p>
<p>were received from the High Council for Human Rights of the Judiciary of the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran, they would be provided. It pointed out, however, that the allegations of 
</p>
<p>acts of reprisal were not founded and had been denied by Iranian judicial officials (ibid.). 
</p>
<p>At the time of finalization of the present report, the information had not yet been provided 
</p>
<p>by the Government. 
</p>
<p>24. On 21 October 2014, a number of special procedure mandate holders expressed 
</p>
<p>concerns about reported acts of reprisal against Saeed Shirzad, a human rights activist and 
</p>
<p>member of the Society for Defending Street and Working Children in Iran (A/HRC/28/85,  
</p>
<p>case IRN 25/2014). Mr. Shirzad was arrested on 2 June 2014 by officials from the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Intelligence in Tabriz and transferred to Evin prison in Tehran, where he was held in 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement for two months. On 18 August, he was allegedly verbally informed of 
</p>
<p>the charges against him, which included cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In its reply dated 11 June 2015, 
</p>
<p>the Government totally refuted the allegations of reprisals against Mr. Shirzad for 
</p>
<p>cooperating with the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/30/27, case IRN 25/2014). 
</p>
<p>25. On 25 November 2014, a number of special procedure mandate holders expressed in 
</p>
<p>a joint communication their concern at reported reprisals against Dr. Mohammad Ali 
</p>
<p>Taheri, who is serving a five-year prison sentence in solitary confinement, and his wife for 
</p>
<p>engaging with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran (A/HRC/28/85, case IRN 28/2014). In June 2014, media outlets released a 
</p>
<p>letter that Dr. Taheri had addressed to the Special Rapporteur, in which he described human 
</p>
<p>rights violations being committed in prisons in the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 2 July, the 
</p>
<p>authorities reportedly arrested and detained his wife, releasing her only after she pledged to 
</p>
<p>remain silent. A new charge of &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; carrying the death penalty was 
</p>
<p>subsequently brought against Dr. Taheri. In response, in October 2014, Dr. Taheri went on 
</p>
<p>a hunger strike and, at the time of transmission of the communication, reportedly risked 
</p>
<p>dying in detention (ibid.). At the time of finalization of the present report, the Government 
</p>
<p>had not provided a response on this case. 
</p>
<p>26. In the same communication, the mandate holders also referred to reports of reprisals 
</p>
<p>against Mohammad Reza Pourshajari, a blogger, in relation to his engagement with the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mr. 
</p>
<p>Pourshajari was arrested on 30 September 2014 by security forces in Orumieh and held in 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement for 14 days before being transferred to Karaj prison on 14 October 
</p>
<p>while awaiting trial on several charges, including for having been in contact with the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. In a letter dated 21 April 2015, the Government confirmed the charges 
</p>
<p>against Mr. Pourshajari of &#8220;embarking on propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran 
</p>
<p>and futile attempt to illegally leave the country&#8221;, while rejecting the other allegations as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;utterly baseless&#8221; (A/HRC/29/50, case IRN 28/2014). 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Israel 
</b></p>
<p>27. The independent commission of inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict, when presenting 
</p>
<p>its report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-ninth session (A/HRC/29/52), reported 
</p>
<p>that some sources had feared for possible consequences of testifying before the 
</p>
<p>Commission or of proactively cooperating with it. The Commissioners were disturbed by 
</p>
<p>recent reports on the possible cancellation of national service allocation for Israeli non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations in the context of the publication of its report, and added that the 
</p>
<p>organizations cited in the media as potentially affected had in fact not cooperated with the 
</p>
<p>commission. The commissioners pointed out the implications of such actions for the rights 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders and the right to freedom of opinion and expression. </p>


<p><b> 10. Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p>28. In relation to his visit to Kazakhstan, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly and of association reported that, on 23 January 2015, unidentified 
</p>
<p>men took photographs of individuals leaving the building, in a manner commonly 
</p>
<p>associated with secret police surveillance, where he had just held a meeting 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/25/Add.2, paras. 13-17).5 The Special Rapporteur submitted a formal complaint 
</p>
<p>to the authorities and received reassurances that a full investigation would be conducted. 
</p>
<p>The next day, the authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that they had apprehended an 
</p>
<p>individual who confessed to have taken the photographs; the Special Rapporteur did not, 
</p>
<p>however, identify the man as one of those he had seen. He subsequently affirmed that the 
</p>
<p>incident had been calculated to instil fear and intimidation, and reiterated that the 
</p>
<p>authorities had to guarantee that no one with whom he met would be subjected to reprisals. 
</p>
<p>The Government responded that the allegations were groundless and based on a 
</p>
<p>misunderstanding (A/HRC/29/25/Add.5, para. 6). In his oral statement to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council at its twenty-ninth session, the Special Rapporteur reiterated his dissatisfaction 
</p>
<p>with the incident, stated that the Government&#8217;s explanation was unconvincing, and urged it 
</p>
<p>to ensure that there would be no reprisals in relation to his visit. Kazakhstan, in its oral 
</p>
<p>reply to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s statement, did not address the allegations of reprisals. 
</p>
<p><b> 11. Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p>29. On 27 April 2015, a number of special procedure mandate holders referred to 
</p>
<p>serious concerns over acts of intimidation and reprisal against Nawaf al-Hendal, founder of 
</p>
<p>the Kuwait Watch Organization for Human Rights (A/HRC/30/27, case KWT 2/2015). On 
</p>
<p>22 January 2015, while in Geneva to attend the review of Kuwait during the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, scheduled for 28 January, Mr. Al-Hendal learned that an arrest warrant had 
</p>
<p>been issued against him by the State security apparatus of the Ministry of the Interior in 
</p>
<p>relation to messages he had posted on his Twitter page. On 1 February, upon arrival at 
</p>
<p>Kuwait International Airport, Mr. Al-Hendal was stopped and interrogated by officials on 
</p>
<p>his participation in the review of Kuwait. On 23 March, three days after returning from 
</p>
<p>Geneva where he delivered a statement to the Human Rights Council, Mr. Al-Hendal 
</p>
<p>monitored &#8211; without participating in &#8211; a protest outside the National Assembly in Kuwait 
</p>
<p>City in his capacity of Director of his organization. As police officers physically dispersed 
</p>
<p>the crowd, they reportedly identified Mr. Al-Hendal and assaulted, arrested and detained 
</p>
<p>him at the Criminal Investigations Department in Al-Salmiya. On 25 March, Mr. Al-Hendal 
</p>
<p>was released from detention but prohibited from travelling pending his trial on charges of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;participating in an illegal demonstration&#8221;. The Government, in three separate replies, 
</p>
<p>stated that no reprisals had been committed against Mr. Al-Hendal, and the travel ban 
</p>
<p>imposed on Mr. Al-Hendal had been lifted (ibid.).6  
</p>
<p><b> 12. Maldives 
</b></p>
<p>30. In a communication addressed on 3 October 2014 to the Government, a number of 
</p>
<p>special procedure mandate holders referred to allegations of reprisals against the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission of Maldives. After having submitted a report to OHCHR on 14 
</p>
<p>September 2014 in view of the review of Maldives at the twenty-second session of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review, and publishing it on its website, the Supreme Court of Maldives

</p>
<p>the members were charged with &#8220;spreading wrongful information and giving a wrongful 
</p>
<p>impression of the constitutional mandate of the Supreme Court&#8221;. On 30 September, at the 
</p>
<p>second hearing, the Commission members were allegedly questioned about the content of 
</p>
<p>report prepared for the universal periodic review (A/HRC/28/85, case MDV 2/2014). At the 
</p>
<p>time of finalization of the present report, no response had been received from the 
</p>
<p>Government to the communication sent by the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>31. On 6 May 2015, during its review, the Government stated that the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission staff members enjoyed immunity from prosecution or complaints for acts done 
</p>
<p>in good faith within the purview of their functions. Given however that the case against the 
</p>
<p>Commission members had yet to be decided, the Government deemed it inappropriate to 
</p>
<p>comment further on the issue. On 19 May, after having received reports that the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court had found the Commission&#8217;s submission for the universal periodic review was 
</p>
<p>unlawful and declared that the Commission had to comply with a set of 11 guidelines, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a press release, stated that the 
</p>
<p>judgement appeared to be &#8220;designed to severely undermine its ability to engage with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights system&#8221;.7 On the same day, two special procedure mandate 
</p>
<p>holders jointly called upon the Supreme Court of Maldives to reconsider its verdict.8 On 19 
</p>
<p>June, the President of the Human Rights Council raised the case with the Council Bureau 
</p>
<p>and referred to it in a general manner when, at the twenty-ninth session of the Council, he 
</p>
<p>opened the general debate under item 6 on 26 June 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>  13. Myanmar 
</b></p>
<p>32. On 12 August 2014, a number of mandate holders referred to allegations of reprisal 
</p>
<p>against Sein Than, a human rights defender and leader of a movement denouncing the 
</p>
<p>confiscation and demanding the restitution of Mi Chaung Kan land (A/HRC/28/85, case 
</p>
<p>MMR 5/2014). On 31 July 2014, while on his way to the United Nations office to deliver 
</p>
<p>documents for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, in 
</p>
<p>follow-up to their meeting during her visit to the country earlier that month, Mr. Than was 
</p>
<p>reportedly arrested with force, causing him injury, by 10 plain-clothed individuals who 
</p>
<p>allegedly did not present an arrest warrant. He was reportedly subsequently detained on 
</p>
<p>remand pending trial at Insein prison on charges related to the conduct of a peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly or procession without the permission of the authorities. In reply, on 27 October 
</p>
<p>2014, the Government affirmed that Mr. Than had been lawfully arrested, detained and 
</p>
<p>sentenced for having organized processions and staged protests in different townships 
</p>
<p>between March and May 2014 without prior approval (ibid.). 
</p>
<p><b> 14. Oman 
</b></p>
<p>33. On 29 September 2014, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association, with two other mandate holders, referred to allegations of 
</p>
<p>reprisals against Tariq al Sabbahi in relation to his visit to the country from 8 to 13 
</p>
<p>September 2014 (A/HRC/28/85, case OMN 2/2014). On 10 and 11 September, after having 
</p>
<p>met with the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Al Sabbahi received a telephone call summoning him 
</p>
<p>to meet with officers from the internal security department. On 14 September, during the 
</p>
<p>meeting, the internal security officers reportedly informed him that he was forbidden from

</p>
<p>Commission of Oman. The Government, in its response of 16 December, denied the 
</p>
<p>allegations of harassment, and explained that the main purpose of the meeting had been to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;discuss the comments Tariq had made on the human rights situation in Oman in light of 
</p>
<p>the contact he had with the Special Rapporteur&#8221; and that &#8220;the current procedures of the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Committee allow individuals to submit any comments they may 
</p>
<p>wish to make concerning human rights issues [&#8230;] so that individuals do not have to address 
</p>
<p>those foreign organizations themselves&#8221; (ibid.). 
</p>
<p>34. Following reports of reprisals against Said Ali Said Jadad, a human rights defender 
</p>
<p>advocating for democratic reforms in the country, three joint communications were 
</p>
<p>addressed by mandate holders to the Government, on 11 November and 16 December 2014, 
</p>
<p>and 29 January 2015. After meeting with the Special Rapporteur during his above-
</p>
<p>mentioned country visit, Mr. Jadad was reportedly subjected to greater surveillance. On 31 
</p>
<p>October 2014, while on his way to board a flight to Istanbul to attend a workshop for 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, Mr. Jadad was stopped, his passport confiscated and informed of a 
</p>
<p>travel ban issued against him by border control officers at Muscat International Airport. On 
</p>
<p>10 December, members of the Oman Royal Police and the Internal Security Forces 
</p>
<p>reportedly arrested Mr. Jadad at his house in Salalah. He was released on 22 December 
</p>
<p>2014 after his son&#8217;s passport was confiscated as a guarantee, but rearrested on 21 January 
</p>
<p>2015, reportedly on charges of, inter alia, undermining the prestige of the State

<p>(A/HRC/28/85, case OMN 3/2014, and A/HRC/29/50, cases OMN 5/2014 and OMN 
</p>
<p>1/2015). In a press release of 30 January 2015, mandate holders urged the Government to 
</p>
<p>release Mr. Jadad and to guarantee that no human rights defender in the country would be 
</p>
<p>subjected to any form of reprisal.9 In response to the second communication and the press 
</p>
<p>release, on 20 February 2015, the Government rejected the allegations, explaining that Mr. 
</p>
<p>Jadad had been arrested not for having met with the Special Rapporteur but because of 
</p>
<p>violation of laws and regulations (A/HRC/29/50, case OMN 5/2014). 
</p>
<p>35. On 27 March 2015, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association, together with two other mandate holders,raised concerns at 
</p>
<p>alleged acts of intimidation and reprisal against Mohammad al-Fazari, a human rights 
</p>
<p>activist and blogger, also for having met with him during his country visit (ibid., OMN 
</p>
<p>2/2015). On 22 December 2014, Mr. Al-Fazari was reportedly prevented from boarding a 
</p>
<p>flight at Muscat International Airport and subjected to a de facto travel ban when his travel 
</p>
<p>documents, including his passport, were confiscated. He was reportedly summoned to 
</p>
<p>appear before the Special Division of the Omani Police in Muscat, where he was 
</p>
<p>interrogated for eight hours without any information on the reason for his interrogation or 
</p>
<p>de facto travel ban. His passport was not returned to him (ibid.). At the time of finalization 
</p>
<p>of the present report, no response had been received from the Government. In his oral 
</p>
<p>presentation to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-ninth session, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterated his dismay at all alleged cases of reprisals10 and, in his report insisted 
</p>
<p>that the Government clarify and determine whether reprisals occurred and keep him 
</p>
<p>informed of the status of investigations, prosecution and protection plans put in place 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/25/Add.3, paras. 579-581). On 17 June 2015, in its oral reply to the Special

<p>referred to his interaction with the Special Rapporteur and the United Nations more 
</p>
<p>generally. Mr. Toshev was afterwards reportedly charged with fraud for deliberately 
</p>
<p>inflicting wounds on his body with the aim of discrediting prison officials and for the 
</p>
<p>distribution of false information, tried in closed court proceedings by the Khujand city court 
</p>
<p>and, in October 2013, sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. On 25 January 2014, the </p>


<p>Sughd regional court reportedly rejected his appeal. The Government, in its response of 27 
</p>
<p>August 2014, indicated that criminal proceedings had been launched into this case and that 
</p>
<p>by Mr. Toshev&#8217;s own testimony it had become clear that there had been no acts of reprisal 
</p>
<p>on the part of prison system employees (ibid.). The Special Rapporteur, in his report, stated 
</p>
<p>that the response from the Government did not sufficiently address the concerns raised and 
</p>
<p>should have made a serious attempt to ensure accountability for the seemingly grave 
</p>
<p>violations committed against Mr. Toshev (A/HRC/28/68/Add.1, paras. 529-532). 
</p>
<p><b> 19. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</b></p>
<p>40. Allegations of acts of intimidation and reprisal against Alfredo Romero, Executive 
</p>
<p>Director of Foro Penal Venezolano, a non-governmental organization representing victims 
</p>
<p>of arbitrary detention and torture, his family and members of the organization were 
</p>
<p>addressed to the Government on 19 February 2015 by a number of mandate holders 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/50, case VEN 2/2015). Mr. Romero travelled to Geneva in November 2014 to 
</p>
<p>meet with representatives of the United Nations human rights system. After his return, he, 
</p>
<p>his family and the organization Foro Penal Venezolano were mentioned repeatedly on a 
</p>
<p>Venezuelan television programme, &#8220;Con el Mazo Dando&#8221;, during which they were 
</p>
<p>reportedly referred to as conspirators against the system in the light of their cooperation 
</p>
<p>with international human rights instruments and suspected of receiving funding from 
</p>
<p>foreign countries. In addition, Foro Penal Venezolano reportedly received anonymous 
</p>
<p>threats via Twitter. At the time of finalization of the present report, no response had been 
</p>
<p>received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> 20.  Viet Nam 
</b></p>
<p>41. On 25 November 2014, mandate holders raised allegations of acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>and reprisal in relation to the country visit of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief to Viet Nam in July 2014 (A/HRC/28/85, case VNM 11/2014). On 27 and 28 July 
</p>
<p>2014, a large number of independent Hoa Hao Buddhists were reportedly threatened and 
</p>
<p>prevented from meeting with the Special Rapporteur during his visit to An Giang Province 
</p>
<p>by police officers who had set up checkpoints in the area; the ashram and home of Bui Van 
</p>
<p>Trunga were surrounded by police officers accompanied by a large number of individuals; 
</p>
<p>Nguyen Hoang Nam was attacked by policemen and transported him to an unknown 
</p>
<p>location where they left him with a head injury; and Bui Thi Diem Thuy noticed that she 
</p>
<p>was being followed by four plain-clothed agents and thus decide not to meet the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. Several Duong Van Minh believers also reported being harassed, questioned 
</p>
<p>and some of them assaulted after having met with the Special Rapporteur. On 7 August 
</p>
<p>2014, Ma Van Pa was reportedly knocked unconscious after being hit by a motorcycle and 
</p>
<p>his family warned by an unknown individual not to pursue the case; on 9 and 10 August, Ly 
</p>
<p>Van Dung was reportedly followed by police officers when visiting his father-in-law in 
</p>
<p>another village; and on 28 August 2014, Dao Dinh Hoang was reportedly visited by two 
</p>
<p>police officers and questioned about his meeting with the Special Rapporteur (ibid.).  
</p>
<p>42. Bui Thi Kim Phuong and Nguyen Bac Truyen, who met with the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>in Ho Chi Minh City on 25 July 2014, were reportedly followed and threatened by the 
</p>
<p>police while travelling to meet the Special Rapporteur at their house in Dong Thap 
</p>
<p>Province, to which they had not been able to return since February 2014 when they were 
</p>
<p>expelled. The area near their house was however surrounded by police officers and they 
</p>
<p>were unable to meet the Special Rapporteur. On 28 August, Mr. Truyen was reportedly hit 
</p>
<p>by a motorcycle in front of his temporary place of residence in Ho Chi Minh City and 
</p>
<p>seriously injured. While the perpetrator was identified as one of the security agents who had 
</p>
<p>been monitoring Mr. Nguyen and his wife, allegedly no investigation was conducted. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, on 5 November, three individuals reportedly set up a table at the doorstep of 
</p>
<p>the residence of Mr. Nguyen and his family, blocking its entrance. Only when an official </p>


<p>from the General Consulate of France, who had been called for assistance, arrived and took 
</p>
<p>photographs did the three individuals leave. The next morning, two neighbourhood guards 
</p>
<p>from the police unit armed with batons were stationed in front of the residence (ibid.). 
</p>
<p>43. In his mission report, the Special Rapporteur expressed his deep concern and outrage 
</p>
<p>at these reports and reiterated his request to the Government of Viet Nam to reconfirm its 
</p>
<p>guarantee that none of the individuals with whom he met or intended to meet would be 
</p>
<p>subjected to any form of reprisal (A/HRC/28/66/Add.2, paras. 4, 83 (s) and 84 (c)). In its 
</p>
<p>response of 16 March 2015, to the joint communication (see A/HRC/29/50, case VNM 
</p>
<p>11/2014) and in its comments on the mission report (A/HRC/28/66/Add.4), the 
</p>
<p>Government affirmed that it had cooperated fully with the Special Rapporteur during his 
</p>
<p>visit and that the allegations had been fabricated, ill-intended and sought to &#8220;distort and 
</p>
<p>tarnish&#8221; the situation of human rights in Viet Nam. In his oral statement to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session, on 10 March 2015, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the acts of reprisal committed during his visit were a blatant violation of 
</p>
<p>the terms of reference of the visit, to which the delegate of Viet Nam responded that there 
</p>
<p>had been &#8220;no such harassment, threat nor reprisal against the persons who met with the SR 
</p>
<p>as the SR just mentioned. We deeply regret this inaccurate misleading information, and 
</p>
<p>probably misunderstandings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The present report shows that acts of intimidation and reprisal against 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals and groups seeking to cooperate, cooperating or having cooperated with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations in the field of human rights continue. The types of acts reported 
</b></p>
<p><b>seem to have become more varied and severe over time, targeting not only the 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals or groups concerned but also their families, legal representatives, non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations and anyone linked to them. This is a matter of grave 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern to me and to the United Nations system as a whole.  
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> Looking at the cases included in the present and in previous reports, a number 
</b></p>
<p><b>of recurring, though non-exhaustive, types of act may be identified. They encompass 
</b></p>
<p><b>threats and harassment by government officials, including through public statements, 
</b></p>
<p><b>media smear campaigns and police surveillance, but also forced closure of 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, including through the introduction of new legislation, physical attacks, 
</b></p>
<p><b>travel bans, arbitrary arrest, detention, including incommunicado and solitary 
</b></p>
<p><b>confinement, charges and sentencing, sometimes to lengthy prison terms, torture and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, denial of access to medical attention and, sadly, even death. Such acts not 
</b></p>
<p><b>only show a complete disregard for the functioning of the United Nations as a whole 
</b></p>
<p><b>but also highlight the fact that, despite repeated calls for action by States to end all 
</b></p>
<p><b>such violations, impunity continues to surround them. 
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> While it is the primary obligation of the State to protect those who cooperate 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the United Nations in the field of human rights and to ensure that they may do so 
</b></p>
<p><b>safely and without hindrance, the cases described in the present report suggest, 
</b></p>
<p><b>worryingly, that acts of intimidation and reprisal are often perpetrated by 
</b></p>
<p><b>government officials or representatives of the State.  
</b></p>
<p>47. <b> I reiterate that any act of intimidation or reprisal against individuals or groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>for their engagement with the United Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the field of human rights is completely unacceptable and must be halted, immediately 
</b></p>
<p><b>and unconditionally. Civil society representatives are indispensable partners for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations. Any act of intimidation or reprisal against them undermines the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective functioning of the United Nations as a whole. We must therefore step up </b></p>


<p><b>efforts and collectively condemn such acts and take all measures necessary to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that all individuals and groups, without exception, may cooperate freely and safely 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the United Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in the field of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights.  
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> I welcome the steps taken by the different parts of the United Nations, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular the President of the Human Rights Council, the special procedures and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights treaty bodies, in developing ways of addressing the issue of reprisals in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>more coherent and systematic manner, and encourage them to continue to coordinate 
</b></p>
<p><b>their efforts in resolving this system-wide issue. I also welcome the efforts made by a 
</b></p>
<p><b>number of States to provide protection to those individuals and groups engaging with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations in the field of human rights, including during the sessions of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council in Geneva. Nonetheless, more concerted action is still urgently 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed to address this issue at all levels. I urge all concerned to work cooperatively 
</b></p>
<p><b>together to ensure that the current deadlock facing Council resolution 24/24 is 
</b></p>
<p><b>overcome without further delay. In the meantime, I emphasize that the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>will continue to work for a solid and coordinated response to reprisals throughout the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations system as a whole. 
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> In 2014 I also called upon States to take action at the national level and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>refrain from, to take all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of, to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for and to consider the establishment of a national focal point to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address all acts of intimidation or reprisal against individuals and groups who seek to 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperate, are cooperating or have cooperated with the United Nations, its 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. I urge all States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>follow up and provide information, as appropriate, to the Human Rights Council on 
</b></p>
<p><b>all measures taken, including on cases mentioned in the present report. In this context, 
</b></p>
<p><b>I also recommend that the Council devote sufficient time to the discussion of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>present report, and welcome the initial statements made by a number of States during 
</b></p>
<p><b>the twenty-seventh session. 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> I encourage all stakeholders, including international and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, Member States, national human rights institutions, civil society and 
</b></p>
<p><b>academic institutions, to continue to contribute to the future consideration of this 
</b></p>
<p><b>issue by the Human Rights Council and the United Nations system as a whole. </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up information on cases of reprisal included in previous reports 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. China  
</b></p>
<p>1. In my previous report, reference was made to Cao Shunli, who had been 
</p>
<p>campaigning for transparency and greater participation of civil society in the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review process of China and reportedly as a result was arrested, detained and 
</p>
<p>denied medical treatment resulting in her death on 14 March 2014 (A/HRC/27/38, paras. 
</p>
<p>17-19). In his report of 10 June 2015, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association regretted not having received a response from the 
</p>
<p>Government to the joint communication sent on 4 March 2014 (A/HRC/29/25/Add.3, paras. 
</p>
<p>240-244). The Rapporteur reiterated his utmost concern that the death of Ms. Cao might 
</p>
<p>have been a reprisal for her continued cooperation with the United Nations in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights and urged the authorities to inform him of the results of the investigations of 
</p>
<p>the circumstances leading to Ms. Cao&#8217;s death, as soon as possible (ibid.). At the time of 
</p>
<p>finalization of the present report, no response had been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Malaysia 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Coalition of Malaysian Non-Governmental Organizations was discussed in my 
</p>
<p>previous report in relation to its engagement with the universal periodic review process of 
</p>
<p>the country (A/HRC/27/38, para. 28). The Government of Malaysia by letter of 9 
</p>
<p>September 2014 reaffirmed its continuous support and commitment to the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review process and stated that all relevant stakeholders had been able to freely 
</p>
<p>participate in Malaysia&#8217;s review without any restrictions. According to the Government, the 
</p>
<p>allegations of the Coalition were &#8220;utterly baseless&#8221; (A/HRC/28/85, case MYS 1/2014). In 
</p>
<p>its press statement issued on 8 January 2014, the Malaysian Secretary-General of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Home Affairs had not declared the Coalition illegal or unlawful but rather 
</p>
<p>highlighted that it was not registered under the Societies Act 1996. The Government 
</p>
<p>confirmed that no investigation and judicial or other inquiries were carried out in relation to 
</p>
<p>the Coalition as no report by or against the Coalition were lodged with the relevant 
</p>
<p>authorities (ibid.). The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, in his 
</p>
<p>report of 4 March 2015, while encouraged by the fact that the Coaltion was no longer 
</p>
<p>considered illegal, reiterated his grave concern at the apparent acts of reprisal against them 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/63/Add.1, para. 280).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p>3. The &#8220;Law on Non-commercial Organizations which Carry Functions of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Agents&#8221; and allegations of reprisals against the Anti-Discrimination Center Memorial via 
</p>
<p>that law were mentioned in my previous report (A/HRC/27/38, para. 43). On 20 June 2014, 
</p>
<p>mandate holders raised further concerns over the enforcement of, and amendments to, the 
</p>
<p>Law and the Memorial with the Government (A/HRC/28/85, case RUS 5/2014). On 8 April 
</p>
<p>2014, the Saint Petersburg Court upheld that the Memorial was performing functions of a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;foreign agent&#8221;, reportedly for submitting information on police actions to the Committee 
</p>
<p>against Torture. The Memorial refused to register as such and decided to dissolve its 
</p>
<p>structure and continue its activities without registration. On 4 June 2014, the Duma voted in 
</p>
<p>favour of amending the Law, reportedly allowing the Ministry of Justice to register, at its 
</p>
<p>own initiative and without a court decision, non-commercial organizations as &#8220;foreign </p>


<p>agents&#8221; (ibid.). In its response dated 25 August 2014, the Government explained the 
</p>
<p>procedures followed in the case of the Memorial and indicated that such registration should 
</p>
<p>not be considered as interference of any kind in the rights to freely express opinions or form 
</p>
<p>associations but that it aims at ensuring transparency and openness in their activities (ibid.). 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, in 
</p>
<p>his report of 10 June 2015, expressed his continued grave concern in relation to the Law 
</p>
<p>and the targeting of human rights organizations that engage with the United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms (A/HRC/29/25/Add.3, para. 436).  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>4. In my previous report reference was made to Visuvalingam Kirupaharan, General 
</p>
<p>Secretary of the Tamil Centre for Human Rights, in relation to his participation in the 
</p>
<p>twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/27/38, para. 34). The 
</p>
<p>Government, on 24 July 2014, sought clarifications from mandate holders who had brought 
</p>
<p>the allegations of acts of intimidation against Mr. Kirupaharan to its attention, indicating 
</p>
<p>that there was no connection between the alleged sequence of events and the authorities 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/72, case LKA 5/2014). Mandate holders in response transmitted clarifications 
</p>
<p>and their observations on the case to the Government referring to the fact that &#8220;States are 
</p>
<p>the primary duty bearers in protecting, defending and promoting human rights, and as such, 
</p>
<p>should address violations of human rights committed by both State and non-State actors&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/85, case LKA 12/2014). At the time of finalization of the present report, no 
</p>
<p>response had been received from the Government.  
</p>
<p>5. My previous report also discussed the case of 24 Sri Lankan civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations that had reportedly been accused by the State-controlled Sri Lanka 
</p>
<p>Rupavahini (TV) Corporation, in its English news bulletin, of having issued a joint civil 
</p>
<p>society memorandum to the HRC (A/HRC/27/38, para. 33). On 24 September 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Government of Sri Lanka, in response to the joint communication transmitted by mandate 
</p>
<p>holders, stated that the Sri Lanka Rupavahihi Corporation was exercising its freedom of 
</p>
<p>speech and expression within the set legal framework in Sri Lanka, however &#8220;unpalatable 
</p>
<p>the contents of the newscast would have been to the said human rights defenders&#8221;. If the 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders felt wronged by such newscast they could invoke a civil action for 
</p>
<p>damages under the laws of Sri Lanka for defamation (A/HRC/28/85, case LKA 4/2014).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>6. The case of Osama al-Najjar, who had reportedly become the subject of reprisals 
</p>
<p>after meeting with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
</p>
<p>during her visit to the United Arab Emirates in February 2014, was included in my previous 
</p>
<p>report (A/HRC/27/38, para. 37-38). The Special Rapporteur, in her oral statements to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and the General Assembly in 2014, called on the authorities to take 
</p>
<p>immediate measures to release Mr. Al-Najjar and open an independent investigation into 
</p>
<p>the circumstances of his arrest and the serious allegations of torture. On 2 April 2015, 
</p>
<p>mandate holders raised further allegations concerning Mr. Al-Najjar with the Government 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/30/27, case ARE 2/2015). On 25 November 2014, after a trial that reportedly 
</p>
<p>lacked respect for the most basic due process and fair trial guarantees, Mr. Al-Najjar was 
</p>
<p>sentenced to three years in prison and fined 500,000 Emirati Dirhams (about 136,000 USD) 
</p>
<p>on charges of, inter alia, contacting foreign organizations and presenting inaccurate 
</p>
<p>information (ibid.). The Government, in its response of 30 April 2015, listed procedural 
</p>
<p>guarantees that had been in place in the case of Mr. Al-Najjar (ibid.). In his report of 4 
</p>
<p>March 2015, the Special Rapporteur on the situation on human rights defenders recalled 
</p>
<p>that the Government had not responded to the earlier communication dated 16 April 2014 
</p>
<p>and stated that he was still awaiting a detailed response from the Government to the 
</p>
<p>allegations and questions raised (A/HRC/28/63/Add.1, paras. 554-555). </p>


<p><b> 6. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</b></p>
<p>7. The case of Judge Maria Lourdes Afiuni Mora has been raised in each of my 
</p>
<p>previous reports since 2010 (A/HRC/14/19, para. 45-47, A/HRC/18/19, para. 87-90, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/21/28, para. 68-69, A/HRC/24/29, para. 46-48 and A/HRC/27/38, para. 46). The 
</p>
<p>Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its latest report again expressed its concern over 
</p>
<p>the continued detention under house arrest of Ms. Afiuni, which it considers as a measure 
</p>
<p>of reprisal against her for ordering the conditional release of Mr. Eligio Cede&#241;o after the 
</p>
<p>WGAD in Opinion No. 10/2009 had considered his detention arbitrary (A/HRC/30/36, 
</p>
<p>para. 38). The Working Group reiterated its call on the Government of Venezuela to release 
</p>
<p>Ms. Afiuni and to provide her with effective and adequate reparations (ibid.). In its 
</p>
<p>concluding observations on the combined third and fourth periodic reports of Venezuela, 
</p>
<p>CAT regretted that no investigation had so far been opened on the case of Judge Afiuni and 
</p>
<p>stated that the Government should without delay conduct a thorough and impartial 
</p>
<p>investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-treatment, including sexual assault, of 
</p>
<p>Ms. Afiuni during her detention (CAT/C/VEN/CO/3-4, para. 16).
