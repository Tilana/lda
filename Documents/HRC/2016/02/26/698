</b></p>
<p><b>  28</b>/&#8230;<b>The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council on the right to food, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>on the issue, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council, at which 
</p>
<p>the Council analysed the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food for all, and Council resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 
</p>
<p>18 September 2008 and 12/10 of 1 October 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
</p>
<p>everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
</p>
<p>including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goal 1 on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, in which the right of everyone to adequate food, including the fundamental 
</p>
<p>right of every person to be free from hunger, is recognized, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
</p>
<p>Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 
</p>

<p>2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 
</p>
<p>2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible 
</p>
<p>Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing 
</p>
<p>Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
</p>
<p>Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of 
</p>
<p>National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that the right to food is the right of every individual, alone or in 
</p>
<p>community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, 
</p>
<p>adequate and culturally acceptable food that is produced and consumed sustainably, 
</p>
<p>preserving access to food for future generations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security 
</p>
<p>contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 
</p>
<p>November 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
</p>
<p>footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and 
</p>
<p>economic environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential 
</p>
<p>foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty 
</p>
<p>eradication, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
</p>
<p>of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
</p>
<p>of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
</p>
<p>international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
</p>
<p>unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and that endanger food security, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
</p>
<p>capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
</p>
<p>in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
</p>
<p>Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
</p>
<p>collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked 
</p>
<p>institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities 
</p>
<p>are essential, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that food security is a national responsibility and that any plan for 
</p>
<p>addressing food security challenges must be nationally articulated, designed, owned and 
</p>
<p>led, and built on consultation with all key stakeholders, and recognizing the commitment to 
</p>
<p>strengthening the multilateral system in the channelling of resources and in the promotion 
</p>
<p>of policies dedicated to fighting hunger and malnutrition, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger, food insecurity 
</p>
<p>and malnutrition have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress 
</p>
<p>made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless 
</p>
<p>urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also </i>the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right 
</p>
<p>to food is threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major 
</p>
<p>factors, such as the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, 
</p>
<p>desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the </p>


<p>lack of development in many countries and transfer of relevant technology to address this 
</p>
<p>issue, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable developing States, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the 
</p>
<p>right to food, in particular in the said countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
</p>
<p>system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
</p>
<p>thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, 
</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i> to act to ensure that the full realization of all human rights, including the 
</p>
<p>right to development, is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels 
</p>
<p>in addressing the global food crisis, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance and positive role of smallholder and subsistence 
</p>
<p>farmers, including women farmers, young farmers, family farmers and farmers in less 
</p>
<p>favoured areas, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing 
</p>
<p>countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
</p>
<p>and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
</p>
<p>life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, 
</p>
<p>both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in 
</p>
<p>agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible 
</p>
<p>Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food 
</p>
<p>Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 
</p>
<p>May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations at its 144th session, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food 
</p>
<p>Systems, which were transmitted to the governing bodies of the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations for consideration by the Committee on World Food 
</p>
<p>Security at its forty-first session, held in October 2014,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>the tenth anniversary in 2014 of the adoption of the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the 
</p>
<p>Context of National Food Security, and the reaffirmation by the Committee on Food 
</p>
<p>Security at its forty-first session of the commitment to implement the Guidelines and to 
</p>
<p>strive for the realization of the right to adequate food for all in the years to come,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of the second International Conference on Nutrition, hosted 
</p>
<p>by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, at which the two main outcome 
</p>
<p>documents, namely, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, 
</p>
<p>were endorsed, committing countries to eradicate hunger and to prevent all forms of 
</p>
<p>malnutrition worldwide, particularly undernourishment, through national and international 
</p>
<p>actions.  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing food security and the right to food for all, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its </p>


<p>work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right 
</p>
<p>to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in 
</p>
<p>support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development, entitled &#8220;The future we want&#8221;, endorsed by the General Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 66/288 on 27 July 2012, and reaffirming the principles contained therein, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
</p>
<p>and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and 
</p>
<p>nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of 
</p>
<p>everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her 
</p>
<p>physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Considers it intolerable</i> that, as estimated by the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from 
</p>
<p>hunger-related illness, and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, about 805 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger, 
</p>
<p>including as one of the effects derived from the global food crisis, while, according to the 
</p>
<p>latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the 
</p>
<p>world; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses its deep concern</i> that, according to the report of the Food and 
</p>
<p>Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled <i>The State of Food Insecurity in the 
</i></p>
<p><i>World 2013</i>, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and the 
</p>
<p>vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis 
</p>
<p>continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, 
</p>
<p>particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world 
</p>
<p>financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-
</p>
<p>importing developing countries, especially on least developed countries; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also</i> <i>expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> that women and girls are disproportionately 
</p>
<p>affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and 
</p>
<p>discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
</p>
<p>malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
</p>
<p>as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address de jure and de facto gender 
</p>
<p>inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the 
</p>
<p>malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization 
</p>
<p>of the right to food and ensuring that women and girls have equal access to social 
</p>
<p>protection and resources, including income, land and water and their ownership,  as well as 
</p>
<p>full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to 
</p>
<p>feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women 
</p>
<p>and strengthen their role in decision-making; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of smallholder and subsistence farmers in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring 
</p>
<p>food security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their 
</p>
<p>development; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to 
</p>
<p>mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her mandate, and encourages the Food </p>


<p>and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and effectively 
</p>
<p>implement a gender perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities 
</p>
<p>regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe, sufficient, 
</p>
<p>nutritious and culturally accepted food are inclusive and accessible to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> States to take steps with a view to progressively achieve the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for 
</p>
<p>everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food 
</p>
<p>and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>to adopt national plans to combat hunger; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Underlines</i> the significance of national government policies and strategies in 
</p>
<p>food production, poverty alleviation and social protection; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Recognizes</i> the advances made through South-South cooperation in 
</p>
<p>developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of 
</p>
<p>agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to 
</p>
<p>increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation and to promote 
</p>
<p>triangular cooperation further; 
</p>
<p>14. Also <i>recognizes</i> the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural 
</p>
<p>practices, inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>and local communities; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
</p>
<p>right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
</p>
<p>response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
</p>
<p>efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to 
</p>
<p>food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, 
</p>
<p>food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food security, with special 
</p>
<p>attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted 
</p>
<p>technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing 
</p>
<p>services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1 and article 11, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and 
</p>
<p>assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the 
</p>
<p>measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
</p>
<p>rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
</p>
<p>impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
</p>
<p>from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Stresses</i> that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
</p>
<p>rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate, 
</p>
<p>small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability 
</p>
<p>to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological 
</p>
<p>approaches; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Recognizes</i> that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food </p>


<p>insecurity given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to 
</p>
<p>land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; 
</p>
<p>that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting 
</p>
<p>land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other 
</p>
<p>associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by 
</p>
<p>States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the 
</p>
<p>facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and 
</p>
<p>empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for 
</p>
<p>food security and the provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
</p>
<p>national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
</p>
<p>degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
</p>
<p>the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious 
</p>
<p>Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Recalls</i> the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
</p>
<p>and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and 
</p>
<p>challenges to the full enjoyment of the right to food that indigenous peoples face, and calls 
</p>
<p>upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the often disproportionately 
</p>
<p>high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous 
</p>
<p>discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Welcomes</i> the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples,1 held on 22 and 
</p>
<p>23 September 2014, and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, 
</p>
<p>food security and nutrition; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Requests</i> all States and private actors, and international organizations and 
</p>
<p>agencies within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
</p>
<p>effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in 
</p>
<p>different fields; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
</p>
<p>human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
</p>
<p>studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
</p>
<p>international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, 
</p>
<p>towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
</p>
<p>national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
</p>
<p>hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>26.<i> Takes note with appreciation</i> of the growing movement, in different regions 
</p>
<p>of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in 
</p>
<p>support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Stresses</i> the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
</p>
<p>utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
</p>
<p>food security policies; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Encourages</i> States to consider developing their legal structures in order to 
</p>
<p>protect resources directly related to the right to food, such as water resources, access to land 
</p>
<p>and seed production;  
</p>
<p>29. <i>Calls for</i> the early conclusion to and a successful, development-oriented 
</p>
<p>outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a 
</p>
<p>contribution to creating international conditions permitting the full realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>food; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Stresses</i> that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
</p>
<p>international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
</p>
<p>agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
</p>
<p>order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views 
</p>
<p>of all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>32. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
</p>
<p>Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
</p>
<p>additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty;  
</p>
<p>33. <i>Recognizes</i> that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
</p>
<p>halve the number of people who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
</p>
<p>recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and 
</p>
<p>international financial and development institutions, as well as relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim 
</p>
<p>of halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from 
</p>
