<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Right to Development, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and other relevant 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 62/219 of 22 
</p>
<p>December 2007 and 65/281 of 17 June 2011, and Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 
</p>
<p>and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 11/11 of 18 June 2009 and 16/21 of 25 March 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolutions 54/205 of 22 December 1999, 55/61 of 
</p>
<p>4 December 2000, 55/188 of 20 December 2000, 56/186 of 21 December 2001, 57/244 of

</p>
<p>December 2013, 68/309 of 10 September 2014 and 69/199 of 18 December 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 17/23 of 17 June 2011, 19/38 
</p>
<p>of 23 March 2012, 22/12 of 21 March 2013 and 25/9 of 27 March 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the entry into force on 14 December 2005 of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> the commitment to ensure the effective enjoyment of all civil, political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights for everyone, including the right to development, and 
</p>
<p>the obligation of all States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural 
</p>
<p>wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international 
</p>
<p>economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law, 
</p>
<p>and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that fighting corruption at all levels is a priority and that corruption is a 
</p>
<p>serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away 
</p>
<p>from activities that are vital for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic 
</p>
<p>and sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> at cases in which the proceeds of corruption-related crimes that involve 
</p>
<p>vast quantities of assets may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, 
</p>
<p>the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development of 
</p>
<p>those States and has a negative impact on the application by States of the maximum 
</p>
<p>available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
</p>
<p>undermined by corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, which may endanger the 
</p>
<p>stability and security of societies, undermine the values of democracy and morality and 
</p>
<p>jeopardize social, economic and political development, especially when an inadequate 
</p>
<p>national and international response leads to impunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Corruption, underlining its central 
</p>
<p>role in fostering international cooperation to facilitate the repatriation of the proceeds of 
</p>
<p>corruption-related crimes, and stressing the need for universal adherence to the Convention 
</p>
<p>and for its full implementation, as well as the full implementation of the resolutions and 
</p>
<p>decisions of the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention, particularly those 
</p>
<p>adopted at its fourth and fifth sessions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that the United Nations Convention against Corruption underlines 
</p>
<p>that States parties should not decline to render mutual legal assistance, pursuant to the 
</p>
<p>Convention, including on the ground of bank secrecy, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the work carried out by different United Nations bodies, including 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as international and regional 
</p>
<p>organizations, in preventing and combating all forms of corruption, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that the prevention and eradication of corruption is a responsibility 
</p>
<p>of all States, and that States should cooperate with one another, in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Convention against Corruption, with the support and involvement of other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, as appropriate, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> all relevant United Nations mechanisms to continue their consideration 
</p>
<p>of the negative impact of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights, to further 
</p>
<p>explore policy responses to the phenomenon and to coordinate their efforts in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that supportive domestic legal systems are essential in preventing and 
</p>
<p>combating corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin and in returning such 
</p>
<p>assets, and recalling that the fight against all forms of corruption requires strong institutions 
</p>
<p>at all levels, including at the local level, able to take efficient preventive and law 
</p>
<p>enforcement measures consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 
</p>
<p>in particular chapters II and III thereof, 
</p>
<p><i>Appreciating</i> the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working groups, to oversee the review process of the implementation of the Convention, to 
</p>
<p>advise on the provision of technical assistance for building institutional and human capacity </p>


<p>in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international cooperation, 
</p>
<p>including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the responsibilities of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of 
</p>
<p>funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of 
</p>
<p>their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full 
</p>
<p>realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have 
</p>
<p>a duty to assist and facilitate repatriation, including through judicial assistance, as part of 
</p>
<p>their obligation of international cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Convention against Corruption and in the field of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the repatriation of funds of illicit origin requires the close and 
</p>
<p>transparent coordination and cooperation of requesting and requested States, including 
</p>
<p>between competent authorities, in particular the judicial authorities, within the shared 
</p>
<p>responsibility to facilitate efficient international cooperation for the prompt recovery of 
</p>
<p>assets of illicit origin, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that article 2.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights notes the need for each State party to take steps, individually and through 
</p>
<p>international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
</p>
<p>maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, and article 3.<footnote name="3">A/HRC/26/28 and Corr.1. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>of the Declaration on the Right to Development, which notes that States have the duty to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
</p>
<p>development, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit and the 2010 high-level 
</p>
<p>plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals to make 
</p>
<p>the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> at the difficulties, in particular the practical difficulties, that both 
</p>
<p>requested and requesting States face in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, taking into 
</p>
<p>account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing 
</p>
<p>a link between the proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in 
</p>
<p>the requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, bearing in mind that 
</p>
<p>everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until 
</p>
<p>proven guilty according to law, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption, while recognizing that States continue to face challenges in 
</p>
<p>recovering funds of illicit origin owing to, inter alia, differences in legal systems, the 
</p>
<p>complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with 
</p>
<p>the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow 
</p>
<p>of funds of illicit origin, noting the particular challenges in recovering them in cases 
</p>
<p>involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and 
</p>
<p>their family members and close associates, and recognizing that legal difficulties are often 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with serious concern</i> that, as highlighted in the interim report by the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
</p>
<p>obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, </p>


<p>social and cultural rights,1 despite the scarcity of available public data, most illicit financial 
</p>
<p>outflows are from developing countries; that, according to the Independent Expert in his 
</p>
<p>interim study on illicit financial flows, human rights and the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/28/60 and Corr.1. 
</footnote> recent studies indicate that developing countries lost $991 billion in illicit financial 
</p>
<p>outflows in 2012, that those flows increased in real terms at a rate of 9.<footnote name="4">A/HRC/25/52. </footnote> per cent per annum 
</p>
<p>over the period 2003&#8211;2012, and that the annual loss is substantially more than the estimated 
</p>
<p>yearly costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals; and that, as indicated by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights in her report on taxation policies,3 
</p>
<p>in 2011, developing countries lost $946.7 billion owing to illicit financial flows &#8211; a 
</p>
<p>substantial portion of which relating to tax abuse &#8211; which, according to the Organization for 
</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation and Development, was more than seven times the official 
</p>
<p>development assistance for that year and substantially more than the estimated costs of 
</p>
<p>achieving the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with serious concern also</i> that, as highlighted by the Independent Expert in 
</p>
<p>his final report,4 while official development assistance remains an important source of 
</p>
<p>finance for poverty alleviation and development, the substantial amounts lost to illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows could help the efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic 
</p>
<p>resources for poverty alleviation, development and realization of human rights, and to 
</p>
<p>reduce their dependence on external financing, which can lead to the erosion of ownership 
</p>
<p>of national development agendas, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the proposal of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-
</p>
<p>2015 Development Agenda and of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals to include in the future United Nations development 
</p>
<p>agenda the goal to reduce significantly by 2030 illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen 
</p>
<p>the recovery and return of stolen assets, and combat all forms of organized crime, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the particular concern of developing countries and countries with economies 
</p>
<p>in transition regarding the need to return assets of illicit origin derived from corruption, in 
</p>
<p>particular to countries from which they originated, consistent with the principles of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapter V thereto, so as to 
</p>
<p>enable countries to design and fund development projects in accordance with their national 
</p>
<p>priorities in view of the importance that such assets can have to their sustainable 
</p>
<p>development, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
</p>
<p>to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, and stressing that any 
</p>
<p>resource that the State is deprived of because of corruption has potentially the same 
</p>
<p>negative effect, regardless of whether it is exported or domestically retained, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the interim study on illicit financial flows, human rights and the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda prepared by the Independent Expert on the effects of 
</p>
<p>foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights;
2
 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Encourages</i> all States to include a goal to reduce illicit financial flows in the 
</p>
<p>final post-2015 development agenda; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet acceded to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to consider enacting legislation to address offences by 
</p>
<p>business enterprises, including multinational corporations, which deprive Governments of 
</p>
<p>legitimate domestic sources of revenue for the implementation of their development 
</p>
<p>agendas; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Asserts</i> the urgent need to repatriate illicit funds to the countries of origin 
</p>
<p>without conditionalities, in accordance with the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Corruption and in line with the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit and the 2010 
</p>
<p>high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit 
</p>
<p>transfer of funds, and urges all States to step up their efforts to trace, freeze and recover 
</p>
<p>those funds; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of compliance with international human rights 
</p>
<p>law in relation to the repatriation of funds of illicit origin by, inter alia, promoting human 
</p>
<p>rights-based policy coherence in the deliberations and actions by States Members of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and in the intergovernmental process of implementing the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention against Corruption; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Invites</i> the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>against Corruption to consider ways of adopting a human rights-based approach in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention, including when dealing with the repatriation of funds of 
</p>
<p>illicit origin, and appreciates the continued efforts of the Open-ended Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Working Group on Asset Recovery of the Conference to assist States parties in fulfilling 
</p>
<p>their obligations under the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective 
</p>
<p>manner the international transfer of funds of illicit origin and to strengthen international 
</p>
<p>cooperation in asset recovery, bearing in mind that, regardless of the capacities, resources 
</p>
<p>and willingness of the requesting State&#8217;s institutions and authorities, there is a victim 
</p>
<p>society that is suffering the consequences of the transfer of those funds; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision made at the fifth session of the Conference of the 
</p>
<p>States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to renew the mandate of 
</p>
<p>open-ended intergovernmental expert meetings on international cooperation to advise and 
</p>
<p>assist States with regard to extradition and mutual legal assistance, and notes with 
</p>
<p>appreciation the Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative of the World Bank Group and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and encourages coordination among existing 
</p>
<p>initiatives; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to consider establishing an intergovernmental working 
</p>
<p>group on the negative impact of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p>and to further explore policy responses to the phenomenon; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Realizes</i> that, while illicit financial outflows from the least developed 
</p>
<p>countries may account for only a small portion of all outflows of funds of illicit origin 
</p>
<p>worldwide, they have a particularly negative impact on social development and the 
</p>
<p>realization of social, economic and cultural rights in these countries, given the size of their 
</p>
<p>economies, and expresses deep concern that such outflows, as estimated by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme, exceed the total official development assistance 
</p>
<p>received by many of the least developed countries and, in some cases, surpass their debt 
</p>
<p>service payments; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Underscores</i> that the repatriation of funds of illicit origin would provide 
</p>
<p>States that have undergone regime change with a further opportunity to improve the 
</p>
<p>realization of economic, social and cultural rights and to fulfil their obligation to meet the 
</p>
<p>legitimate aspirations of their peoples; </p>


<p>12. <i>Acknowledges</i> the important role that civil society can play in exposing 
</p>
<p>corruption and drawing attention to the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of 
</p>
<p>illicit origin on the rule of law and the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>and reiterates in this context the obligation of States to protect reporting persons in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 33 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society 
</p>
<p>to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Welcomes</i> recent national initiatives to adopt anti-money-laundering 
</p>
<p>legislation as an important step in the fight against corruption and the willingness 
</p>
<p>demonstrated by some States to cooperate in facilitating the repatriation of funds of illicit 
</p>
<p>origin, and calls for more robust regulations in this regard, including through the 
</p>
<p>implementation of policies aimed at reducing the flow of funds of illicit origin, ensuring 
</p>
<p>their repatriation and the provision of technical assistance to developing countries; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> further international cooperation through, inter alia, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system, in support of national, subregional and regional efforts to prevent and 
</p>
<p>combat corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin, in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and in this regard 
</p>
<p>encourages close cooperation at the national and international levels between anti-
</p>
<p>corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> all States requested to repatriate funds of illicit origin to uphold 
</p>
<p>fully their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
</p>
<p>curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to acknowledge that, in fulfilling their obligations in 
</p>
<p>this regard under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, they also have a 
</p>
<p>responsibility towards societies affected by corruption to make every effort to achieve the 
</p>
<p>repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin in order to diminish the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of non-repatriation, including on the enjoyment of human rights, in 
</p>
<p>particular economic, social and cultural rights in the countries of origin by, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>lowering the barriers imposed on requiring jurisdictions at the tracing stage and enhancing 
</p>
<p>cooperation in this regard between anti-corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and 
</p>
<p>financial intelligence units, in particular taking into account the risks of dissipation of those 
</p>
<p>funds and, where appropriate, by delinking confiscation measures from a requirement of 
</p>
<p>conviction in the country of origin; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> all States requesting the repatriation of funds of illicit origin to 
</p>
<p>uphold fully their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels 
</p>
<p>and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to apply the principles of accountability, 
</p>
<p>transparency and participation in the decision-making process regarding the allocation of 
</p>
<p>repatriated funds to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in order to 
</p>
<p>improve prevention and detection procedures, correct identified weaknesses or 
</p>
<p>mismanagement, prevent impunity, provide effective remedies directed at creating 
</p>
<p>conditions for avoiding new human rights violations and improve the overall administration 
</p>
<p>of justice; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Reaffirms</i> that it is the obligation of the State to investigate and prosecute 
</p>
<p>corruption, calls upon all States to strengthen criminal proceedings directed at freezing or 
</p>
<p>restraining funds of illicit origin, and encourages requesting States to ensure that adequate 
</p>
<p>national investigative procedures have been initiated and substantiated for the purpose of 
</p>
<p>presenting mutual legal assistance requests and, in this context, encourages requested States 
</p>
<p>to provide information on legal frameworks and procedures to the requesting State and to 
</p>
<p>remove barriers to asset recovery, including by simplifying their legal procedures; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Underlines</i> that there is also a corporate responsibility to comply with and 
</p>
<p>respect all applicable laws and human rights, and a need for greater access to effective </p>


<p>remedies by victims in order to realize effective prevention of, and remedy for, business- 
</p>
<p>related human rights harm, as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights;<footnote name="5">A/HRC/17/31, annex. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Encourages</i> all States to share best practices and practical experiences in the 
</p>
<p>freezing and recovery of funds of illicit origin; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Calls upon</i> requesting and requested States with practical experience in asset 
</p>
<p>recovery to develop, as appropriate, in cooperation with interested States and providers of 
</p>
<p>technical assistance, non-binding practical guidelines, such as a step-by-step guide, for 
</p>
<p>efficient asset recovery, with a view to enhancing effective approaches to asset recovery 
</p>
<p>based on the lessons learned from past cases; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> for transparency in financial institutions and effective due 
</p>
<p>diligence measures to be applied by financial intermediaries, calls upon States to seek 
</p>
<p>appropriate means in accordance with their international obligations to ensure the 
</p>
<p>cooperation and responsiveness of financial institutions to foreign requests to freeze and 
</p>
<p>recover funds of illicit origin and the provision of an efficient mutual legal assistance 
</p>
<p>regime to States requesting repatriation of those funds, and encourages the promotion of 
</p>
<p>human and institutional capacity-building in that regard; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of the mechanism for the review of implementation of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and urges State parties to comply with 
</p>
<p>their obligations in the conduct of the country reviews to enhance effective implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Convention as a preventive measure for the outflow of illicit financial flows; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
</p>
<p>related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
</p>
<p>rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to continue to consider the impact 
</p>
<p>of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights as part of the mandate;
