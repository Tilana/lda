<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the High Commissioner&#8217;s third periodic report on the human rights situation 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It covers the period from 4 February to 30 November 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>2. Information in this report is based primarily on human rights monitoring carried out 
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights field presence in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OHCHR-OPT). Monitoring activities are implemented 
within the framework of General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 1994, which established 
the mandate of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and in consideration of Human 
Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1, which requested that the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights monitor, document and report on human rights violations in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza and East Jerusalem.   
</p>
<p>3. It is noted that OHCHR-OPT communicated with the Government of Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority during the preparation of this report. OHCHR-OPT acknowledges the 
positive cooperation of both parties. An ongoing dialogue with duty-bearers is essential in 
order to conduct meaningful human rights monitoring and reporting. OHCHR-OPT will 
continuously seek to develop its cooperation and communication with the respective 
authorities. With regard to the Government of Israel, it is hoped that these contacts can be 
extended beyond officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also include the Israeli 
Defence Forces (IDF) and other counterparts. In this respect, the positive indications from 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are noted with appreciation. With regard to the Palestinian 
Authority, OHCHR-OPT is pleased to note the good cooperation with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Interior and other counterparts.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>4. International human rights law and international humanitarian law are applicable in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Detailed analysis of the legal framework and the basis 
for the obligations of the different duty-bearers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
namely the State of Israel as the Occupying Power, the Palestinian Authority and the de 
facto authorities in Gaza, is contained in the High Commissioner&#8217;s first periodic report on 
the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/HRC/12/37, paras 5&#8211;
9). This analysis remains valid.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The human rights situation in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Update on the general human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Israeli blockade continued to significantly impact the human rights situation in 
Gaza. Though there was a moderation of the policy relating to the movement of goods in 
June, no significant change in the blockade regime occurred. This includes in relation to the 
movement of persons and exports from Gaza. From June to October, the monthly average 
of truckloads entering Gaza equalled 65 per cent of the monthly average before the 
blockade.1 Restrictions on exports remained, with a few exceptions, as did restrictions on

<p>cement and construction materials, thereby impeding reconstruction and economic 
recovery.2 Economic and social rights, such as the rights to work and food, were acutely 
affected. The unemployment rate was estimated at more than 44 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s 
workforce. Nearly 1.1 million Palestinians relied on United Nations food assistance.3 
Access to electricity improved, yet supply still fell short of demand by around 30 per cent.4 
As of 1 September, four to six-hour blackouts affected Gaza on a daily basis. 
</p>
<p>6. Restrictions on movement continued to negatively impact the right to health. 
Between February and October, three patients died while requests for permits to travel to 
the West Bank, Israel or abroad were delayed.5 For instance, a 2-year-old child with cancer, 
who was scheduled to receive chemotherapy on 6 October, died on 16 October after her 
permit was delayed.6  
</p>
<p>7. Restrictions on movement prevented persons in Gaza from visiting family members 
detained in Israel. Seven hundred and twenty-six Gazans remained detained in Israel,7 in 
contravention of article 76 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian 
Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention). Since the imposition of the blockade, 
family members of detainees have not been allowed to enter Israel, thereby de facto ending 
family visits.  
</p>
<p>8. Indiscriminate rocket and mortar fire from Gaza continued. During the reporting 
period, Palestinian militants launched an estimated 275 rockets and mortars in the direction 
of Israel. On 18 March, a rocket landed in Moshav Netiv Ha&#8217;asara, killing a foreign 
national.8 This was the first fatality due to a rocket attack since operation &#8220;Cast Lead&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues of particular concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. &#8220;Buffer zone&#8221; and fishing limit area 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Government of Israel continued to restrict access to the 300-metre-wide &#8220;buffer 
zone,&#8221; areas located up to about 1,500 metres from the barrier around Gaza, and sea areas 
beyond 3 nautical miles from shore. IDF regularly fired shots in the direction of 
Palestinians near these areas, in some cases directly targeting them. On 12 September, an 
IDF tank stationed at the northern Gaza-Israel barrier fired four shells toward a farm in the 
Shurrab area. At least two shells landed on the farm,9 killing three Palestinians: Ibrahim 
Abedallah Sulieman Abu Saied, 91 years old, Husam Khalid Ibrahim Abu Saied, 17 years 
old, and Isameil Waleed Abu Udah, 17 years old. The farm is located within 800 metres of 
the barrier. Media reported that IDF sources confirmed the attack, explaining that the three

<p>October. IDF refused to grant her father a permit, asking for another companion (her father had 
accompanied her previously). Following the intervention of human rights organizations, IDF granted 
the father a permit on 14 October. It was too late as the child&#8217;s health condition had deteriorated, and 
it was not possible to transfer her to the centre.

Organizations, letters to the High Commissioner dated 15 March 2010, 9 April 2010, 30 July 2010, 
and 22 November 2010. 
</p>
<p> 9 Case monitored by OHCHR, 14&#8211;23 September. </p>


<p>Palestinians were not involved in any hostile act but had been shelled because they were 
thought to have been aiming a rocket launcher at the barrier.10 In a similar incident, on 13 
July, a 33-year-old woman was killed and three of her relatives injured when IDF along the 
barrier east of Johr El Deek fired three shells. One shell landed close to her house located 
within 35&#8211;-400 metres of the barrier. OHCHR was informed that IDF restricted the access 
of ambulances, and only authorized them to evacuate the dead and injured more than three 
hours after the attack.11   
</p>
<p>10. OHCHR documented several cases in which individuals were shot near the &#8220;buffer 
zone.&#8221; On 2 November, a man was collecting scrap metal and plastic around 400 metres 
from the barrier in Johr El Deek. He was shot in his shoulder by IDF. According to 
information gathered, the situation in the area was calm at the time, with no rocket or 
mortar attacks having taken place. On 22 October, in Beit Hanoun a man was shot below 
the knee with a bullet fired by IDF. The man had been collecting scrap metal 250&#8211;300 
metres from the barrier. On 10 July, a 14-year-old boy was collecting scrap metal west of 
Beit Lahia, within 500 metres of the barrier, when he was shot in the leg.12 Many Gazans 
conduct this type of activity in light of the economic hardship and lack of employment 
opportunities.  
</p>
<p>11. Israeli Naval Forces continued to impede access of Palestinian fisherman beyond 3 
nautical miles from shore. The enforcement of this restriction, including by use of live 
ammunition, severely limited fishing activities. Since the beginning of 2010 to 1 October, 
at least three Palestinian fishermen were killed and seven injured in incidents in which 
Israeli Navel Forces opened fire.13 On 24 September, approximately 1,500 metres from the 
shore, an Israeli patrol boat approached a Palestinian fishing boat and opened fire, resulting 
in the death of one fisherman. According to information collected by OHCHR, the patrol 
boat left the scene, failing to offer medical care or otherwise assist. 
</p>
<p>12. The manner in which the &#8220;buffer zone&#8221; was enforced raises serious legal concerns. 
In particular, the use of live ammunition against civilians violates the prohibition on 
targeting civilians unless they are directly taking part in hostilities. Presence in a restricted 
area is not equivalent to directly participating in hostilities. Many of these incidents 
constitute a violation of the right to life and may also amount to extrajudicial executions. 
The use of live ammunition against civilians in the &#8220;buffer zone&#8221; impinges upon other 
human rights, such as the rights to work, an adequate standard of living and health. The de 
facto prohibition on cultivation of around 30 per cent of the arable land of Gaza, due to the 
delimitation and enforcement of the &#8220;buffer zone&#8221;, has a severe impact on the right to food. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Arbitrary detention, torture and the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 15 April, the de facto authorities executed two men. Three further men were 
executed on 17 May (OHCHR monitored these developments). The five executions 
proceeded without the ratification of the death sentences by the president of the Palestinian 
Authority, which is a requirement under the Palestinian Basic Law. The de facto 
authorities&#8217; Ministry of Interior announced on 19 September its intention to persist with 
executions.14

<p>14. According to information collected by OHCHR, the de facto authorities&#8217; courts had 
delivered at least six death sentences since the beginning of 2010. Several of these 
sentences were delivered by military courts.15 In violation of international human rights, in 
particular article 14, paragraph 5, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, there is no right to appeal a verdict of a military court to a higher tribunal. It is the 
position of OHCHR that civilians should, in principle, not be tried by military courts. Other 
sentences were delivered by civil courts.16 In some cases, OHCHR received allegations of 
torture being used to extract confessions. For example, OHCHR received reports that one 
suspect was subjected to beatings and s<i>habeh</i>17 for 15&#8211;20 days. 
</p>
<p>15. Arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture of detainees by different branches of 
the de facto authorities&#8217; security forces continued to be reported. In one incident, one man 
was detained by approximately five security personnel of the de facto authorities and was 
taken to a police station where he was ill-treated. According to information collected by 
OHCHR, security personnel tied him to a pillar and beat him with sticks. When he was 
examined at the hospital blood tests showed serious problems in both kidneys.18  
</p>
<p>16. Kidnapping and torture by unknown gunmen continued to be reported. In March, 
three masked gunmen kidnapped a former police officer of the Palestinian Authority. They 
interrogated him for around four hours regarding his political affiliation. He was beaten 
around the head with an iron chain and tortured with electric shocks, and threatened not to 
report his case. He suffered cuts and bruises all over and was hospitalized after being 
released. It was reported that the police started an investigation into the incident following a 
complaint lodged by the victim&#8217;s family. The results of the investigation had not been 
released at the conclusion of the reporting period.19 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Shrinking space for the national human rights institution and civil society actors 
</b></p>
<p>17. These developments occurred as the national human rights institution (Palestinian 
Independent Commission for Human Rights, ICHR) and civil society organizations faced 
increasing restrictions on their activities. On 24 August, the Reform and Change bloc 
passed the second reading of a bill that would allow the Palestinian Legislative Council 
(PLC) to appoint unilaterally the ICHR governing commissioner. This contradicts the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles) on the composition and guarantees of independence and 
pluralism of national human rights institutions. The draft bill would also give PLC the 
power to control the properties and staff of ICHR in Gaza, and de facto separate ICHR in 
Gaza from ICHR in the West Bank. 
</p>
<p>18. On 31 May, the de facto authorities&#8217; security forces raided civil society 
organizations in Rafah and Gaza City, searching premises, confiscating equipment and 
documents, and eventually closing certain organizations.20 The de facto authorities stated 
that some of these organizations were involved in Fatah-affiliated political activities, while 
others had engaged in &#8220;immoral conduct&#8221;.21 On 30 November, Gaza police implemented a 
decision taken by the de facto authorities&#8217; attorney general to shut down all offices of the 
</p>
<p>  
 15 For example, on 22 September, Omar Hmeidan Kaware was sentenced by a Gaza military court to 
</p>
<p>death by firing squad. 
 16 For example, on 2 November, Zahi Abdul Rahman al-Masri was sentenced to the death penalty. 
 17 The term <i>shabeh</i> is understood to include stress positions, sensory isolation, sleep deprivation and 
</p>
<p>infliction of pain, and often one or a combination of these methods for prolonged periods.

<p>Sharek Youth Forum, on allegations of &#8220;moral misconduct&#8221;.22 On 10 August, the de facto 
authorities&#8217; police attacked and forcibly dispersed a protest against the electricity crisis. 
According to information collected by OHCHR, over ten people were injured and taken to 
the hospital. Two other participants were arrested, detained and later released.23 The 
following day security forces launched a campaign to arrest members and supporters of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the organizers of the protest. Approximately 
ten persons were arrested, detained for hours and then released.  
</p>
<p>19. The de facto authorities continued to ban certain Palestinians newspapers in Gaza 
(<i>Al-Hayat</i>, <i>Al-Quds</i> and <i>Al-Ayyam</i>), and its security forces continued to attack journalists. 
On 4 August, police officers attacked a reporter while he covered an event in Khan Younis. 
According to the journalist, police were aware of his status as a journalist, as he had 
provided his credentials. Yet police beat him and ordered him not to take photos. The 
journalist had to receive medical treatment. He complained to the police on 5 August and, 
according to the journalist, the police showed no willingness to investigate the incident.24  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The human rights situation in the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Update on the general human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Tense situation in East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p>20. Tension in East Jerusalem increased during the reporting period, in particular due to 
frequent violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their properties, the demolition 
of Palestinian homes by Israeli authorities, limited access for Palestinians to the Al-Aqsa 
Mosque, arbitrary detention by Israeli security forces and the occupation of Palestinian 
homes by Israeli settlers. These tensions often resulted in clashes involving Palestinians, 
Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers.   
</p>
<p>21. Following the publication of a development plan by the Israeli municipality in early 
March,25 Silwan became a scene of frequent violent confrontations between Israeli police, 
Israeli settlers, Israeli private security personnel and Palestinians. On 25 April, clashes were 
sparked by a march sponsored by Israeli settlers protesting the construction of Palestinian 
homes. At least 29 Palestinians were injured, including three medical personnel and one 
journalist.26  
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR received reports that Israeli police increased arrests of children in Silwan. 
More than 28 Palestinian children were arrested during the reporting period. Most were 
arrested at their houses late at night and charged with threatening Israeli security. Some 
were sentenced to house arrest and prohibited from attending school.27   
</p>
<p>  
 22 According to information collected by OHCHR, the de facto authorities&#8217; Ministry of Interior alleged 
</p>
<p>that its security forces found pornographic material on staff computers.

<p><b> 2. Revocation of residency rights   
</b></p>
<p>23. Palestinians living in East Jerusalem continued to face problems with regard to 
residency permits (A/HRC/13/54, para. 37). In addition to the justifications used to revoke 
residency that were already employed, the case of four East Jerusalem residents,28 all 
current or former members of PLC, revealed a new justification given for revoking 
residency. According to information available to OHCHR, following the 2006 Palestinian 
elections the four PLC members received notification that their residency would be 
revoked. The basis provided was that membership in the parliament of a hostile entity is 
incompatible with loyalty to Israel. They were arrested in May 2006, found guilty of 
affiliation with Hamas and served prison terms. OHCHR was informed that, following the 
release of the last PLC member, all four had their identity cards confiscated and received 
letters from the Government of Israel informing them that they had 30 days to leave East 
Jerusalem. Mr. Abu Tier was detained on 30 June. He was later transferred to another 
location in the West Bank, whereupon the three other PLC members sought refuge in the 
East Jerusalem offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, where they 
remained at the time of the finalization of this report.   
</p>
<p>24. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits the forcible transfer of 
civilians of an occupied territory, except when necessary to ensure the security of the 
civilians involved. The revocation of residency rights may also violate the right to privacy 
and family and a wide range of economic, social, and cultural rights. The stated basis for 
the revocation of residency in these cases &#8211; the lack of loyalty to Israel &#8211; is analogous to 
&#8220;swearing allegiance.&#8221; Article 45 of the Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of 
War on Land (Hague Regulations) prohibits forcing residents of the occupied territory to 
swear allegiance to the hostile power.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>25. Movement between Palestinian communities within the West Bank (excluding East 
Jerusalem and Palestinian communities located to the west of the Wall) improved. 
Measures adopted by IDF included the removal of obstacles; transformation of six 
checkpoints into &#8220;partial&#8221; checkpoints; relaxation of controls at some checkpoints; lifting of 
permit requirements for vehicles driving to and from Nablus; and opening three sections of 
roads to Palestinians.29 
</p>
<p>26. Access from the rest of the West Bank to East Jerusalem remained difficult. Access 
to East Jerusalem for Palestinians holding West Bank identification who have obtained an 
entry permit was restricted to 3 of the 16 checkpoints along the Wall. Overcrowding, 
multiple layers of checks and other procedures at these checkpoints continued to encumber 
entry into East Jerusalem. Restrictions on freedom of movement continued to impact a 
range of human rights, such as the rights to work, education, family life, freedom of 
religion and health (see A/HRC/12/37, para. 76).  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Military Orders Nos. 1649 and 1650 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 13 April, two IDF regulations came into effect which raise concerns regarding 
Israeli obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
Military Orders Nos. 1649 and 1650, in particular due to their lack of clarity, appear to 
authorize IDF to detain, prosecute, imprison and/or forcibly transfer an undefined number 
of people from the West Bank. A principal concern is that the definition of the term 
</p>
<p>  
 28 Muhammad Abu Tier, Ahmad Attoun, Muhammad Totah, and Khaled Abu Arafeh. 
 29 OCHA, <i>West Bank Movement and Access Update</i> (East Jerusalem, 2010), p. 2.  </p>


<p>&#8220;infiltrator&#8221; in Order No. 1650 refers to a permit that is required to be present in the West 
Bank, yet the said permit is not defined in law. This lack of clarity potentially exposes 
anyone in the West Bank to forcible transfer.30  
</p>
<p>28. A further concern relates to the possibility that persons can be forcibly transferred 
without judicial review. Whereas Order No. 1649 establishes a committee, to be appointed 
by military officers and comprised of military judges, to review appeals against 
&#8220;deportation orders&#8221;, Order No. 1650 provides that persons for whom a &#8220;deportation order&#8221; 
has been issued can be forcibly transferred before they are brought before this committee.31 
In addition, the orders do not require that detained persons be informed in a language they 
understand that a &#8220;deportation order&#8221; has been issued or what rights they have under the 
orders. IDF can also charge detained persons for expenses related to their detention or, 
where they cannot cover these expenses, can seize assets for this purpose. 
</p>
<p>29. In its consideration of the third periodic report of Israel on implementation of the 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in July 2010, the Human Rights Committee 
expressed concern with the issuing of these two orders. It stated that Israel, &#8220;should refrain 
from expelling long-term residents of the West Bank to the Gaza Strip on the basis of their 
former addresses&#8221; and should &#8220;ensure that any person subject to a deportation order is 
heard and may appeal the order to an independent, judicial authority&#8221; (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, 
para. 14). It is recalled that article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits individual 
forcible transfer or deportation of protected persons, &#8220;regardless of their motive&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Home demolitions and expansion of settlements 
</b></p>
<p>30. Forced evictions and the demolition of buildings, including homes, continued to take 
place in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. From January through the end of 
November, 347 Palestinian structures were demolished in these areas (84 per cent in Area 
C). This represents an increase compared to the same period in 2009 (265 demolitions).32 
As a result, approximately 1,300 Palestinians, including 700 children, were forcibly 
displaced or otherwise negatively affected. At the conclusion of the reporting period, the 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported an increase in demolition 
orders.33 
</p>
<p>31. Home demolitions were of particular concern in Area C and East Jerusalem.34 
Between January and July, 199 Palestinian structures, including 59 homes, were 
</p>
<p>  
 30 It is noted that the Government of Israel stated that &#8220;population registry documentation issued by the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Authority pursuant to the Israel-Palestinian Interim Agreement 1995 falls into the 
category of lawful permits.&#8221; Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations Office at Geneva and 
Other International Organizations, letters to the High Commissioner dated 29 April 2010. This 
clarification is welcome, yet it is not consistent with the language of Order No. 1650. Furthermore, 
OHCHR received reports that Israel has generally restricted changes to the population registry since 
</p><p>2000. It is therefore not likely to accurately reflect the West Bank population.  
</p>
<p> 31 It is noted in the aforementioned letters to the High Commissioner dated 29 April 2010 that the 
Government of Israel stated that the committee established by Order No. 1649 provides &#8220;additional 
safeguards and protections to the existing legislation&#8221;. Yet there is nothing in the orders that 
guarantees that persons against whom &#8220;deportation orders&#8221; have been issued must be brought before 
the committee in advance of being deported. The orders outline detailed timeframes that allow 
persons to be forcibly transferred prior to appearing before the committee.

<p>demolished in Area C, displacing 242 people and undermining the livelihoods of an 
additional 696. Demolitions occurred during the enforcement of evacuation orders issued 
against Palestinians living in &#8220;closed military zones&#8221;. More than 33 per cent of Area C has 
been declared a &#8220;closed military zone&#8221;, leaving 59 communities highly vulnerable to 
demolition.35 It is recalled that only 1 per cent of the land in Area C is designated for 
Palestinian construction.36 
</p>
<p>32. In East Jerusalem, only 13 per cent of the land is designated for Palestinian 
construction.37 This has resulted in a housing crisis for Palestinians living in East 
Jerusalem. At least 28 per cent of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem are built in 
contravention of the Israeli zoning regime, putting about 60,000 Palestinians in East 
Jerusalem at risk of displacement.38 It is estimated that there are at least 1,500 pending 
demolition orders in East Jerusalem, potentially affecting several thousand Palestinians.39 
</p>
<p>33. The threat of demolition is heightened in Silwan. In 2010, the Israeli-controlled 
municipality approved a development plan for the Al-Bustan area of Silwan. The plan 
would lead to the demolition of more than 40 Palestinian homes; if implemented, 
approximately 500 Palestinians would be displaced.40 In October, protests occurred after 
Israeli police posted notices on several Palestinian homes, which prompted violent clashes 
between Israeli settlers, Israeli police and Palestinians.41 In the Sheikh Jarrah 
neighbourhood, several Palestinian families are at risk of displacement due to the efforts of 
Israeli settler organizations to forcibly evict them.42 
</p>
<p>34. Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits any destruction by the 
Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to 
private persons. Israel, as the Occupying Power, is obliged by international humanitarian 
law, and specifically article 43 of the Hague Regulations, to protect the local population 
and ensure its safety and welfare. The destruction of civilian homes also violates the right 
to adequate housing, including as a violation of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (article 11, para. 1).   
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues of particular concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Killings in the course of search and arrest operations by the IDF 
</b></p>
<p>35. IDF continued to conduct search and arrest operations in the West Bank. Larger 
operations allegedly involved several dozen soldiers. Some resulted in the killing of persons 
targeted by the operations. While OHCHR documented several cases, the following are 
given as appropriate examples. <b>

According to OCHA, an estimated 475 Palestinians are at risk of forced eviction and displacement in 
Sheikh Jarrah. </p>


<p>36. On 26 December 2009,43 at approximately 3.00 a.m., IDF conducted a large-scale 
operation in Nablus, reportedly seeking to arrest men suspected in the killing of an Israeli 
settler two days earlier. In the old city, IDF soldiers broke down the doors of the houses of 
Nader &#8220;Raed&#8221; al-Surakji and Ghassan Abu Sharkh, calling to them to come out. Both 
complied and when they were in sight of the soldiers, they were shot several times. In both 
cases, the victims were unarmed. In the case of Nader &#8220;Raed&#8221; al-Surakji, after the initial 
shots were fired, a soldier approached Mr. Surakji who was laying on the ground, wounded 
or already dead, and reportedly shot him several times at point-blank range. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. Early morning on 17 September, several dozen IDF soldiers entered the Nur Shams 
refugee camp and simultaneously searched a dozen houses. Eyad As&#8217;ad Ahmad Abu-
Shelbayeh was killed and 11 other Palestinians were detained. According to information 
collected by OHCHR, soldiers raided Mr. Abu-Shelbayeh&#8217;s house during the night, and he 
was shot and killed near his bed. He was unarmed.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. According to information gathered, in both these as in other cases, IDF exercised 
complete control over the area during the operation. The operations targeted specific houses 
and had the characteristics of law enforcement operations. Thus, IDF was bound to act in 
conformity with article 6 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Further, 
limitations exist with regard to the conduct of soldiers regardless of the circumstances 
under which the operations take place. Foremost is the prohibition on targeting civilians. 
Even when pursuing a legitimate military target, the means that may be used are not 
unlimited.44 It can be noted that the limitation of means in the course of military operations 
is supported by the jurisprudence of the Israeli High Court.45 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. As in all cases in which there are allegations of violations of human rights or 
international humanitarian law, the Government of Israel has the obligation to conduct an 
independent, effective and thorough investigation of such incidents. This obligation is also 
not without support from the Israeli High Court. In this instance, the Court decided that all 
cases where civilians who are suspected of having taken direct part in hostilities are 
targeted must be the object of a thorough, independent investigation, and that such 
investigations may be subject to judicial review.46 OHCHR is not aware of any 
investigations in relation to these incidents. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Killings by security forces in the course of daily security operations 
</b></p>
<p>40. Unarmed Palestinian civilians, who were apparently not the intended targets of a 
planned military or police operation, were killed in the course of routine operations by 
Israeli security forces in the West Bank. Three cases documented by OHCHR resulted in 
the death of a total of five Palestinian civilians. On 20 March, IDF was deployed to the east 
of Iraq Burin, as villagers had planned a demonstration there. Clashes erupted in the fields 
east of the village between IDF and village youths. Four or five IDF vehicles entered the

<p>  
 43 While the incident is outside the reporting period, the case is included in the light of issues pertaining 
</p>
<p>to accountability which fall within the reporting period.  
 44 International Committee of the Red Cross, <i>Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct 
</i></p>
<p><i>Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law</i> (2009), pp. 80&#8211;81.  
 45 The High Court stated: &#8220;a civilian taking a direct part in hostilities cannot be attacked at such time as 
</p>
<p>he is doing so, if a less harmful means can be employed &#8230; Indeed, among the military means, one 
must choose the means whose harm to the human rights of the harmed person is smallest. Thus, if a 
terrorist taking a direct part in hostilities can be arrested, interrogated, and tried, those are the means 
which should be employed.&#8221;<i> The Public Committee against Torture in Israel et al. v. the Government 
of Israel et al.</i>, Israeli High Court, 11 December 2005, para. 40.

<p>village and set up a roadblock, while soldiers searched homes. A minibus arrived in the 
western section of the village and Osayd Abdelnasser Mohammad Qadous and Mohammad 
Ibrahim Abdel Qader Qadous, two youths from the village, left the minibus in the section of 
the village that was not targeted by the search operation &#8211; approximately 70&#8211;100 metres 
from the roadblock. Shortly thereafter, according to witnesses, an IDF soldier at the 
roadblock opened fire in the direction of the two boys. Osayd was shot in the head and 
Mohammad was shot in the chest. Mohamed was pronounced dead upon arrival at the 
hospital and Osayd died a few hours later. In another case, which occurred on 21 March, 
two boys from Awarta were tending the land outside the village when they were detained 
by IDF and then shot and killed. IDF alleged that the boys attempted to attack the soldiers. 
In a third case, on 4 October, a group of men scaled the Wall separating East Jerusalem 
from the rest of the West Bank in order to reach their places of work. The Israeli Border 
Police discovered them and, during the ensuing chase, Izz Al Dein Saleh Abdel Kareem 
Kawazbeh, who was unarmed, was shot and killed. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. In the first two cases, an investigation was initiated by IDF, which according to 
information received by OHCHR included on-site observations and interviews with 
witnesses and medical staff. According to media reports, the preliminary investigations 
concluded that &#8220;tactical failures&#8221; had led to the death of the four Palestinians.47 In the case 
of the killing of the two men from Awarta, media reported that the squad commander had 
been dismissed and would no longer be authorized to serve as a commander. It was also 
reported that the Chief Military Prosecutor had ordered an investigation into the incident.48 
In relation to the 4 October case, according to media reports49 and information received 
from witnesses, the Ministry of Justice initiated an investigation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Violence committed by private Israeli citizens and response by the Israeli authorities 
</b></p>
<p>42. Violence committed by Israeli settlers escalated. There was an increase both in the 
number of attacks on Palestinians and their properties and the types of violence. Since 
March, several attacks by settlers on Palestinian mosques, schools, farms, houses, and 
agriculture were reported. Acts of violence committed by settlers or related to the 
protection of settlements resulted in the killing of two Palestinians, cases which were 
documented by OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>43. On 13 May, four boys from Al Mazra&#8217;a Ash-Sharqiya went to an olive grove near 
Route 60, a road regularly used by settlers to travel to Jerusalem. The boys threw stones at 
cars. According to information received by OHCHR, a car, allegedly driven by Israelis 
from a nearby settlement, stopped and two or three passengers stepped out of the vehicle 
and opened fire. Aysar Yasser Fawwaz Razzaq was shot and died at the scene. On 22 
September, Samer Mahmoud Ahmad Sarhan was shot and killed by a private security guard 
employed by the Ministry of Housing to provide security for settlers living in Silwan. 
Conflicting reports exist with regard to the circumstances surrounding this incident, namely 
whether the victim had been throwing stones at the vehicle of the guard implicated. 
According to information gathered by OHCHR, it took 30 minutes for an ambulance to 
arrive and more than 45 minutes for the police. Media reports indicated that the police 
organized a re-enactment of the incident, with the assistance of the guard involved, and that

<p>the police director stated later, without further investigation, that he accepted the guard&#8217;s 
description of the incident.50 
</p>
<p>44. In 13 other cases monitored by OHCHR, groups of armed settlers, protected by IDF 
in most cases, harassed, assaulted and attacked civilians, desecrated mosques, vandalized 
schools and burnt olive and fruit trees and vehicles owned by Palestinians. On 14 April, 
settlers from Yitzhar settlement entered Huwwara in the early morning and painted graffiti 
on the town&#8217;s mosque. The same group of settlers set fire to three cars belonging to 
residents. On 24 April, another group of settlers from the same settlement destroyed olive 
trees and property in the town. They started the attack by setting fire to olive groves. Then 
they attacked and damaged the public park. Windows of one house were broken. In all of 
these cases, the victims communicated information on the incidents to the Palestinian 
District Coordination Liaison Offices (DCL), which in turn filed complaints with their 
Israeli counterparts. OHCHR was informed that Israeli DCL officers normally receive all 
information on settler violence, but that they rarely communicate with the Palestinian DCL 
regarding follow&#8211;up. 
</p>
<p>45. The number of settler attacks rose in October, when Palestinians commenced the 
olive harvest. Four Israeli human rights organizations sent an urgent letter to senior Israeli 
military commanders, in which they called on them to take all necessary steps to ensure that 
Palestinians and their properties would be protected from violence and damage.51 The letter 
listed 35 incidents in which damage was caused to Palestinian olive trees or properties. 
</p>
<p>46. Israel has the obligation to ensure public order and safety (Hague Regulations, art. 
43) throughout the West Bank. Israel must exert all efforts to stop and prevent acts of 
violence, especially killings perpetrated by Israeli citizens. IDF occasionally take action to 
prevent or limit violence committed by settlers. Victims of settler violence are then 
requested to file complaints at the nearest Israeli police station. Yet Israeli police rarely 
inform the victims of the status of the investigations, or of the prosecution of perpetrators. 
The very limited number of prosecutions for acts of violence committed by settlers 
contributes to a climate of impunity.52  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Attacks on civilians by Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>47. On 31 August, a car travelling in the West Bank near Hebron was the target of a 
shooting, resulting in the killing of the four occupants. The occupants were reported to be 
Israelis from a settlement in the West Bank. The armed wing of Hamas claimed 
responsibility for the attack.53 A day later, two Israeli settlers were wounded when their car 
was the target of a shooting in the Ramallah District.54 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Arrests and detention of children 
</b></p>
<p>48. There is a worrying trend for arrest, detention and mistreatment of Palestinian 
children in Israeli detention facilities. During the reporting period, Palestinian children were

<p>arrested at checkpoints, on the street and during home raids. Children and their families 
were seldom informed of the charges against them.55 Children were subjected to beating, 
kicking, verbal abuse and threats during interrogation. An average of 303 Palestinian 
children (12&#8211;17 years old) were detained in Israeli prisons during the reporting period,56 in 
contravention of article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. At the end of October, 256 
children remained in Israeli detention, including 34 between the ages of 12&#8211;15 years.57 Two 
children had remained in detention without charge or trial since March.58 As of August, 
42.5 per cent of Palestinian children in Israeli prisons were held in facilities with adults.59 
Children as young as thirteen were sentenced to house arrest away from their families.60 
OHCHR documented the case of a 13-year-old resident of Hebron who was sentenced to 
five months of house arrest in a home away from his family.61 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Arbitrary detention by the Palestinian Authority and treatment in detention 
</b></p>
<p>49. Palestinian Authority security forces detained citizens throughout the West Bank 
without following appropriate legal procedures, in violation of international human rights 
law62 and the Palestinian Basic Law. From March to the conclusion of the reporting period, 
hundreds of Palestinians were arbitrarily detained. In many of those cases, ill-treatment was 
carried out by the Palestinian General Intelligence Services (Mukhabarat) or the Palestinian 
Preventive Security Service (PSS). 
</p>
<p>50. The arrests carried out by Palestinian security forces targeted PLC members, 
university professors, journalists and ordinary citizens. On 21 September, a Palestinian 
security force raided the house of a PLC member in Deir Al Ghusun and transported him to 
the security compound (Mukata&#8217;a) in Tulkarem before he was released.63 Journalists were 
also victims of arbitrary detention. In March, the Mukhabarat arrested a Palestinian 
journalist while he crossed the Allenby Bridge. He was released after spending 15 days in 
the Mukhabarat interrogation centre in Jericho. In May, he was re-arrested and detained for 
approximately ten days in Juneid prison. In neither case was he charged with a crime. He 
was ill-treated and, when not detained, was not permitted to travel to Jordan &#8211; where he 
lives and works.64 Employees of Islamic charities were also targeted by Palestinian security 
services. On 13 September, PSS in Hebron arrested a man who was transferred to Adh 
Dhahiriya and later to the PSS detention facility in Jericho. The man was detained until 3 
November, whereupon he was released without having been charged.65

<p>51. Following the killing of four Israeli settlers in the Hebron district (see para. 49 
above), Palestinian security forces launched a campaign during which hundreds of 
Palestinians were reportedly arrested. Two days after the attack, it was reported that 
members of PSS and the Mukhabarat had arrested at least 350 persons.66 In addition, ICHR 
reported that more than 126 Palestinians were subjected to ill-treatment and torture, 
inflicted by Palestinian security agencies, from February to October 2010.67 
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR received information that, following this wave of arrest human rights, 
nongovernmental organizations and ICHR did not have the same level of access to 
Palestinian detention sites as they had before the campaign. OHCHR also experienced 
difficulties obtaining access to places of detention following these events, which it had not 
experienced prior to the campaign. However, following a number of constructive meetings 
with the Ministry of Interior, access to detention facilities was made easier.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Restrictions on civil society in areas under Palestinian Authority control 
</b></p>
<p>53. It appears that a consequence of the tension between the de facto authorities in Gaza 
and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is intense pressure on civil society 
organizations, human rights defenders and journalists in the West Bank. Palestinian 
Authority security forces raided media institutions and prevented journalists from carrying 
out their work, in violation of international law and the Palestinian Basic Law. 
</p>
<p>54. On 17 July, Palestinian security forces raided Watan television station, while 
covering a march by an Islamic party. Two journalists employed by the same station were 
attacked by Palestinian Authority security forces while covering a march in Ramallah on 25 
August.68 The radio station &#8220;Bethlehem 2000&#8221; manager was arrested by the Mukhabarat on 
15 November, after the station had reported on differences between the president of the 
Palestinian Authority and a member of Fatah&#8217;s Central Committee. He was released five 
days later.69 In another case, PSS arrested a journalist working for Quds Press News 
Agency. During detention, he was interrogated regarding interviews he had conducted with 
members of Hamas.70 It is noted that staff members of ICHR were harassed by Mukhabarat 
officers in May, while travelling to visit PLC members in Nablus.71 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory remained of 
profound concern throughout the reporting period. Serious violations occurred on a 
widespread and persistent basis. The preponderance of such violations was 
attributable to acts or omissions by Israel. With regard to international humanitarian 
law, Israel continued to fail to fulfil its obligations as the Occupying Power.</b>  
</p>
<p>56. <b>Serious violations of international human rights also occurred due to acts or 
omissions of other duty bearers, namely the Palestinian Authority and the de facto 
authorities in Gaza. Furthermore, the de facto authorities in Gaza violated

and mortars toward Israel. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>It is critical to note that the recommendations made by the Secretary-General 
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights in recent reports on the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory have still not been implemented.</b>72<b> They remain valid and need 
to be implemented as a matter of urgency.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Many of the recommendations contained in the report of the United Nations 
Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict also remain to be effectively implemented 
(A/HRC/12/48, para. 1979 (b)), including those addressed to Israel (para. 1972 (a)&#8211;(i)) 
regarding the blockade of Gaza and its concomitant regime that limits sea access and 
agricultural activity; rules of engagement, standard operating procedures and open 
fire regulations in accordance with international humanitarian law; freedom of 
movement; Palestinian children detained in Israeli prisons and discriminatory 
treatment of Palestinian detainees; detention of PLC members; an independent 
inquiry to assess whether the treatment by Israeli judicial authorities of Palestinian 
and Jewish Israelis expressing dissent in relation to the Gaza conflict was 
discriminatory; and the need to reiterate a commitment to respecting the inviolability 
of United Nations premises and personnel. In relation to recommendations that were 
addressed to Palestinian armed groups (para. 1973 (a)&#8211;(b)), there remains a need to 
ensure respect for international humanitarian law and, with regard to Israeli soldier 
Gilad Shalit, to act on the Mission&#8217;s recommendation to release him on humanitarian 
grounds. With respect to recommendations to responsible Palestinian authorities, 
paragraph 1974 (b) regarding political detainees has not been implemented, and 
Palestinian non-governmental organizations still are not able to operate freely and 
independently in line with paragraph 1974 (c). 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>In this context the High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends that the 
Government of Israel take the following actions: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Fully lift the blockade of Gaza, with due regard to legitimate security 
concerns. This should include putting in place more efficient measures to facilitate the 
movement of people to and from Gaza, permitting goods to be exported from Gaza, 
and ensuring that materials for reconstruction can be delivered to Gaza; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Bring policies and practices regarding the detention of persons from the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory into compliance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
in particular with respect to detaining them within occupied territory; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Publicly clarify restrictions on freedom of movement inside Gaza, 
including with respect to its maritime territory. Such restrictions should take full 
account of the agricultural, fishing and other affected industries in Gaza, and the 
impact that these industries have on the human rights situation. Further, the methods 
of enforcing such restrictions should be consistent with Israel&#8217;s international legal 
obligations, and should never include the use of live ammunition against civilians; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Adopt effective measures to lessen tension in East Jerusalem, in 
particular by ending the demolition of Palestinian homes, desisting from building 
settlements, facilitating access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and preventing, investigating 
and prosecuting violent acts perpetrated by Israeli settlers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Bring relevant policies and practices into compliance with the Fourth 
Geneva Convention&#8217;s prohibition on the forcible transfer of civilians in occupied

<p><b> (g) Cease the expansion of settlements and dismantle existing settlements,
