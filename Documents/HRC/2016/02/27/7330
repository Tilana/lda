<p><b>and implementation of the Durban Declaration

<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance submits the present report pursuant to General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 69/160 on combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other 
</p>
<p>practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance. In paragraph 43 of that resolution, the Assembly 
</p>
<p>requested the Special Rapporteur to prepare for submission to the Human Rights Council at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-ninth session, a report on the implementation of the resolution, based on the 
</p>
<p>views of Governments and non-governmental organizations, gathered in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the request made by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2005/5. 
</p>
<p>The present report addresses developments identified by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>with regard to the human rights and democratic challenges that extremist political parties, 
</p>
<p>movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead groups and similar extremist 
</p>
<p>ideological movements, continue to pose. 
</p>
<p>In that context, the Special Rapporteur examines the main areas of concern in which 
</p>
<p>further efforts and constant vigilance are required, including with regard to the protection 
</p>
<p>of vulnerable groups of individuals against racist and xenophobic crimes and the promotion 
</p>
<p>and consolidation of democracy and human rights in general. He also identifies good 
</p>
<p>practices developed by States and various stakeholders. 
</p>

<p>The present report includes the recommendations made on the issue by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur in his previous reports to the General Assembly (A/69/334) and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council (A/HRC/26/50 and A/HRC/23/24) as they remain applicable and valid, 
</p>
<p>despite efforts made to address the problem of glorification of Nazism and other practices 
</p>
<p>that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and related intolerance. Those recommendations are clustered at the end of the report by 
</p>
<p>sectors for easy reference. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the current requirement to report twice 
</p>
<p>per year on this specific issue is not an optimal mechanism for fulfilling the obligations of 
</p>
<p>his mandate as set out in General Assembly resolution 69/160 and, considering that there 
</p>
<p>have been no major developments since the presentation of his last report on the issue to 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly and to the Human Rights Council, he is of the view that those 
</p>
<p>obligations would be best served by the submission of a single report annually to the 
</p>
<p>Assembly. The Special Rapporteur believes that other streams of his work could be used to 
</p>
<p>address this important issue in a concrete way, which could allow for more in-depth 
</p>
<p>dialogue and engagement with Governments, non-governmental organizations and relevant 
</p>
<p>actors, thus enabling them to work in a concerted fashion towards the implementation of 
</p>
<p>both existing and future recommendations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 69/160, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 43, in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to prepare, for 
</p>
<p>submission to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-ninth session, a report on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of that resolution on combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and 
</p>
<p>other practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, based on the views of Governments and 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>2. In paragraph 41 of General Assembly resolution 69/160, the Assembly recalled the 
</p>
<p>request of the Commission of Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/5, that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur continue to reflect on that issue, make relevant recommendations in his future 
</p>
<p>reports and seek and take into account in that regard the views of Governments and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations. Furthermore, in accordance with paragraph 43 of Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 69/160, the Special Rapporteur will be submitting a similar report to the 
</p>
<p>Assembly at its seventieth session. 
</p>
<p>3. In section II of the present report, the Special Rapporteur addresses the human rights 
</p>
<p>and democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups, 
</p>
<p>including neo-Nazis, skinhead groups and similar extremist ideological movements, in the 
</p>
<p>context of the current economic crisis. In section III, he examines cyberracism and hate 
</p>
<p>propaganda disseminated in social media by extremist political parties, movements and 
</p>
<p>groups. Section IV concerns extremism in sports. Section V is dedicated to countering 
</p>
<p>Holocaust denial and the distortion of history. The Special Rapporteur identifies good 
</p>
<p>practices developed by States and different stakeholders in section VI, and section VII 
</p>
<p>contains his conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Information received relating to the existence of extremist 
political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, 
skinhead groups and similar extremist ideological movements 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the present section, the Special Rapporteur focuses on information received 
</p>
<p>relating to the existence of extremist political parties, movements and groups, including 
</p>
<p>neo-Nazis, skinhead groups and similar extremist ideological movements. The challenges 
</p>
<p>concern (a) the protection and consolidation of human rights in a democratic context; (b) 
</p>
<p>protecting victims and vulnerable groups against racist and xenophobic crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Protecting and consolidating democracy and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
</p>
<p>Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban, South Africa, and in the subsequent 
</p>
<p>Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, States recognized that political manifestos 
</p>
<p>and organizations based on racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related 
</p>
<p>discrimination were irreconcilable with principles of democracy and good governance. 
</p>
<p>6. As noted in his thematic reports to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/26/50 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/24), the Special Rapporteur has received information that extremist political 
</p>
<p>parties, movements and groups have continued to gain influence in several countries and 
</p>
<p>regions. Throughout Europe in particular, there has been an increase in the number of local 
</p>
<p>and regional parliamentary seats occupied by representatives of extremist political parties. </p>


<p>A number of far-right political parties have also gained ground in local parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections, as well as in the European Parliament.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in some countries, some mainstream 
</p>
<p>political parties continue to form coalitions with extremist political parties. He emphasizes 
</p>
<p>the need for all democratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law and to condemn 
</p>
<p>political messaging that has the objective of fuelling racist, xenophobic, discriminatory or 
</p>
<p>intolerant ideas. 
</p>
<p>8. Stigmatization and targeting of vulnerable groups during sustained periods of 
</p>
<p>austerity in some countries continue and with them the increasing tendency of political 
</p>
<p>leaders to blame certain groups for high unemployment rates, cuts in social benefits and 
</p>
<p>increasing poverty. Extremist political parties place the burden of the negative 
</p>
<p>consequences of such crises on foreigners, migrants (including irregular migrants), minority 
</p>
<p>groups, refugees and asylum seekers. Those groups are often perceived as a threat to the 
</p>
<p>standard of living of the general population in those countries. According to information 
</p>
<p>received, individuals from the Muslim and Jewish faiths, as well as those from the Roma 
</p>
<p>communities, have been singled out and stigmatized and, in some cases, have been at the 
</p>
<p>receiving end of intolerance and violence, incited by political leaders. As stated in his 
</p>
<p>thematic report (A/HRC/26/50), political leaders should take all the necessary measures to 
</p>
<p>deal adequately with social and economic issues, especially during periods of economic 
</p>
<p>recession, and not use extremist rhetoric, particularly during electoral campaigns, in order 
</p>
<p>to secure re-election. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur is reassured, however, by reports from some Eastern 
</p>
<p>European countries that politicians from the same party or coalitions have spoken out 
</p>
<p>against such populist language targeting vulnerable groups. It is essential that mainstream 
</p>
<p>political parties and politicians, including high-level political leaders, clearly and 
</p>
<p>unequivocally condemn expressions of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance. He 
</p>
<p>encourages politicians and political parties to break away from the continuing rhetoric 
</p>
<p>which seeks to inflame tensions rather than build mutual understanding and respect. 
</p>
<p>Echoing the views expressed in his above-mentioned thematic report, he again stresses the 
</p>
<p>importance of addressing such discourse when it arises from within the parties&#8217; own ranks.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Protecting victims and vulnerable groups against racist and xenophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes  
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur has received reports that incidents of racist and xenophobic 
</p>
<p>violence continue to be perpetrated by extremist movements and groups, including neo-
</p>
<p>Nazis, skinheads and other right-wing movements, against Roma, Muslims, Jews and non-
</p>
<p>traditional religious groups and their places of worship. As previously noted in his reports 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/23/24 and A/HRC/26/50), he continues to be concerned about reports of incidents 
</p>
<p>of harassment and violence against persons of African descent. He is also concerned by 
</p>
<p>information regarding violence against migrants and foreigners, committed by individuals 
</p>
<p>closely linked to far-right nationalist parties, including arson attacks on houses, 
</p>
<p>vandalization of schools and places of worship as well as cases of stabbing of migrants and 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers in the street. Information has further been received regarding threats against 
</p>
<p>Muslim women wearing headscarves, and physical attacks on imams at mosques. There 
</p>
<p>have been reports of Jewish schools being painted with swastikas and slogans against Jews. 
</p>
<p>Jewish cemeteries have been desecrated and gravestones broken and painted with 
</p>
<p>swastikas. He is also concerned at reports of attacks on civil society organizations working 
</p>
<p>on anti-racism issues.  </p>


<p>11. Hate speech targeting refugees in particular has resulted in actual violence against 
</p>
<p>that group as well as persons perceived to belong to it. As noted in the report of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to the General Assembly (A/69/334), racial discrimination and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance are common reasons for persons to flee their countries and can also threaten the 
</p>
<p>protection of asylum seekers and refugees at the different stages of the displacement cycle. 
</p>
<p>In Southern Africa, foreign nationals are increasingly viewed as competitors for scarce 
</p>
<p>economic opportunities, which can fuel xenophobia and have a negative impact on the 
</p>
<p>protection environment for refugees and asylum seekers in the region. Furthermore, as 
</p>
<p>explained in the above-mentioned report, the lack of legal and normative frameworks 
</p>
<p>relating to international protection in Asia and the Pacific region compromises the rights 
</p>
<p>afforded to displaced persons who may be in need of international protection as a result of 
</p>
<p>ethnic, racial or xenophobic persecution in their country of origin. Ensuring that 
</p>
<p>humanitarian responses are not hampered by the focus on migration policy and border 
</p>
<p>protection remains a challenge.  
</p>
<p>12. As previously illustrated (A/HRC/23/24), the Special Rapporteur has received 
</p>
<p>further information regarding cases of extremism in police forces. In some countries, 
</p>
<p>members of the police force openly propagate far-right, nationalistic and xenophobic ideas 
</p>
<p>and discourse in their official capacity as guardians of public order and civil servants of the 
</p>
<p>State. He is particularly concerned at reports from Eastern Europe that police officers are 
</p>
<p>sometimes reluctant to intervene to stop harassment, verbal abuse and violent attacks and/or 
</p>
<p>receive complaints from victims of racist and xenophobic crimes, particularly migrants and 
</p>
<p>those from minority groups, and to investigate those incidents. That not only makes victims 
</p>
<p>more reluctant to report racist or xenophobic acts, especially if they have irregular 
</p>
<p>residence status in a particular country, but also creates a climate of impunity for extremist 
</p>
<p>and vigilante groups. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at allegations of increasing 
</p>
<p>police involvement in crimes of sexual and gender-based violence against women of 
</p>
<p>African descent and women from ethnic minorities, which often go unreported or are not 
</p>
<p>thoroughly investigated.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur has received reports of attacks by individuals and groups 
</p>
<p>linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups on homosexual and bisexual men, and lesbian and 
</p>
<p>transgender women. The same groups that attack, discriminate and promote discrimination 
</p>
<p>against racial minorities are also involved in attacks against individuals on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>sexual identity. 
</p>
<p>14. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the identity of an individual is made up of 
</p>
<p>multiple components, including gender, age, nationality, profession, sexual orientation, 
</p>
<p>political opinion, religious affiliation and social origin; therefore, tolerance, mutual 
</p>
<p>understanding and respect for all, without prejudice, stereotyping or discrimination, should 
</p>
<p>be the basis of human relations of any kind. He also notes the underreporting of that type of 
</p>
<p>violence and urges States to take the necessary measures to address the multiple and often 
</p>
<p>interlinked forms of discrimination faced by individuals on the basis of their race, colour, 
</p>
<p>descent, national or ethnic origin or sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>15. The impact of racist and xenophobic ideas and values on some of the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups who have been most affected by the financial and economic crisis, such 
</p>
<p>as young people, the elderly and impoverished citizens, is also of concern to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. Those groups are likely to feel the full negative effects of high unemployment 
</p>
<p>and cuts in social services. In countries and regions such as Eastern and Southern Europe, 
</p>
<p>which have been hardest hit by austerity measures, those persons often do not see a future 
</p>
<p>for themselves or opportunities for improvement. Extremist ideologies can thus grow easily 
</p>
<p>in such a climate of discontent. The Special Rapporteur recalls the view he set out in a 
</p>
<p>previous report (A/HRC/23/24) that education is important and it is the responsibility of the 
</p>
<p>State to counter the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred and to </p>


<p>promote the values of non-discrimination, equality, diversity, democracy and respect for all. 
</p>
<p>He recognizes, nonetheless, the important role of parents and family in helping to foster a 
</p>
<p>culture of tolerance and respect.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about ongoing reports that victims are reluctant 
</p>
<p>to come forward and report incidents to the appropriate authorities for fear of reprisals, fear 
</p>
<p>of prosecution, especially if their residence status is precarious or irregular, a belief that 
</p>
<p>police will not investigate, a lack of trust in the criminal justice system in addition to 
</p>
<p>language barriers and ignorance of their rights. The Special Rapporteur urges States to take 
</p>
<p>further measures to better engage with victims so as to reduce fears, create a sense of trust 
</p>
<p>between victims, police and prosecution and promote the reporting of such crimes. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, he encourages the provision of training for law enforcement officers and 
</p>
<p>members of the judiciary in order that they may properly address racist and xenophobic 
</p>
<p>crimes in an effective, appropriate manner, one that is compatible with international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to reiterate the concerns set out in his 
</p>
<p>previous report (A/HRC/23/24) that many racist crimes go underreported, thus potentially 
</p>
<p>underestimating the scope and nature of the problem. The lack of accurate and current 
</p>
<p>ethnically disaggregated data, which include sex-disaggregated data, particularly in the case 
</p>
<p>of irregular migrants and asylum seekers, may give the impression that racist crimes by 
</p>
<p>extremist political parties, movements and groups do not exist, or are less prevalent than in 
</p>
<p>reality. Some national action plans lack mechanisms and sufficient financial support for 
</p>
<p>collecting and disseminating disaggregated data. Collection of such data is critical, as it can 
</p>
<p>help inform policy decisions on combating those crimes. The Special Rapporteur is of the 
</p>
<p>opinion that both States and civil society should establish detailed systems for recording, 
</p>
<p>reporting and monitoring such incidents and for encouraging victims to report them. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Cyberracism and hate propaganda disseminated in social 
media by extremist political parties, movements and groups</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. According to information received, racist and intolerant hate speech in political 
</p>
<p>discourse is escalating, in particular against refugees and asylum seekers. In the media, on 
</p>
<p>the Internet and in social networks, expressions of racism and xenophobia against 
</p>
<p>foreigners and ethnic minorities have become commonplace, as has abusive language, when 
</p>
<p>referring, for example, to the Roma. In Eastern Europe, the Special Rapporteur has received 
</p>
<p>reports of an open anti-Roma campaign waged by the media in one country where Roma 
</p>
<p>are presented as a demographic threat. According to reports, there is a worrying tolerance 
</p>
<p>of such practices on the part of the public.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that very few cases of hate speech have 
</p>
<p>been dealt with by justice systems and also that the conviction rate is so low. In one Eastern 
</p>
<p>European country in 2014, out of a total of 56 pretrial proceedings which were initiated 
</p>
<p>under the crime of preaching hatred on religious grounds, not one resulted in a conviction. 
</p>
<p>The trend appears to be that criminal law provisions in force to combat hate speech are 
</p>
<p>rarely invoked and hardly ever successfully. That sets a dangerous precedent implying that 
</p>
<p>hate speech is not a serious offence and can be used with impunity. Although the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes the response of some high-level public figures who have issued 
</p>
<p>declarations condemning such acts and appealing for solidarity, he notes that some attempts 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See also the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/26/49). </p>


<p>to ban extremist political parties for incitement to ethnic and religiously motivated hatred 
</p>
<p>have not succeeded.  
</p>
<p>20. New technologies such as the Internet and social media have developed rapidly, but 
</p>
<p>they are unfortunately increasingly used as instruments for the dissemination of racist ideas 
</p>
<p>and hate speech under the supposed anonymity provided by online forums. As noted in his 
</p>
<p>previous report (A/HRC/26/50), the Special Rapporteur is concerned that some extremist 
</p>
<p>groups may have moved their activities to the Internet and social media networks in order 
</p>
<p>to spread their ideas and propaganda with relative impunity.  
</p>
<p>21. According to information received, extremist movements and groups are actively 
</p>
<p>present on the Internet and social media networks and publish material on their websites or 
</p>
<p>on those of sympathetic organizations, which promote and incite racial discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violence. Not only do those websites and social media networks serve as avenues to spread 
</p>
<p>hate speech and incite racial violence and abuse against specific groups, they are also a 
</p>
<p>means of expanding their network of supporters worldwide, who can easily join in various 
</p>
<p>online events and meetings without the constraint of distance. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>notes that, in some countries, systems in place for sanctioning violations of relevant 
</p>
<p>legislation relating to social media are ineffective. 
</p>
<p>22. By the same token, the Special Rapporteur recognizes that the Internet and social 
</p>
<p>media can be used for preventing the spread of racist ideologies by extremist political 
</p>
<p>parties, groups and movements and notes with appreciation that the mainstream media in 
</p>
<p>some countries have started to recognize the cultural value of diversity and to promote the 
</p>
<p>idea of improving the living and working conditions of members of minorities. Other 
</p>
<p>positive initiatives include the creation of social network-based platforms by civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations at the national level targeting the youth with the specific aim of countering 
</p>
<p>extremism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, in addition to promoting a 
</p>
<p>democratic culture.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Preventing and countering racism and extremism in sport</b>2<b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. According to reports received, extremist groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead 
</p>
<p>groups, operate at sporting venues, in particular football matches, and at some individual 
</p>
<p>professional sporting events. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about an increase in 
</p>
<p>reported cases of racist symbols and banners displayed during football matches, as well as 
</p>
<p>the shouting of racist slogans and the making of racist gestures on those occasions. Those 
</p>
<p>abuses are often targeted at foreign players, players or supporters of African descent, or at 
</p>
<p>others because of their ethnic origin.  
</p>
<p>24. Given the important role that professional athletes play in inspiring the youth, those 
</p>
<p>incidents are of particular concern. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the view expressed in 
</p>
<p>his previous report (A/HRC/26/50), that there is no place for racism and intolerance in 
</p>
<p>sport. Sport is meant to bring different cultures together in a celebration of healthy 
</p>
<p>competition, and to overcome the social and political divisions that often divide countries 
</p>
<p>and communities.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that States, sports federations and other 
</p>
<p>relevant authorities must address the problem of extremist groups, including neo-Nazis, 
</p>
<p>skinhead groups and hooligans at sports events, including football matches. It is imperative 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See also the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance to the General Assembly (A/69/334). </p>


<p>that preventative measures be taken to avoid acts of racial violence, xenophobia, abuse and 
</p>
<p>incitement to racial hatred by extremist individuals.  
</p>
<p>26. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by information received 
</p>
<p>regarding measures taken by some States to counter racism and extremism in sports. One 
</p>
<p>example is a conference organized by an Eastern European sports association in partnership 
</p>
<p>with a local non-governmental organization, using the positive values of sports to counter 
</p>
<p>racism and stereotyping.  
</p>
<p>27. Referring again to his previous report (A/HRC/26/50), the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>reiterates that States are bound by the obligations set forth in international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination. He recalls the requirements set out in Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 13/27, urging States and the relevant international and regional organizations to 
</p>
<p>intensify the fight against racism in sport. He also encourages national and international 
</p>
<p>sports organizations and federations to develop and implement codes of conduct that 
</p>
<p>address the issue of extremist ideologies and intolerance among supporters, and urges 
</p>
<p>States to seize the opportunity to use sporting events as a vehicle to promote respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Countering Holocaust denial and the distortion of history</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. Holocaust denial is an attempt to negate the established facts of the Nazi genocide of 
</p>
<p>European Jews, Roma, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons as well as political 
</p>
<p>opponents. Some key denial assertions are that the murder of approximately 6 million Jews 
</p>
<p>during the Second World War never occurred, that the Nazis had no official policy or 
</p>
<p>intention to exterminate the Jews and that the concentration camps such as Auschwitz-
</p>
<p>Birkenau never existed nor served that purpose.  
</p>
<p>29. Holocaust denial and distortion are generally motivated by strong anti-Semitism, 
</p>
<p>and build on the claim that the Holocaust was invented or exaggerated as part of a plot to 
</p>
<p>advance Jewish interests. That is a view that perpetuates long-standing anti-Semitic 
</p>
<p>prejudices and stereotypes and the Special Rapporteur recalls that the Holocaust is one of 
</p>
<p>the tragic events of the past century that has been well documented. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is particularly concerned about allegations regarding a cartoon competition disdaining the 
</p>
<p>Holocaust and insulting the victims and remaining survivors of that tragedy. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his condemnation of attempts by extreme right-
</p>
<p>wing groups to deny the Holocaust and falsify history. Such revisions contribute to the 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation and dissemination of Nazism and other extreme ideologies and create fertile 
</p>
<p>ground for nationalist and neo-Nazi demonstrations. The Special Rapporteur is concerned 
</p>
<p>about reports of university professors explicitly denying the existence of the Holocaust in a 
</p>
<p>public academic setting in an Eastern European country, which received applause from the 
</p>
<p>audience. The Special Rapporteur reminds all stakeholders that such events set dangerous 
</p>
<p>precedents, do not promote values of tolerance and mutual understanding and run counter 
</p>
<p>to provisions of several General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions on the 
</p>
<p>matter.4  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of criminalizing the approval, denial 
</p>
<p>or belittlement of the Holocaust in national law, especially considering that such a denial 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The Special Rapporteur addressed the issue of Holocaust denial and the distortion of history in 2014, 
</p>
<p>in his reports to the General Assembly (A/69/334) and the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/26/50).  
</p>
<p> 4 See, for example, General Assembly resolutions 65/199, 66/143, 67/154 and 68/150.  </p>


<p>could promote racist rhetoric and, as such, constitutes hate speech under article 4 (a) of the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. He 
</p>
<p>welcomes the fact that Holocaust denial is clearly considered a crime in a number of 
</p>
<p>countries. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur continues to call for the active preservation of Holocaust 
</p>
<p>sites that served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced labour camps. He 
</p>
<p>encourages States to take concrete measures, including legislative and educational ones, 
</p>
<p>such as inclusion of education about the Holocaust in school curricula, so as to prevent 
</p>
<p>revisionism of the Second World War, the denial of the Holocaust and the Nazi genocide 
</p>
<p>and the glorification of Nazi criminals, which lead to the growth of neo-Nazi, xenophobic 
</p>
<p>and anti-Semitic sentiments and serve to provoke inter-ethnic conflicts. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Good practices in countering extremist political parties, 
movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead 
groups and similar extremist ideological movements 
</b></p>
<p>33. While not exhaustive, the examples of good practices presented below, as noted in 
</p>
<p>the previous thematic reports of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/23/24 and A/HRC/26/50), 
</p>
<p>have been developed to counter extremist political parties, movements and groups and 
</p>
<p>provide an overview of some the legislative, policy and institutional measures taken by 
</p>
<p>States in different areas that could serve as models and be adapted to a local context. Such 
</p>
<p>measures taken by States have also been complemented by initiatives developed by civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that a growing number of States 
</p>
<p>have included prohibitions against racial discrimination and xenophobia in their domestic 
</p>
<p>legislation. Furthermore, an increasing number of States have incorporated the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination into their domestic 
</p>
<p>law, and have recognized the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of 
</p>
<p>individuals claiming to be victims of a violation by the State of any of the rights under 
</p>
<p>article 14 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>35. In addition, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that a growing number of 
</p>
<p>States, particularly in Eastern Europe, have either enacted specific laws, or introduced 
</p>
<p>amendments to their Criminal Codes, with provisions on aggravating circumstances for 
</p>
<p>offences committed on the grounds of persecution or hatred based on race, religion or 
</p>
<p>nationality, or for the purposes of completely or partially annihilating a national, ethnic, 
</p>
<p>racial or religious group or individual. In some countries, there are enhanced penalties for 
</p>
<p>murder and causing bodily harm committed with racist or xenophobic motives and 
</p>
<p>criminalization of organized violence at sporting events. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes that some countries have included provisions in their 
</p>
<p>migration and refugee laws that reaffirm the principle of non-discrimination and require the 
</p>
<p>relevant institutions in charge of issues relating to migrants and refugees to take all the 
</p>
<p>necessary measures to prevent discrimination against those groups.  
</p>
<p>37. In some instances, the above-mentioned legislative developments have also been 
</p>
<p>accompanied by the establishment of specific institutions such as national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions or ombudspersons, in accordance with the Paris Principles, to receive and 
</p>
<p>consider complaints and investigate cases of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance and/or communications referred to in the International Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In particular, the Special Rapporteur </p>


<p>welcomes the measures taken by a national commission on human rights in a Southern 
</p>
<p>European country to combat racism in sports, including the appointment of a special 
</p>
<p>prosecutor for crimes of racist violence. He also notes the creation in a Latin-American 
</p>
<p>country of a monitoring mechanism for hate speech on the Internet, which aims to identify 
</p>
<p>early racist crimes online and the eradication of any form of discrimination online, 
</p>
<p>including the removal of discriminatory material from public web pages.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the above-mentioned developments and 
</p>
<p>recommends that such specialized institutions, in addition to monitoring and raising 
</p>
<p>awareness about the challenges posed by extremist political parties, provide advice on 
</p>
<p>measures to address them. States should ensure that such institutions have a strong 
</p>
<p>mandate, independence and sufficient resources to execute their programmes. 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, the Special Rapporteur has received information regarding measures 
</p>
<p>taken by some States regarding the training of their officials, in particular, law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agents. In one Middle Eastern country, the Human Rights Commission organized 
</p>
<p>workshops to raise human rights awareness among police officers, the judiciary and State 
</p>
<p>officials. Legislation relating to the dissemination of a human rights culture in that same 
</p>
<p>country was also adopted, which included the development of a national action plan. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that human rights education is of particular 
</p>
<p>importance for a number of States and that specific units dealing with hate crimes and 
</p>
<p>racism have been established, including within the Office of the Public Prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur continues to appreciate the many examples of awareness-
</p>
<p>raising activities that have been conducted by States to foster tolerance and respect for 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity, to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance and to strengthen intercultural dialogue. Those activities include the 
</p>
<p>organization of cultural events, art festivals of national minorities, exhibitions, concerts, 
</p>
<p>seminars and forums in addition to the publication of books and brochures promoting 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity. He encourages such initiatives, which offer space for further intercultural 
</p>
<p>dialogue and interaction. Other measures are also welcomed, such as information 
</p>
<p>broadcasts on television and the Internet aimed at promoting acceptance and tolerance 
</p>
<p>among different ethnic groups. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that, in some 
</p>
<p>countries, the mainstream media have started to recognize the cultural value of diversity 
</p>
<p>and to promote the idea of improving the living and working conditions of minority groups.  
</p>
<p>41. Finally, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that continued cooperation with relevant 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights mechanisms and civil society organizations is 
</p>
<p>important in countering extremist political parties, movements and groups, and he notes 
</p>
<p>with appreciation the engagement of States with regional and international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The recommendations the Special Rapporteur had made in his previous reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/23/24 and A/HRC/26/50) and the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly (A/69/334) remain valid and current. They are presented again below, 
</b></p>
<p><b>clustered by thematic area for easy reference.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political measures 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts made by States to counter 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead </b></p>


<p><b>groups and similar extremist ideological movements. While good practices have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>identified, important challenges remain, such as the rise in extremist political parties, 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead groups and similar extremist 
</b></p>
<p><b>ideological movements, which continue to pose major human rights and democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges. Greater vigilance from all States and relevant actors is therefore required. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In that regard, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that a comprehensive approach 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on a solid legal framework, complemented by other measures including key 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy measures such as education and awareness-raising programmes, and a victim-
</b></p>
<p><b>centred approach, should be further developed and implemented. Good practices such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as those mentioned in the present report should also be exchanged on a regular basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>among all actors working in the field. To that end, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following specific recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>As long as extremist political parties, movements and groups continue to exist 
</b></p>
<p><b>legally or illegally, they will remain a major challenge to democracy. In that regard, 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should always bear in mind that preserving and consolidating the values of 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy are essential to preventing and combating racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance effectively. Political leaders and parties must 
</b></p>
<p><b>therefore strongly condemn all messages disseminating ideas based on racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination or xenophobia. They should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be aware of the moral authority they bear, promote tolerance and respect, and refrain 
</b></p>
<p><b>from forming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law should always 
</b></p>
<p><b>be the cornerstone of all their programmes and activities, bearing in mind the need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that political and legal systems reflect the multicultural character of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>societies.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>As stated in paragraph 13 of the outcome document of the Durban Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Programme of Action, any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence should be prohibited by 
</b></p>
<p><b>law, as should be the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, 
</b></p>
<p><b>incitement to racial discrimination as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to respect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments made in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, which is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive framework for action against racism, racial discrimination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia. He also recommends that States adopt legislation that conforms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards, including the International Convention on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, paying particular attention to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations under article 4 of the Convention. In that connection, in order to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>and address in an effective manner the commission of racist or xenophobic crimes by 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals and groups of individuals closely linked to extremist political parties, 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements and groups, States should introduce into domestic criminal law a 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision to the effect that the commission of an offence with racist, xenophobic, anti-
</b></p>
<p><b>Semitic or homophobic motivation or aim constitutes an aggravating circumstance 
</b></p>
<p><b>attracting heavier sanctions.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates that States have the obligation to prosecute 
</b></p>
<p><b>the perpetrators of crimes with racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or homophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>motivations and to fight against impunity. States should ensure prompt, thorough and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartial investigation into those crimes, and that those responsible are adequately 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanctioned.  </b></p>


<p>47. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to ensure that victims of crimes motivated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by racism or xenophobia have full access to effective legal remedies, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to seek reparation for damages suffered as a result of such crimes. He also 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that States ensure that victims of racist or xenophobic crimes are 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided with the necessary legal, medical and psychological assistance and are made 
</b></p>
<p><b>aware of their rights and of existing judicial and non-judicial remedies. States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>further engage with vulnerable groups or minorities who are at particular risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>racist or xenophobic crimes, with the aim of restoring confidence in law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials and the criminal justice system and to facilitate better reporting of such 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates efforts made to document racially 
</b></p>
<p><b>motivated crimes, and reiterates recommendations made in previous reports to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council and the General Assembly that States should collect 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated data and statistics on racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes in order to identify the types of offences committed, the characteristics of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims and of the perpetrators and whether they are affiliated with an extremist 
</b></p>
<p><b>political party, movement or group. Such disaggregated data would provide a better 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding of the phenomenon and identify effective measures to be taken to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address those crimes. States should provide adequate financial, human and technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources to improve the quality of data collection systems where those already exist, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while ensuring that civil society is involved in the process, which is to be undertaken in 
</b></p>
<p><b>such a way as to guarantee the protection of privacy.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Education and capacity-building</b>5<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that education remains the most effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>means of countering the negative influence that extremist political parties, movements 
</b></p>
<p><b>and groups may have on young people. Recalling paragraph 136 of the Durban 
</b></p>
<p><b>Programme of Action, he urges States to ensure that education and training, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially teacher training, promote respect for human rights and the fight against 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational institutions implement policies and programmes on equal opportunities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>anti-racism, gender equality and cultural, religious and other diversity, with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of teachers, parents and students.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>In particular, the Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 57 (a) of his 2013 
</b></p>
<p><b>thematic report (A/HRC/23/56), in which he recommended that States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognize the important role of education in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance, especially in promoting the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerance and respect to ethnic, religious and cultural diversity and preventing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>proliferation of extremist racist and xenophobic movements and propaganda, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially among the youth.  
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>He also recalls paragraph 57 (e) from the above-mentioned thematic report 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/HRC/23/56), in which he recommended that States should recognize the important 
</b></p>
<p><b>role of formal and non-formal education in the deconstruction of prejudices, positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>change of negative perceptions, enhanced understanding and social cohesion. To that 
</b></p>
<p><b>end, States should be encouraged to implement educational activities and measures, 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See also the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/23/56). </p>


<p><b>including human rights training at various levels, to prevent and combat effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the capacity of law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials and members of the judiciary be strengthened further to address crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>motivated by racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or homophobic biases. Comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>and mandatory human rights training, including training with a specific focus on 
</b></p>
<p><b>racist and xenophobic crimes perpetrated by individuals linked to extremist political 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties, groups and movements, should be provided to public officials, including law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement agents, who should also be provided with the necessary guidelines and 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures to be able to identify, investigate and register such crimes. He emphasizes 
</b></p>
<p><b>that States should also ensure that law enforcement agents engage with vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups who are particularly at risk of racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or homophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes, in order to reduce their legitimate fears and concerns, restore confidence in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the application of the rule of law, and that they report such crimes adequately.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates the organization of awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities such as cultural events, festivals, conferences, seminars, competitions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>exhibitions, research work and publications, as well as information campaigns and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other events aimed at providing a space for intercultural dialogue and interaction, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which contribute to the building of a society based on pluralism, tolerance, respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural diversity, multiculturalism and non-discrimination and which should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>further encouraged.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Internet and social media 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the increased use of the Internet 
</b></p>
<p><b>and social media by extremist political parties, movements and groups to promote and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminate racist content. States should take all opportunities, including those 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by the Internet, to counter the dissemination of ideas based on racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>superiority or hatred, and promote the values of equality, non-discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity and democracy, while respecting their obligations under articles 19 and 20 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In order to ensure full 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect for human rights and democratic principles, States, while adopting measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>to counter extremist ideas and biases, should strengthen freedom of expression, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>plays a crucial role in promoting democracy and combating racist and xenophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>ideologies based on racial superiority. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Sport 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on States to strengthen measures to prevent racist 
</b></p>
<p><b>and xenophobic incidents at sporting events. He notes the key role of sport in 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting cultural diversity, tolerance and harmony and recommends that States 
</b></p>
<p><b>take advantage of such events to promote the values of tolerance and respect. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>recalls paragraph 218 of the Durban Programme of Action, which urges States, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation with intergovernmental organizations, the International Olympic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee and international and regional sports federations, to intensify the fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against racism in sport by educating the youth of the world through sport practised 
</b></p>
<p><b>without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires human 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding, tolerance, fair play and solidarity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Holocaust denial 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Special Rapporteur condemns any denial or attempt to deny the Holocaust 
</b></p>
<p><b>and all manifestations of religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief. He also calls </b></p>


<p><b>for the active preservation of the sites which served as Nazi death camps, 
</b></p>
<p><b>concentration and forced labour camps and prisons, and encourages States to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative and educational measures to put an end to Holocaust denial.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of cooperating closely with civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society and international and regional human rights mechanisms to effectively counter 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and similar extremist ideological movements. In particular, the role played by 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society in collecting information, working closely with victims and promoting 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic principles and human rights should be emphasized. He calls upon national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institutions to develop appropriate programmes to promote tolerance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>and respect for all and to collect relevant information. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Efforts made by States to counter extremist political parties, movements and 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, including neo-Nazis, skinhead groups and similar extremist ideological 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements should be enhanced through the replication of good practices. In that 
</b></p>
<p><b>connection, it is important that the sharing of good practices continue among all 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of cooperating 
</b></p>
<p><b>closely with civil society and international and regional human rights mechanisms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively counter extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-
</b></p>
<p><b>Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological movements. As stated in 
</b></p>
<p><b>paragraph 49 of the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, a broad 
</b></p>
<p><b>sharing of best practices in all regions of the world aimed at preventing, combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>and eradicating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance can 
</b></p>
<p><b>assist Governments, parliaments, the judiciary and civil society with the effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Action, and the Rabat Plan of Action. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges all States to submit information regarding 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures undertaken within their respective territories in relation to the provisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>set out in General Assembly resolution 69/160 on combating glorification of Nazism,
