<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Jamaica was held at the 15th meeting, on 13 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Jamaica was headed by Mark Golding. At its 17th meeting, held on 15 May 
</p>
<p>2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Jamaica. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Jamaica: Algeria, Estonia and Japan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Jamaica: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/JAM/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/JAM/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/JAM/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, 
</p>
<p>Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland, and the United States of America was transmitted to Jamaica through the troika. 
</p>
<p>These questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The representative of the State under review stated that, as a newly independent 
</p>
<p>country, Jamaica had initiated and advocated for the International Year for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>as part of a focused attempt to define an international human rights landscape with agreed 
</p>
<p>principles, guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and rights for all peoples. The Constitution 
</p>
<p>guaranteed the protection of the human rights of all Jamaicans regardless of colour, class or 
</p>
<p>creed. Since 2011, these rights had been further expanded through the Charter of 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. It also highlighted that the Charter applied vertically to 
</p>
<p>the State and also horizontally among persons, therefore inculcating respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights at all levels of society by holding all persons, including the State, accountable. 
</p>
<p>6. Jamaica had embarked on a path of national transformation through the national 
</p>
<p>development plan for 2009&#8211;2030, Vision 2030 Jamaica, which revolved around four 
</p>
<p>national goals: Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest potential; Jamaican society 
</p>
<p>is secure, cohesive and just; the economy is prosperous; and the country has a healthy 
</p>
<p>natural environment. 
</p>
<p>7. Efforts were ongoing to address the impact on the country&#8217;s economy of the 2008 
</p>
<p>global economic recession. The most central adjustment, aimed at reducing the overall debt 
</p>
<p>burden, was the maintenance of a large primary surplus (7.5 per cent of the gross domestic 
</p>
<p>product) for at least four years, an adjustment that limited the availability of resources for a 
</p>
<p>range of policies and programmes in the social sector. </p>


<p>8. The Government&#8217;s economic reform programme had yielded positive results, 
</p>
<p>including unemployment reduction, economic growth, reduced inflation, a narrowing of the 
</p>
<p>current-account deficit and increased local and foreign investments.  
</p>
<p>9. The needs of the vulnerable remained a top priority for the Government, which is 
</p>
<p>why the first comprehensive social protection strategy of Jamaica had been developed in 
</p>
<p>2013 and, in March 2014, the Cabinet had approved a social protection strategy. The 
</p>
<p>Government was currently developing a new national poverty policy and programme and a 
</p>
<p>poverty reduction coordination unit had been established in the Planning Institute of 
</p>
<p>Jamaica to oversee this process. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government understood that seeking to reduce crime and violence and improve 
</p>
<p>social harmony were not incompatible with a sustained commitment to human rights but 
</p>
<p>rather complementary. The Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms afforded 
</p>
<p>protection to the rights and freedoms of persons to the extent that those rights and freedoms 
</p>
<p>did not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others. The Government thus remained 
</p>
<p>determined to reduce crime and violence, including through an increased emphasis on 
</p>
<p>social interventions, community programmes and more effective policing. The Jamaica 
</p>
<p>Constabulary Force had acquired new equipment and technology, established additional 
</p>
<p>posts and increased recruitment, and Jamaica had registered a marked downward trend in 
</p>
<p>serious crimes over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding recommendations made during the first universal periodic review of 
</p>
<p>Jamaica, the Cabinet had approved the establishment of an inter-agency steering committee 
</p>
<p>on the review, which had been given the following tasks: to review the recommendations 
</p>
<p>that Jamaica had accepted during the 2010 review; to develop an action plan, including 
</p>
<p>strategies and timelines, to advance the implementation of those recommendations; to 
</p>
<p>support efforts aimed at raising awareness about the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights; and, where necessary, to recommend possible changes to existing pieces of 
</p>
<p>legislation.  
</p>
<p>12. Since its review, Jamaica had ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and 
</p>
<p>would consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities. In addition, Parliament had passed a comprehensive Disabilities Act in 
</p>
<p>October 2014.   
</p>
<p>13. Jamaica had submitted reports to the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.   
</p>
<p>14. Jamaica was still putting in place the relevant domestic legislation that could give 
</p>
<p>effect to the implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
</p>
<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; acts of torture had never been condoned nor 
</p>
<p>accepted as a practice in Jamaica. Significant progress was being made in addressing many 
</p>
<p>of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment in his report on his visit to Jamaica in 2012, including 
</p>
<p>concerning conditions in detention facilities.  
</p>
<p>15. Jamaica was at an advanced stage in the drafting of the legislation to bring its 
</p>
<p>domestic law into compliance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>The Cabinet had already approved ratification of the Rome Statute once the required 
</p>
<p>domestic legislation was in place. 
</p>
<p>16. At the primary and secondary levels, human rights education was included in the 
</p>
<p>national curricula and in all levels of teacher training. The Jamaica Constabulary Force had </p>


<p>included fundamental human rights in its basic police training and had a highly qualified 
</p>
<p>team of trainers.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government was actively pursuing the establishment of a national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution and Jamaica already had an effective, extensive network of institutions mandated 
</p>
<p>to protect the rights of Jamaicans. The plan was to establish a national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution by expanding the role and functions of existing entities.  
</p>
<p>18. Jamaica regarded special procedures rapporteurs as constructive players in the 
</p>
<p>international human rights framework. It was not opposed to accommodating visits of 
</p>
<p>special rapporteurs, which were considered on a case-by-case basis. It added that adequate 
</p>
<p>notice should be given to the Government to ensure that the necessary arrangements were 
</p>
<p>in place for a successful visit, in accordance with mutually agreed dates. Jamaica 
</p>
<p>recommended to the Human Rights Council that a mechanism should be put in place that 
</p>
<p>allowed for information to be shared among these various human rights bodies and 
</p>
<p>procedures, as there were often overlapping requests that were not only inefficient but also 
</p>
<p>unduly stretched the country&#8217;s limited resources. 
</p>
<p>19. Justice reform was a priority for the Government. The justice reform implementation 
</p>
<p>unit, established in 2012, coordinated, monitored and supported the timely delivery of all 
</p>
<p>justice-sector reform initiatives, driving the implementation of the justice reform agenda. 
</p>
<p>Several projects, programmes and legislation had been developed over the past three years 
</p>
<p>in support of a more efficient criminal justice system, including the Evidence (Amendment) 
</p>
<p>Act, aimed at reducing sources of lengthy delay and unnecessary costs in the court process; 
</p>
<p>the Administrator General (Amendment) Act, which would facilitate the speedier 
</p>
<p>processing of intestate estates and substantially reduce burden of cases; the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Records (Rehabilitation of Offenders) (Amendment) Act 2014, which reduced the period 
</p>
<p>required before persons convicted of less serious offences could have their convictions 
</p>
<p>removed from the criminal records; the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015, which 
</p>
<p>removed the powers of arrest and detention in relation to the possession of small quantities 
</p>
<p>or smoking of ganja, and possession of same would no longer be prosecuted in the courts. 
</p>
<p>The Act also recognized the indigenous Rastafari community, and protected their 
</p>
<p>constitutional right to freedom of religious expression by including special measures 
</p>
<p>relating to the cultivation and use of the ganja plant for sacramental purposes. Flogging and 
</p>
<p>whipping, forms of inhumane judicial punishment dating from the era of slavery and 
</p>
<p>colonialism, had been legislatively abolished in 2012. 
</p>
<p>20. A national restorative justice programme was being established to ensure increased 
</p>
<p>access to justice for citizens. The programme also encouraged increased public confidence 
</p>
<p>and trust in the justice system by fostering greater participation in and ownership of 
</p>
<p>restorative justice processes by communities and victims. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding crime, justice and police reform, the delegation reported that a series of 
</p>
<p>measures had been taken to enhance operational and administrative efficiency and reduce 
</p>
<p>serious crime, including the successful merger of the Island Special Constabulary Force 
</p>
<p>into the Jamaica Constabulary Force, and an increase in police recruitment, which had 
</p>
<p>contributed to the ongoing improvement of crime statistics, with a 17 per cent decline in 
</p>
<p>serious and violent crimes in 2014 over 2013. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation reported the passing of important legislation relating to law 
</p>
<p>enforcement, including the Law Reform (Fraudulent Transactions) (Special Provisions) Act 
</p>
<p>and the Criminal Justice (Suppression of Criminal Organisations) Act, and legislation that 
</p>
<p>would establish a national DNA database. 
</p>
<p>23. A data system to facilitate the operation of the sex offenders registry had been 
</p>
<p>completed in 2014. Under the Sexual Offences Act, persons convicted of certain offences, 
</p>
<p>including rape, abduction and the sale of or trafficking in persons, are included in the sex </p>


<p>offenders registry. The Department of Correctional Services would monitor registered sex 
</p>
<p>offenders for the period stipulated by law after their release from custody. 
</p>
<p>24. On the 2010 operation in Tivoli, following an investigation by the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Public Defender, a report had been submitted in April 2013, recommending, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Commission of Enquiry into the activities. The terms of reference for 
</p>
<p>the Commission had been finalized after a process of public consultation and that the 
</p>
<p>Commission had been working since December 2014. 
</p>
<p>25. Although there was a de facto moratorium on the application of the death penalty,  
</p>
<p>no decision had been taken to abolish it from the law books. Individual petitioners retained 
</p>
<p>the right to petition the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>26. The Government was strongly opposed to killings resulting from the excessive use 
</p>
<p>of force by State agents and the Jamaica Constabulary Force had put in place a policy 
</p>
<p>aimed at the protection of human rights, in particular the right to life, by enforcing 
</p>
<p>regulations on the use of force, including firearms, in conformity with national and 
</p>
<p>international laws. The policy had been supported by the establishment of the independent 
</p>
<p>commission of investigations in 2010 as an institution dedicated to ensuring that allegations 
</p>
<p>of the excessive use of force are investigated in a prompt, independent and effective 
</p>
<p>manner. The delegation also said that the Government had increased the commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>financial, technical and human resources.  
</p>
<p>27. As a result of these measures, Jamaica had recorded a reduction of over 50 per cent 
</p>
<p>in security-force-related fatalities in 2014 compared with 2013 and that the trend had 
</p>
<p>continued in 2015. The Government also continued to act to ensure that police officers 
</p>
<p>implicated in cases of excessive use of force and who had fled the country were extradited, 
</p>
<p>where possible, to answer charges.  
</p>
<p>28. The protection of the vulnerable in society, particularly children, the elderly, women 
</p>
<p>and the disabled, remained of paramount importance to Jamaica. For the protection of 
</p>
<p>children, a national plan of action for an integrated response to Children and Violence was 
</p>
<p>being developed. The Government had in 2004 established a comprehensive network of 
</p>
<p>institutions mandated to protect the rights of children and ensure their well-being. The 
</p>
<p>Ananda alert system, established in March 2013 through the Office of the Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Registry, was a nationwide system used for the safe and speedy recovery of missing 
</p>
<p>children, and had recorded some success since its inception.   
</p>
<p>29. Jamaica was firmly committed to improving conditions in the operation of lock-ups 
</p>
<p>and correctional facilities in order to meet international human rights standards. However, 
</p>
<p>several obstacles needed to be overcome, in particular the long-outdated physical 
</p>
<p>infrastructure of the lock-ups and prisons. Notwithstanding these challenges, meaningful 
</p>
<p>improvements had been made in the past two years, including a reduction in the number of 
</p>
<p>juveniles in correctional or remand facilities and a 25 per cent decrease in 2014 in the 
</p>
<p>number of persons in police custody. 
</p>
<p>30. A national policy for gender equality had been put in place in 2011. According to a 
</p>
<p>study conducted in 108 countries by the International Labour Organization, Jamaica ranked 
</p>
<p>highest in the world in the percentage of women managers, at 59.3 per cent.  
</p>
<p>31. Gender-based violence remained a challenge that required a multi-faceted approach. 
</p>
<p>A national strategic plan of action to eliminate gender-based violence was being finalized 
</p>
<p>as part of a strengthened effort to address gender-based violence in all its forms.  
</p>
<p>32. The national task force against trafficking in persons was raising awareness among 
</p>
<p>the public of the problem of trafficking and in 2013 the Trafficking in Persons Act had been 
</p>
<p>amended, widening the offence of human trafficking to include debt bondage and offences 
</p>
<p>similar to trafficking and establishing a mandatory order for restitution for victims of </p>


<p>trafficking. Eight trafficking in persons cases were currently before the court. The 
</p>
<p>delegation considered that, owing to the clandestine nature of the crime, it was increasingly 
</p>
<p>difficult to secure convictions as victims and witnesses were often reluctant to testify. 
</p>
<p>33. The Constitution of Jamaica and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms 
</p>
<p>Act (2011) guaranteed certain State protection to persons with disabilities. The Disabilities 
</p>
<p>Act 2014 sought to promote, protect and facilitate the full and equal enjoyment of all 
</p>
<p>fundamental rights and freedoms for persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>34. The 2009 policy on refugees, which was guided by the 1951 Convention Relating to 
</p>
<p>the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, had 
</p>
<p>established the procedures for managing the refugee-status determination process.  
</p>
<p>35. A national policy and plan of action on international migration and development had 
</p>
<p>been adopted. The Constitution guaranteed basic human rights to all Jamaicans and 
</p>
<p>prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex or gender. In order to create greater 
</p>
<p>understanding of the concerns of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, 
</p>
<p>several initiatives had been put in place. The Jamaica Constabulary Force had already 
</p>
<p>established a clear policy of engagement with the that community, including human rights 
</p>
<p>training and awareness-raising. Its diversity policy included objectives such as fostering 
</p>
<p>public confidence by demonstrating fairness, integrity, tolerance and understanding, 
</p>
<p>providing the necessary support to victims and eliminating fear of reporting crime and 
</p>
<p>violence. 
</p>
<p>36. The delegation highlighted that the Jamaican Government remained committed to 
</p>
<p>implementing the recommendations arising from the universal periodic review and would 
</p>
<p>endeavour to uphold its demonstrated tradition of respect for the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>37. As a small island developing State that was highly indebted, Jamaica had capacity 
</p>
<p>constraints and was vulnerable to external shocks that posed very real constraints on its 
</p>
<p>ability to implement the full range of measures that would enable all citizens to enjoy their 
</p>
<p>civil, political, social and cultural rights. The representative of Jamaica expressed gratitude 
</p>
<p>to the many bilateral partners that had offered technical and other assistance to ensure the 
</p>
<p>development of national capacities to meet the State&#8217;s obligations to the people of Jamaica. 
</p>
<p>In conclusion, he said that Jamaica hoped to continue to have meaningful partnerships, at 
</p>
<p>home and abroad, striving to strengthen the human rights and dignity of the Jamaican 
</p>
<p>people. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the interactive dialogue, 64 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>39. Sweden asserted that, according to reports, hostility and violence perpetrated against 
</p>
<p>Jamaicans who are either lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is widespread, and that 
</p>
<p>despite the fact that more of these persons were reporting acts of violence and 
</p>
<p>discrimination to the police, many incidents remained unreported. 
</p>
<p>40. Thailand encouraged Jamaica to work towards a permanent coordination structure to 
</p>
<p>monitor and report on human rights obligations. It raised concerns about reports of 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force by law enforcement personnel, and hence welcomed the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the independent commission of investigations.  
</p>
<p>41. Timor-Leste welcomed the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and 
</p>
<p>Freedoms, the Sexual Offences Act and the Child Pornography Prevention Act. It remained 
</p>
<p>concerned by the prevalence of trafficking in persons despite the existence of a national 
</p>
<p>plan of action. </p>


<p>42. Togo praised the progress in gender equality, with the appointment of a woman as 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister and with 21 per cent of Parliament being women. It commended Jamaica on 
</p>
<p>the protection of persons with disabilities through the 2014 Law and the Vision 2030 
</p>
<p>Jamaica national development plan. 
</p>
<p>43. Trinidad and Tobago also applauded the Vision 2030 Jamaica national development 
</p>
<p>plan, which integrated a wide spectrum of socioeconomic human rights objectives. It 
</p>
<p>commended Jamaica on its national energy policy and its target to achieve 30 per cent of 
</p>
<p>renewable energy by 2030. 
</p>
<p>44. Turkey enquired about the social-development strategy drawn up in 2013. It echoed 
</p>
<p>the concerns of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the 
</p>
<p>high incidence of domestic violence. It encouraged the finalization and implementation of 
</p>
<p>the national strategic plan of action to eliminate gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>45. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland urged the Government 
</p>
<p>to implement fully comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation. It welcomed the steps 
</p>
<p>taken to identify and prosecute members of the security forces involved in acts of 
</p>
<p>corruption or violence against civilians.  
</p>
<p>46. France deplored the persistence of discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual and transgender persons. It raised concerns over police violence and the conditions 
</p>
<p>in detention. To improve the situation, it encouraged Jamaica to implement effectively the 
</p>
<p>control procedures based on national laws.  
</p>
<p>47. Uruguay highlighted the emphasis on early education and the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;tablets in schools&#8221; pilot programme. It congratulated Jamaica on the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography and the ongoing consideration of the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>48. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that notwithstanding the challenges of 
</p>
<p>climate change, Jamaica had demonstrated its commitment to implementing the 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first cycle. It welcomed the implementation of the national 
</p>
<p>development plan and the gender equality policy, as well as efforts for the protection of the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>49. Algeria welcomed the progress made by Jamaica since the first review, including the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
</p>
<p>sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. It commended the country on the 
</p>
<p>measures taken to provide better protection to women, on the efforts to strengthen gender 
</p>
<p>equality and on the national development plan. 
</p>
<p>50. Angola commended Jamaica on the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography and the submission of the fourth periodic report under the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It encouraged Jamaica to continue its cooperation 
</p>
<p>with the special procedures mandate holders. It remained concerned over conditions at 
</p>
<p>correctional facilities. 
</p>
<p>51. Argentina thanked the delegation for the presentation of the national report. It 
</p>
<p>congratulated Jamaica on the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</p>
<p>following the first review.  
</p>
<p>52. Australia remained concerned at the high levels of physical and sexual violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls, that a formal moratorium on the death penalty had not been </p>


<p>adopted and at the high numbers of police killings. It welcomed the willingness of Jamaica 
</p>
<p>to engage actively in the universal periodic review process.  
</p>
<p>53. Barbados noted progress on enhancing gender equality and on the empowerment of 
</p>
<p>women and girls. It urged Jamaica to prioritize finalizing and implementing the national 
</p>
<p>strategic plan of action to eliminate gender-based violence. It viewed as positive the efforts 
</p>
<p>to enhance the security of citizens.  
</p>
<p>54. Botswana commended Jamaica on the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography, as recommended in the first review cycle. It encouraged Jamaica to finalize 
</p>
<p>and fully implement the national strategic plan of action to eliminate gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>and step up its efforts to combat trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>55. Mexico noted the progress made since the last review. It commended Jamaica on the 
</p>
<p>changes in the legal framework, in particular the adoption of initiatives to eliminate gender 
</p>

<p><b>measures that can give effect to the implementation of the Optional Protocol. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>Concerning recommendation 121.20 put forward by Germany, Jamaica

<p><b>considers that there is no basis for stating that human rights defenders are at risk in

<p><b>they are active, openly engaged in advocacy, and have contributed positively to the

</b></p>
<p>130. <b>Concerning recommendation 121.55 put forward by the United States of 
</b></p>
<p><b>America, Jamaica accepts this recommendation in principle, but its interpretation of </b></p>
