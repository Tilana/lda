<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/12, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to present an annual report to the Council containing 
information on relevant developments in the work of United Nations human rights bodies 
and mechanisms, as well as on the activities undertaken by her Office at Headquarters and 
in the field, that contribute to the promotion of and respect for the provisions of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p>2. The Declaration, adopted by consensus in 1992, provides global standards on 
minority rights and the obligations of States to protect and promote such rights. In addition 
to being an important component of human rights, minority rights are key factors in 
peacebuilding, the prevention of conflict, and development. In the context of the twentieth 
anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursued several activities to bring awareness to 
the Declaration and encourage its implementation, consistent with the OHCHR 
Management Plan for the biennium 2012-2013. 
</p>
<p>3. Through subregional events and other initiatives, OHCHR encouraged stronger 
interest in minority rights. The activities focused on most topical minority rights issues, 
ranging from the protection of religious minorities to constitution-making. The activities 
offered an important opportunity to examine and gather approaches that work in the field of 
minority rights protection so that they can be replicated, and also to examine remaining 
challenges in order to tackle them at national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights at Headquarters and in the field 
</b></p>
<p>4. In various public statements and keynote addresses during the year, the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concerns about the situation of minorities, 
ranging from the treatment of Roma in Europe to the rights of religious minorities in 
different regions. For example, in her opening statement at the twentieth session of the 
Human Rights Council, in June, the High Commissioner highlighted the twentieth 
anniversary of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities, stressing that advancing minority rights 
and combatting discrimination must engage the entire United Nations system. In her 
opening statement at the twenty-first session of the Council, in September, the High 
Commissioner raised concerns about, inter alia, the targeting of religious minorities, 
stressing that discriminatory laws and practices needed to be rooted out and that it was 
important not to be selective in addressing that issue. 
</p>
<p>5. In her keynote address at a workshop on civil society and education in human rights 
as tools for promoting religious tolerance, held in New York on 27 September, the High 
Commissioner stated that while increased emphasis on the importance of advancing 
religious tolerance and protecting religious minorities had been noted, the situation on the 
ground remained, regrettably, as worrisome as ever. She stressed that there was much work 
to be done to ensure respect for freedom of religion or belief and protection of the rights of 
religious minorities, and that strong commitment from everyone at the international, 
regional and national levels was necessary. On 20 June, at the World Congress on Justice, 
Governance and Law for Environmental Sustainability, organized by the United Nations 
Environmental Programme, the High Commissioner stressed that the rights of minorities, </p>


<p>indigenous peoples, women, small farmers, those living in poverty and vulnerable groups 
should all be respected in participatory processes. 
</p>
<p>6. On 27 July, the High Commissioner raised serious concerns about ongoing human 
rights violations in the State of Rakhine, Myanmar, following the violence that erupted 
between Buddhist and Muslim communities. She urged a prompt and independent 
investigation to bring light to the situation. 
</p>
<p>7. She also raised a range of minority issues during her country visits. For example, on 
7 June, during her mission to Pakistan, the High Commissioner expressed hope that the 
country would reform and update its school curricula and materials to better promote 
tolerance and human rights, especially with regard to religious and other minorities. On 10 
July, during her mission to Kyrgyzstan she stated that discrimination, especially on ethnic, 
religious and gender grounds, remained a deeply problematic issue, with ethnic and 
national minorities significantly underrepresented in the executive Government and 
bureaucracy, law enforcement bodies and judiciary. On 13 November, during her mission 
to Indonesia, the High Commissioner expressed distress at reports of violent attacks, forced 
displacement, denial of identification cards and other forms of discrimination and 
harassment against religious minorities from the Ahmadiyya, Christian, Shia and traditional 
belief communities. She also expressed concern about police failing to provide adequate 
protection in those cases. She recommended that Indonesia amend or repeal the 1965 
Blasphemy Law, the 1969 and 2006 ministerial decrees on building houses of worship and 
religious harmony, and the 2008 Joint Ministerial Decree on Ahmadiyya. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Twentieth anniversary commemorative activities 
</b></p>
<p>8. The 1992 Declaration on Minorities remains the most important United Nations 
instrument devoted to minority rights, providing authoritative guidance and key standards, 
ranging from non-discrimination to participation in decision-making, yet it is not 
sufficiently invoked in efforts to protect minority rights. The twentieth anniversary 
provided an opportunity to address this gap and be a catalyst for greater attention to the 
Declaration and its implementation and stronger engagement on minority rights more 
generally. 
</p>
<p>9. The momentum created by the anniversary and related OHCHR activities, organized 
in cooperation with a range of United Nations partners, Governments, representatives of 
minorities, and non-governmental organizations, resulted in enhanced engagement with the 
Declaration. OHCHR reported on the outcome of the anniversary activities at the fifth 
session of the Forum on Minority Issues (27-28 November 2012), devoted to the 
anniversary. 
</p>
<p>10. OHCHR, in collaboration with the Department of Public Information, has developed 
a communication strategy for the commemoration of the anniversary. Its implementation 
has included the creation of a distinctive visual identity for the commemoration; a special 
section on the OHCHR website dedicated to the anniversary 
(www.ohchr.org/minorityrights2012); branded promotional materials in all six official 
languages (banners, posters, folders); a dozen web feature stories on minority issues, 
published throughout the year; press statements of the High Commissioner that focus 
primarily on discrimination against minorities; a video interview with the Independent 
Expert on minority issues, Rita Izs&#225;k, focusing on the anniversary; and a compilation of all 
the recommendations made by the Forum on Minority Issues, published in English, French 
and Spanish and branded with the anniversary logo. </p>


<p><b> 1. Human Rights Council panel discussion to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Human Rights Council decided, in its resolution 18/3, to convene, at its 
nineteenth session, a panel discussion to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities, with a particular focus on its implementation as well as on 
achievements, best practices and challenges in this regard, and requested OHCHR to 
prepare a report on the outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary (see 
A/HRC/20/6 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>12. Consistent with the resolution, the panel discussion was held on 13 March. The 
participants included experts as well as representatives of States and civil society, who 
agreed that the Declaration remained a key reference document and that its implementation 
was vital in order to counter the problems that continued to undermine human rights and 
often posed a threat to peace and security. The panel discussion also reflected the fact that 
further efforts were needed to improve implementation in all countries and regions. 
Challenges to implementation were identified and possible solutions shared. The discussion 
revealed that a number of States had adopted new measures to combat exclusion of 
minorities and promote their identities, the full enforcement of which was instrumental in 
tackling contemporary problems obstructing the protection of the rights of minorities. 
</p>
<p>13. The panel discussion demonstrated that respect for the principles of the Declaration 
remained crucial in transition processes. The core principles of equality and non-
discrimination were underscored as prerequisites in securing minority rights. The panel also 
reiterated that access to quality education played a vital role in combatting discrimination 
and in building the capacity of minorities to participate in the political, social and economic 
life of the countries in which they lived. The panel discussion offered an important 
opportunity to collect good practices on various issues that could be replicated to strengthen 
the implementation of the Declaration in all regions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Expert seminar on enhancing the effectiveness of international, regional and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights mechanisms in protecting and promoting the rights of religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities 
</b></p>
<p>14. Held in Vienna on 22 and 23 May and organized by OHCHR in cooperation with 
the Government of Austria, the expert seminar brought together renowned experts on 
minority rights and freedom of religion or belief, including the Independent Expert on 
minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Heiner 
Bielefeldt, as well as representatives of Governments, key European organizations and 
mechanisms dealing with religious minorities, national human rights institutions and civil 
society. The 67 participants, including representatives of 16 Governments, explored how 
minority rights could be used more effectively to ensure protection of religious minorities. 
In addition to reviewing recent developments in the work of relevant human rights 
mechanisms, the participants made suggestions aimed at enhancing collaboration between 
these mechanisms at the international, regional and national levels on specific issues and 
integrating protection of religious minorities more effectively into the work of such 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>15. The expert seminar offered a unique opportunity to examine closely and 
substantively the interconnections between minority rights (art. 27 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration) and the specific human right to 
freedom of religion or belief (art. 18, para. 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights) with regard to persons belonging to religious minorities. Interconnections 
between minority rights and other human rights standards were discussed, in addition to </p>


<p>those that exist between United Nations international and regional mechanisms. In both 
respects, good practices were shared and the potential for increased cooperation to 
strengthen protection was explored. 
</p>
<p>16. While there was a general sentiment that religious minorities deserve increased 
attention by human rights mechanisms, participants shared a range of examples from 
United Nations and regional mechanisms of important case law, recommendations and 
other work that has addressed this issue. They considered that while the discussions were 
beneficial to the participants, a more systematic approach would be advantageous, and they 
encouraged knowledge-management initiatives to facilitate the sharing of information and 
insights. The participants agreed that more action was required to encourage increased 
implementation of the Declaration, including by harnessing the momentum offered by the 
twentieth anniversary. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Regional consultation on the role of the United Nations and other human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development actors in advancing the participation of minorities in poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p><b>and development strategies in South-East Asia 
</b></p>
<p>17. Held in Bangkok on 25 and 26 September, the consultation brought together 
representatives of various United Nations entities, including the OHCHR Regional Office 
for South-East Asia, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 
the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality 
and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women). Among the participants were 
representatives from national human rights institutions and non-governmental 
organizations, including the Asian Human Rights Commission, Minority Rights Group 
International, the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand and the Asia Pacific 
Refugee Rights Network. 
</p>
<p>18. Participants examined some of the reasons why in many cases Millennium 
Development Goals were not being reached. They found, inter alia, that persistent 
inequalities across the board and obstacles to meaningful participation stood as primary 
obstacles, often involving development policies and programmes that were disempowering. 
</p>
<p>19. Participants also examined how systematic discrimination of persons belonging to 
minorities and other marginalized groups in access to ownership and control of land could 
result in their exclusion from decision-making at all levels in development issues, which in 
turn could fuel land grabbing, and how that problem affected minority women in particular. 
Participants explored possible solutions, including various mechanisms to enhance minority 
participation in decision-making and programmes that improved institutional capacity and 
facilitated access to legal identity and ownership documents. 
</p>
<p>20. Participants recalled that promoting human rights was one of the pillars of a 
governance strategy to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals were met and that 
human rights mechanisms, such as the Independent Expert on minority issues and the 
Forum on Minority Issues, could contribute to ensuring that the Goals were pursued with 
due regard to the specific challenges faced by minorities. The consultation highlighted that 
the Goals were to be pursued in an equitable and sustainable manner benefiting minority 
communities, which could involve conducting studies devoted to interrelations between 
work to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and work to address concerns of 
minorities. </p>


<p><b> 4. Regional expert workshop, </b>&#8220;Effective participation of persons belonging to minorities 
</p>
<p><b>in law enforcement: b</b>uilding an inclusive and responsive police force and judiciary&#8221;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>21. Held in Bishkek on 18 and 19 October, this regional workshop brought together over 
70 participants. They included representatives from nine countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and 
Ukraine), international and regional organizations (Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, UN-
Women, United Nations Regional Centre for Preventative Diplomacy for Central Asia, 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UNDP), national human rights institutions, 
and non-governmental organizations, as well as international experts in the fields of 
minority rights and policing. The sessions addressed, inter alia, human rights issues in 
connection with unlawful discriminatory practices in law enforcement, the need to build 
trust in law enforcement institutions, and engagement with minority communities.  
</p>
<p>22. The OHCHR Regional Office for Central Asia presented the Study on minority 
inclusion in law enforcement in Kyrgyzstan, and participants shared lessons learned. The 
participants recognized the necessity to provide continuous training for police officials at 
all levels across ranks. Other issues stressed included: (a) the need for reform in law 
enforcement to be part of a wider structural reform process; (b) reforms regarding access to 
information in minority languages; (c) the advantages of quota systems and temporary 
special measures to facilitate recruitment of minorities; and (d) the need for disaggregated 
data. 
</p>
<p>23. The participants explored a wide range of minority rights issues relating to the role 
of the judiciary and in strengthening access to justice. The discussions focused on 
promoting and protecting the rights of minorities through participation and representation in 
the judiciary. The importance of guaranteeing independent oversight and accountability 
regarding the work of the police was stressed. The invaluable role of national human rights 
institutions and civil society was also highlighted in guaranteeing minority rights. 
</p>
<p>24. Furthermore, time was allotted to representatives of States and national human rights 
institutions to present their work on minority issues in connection with law enforcement 
and the judiciary. These presentations facilitated an open and constructive dialogue with 
respect to the situation on the ground at the national level. While States primarily presented 
their achievements, civil society representatives questioned some of the accomplishments 
claimed. 
</p>
<p>25. The participants acknowledged the importance attached to deploying efforts to 
further advance minority rights with a view to building a responsive and inclusive police 
force and judiciary in their respective countries. Therefore, they agreed to a list of 
recommendations that could serve as guidelines in the work they undertook at the national 
level. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. </b>Consultation: &#8220;Reflecting diversity in the process of constitutional reforms in the 
</p>
<p><b>Middle East and North Africa</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. By canvassing the current situation as regards constitutional changes in the Middle 
East and North Africa, the consultation offered an opportunity to examine current shifts in 
constitutional reforms and constitution-making. Held on 19 and 20 November in Doha, the 
consultation brought together experts in the fields of human rights and constitutional law 
from the region to brainstorm on the rapid constitutional changes and notably their impact 
on human rights and minorities. The experts examined legal developments and explored the 
different ways in which diversity, including the principles of the 1992 Declaration on 
Minorities, had been reflected in constitution-making in the region.  <b> </b></p>


<p>27. They also explored how the United Nations could support constitution-making 
rooted in human rights, including efforts to promote inclusivity and meaningful 
participation. Participants also made suggestions aimed at enhancing collaboration among 
human rights mechanisms at the international, regional and national levels, with a view to 
encouraging systematic integration of the protection of minorities in constitutions, 
legislations and policies. While the focus of the consultation was on constitutional reforms, 
the participants also examined practical issues from a regional perspective, by discussing 
both positive examples and challenges to be tackled. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>28. In commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the 1992 Declaration on Minority 
Rights, the fifth session of the Forum on Minority Issues focused on the theme 
&#8220;Implementing the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities: identifying positive practices and opportunities&#8221;. Held 
on 27 and 28 November, this session of the Forum offered an opportunity to examine the 
diverse ways in which the Declaration has been used and implemented in practice. 
Benefiting from the perspectives offered by different stakeholders, the Forum was a venue 
for discussion of the impact of the Declaration on national legislation, institutional 
mechanisms and activities to advance the rights of persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>29. The fifth session of the Forum was framed around core questions on the Declaration, 
including the following: &#8220;How has the Declaration been useful in your work and efforts 
</p>
<p>towards protecting and promoting the rights of minorities?&#8221; and &#8220;How can awareness and 
implementation of the Declaration be improved?&#8221; Contributions of participants relating to 
the Declaration and how it has been and continues to be used provided additional insights 
on how to translate its provisions into concrete action. These practical suggestions 
contributed to the set of recommendations of the Forum, which will be submitted to the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>30. Consistent with past practice, on the day preceding the session of the Forum (26 
November 2012), OHCHR held a dialogue with minority representatives and other 
stakeholders. Participants discussed their engagement in the implementation of the 
Declaration and shared their visions on how best to do so, including through more 
coordinated collaboration. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Minorities fellowship programme 
</b></p>
<p>31. The annual minorities fellowship programme for persons belonging to national, 
ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities took place from 29 October to 30 November. The 
programme comprised two linguistic components (Arabic and English); participants came 
from Algeria, Cameroon, Colombia, India, Jordan, Kenya, the Republic of Moldova, the 
Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen. The fellowship enables individuals from minority 
groups to gain knowledge of the United Nations system and mechanisms dealing with 
international human rights in general and minority rights in particular. It is aimed at 
strengthening advocacy skills and assisting the fellows in improving their work, at the 
national level and in their communities back home, to enhance protection of minority 
rights. Throughout the five-week programme, the fellows attend briefings on a wide variety 
of human rights topics and undertake individual and group assignments. 
</p>
<p>32. In 2012, the programme offered the opportunity for the fellows to contribute to the 
twentieth anniversary commemorations by participating in the fifth session of the Forum on 
Minority Issues. The fellows collaborated in teams to deliver an intervention on what the </p>


<p>Declaration means to them and their communities, and on whether the Declaration is still 
relevant and meaningful to their context. They also raised creative ideas to help promote 
awareness of the Declaration and support its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Regional and country engagement activities 
</b></p>
<p>33.<b> </b>Throughout 2012, the OHCHR Regional Office for Europe continued engaging on 
the rights of Roma and Travellers in Europe. In January, the Regional Office hosted a two-
day meeting in Brussels of the Roma Civil Society Group on the Right to Health, as part of 
a broader inter-agency initiative on Roma women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s health led by the World 
Health Organization. In June, the Regional Office held a colloquium in Rome on a human 
rights-based approach to Roma inclusion and Roma active citizenship, with representatives 
from States, European Union institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>34. Through continuous engagement with national and local authorities in several 
countries as well as with civil society partners, the Regional Office consistently argued for 
the right to culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers, and for respect for United 
Nations guidelines on forced evictions, the rights of the child and inclusive, non-
segregating solutions for Roma. 
</p>
<p>35. The Regional Office for the Pacific supported the Government of Fiji by hosting 
stakeholder consultations on the State report to be submitted under the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The consultation 
brought together Government entities responsible for the drafting of the report and civil 
society organizations working on issues relating to racial discrimination and national, 
religious and linguistic minorities in Fiji. Similarly, the Regional Office is engaging with 
the Government of Fiji to follow up recommendations from the universal periodic review, 
including those relating to minorities. 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR-Colombia has been supporting a project aimed at collecting, in a 
transparent and inclusive manner, the visions, positions and recommendations of 
Colombian ethnic groups with regard to their right to consultation. Using a methodology 
validated with Colombian ethnic representatives and based on discussions involving more 
than 3,300 persons from, inter alia, indigenous, Raizal, Palenquero, Roma and Afro-
descendant communities, OHCHR contributed to strengthening the individual ethnic 
organizations and helping rights holders claim their rights. As a direct consequence of the 
project, a number of ethnic communities initiated a process of internal reflection and 
discussion that led to the adoption of regional guidelines and protocols on ways they are to 
be consulted by external actors. OHCHR is using the recommendations resulting from the 
participatory process in political dialogue with relevant institutions in the current debate on 
a possible legal framework to be adopted on the right to consult. 
</p>
<p>37. The Human Rights Advisor in the Republic of Moldova worked extensively with 
Government and civil society representatives to support the adoption in May 2012 of the 
State&#8217;s first comprehensive anti-discrimination law (Act on Ensuring Equality). Following 
the mission by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, OHCHR worked 
with UNDP to provide key civil society actors with grant support to monitor freedom of 
religion or belief in the Republic of Moldova. Other OHCHR activities in the Republic of 
Moldova included: providing support in the creation of a network of Roma community 
mediators; supporting the national human rights institution to help build strategic 
discrimination cases, following a March 2011 recommendation by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination urging that the national human rights institution use 
its legal powers to advocate in courts on behalf of victims of discrimination 
(CERD/C/MDA/CO/8-9, para. 12); and supporting a joint study (UN-
Women/UNDP/OHCHR) on the situation of Roma women in the Republic of Moldova. </p>


<p>38. In May, the OHCHR presence in the South Caucasus held a workshop in the 
Samtskhe-Javakheti region of Georgia largely populated by the ethnic Armenian minority. 
The workshop was organized in close cooperation with the regional office of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman of Georgia. Training on human rights was delivered to 20 
representatives of various non-governmental organizations, media and human rights 
defenders. The information and materials enabled the local civil society actors to deepen 
their understanding of various human rights issues, including the rights of linguistic, 
national and other minorities. 
</p>
<p>39. OHCHR also contributed to the work of regional organizations in the field of 
minority rights. For example, it participated in the development of the thematic 
commentary on the language rights of persons belonging to national minorities under the 
Framework Convention, adopted by the Council of Europe&#8217;s Advisory Committee on the 
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in May 2012, and the 
Ljubljana Guidelines on Integration of Diverse Societies, launched by the OSCE High 
Commissioner on National Minorities in November 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> III. United Nations network on racial discrimination and the 
protection of minorities 
</b></p>
<p>40. In accordance with article 9 of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities, the specialized 
agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system should contribute to the full 
realization of the rights set forth in the Declaration. This is part of the background against 
which, in March 2012, the Secretary-General established the United Nations network on 
racial discrimination and the protection of minorities, to be coordinated by OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>41. The network is to enhance dialogue and cooperation between relevant United 
Nations departments, agencies, programmes and funds. It is facilitated by focal points for 
racial discrimination and minority rights, appointed by relevant entities of the United 
Nations system.  
</p>
<p>42. The network tasks include developing guidance for the United Nations system on 
how to address racial discrimination and protection of minorities in line with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other key standards, drawing from effective practices. It 
is also reviewing the content of relevant United Nations training initiatives with a view to 
ensuring that they adequately cover issues concerning racial discrimination and national or 
ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities. 
</p>
<p>43. The network held its first meetings (by videoconference) in April 2012 and 
November 2012. The second meeting was preceded by a consultation, organized by 
OHCHR, with minority organizations and others on the advancement of work to combat 
racial discrimination and to protect minorities in the United Nations system, and was 
followed by the fifth session of the Forum on Minority Issues, which was devoted to the 
anniversary of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Treaty bodies  
</b></p>
<p>44. Human rights treaty bodies have addressed minority issues throughout the reporting 
period, as illustrated in the below non-exhaustive examples. </p>


<p><b>  Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) 104th session (12 </i>&#8211;<i> 30 March 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>45. In its consideration of the report of Cape Verde, the Human Rights Committee 
recommended that the State party collect data disaggregated by ethnicity on the existence 
and size of minorities, and that it investigate the root cause of the murders of West African 
immigrants and ensure prosecution, sanctions and compensation in such cases 
(CCPR/C/CPV/CO/1, para. 18). In its concluding observations for Turkmenistan, the 
Committee encouraged the State party to promote the participation of minority groups in 
public life and decision-making bodies and to collect data, disaggregated by ethnicity, on 
their representation in this regard (CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para. 22). 
</p>
<p>46. The Committee recommended that Yemen ensure that all ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities enjoy effective protection from discrimination and are able to enjoy 
their own culture and equal access to education, health and public services; victims of 
discrimination were also to be provided with effective remedies, including compensation 
(CCPR/C/YEM/CO/5, para. 12). 
</p>
<p><i> (b) 105th session (8 </i>&#8211;<i> 27 July 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>47. Minority issues were raised in the concluding observations regarding Armenia, in 
which the Human Rights Committee recommended that the State party combat violence 
and incitement to racial and religious hatred, provide proper protection to minorities and 
ensure adequate investigation and prosecution of such cases. It should also strengthen its 
efforts to ensure the effective implementation of the laws adopted to combat racial 
discrimination (CCPR/C/ARM/CO/2, para. 6). Regarding the report submitted by 
Lithuania, the Committee encouraged the State to strengthen its efforts to combat crimes 
committed with racial, discriminatory or xenophobic motives and sensitize the public to and 
reduce the prevalence of hatred and intolerance in the media, including the Internet, through 
awareness-raising campaigns and training programmes, especially targeting law 
enforcement agencies (CCPR/C/LTU/CO/3, para. 15). 
</p>
<p>48. With regard to Kenya, the Human Rights Committee recommended that the State 
respect the rights of minority and indigenous groups to their ancestral land and traditional 
livelihood when planning development and natural resource conservation projects. In 
particular, the State should ensure that the inventory being undertaken to assess the status 
and land rights of the Ogiek people is participatory and that decisions are based on free and 
informed consent of the community (CCPR/C/KEN/CO/3, para. 24). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Forty-eighth session (30 April </i>&#8211;<i> 18 May 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>49. Concerning the report submitted by Slovakia, the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights recommended that the Government take steps, such as the imposition 
of penalties, to ensure implementation of the law governing minority languages, under 
which all citizens belonging to minority groups were allowed to use minority languages in 
their dealings with public administration (E/C.12/SVK/CO/2, para. 27). Regarding the 
report from Ethiopia, the Committee encouraged the State party to further strengthen 
necessary measures to ensure equal treatment for all ethnic groups, with a view to 
guaranteeing their right to a cultural identity, and to implement the relevant 
recommendations by the Independent Expert on minority issues (E/C.12/ETH/CO/1-3, 
para. 27).  </p>


<p>50. Regarding the report of Peru, the Committee expressed concern about the high 
illiteracy rate among Afro-Peruvian communities and urged the Government to address the 
matter (E/C.12/PER/CO/2-4, para. 26). It also encouraged the State to adopt temporary 
special measures in line with the principle of non-discrimination to promote the realization 
of economic, social and cultural rights for Afro-descendants (ibid., para. 28). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Eighty-first session (6 </i>&#8211;<i> 31 August 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>51. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged Austria to collect 
comprehensive statistical data on the ethnic composition of its population and to take 
measures to prohibit incitement to racial hatred, for example through collaboration with 
sporting associations (CERD/C/AUT/CO/18-20, paras. 4 and 11). The State should also 
cease arrests, stops, searches and investigations based on racial profiling and prevent racist 
advertisements relating to housing and employment opportunities (ibid., para. 15). 
</p>
<p>52. The Committee urged Ecuador to consider special measures to ensure that Afro-
Ecuadorians enjoy the rights outlined in the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, especially regarding their access to public positions 
(CERD/C/ECU/CO/20-22, para. 12). It also recommended that the State engage in 
educating and training reporters and others working in the media to combat racial 
prejudices that led to discrimination against Afro-descendants in Ecuador (ibid., para. 16). 
In its report on Fiji, the Committee recommended that the State party consider special 
measures to improve the level of participation of persons belonging to minority groups in 
public administration and politics and to promote minority culture and languages, including 
the interpretation into minority languages of court proceedings to guarantee the right to a 
fair trial (CERD/C/FJI/CO/18-20, paras. 10, 12 and 13). 
</p>
<p>53. The Committee urged Tajikistan to collect disaggregated data, in particular with 
respect to minorities, on relevant socioeconomic indicators to ensure the enjoyment of 
rights under the Convention, and to continue its efforts in increasing the participation of 
ethnic minority groups, including women, in public and political life by improving 
representation within Parliament and other public institutions (CERD/C/TJK/CO/6-8, paras. 
8 and 12). With respect to the report submitted by Thailand, the Committee advised that the 
State party ensure that members of ethnic groups could avail themselves of legal remedies, 
and that it collect data on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by ethnic 
groups (CERD/C/THA/CO/1-3, paras. 12 and 17). The State party should also strengthen 
efforts to protect and conserve ethnic languages by teaching them in schools, as well as 
raise awareness among media professionals of their responsibility not to disseminate 
stereotypes and prejudices of ethnic groups (ibid., para. 19). With regard to the report 
provided by Finland, the Committee highlighted the need for the State to collect data 
disaggregated by ethnicity, including data on minority groups and immigrants, in order to 
enable the Committee to evaluate the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights of such groups (CERD/C/FIN/CO/20-22, para. 7). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Fifty-second session (9 </i>&#8211;<i> 27 July 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>54. Regarding the report of Bulgaria, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women recommended that the State tackle the root causes of and 
decrease the school dropout rates among Roma girls and reintegrate such girls into the 
educational system. The Government should furthermore collect data disaggregated by sex 
on the situation of disadvantaged groups of women, such as ethnic minorities, with a view </p>


<p>to accelerating the realization of substantive equality. To combat trafficking, the State was 
urged to increase efforts to improve the economic situation of women and girls, in 
particular Roma women, to eliminate their vulnerability to exploitation 
(CEDAW/C/BGR/CO/4-7). 
</p>
<p>55. In its concluding observations on Indonesia, the Committee expressed the need for 
the State to use all available means to eliminate discrimination and violence, including 
sexual violence and intimidation, against women belonging to religious minorities, such as 
Ahmaddiyah, Christians, Buddhists and Baha&#8217;is, and to ensure their security and enhance 
their enjoyment of human rights (CEDAW/C/IDN/CO/6-7). With regard to the reports 
submitted by New Zealand, the Committee encouraged the State party to address the 
deteriorating mental health situation of young girls, to prevent and combat the abuse of 
alcohol and use of drugs, and to prevent girls&#8217; suicide, especially among girls from migrant 
and minority communities (CEDAW/C/NZL/CO/7). 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Committee against Torture 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Forty-eighth session (7 May </i>&#8211;<i> 1 June 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>56. In its concluding observations on the report of Greece, the Committee against 
Torture encouraged the Government to take effective measures to prevent discrimination 
against and ensure protection of all minorities, recognized or not (CAT/C/GRC/CO/5-6, 
para. 12). The State party should also engage with the Albanian authorities regarding the 
missing Albanian Roma street children, in order to create an effective mechanism for the 
investigation of the cases (ibid., para. 27). Correspondingly, in reviewing the report of 
Albania, the Committee urged the State party to immediately engage with the Greek 
authorities in order to promptly create an effective mechanism to investigate the cases and 
establish the whereabouts of 502 missing Albanian Roma street children 
(CAT/C/ALB/CO/2, para. 24).<b> </b></p>
<p>57. The Committee recommended that the Czech Republic protect its Roma citizens and 
their property through enhanced monitoring and preventative measures, and investigate and 
prosecute all acts of anti-Roma violence and discrimination (CAT/C/CZE/CO/4-5, para. 11 
(a)). The Anti-discrimination Act and all written materials relating to sterilization of women 
should be translated into the Roma language, and Roma children should be admitted to 
mainstream education (ibid., paras. 11 (b) and 12). 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Sixtieth session (29 May </i>&#8211;<i> 15 June 2012) 
</i></p>
<p>58. Regarding the report of Algeria, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
recommended that the State ensure full respect for the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion of the child, and take all necessary measures to end all forms of 
violence and harassment of religious minorities (CRC/C/DZA/CO/3-4, para. 42). In its 
concluding observations on the report of Cyprus, the Committee urged the Government to 
collect data disaggregated by ethnicity, allocate resources to ensure that Turkish Cypriot 
children were provided with the option of receiving bilingual education, and ensure that 
religious education was optional (CRC/C/CYP/CO/3-4, paras. 18 and 45). 
</p>
<p>59. In its consideration of the report of Greece, the Committee encouraged the State to 
develop and implement, in collaboration with the Roma community, policies and programmes 
aimed at ensuring equal access to essential services, especially health and education 
(CRC/C/GRC/CO/2-3, para. 72). Greece should also ensure that children from the Muslim 
community of Thrace, children of Turkish origin and children from groups identifying 
themselves as belonging to the Macedonian minority should have equal access to health and </p>


<p>social services and quality education (ibid., para. 27). With regard to Turkey, the Committee 
encouraged the State to withdraw its reservations so as to provide better protection and 
opportunities to all groups of children, especially those of Kurdish origin, who are not 
recognized as a minority under the Constitution (CRC/C/TUR/CO/2-3, para. 9). 
</p>
<p>60. Viet Nam was urged by the Committee to distribute the Convention to minority 
populations, including their children, in their own languages and to eliminate all efforts to 
assimilate ethnic minority populations with the Kinh majority (CRC/C/VNM/CO/3-4, 
paras. 22 and 40). The Committee considered Nepal under the Optional Protocol on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and recommended that data 
disaggregated by ethnicity be collected (CRC/C/OPSC/NPL/CO/1, para. 8). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Independent Expert on minority issues presented her first report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/19/56) during its nineteenth session. The Council held a general 
debate with the Independent Expert on the role of human rights bodies and mechanisms. In 
this connection, the Independent Expert participated in the Council panel discussion held in 
March to commemorate the anniversary of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities, where she 
stated that she was particularly concerned about the situation of religious minorities in all 
regions, and that she would therefore address the rights and security of religious minorities 
as a thematic priority in 2012-2014.  
</p>
<p>62. On 22 February, the Independent Expert encouraged the Government of Latvia to 
ensure its protection of the rights of the Russian speaking minority and engage in a process 
of meaningful dialogue, following a referendum on 18 February that had rejected a 
proposal to recognize Russian as a second official State language. On 2 March, she joined 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, in urging the Government 
of Pakistan to respond decisively to end sectarian violence and improve the security of 
religious minorities. On 20 March, the Independent Expert and the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
Mutuma Ruteere, called for an intensified struggle against racism. She joined the statement 
published on the occasion of International Roma Day (8 April) by a group of seven United 
Nations human rights experts, stressing that &#8220;it is hard for Roma to shake off those negative 
labels and for wider society to see beyond them&#8221; as she called on States to intensify their 
efforts and &#8220;identify, share and put into practice what is known to be working for the 
</p>
<p>inclusion and integration of Roma communities&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>63. On 2 August, the Independent Expert and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance called on all 
countries (particularly those with Roma communities) to mark Roma Holocaust 
Remembrance Day with a &#8220;commitment to confronting modern-day hatred, violence and 
discrimination against Roma and finding real solutions to their persistent exclusion&#8221;. On 9 
November the Independent Expert participated in the Fifth Budapest Human Rights Forum 
in Budapest, and joined a panel to discuss minority issues on the occasion of the 
commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities. The 
Independent Expert presented her report to the General Assembly (A/67/293) at its sixty-
seventh session, on 2 November. The report was the first under the General Assembly 
requirement, contained in Assembly resolution 66/166 (para. 21), that the mandate holder 
submit to it reports on an annual basis. In the report, the Independent Expert focused on the 
role institutional attention could play in advancing minority issues within governmental 
organs, national human rights institutions and other relevant national bodies.   </p>


<p>64. The Independent Expert conducted her first country visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina 
from 17 to 25 September to examine the situation of national minorities, including Roma 
and those &#8220;constituent peoples&#8221; (Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs) who, following the 
conflicts between 1992 and 1995, found themselves to be de facto minorities in the regions 
and localities in which they live. On 31 October, she joined with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom&#225;s Ojea Quintana, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, to express 
deep concern over continuing inter-communal violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar, that 
had led to loss of life, destruction of homes and mass displacement, and called on the 
Government to urgently address the underlying causes of the tension and conflict between 
the Buddhists and Muslim communities in the region.  
</p>
<p>65. After her mission to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (30 January &#8211; 12 
February), the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Raquel 
Rolnik, stated that &#8220;the Israeli authorities have had an impressive record of providing 
</p>
<p>adequate housing for waves of Jewish immigrants and refugees, but today these policies 
have failed to respond to the needs of minorities and the socially disadvantaged&#8221;. 
Palestinian minorities living inside Israel and Palestinians living under military occupation 
were affected by ongoing threats against their right to housing.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, in his report to the Human 
Rights Council, expressed concern about members of minority groups who were subjected 
to pressure by State and non-State actors to convert or reconvert to mainstream religions or 
beliefs (A/67/303, para. 47). The concept of an official &#8220;State religion&#8221; has adverse effects 
on religious minorities, as missionary activities on behalf of the mainstream religion are 
encouraged while others are prohibited or restricted, thus violating the principle of non-
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally 
sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, Calin Georgescu, 
warned on March 30 that the communities affected by nuclear testing over 60 years ago in 
the Marshall Islands had &#8220;yet to find durable solutions to the dislocation to their indigenous 
ways of life&#8221;. Mr. Georgescu, who visited the country between 26 and 30 March, urged the 
country&#8217;s Government, as well as the United States of America and the international 
community, to find effective redress for the affected people from Bikini, Enewetak, 
Rongelap and Utrik.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, conducted her 
first mission to the Russian Federation from 15 to 26 April. The recognition by the Russian 
Federation of its multi-ethnic and multi-confessional character is reflected in important 
constitutional provisions, including in the area of education and language. However, the 
Special Rapporteur was concerned at the uneven application of those provisions and that 
many minorities lacked support from the federal and regional authorities in that regard. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, warned that &#8220;food 
systems of emerging countries are at a major crossroads. Millions of people have been 
lifted out of poverty, yet whole communities have been left behind&#8221;. His statement was 
made after he presented his reports on China, Mexico and South Africa 
(A/HRC/19/59/Add.1, Add.2 and Add.3, respectively) to the Human Rights Council at its 
nineteenth session.  
</p>
<p>70. On 13 April, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, hailed 
the decision by the Indian Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional validity of the 
provisions in the 2009 Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act. The Act 
mandates that 25 per cent of places in private and public schools be reserved for socially </p>


<p>and economically disadvantaged groups. Mr. Singh said that the judgment should inspire 
other countries. 
</p>
<p>71. In a statement to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar said the recent wave of reforms had 
already had a positive impact on the country and its people, but warned there were ongoing 
and serious human rights concerns that remained to be addressed, and that could not be 
ignored in the rush to reform and to move forward. Positive developments should not be 
based on the mere discretion of the authorities, but rather on a democratic institutional 
approach that allowed transparency, predictability and continuity in reforms. In August, 
welcoming the ceasefire agreements reached with 10 ethnic armed groups, and the ongoing 
dialogue in that regard, the Special Rapporteur said that efforts to find durable political 
solutions should address long-standing grievances and deep-rooted concerns among ethnic 
groups.  
</p>
<p>72. In May, the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia, 
Shamsul Bari, urged the Somali authorities and the international community to re-establish 
a legitimate justice system in Mogadishu and South Central Somalia. According to 
Mr. Bari, the harmonization of customary law and sharia law with modern law and 
international human rights law presented another major challenge for the administration of 
justice in Somalia. He stressed that &#8220;women, internally displaced persons and minorities 
suffer particularly from the lack of access to justice and due process&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>73. Also in May, the Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and in 
Practice urged the Government of Moldova to implement coherently the country&#8217;s non-
discrimination legislation. The Working Group also noted a major void in the national 
human rights mechanisms to address violations of women&#8217;s rights, and stressed that women 
who faced multiple forms of discrimination, such as members of religious minority groups 
or Roma women, required an effective mechanism to monitor their situation.  
</p>
<p>74. In June, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, Juan M&#233;ndez, condemned the execution of four 
members of the Ahwazi Arab minority in Ahwaz&#8217;s Karoun Prison in the Islamic Republic 
</p>
<p>of Iran. Following a reportedly unfair trial, they were sentenced to death and executed on or 
around 19 June 2012. The four men were reportedly arrested in April 2011 during a protest 
in Khuzestan and convicted of <i>Moharebeh</i> (enmity against God) and <i>Fasad-fil Arz</i> 
(corruption on earth).  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights and the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief strongly condemned grave violations of cultural rights and the 
right to freedom of religion and belief in northern Mali, in particular the destruction of sites 
of religious significance, including mausoleums in the World Heritage site of Timbuktu.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>76. At its nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first sessions, the Human Rights Council 
adopted the reports of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review on various 
countries.  
</p>
<p>77. In the adopted reports, issues regarding minority groups were raised, and 
recommendations included, inter alia, strengthened disaggregated data collection to better 
understand hate crimes towards minorities; increased enforcement of anti-discrimination 
and hate crime laws with a view to effectively prosecuting the incitement of hatred, </p>


<p>especially against religious minorities; establishing public outreach programmes and 
awareness campaigns to discourage ethnic discrimination; intensifying efforts to eliminate 
discrimination against the most vulnerable groups, such as minority women, and ensure 
their equal access to education, health, housing and employment; and guaranteeing freedom 
of religion or belief, freedom of expression and the integration of minorities into society 
through national plans of action. States were also encouraged to train Government and 
professional staff to decrease discrimination and social exclusion; provide textbooks in 
minority languages; put into place monitoring mechanisms to ensure that intended 
objectives for the promotion and protection of the welfare and rights of minorities are 
achieved; and, finally, to adopt favourable policies aimed at securing the full enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights for minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Linguistic Minorities provided a significant opportunity to bring awareness to the 
</b></p>
<p>Declaration&#8217;s<b> importance while assessing challenges and obstacles to its 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation. Implementing the Declaration not only serves to protect the physical 
</b></p>
<p><b>existence and identity of minorities but, as the preamble to the Declaration states, also 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributes to the political and social stability of the States in which minorities live.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Minority issues are complex, and they need to be addressed through 
contextualized measures. Practices that work for the protection of minorities at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national level tend to also involve legislative and policy measures that take into 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration the circumstances on the ground and encourage inter-ethnic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intercultural interaction and dialogue while protecting distinct identities. As such, 
</b></p>
<p><b>creating the conditions for the effective participation of minorities and protecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>their rights should be considered by States to be an integral aspect of good 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance, beneficial to minorities and majorities alike.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Combating discrimination and protecting minority rights are at the core of 
much of the work of the United Nations, including the Office of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>High Commissioner for Human Rights. All three pillars of the United Nations</b>&#8212;
</p>
<p><b>security, development and human rights</b>&#8212;<b>are affected by discrimination and minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights violations, and efforts to combat them require system-wide engagement and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation. It is against this background that the United Nations network on racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination and the protection of minorities is engaged in enhancing dialogue and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation among relevant United Nations departments, agencies, programmes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>funds by providing a regular channel for exchanges between United Nations actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and for building expertise and guidance on key thematic issues of common concern. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, civil society and non-governmental organizations as well as representatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>of minorities have a vital role to play in promoting the 1992 Declaration on Minorities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In this regard, they should participate effectively in the development, implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and evaluation of national policies and strategies on minority rights protection.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Overall, efforts to improve protection and prevent tension must involve society 
at large, majorities and minorities, and the dominant and non-dominant sectors of 
</b></p>
<p><b>society, while ensuring the participation of minority women. It is vital that future 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities place even more focus on the actual implementation of the Declaration along 
</b></p>
<p><b>with other international human rights standards, to address the complex problems 
</b></p>
<p><b>faced by minority communities on the ground.   
</b></p>
