Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the time frame for 
such accession, and ratification of the Statute is the exclusive right of 
the State and will be taken in light of the national interest. When 
considering the possibility of ratification, Turkmenistan will take into

International Criminal Court and the outcome of work to define the 
crime of aggression. 
</p>
<p>113.14 
113.15 
</p>
<p>Turkmenistan accepts the recommendations. Ratification of the

</p>
<p>Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation. It is continuing to study 
the experience and practice of other countries in the establishment 
and operation of independent human rights institutions that comply 
with the Paris Principles, including from the viewpoint of improving 
existing human rights institutions where possible.

113.47 
</p>
<p>Turkmenistan accepts the recommendations. The possibility of 
inviting the special procedures of the Human Rights Council to 
Turkmenistan is currently under consideration. 
</p>
<p>113.48 Turkmenistan does not accept the recommendation by Hungary to 
invite experts from the International Labour Organization to 
overcome existing challenges in the implementation of laws to 
protect children from the harmful effects of all forms of child labour, 
since the laws and regulations concerning child labour that it has 
introduced are in line with the standards of international law. It is, 
however, prepared to consider forms of international cooperation in 
this field. 
</p>
<p>113.49 
113.50 
113.51 
113.52 
113.53 
113.54 
</p>
<p>Turkmenistan accepts the recommendations. The equal right of men 
and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights provided 
for in the international conventions and agreements ratified by 
Turkmenistan is guaranteed. The Family Code, adopted on 10 
January 2012, guarantees men and women equal rights in family 
relations. No direct or indirect restriction of rights related to race, 
ethnic group, religion or other circumstances is permitted in marriage 
or in family relations. On 14 December 2007, the Mejlis (parliament) 
adopted the State Guarantees of Women&#8217;s Equality Act. The Act is 
intended to implement the main principles of the country&#8217;s human 
rights policy, guarantee comprehensive development and progress for 
women and establish State guarantees of women&#8217;s enjoyment, on an 
equal basis with men, of human rights and freedoms in political, 
economic, social, cultural and other fields. On 14 December 2007, the 
Trafficking in Persons Act was adopted to provide State guarantees </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/3/Add.1

<p><b>4</b> GE.13-16794 
</p>
<p><i>Recommendation Position of Turkmenistan 
</i>for personal freedoms and to protect society from trafficking in 
persons, including trafficking in women. Efforts will continue to 
adopt new laws on gender equality, women&#8217;s participation in society 
and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>113.55 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation and notes that any kind of 
direct or indirect restriction on the rights or any privileged treatment 
of a citizen in relation to his/her religious or atheistic persuasion, any 
incitement to hostility or hatred or any insult to a citizen in that 
connection constitute grounds for bringing charges in accordance 
with the law. 
</p>
<p>113.56 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation and notes that national 
legislation does not permit any advantages to be conferred or 
restrictions imposed on one religion or faith compared to others. 
</p>
<p>113.57 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation in part, since the 
Constitution provides that religious organizations are separate from 
the State and may not intervene in the affairs of the State or perform 
State functions. 
</p>
<p>113.58 A response regarding the elimination of torture and accession to the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture can be found in 
113.1, 113.3 and 113.5&#8211;6.

113.5&#8211;6. 
Information on the second part of the recommendation can be found 
in 113.61. 
</p>
<p>113.61 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation. Police stations, holding 
cells and penal correction facilities are systematically being provided 
with technical equipment to allow audio and video recordings to be 
made of questioning. To prevent violence and cruel treatment in 
places of detention, a fully-fledged, functioning system of penal 
institution monitoring and inspections &#8212; performed by an 
independent body &#8212; is essential. Notably, on 31 March 2010, a 
governmental act was adopted providing for the establishment of 
oversight commissions attached to the Cabinet of Ministers and 
authorities in the provinces, Ashgabat, districts and towns with 
district status. The commissions monitor the activities of the agencies 
that apply penal enforcement legislation, and also work with 
convicted offenders and suspects following their release from places 
of detention. On the basis of, and in accordance with, the relevant 
legislation, voluntary associations may independently monitor the 
activities of institutions and bodies that enforce sentences.

</i>review, in the section headed Recommendations which Turkmenistan 
will examine, part 4, under article 23 of the Constitution, no one may 
be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>113.70 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation. All communications and 
complaints by citizens and other persons concerning human rights 
violations are examined, in the legally established manner, by the 
competent authorities. No complaints were registered during the 
reporting period of torture or cruel treatment of detainees, including 
human rights defenders and independent journalists, committed by 
staff of the internal affairs agencies, either at the time of arrest or 
during placement in pretrial detention, for the purposes of obtaining 
evidence from them. 
</p>
<p>113.71 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation. In Turkmenistan, 
convicted persons serve their sentence in a place of detention only on 
the basis of a court decision. Under article 18 of the Constitution, no 
one may deprive an individual of any rights or freedoms, or restrict 
his or her rights or freedoms, other than in accordance with the 
Constitution and the law. Article 3 of the Criminal Code, adopted on 
14 May 2010, states that no one may be found guilty of having 
committed a crime and be subjected to criminal punishment, except 
on the decision of the court and in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p>113.72 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation and notes that Turkmen 
legislation provides for the exercise of the rights of convicted persons 
serving long-term prison sentences to communicate with their lawyer 
and relatives and to have access to medical care. 
</p>
<p>113.73 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation, since it has already been 
implemented. Under article 30 of the Constitution, citizens are 
entitled to set up political parties and other voluntary associations that 
function within the framework of the Constitution and the law. There 
is no law in Turkmenistan that restricts the activities of religious 
organizations or allows the criminalization of religious activities 
solely on the basis of a lack of legal registration. 
</p>
<p>113.74 
113.75 
</p>
<p>Turkmenistan accepts the recommendations; the matters raised 
therein are currently being examined. 
</p>
<p>113.76 
113.77 
113.79 
</p>
<p>Turkmenistan accepts the recommendations. Under article 30 of the 
Constitution, citizens are entitled to found political parties and other 
public associations that function within the framework of the 
Constitution and the law. Such associations are an essential part of 
civil society and the conditions necessary to their development are 
being established. The Voluntary Associations Act, adopted on 21 
October 2003 in accordance with the Constitution, is aimed at 
implementing the citizens&#8217; right to form voluntary associations and 
determines the legal and organizational framework for the creation, 
activity, reorganization and dissolution of voluntary associations, as 
well as regulating social relations in that field. There are no laws in 
Turkmenistan that restrict the activities of voluntary associations. The 
issues raised in the recommendations are currently being considered 
in the context of the ongoing reform of national legislation. 
</p>
<p>113.78 Turkmenistan accepts the recommendation. Under article 28 of the 
Constitution, Turkmen citizens enjoy the right to freedom of faith and </p>

the universally recognized standards of international law. The Act

constitutional right to form political parties and the details of
