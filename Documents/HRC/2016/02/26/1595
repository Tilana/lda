The right to education of persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness 
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to 
be guaranteed the full enjoyment of their rights and freedoms without discrimination, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the rights of 
persons with disabilities, the most recent of which was resolution 22/3 of 21 March 2013, 
and welcoming the efforts of all stakeholders to implement those resolutions,  </p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, inter alia, 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International 
Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and, most 
recently with regard to persons with disabilities, in the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, and other relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular </i>that article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities reaffirms the right of persons with disabilities to education, and provides 
that, with a view to realizing this right without discrimination and on the basis of equal 
opportunity, States parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and 
lifelong learning, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>relevant guidelines of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization, such as the Guidelines for Inclusion: Ensuring Access to Education 
for All of 2005, 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that progress has been made, yet deeply concerned that many persons 
with disabilities in all regions continue to face significant obstacles in exercising their right 
to education without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>at the violence, stigmatization and discrimination faced by 
persons with disabilities, which leads to their exclusion and hinders and often prevents their 
access to education, </p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned also </i>that girls and women of all ages with disabilities are subject 
to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, including in the context of 
realizing their right to education without discrimination and on the basis of equal 
opportunity, </p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the equal realization of the right to education of persons with 
disabilities is fundamental for their social and economic inclusion and full participation in 
society, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that inclusive education benefits all children and society by 
celebrating diversity, promoting equality and participation for all and countering exclusion, 
stigmatization and discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the need to build awareness among all persons, including persons with 
disabilities, their families, teachers, social workers, students, communities and all those 
involved in education systems, of the right of persons with disabilities to education without 
discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>at the lack of data, research and statistics on the education of persons 
with disabilities, including women and indigenous persons, and its negative impact on 
effective and equitable policymaking, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the high-level meeting of the General Assembly held on 23 September 
2013 on disability and development and its outcome document,1 in which the Assembly 
stressed the importance of ensuring accessibility for and inclusion of persons with 
disabilities in all aspects of development, and encouraged the international community to 
seize every opportunity to include disability as a cross-cutting issue in the global 
development agenda, to give due consideration to all persons with disabilities in the 
emerging post-2015 development agenda of the United Nations, with a view to enhancing 
cooperation, and to provide relevant technical assistance to Member States upon their 
request, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the commitment in the above-mentioned outcome document to 
recognize, inter alia, the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-
discrimination by ensuring that all children have equal opportunity for access to an 
inclusive education system of good quality, and notes the recognition in the outcome 
document that promoting access to inclusive education systems supports equal access to 
full and productive employment and decent work on the same terms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the need to strengthen further the process of developing inclusive 
education systems, including by giving due consideration to inclusive education in the 
process of the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the importance of consulting closely with and actively involving 
persons with disabilities and their representative organizations in the process of the 
elaboration of the emerging post-2015 development agenda of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>
