<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102.  It 
covers the period January-December 2006.   
</p>
<p>Section I of the report outlines the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities, including participation 
at different conferences, the issuing of press releases and the sending of individual complaints to 
Governments on cases of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, during the 
reporting period.   
</p>
<p>Section II is devoted to a thematic study on forced marriages in the context of trafficking 
in persons.  In this section, the Special Rapporteur defines what amounts to a forced marriage 
and lists different forms of existing forced marriages as reported to her in the different replies to 
a questionnaire on forced marriages that the Special Rapporteur sent to Governments, 
international organizations and non-governmental organizations.   
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur examines forced marriage as an act or an element of trafficking 
in persons, in accordance with article 3 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and describes some of the consequences.   
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur further addresses the element of demand as a means to 
effectively combat trafficking in persons generally and, with reference to certain situations 
concerning marriage-brokering agencies, in the context of forced marriages specifically.  Finally, 
section III contains the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations to States and 
non-State actors on ways to prevent trafficking in persons through or for the purpose of forced 
marriages, discourage the demand for such marriages, protect and assist the victims concerned, 
and establish legal and prosecutorial measures to combat forced marriages in the context of 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children. </p>

</p>
<p>8. On 22 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur attended an international conference 
organized by the City Council of Madrid on &#8220;Human Rights and Prostitution&#8221;, where she 
delivered an opening speech highlighting the main observations and conclusions of her report to 
the Human Rights Council.  She also underscored that prostitution is a profitable form of

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representatives of NGOs.  The Special Rapporteur attended the 
Inter-parliamentary Conference on Human Rights and Religious Freedom in Rome from 27 to 
29 November 2006 organized by the Institute of Religion and Public Policy, where she gave a 
presentation emphasizing the importance of such dialogues in better understanding religion in 
the perspective of human rights and participated as a panellist. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Communications to Governments and other actors 
</b></p>
<p>9. Since the presentation of her last report on communications (E/CN.4/2006/62/Add.<footnote name="1">2. On Human Rights Day, 10 December 2006, all special procedures mandate holders, 
including the Special Rapporteur, issued a joint press release on poverty and human rights 
stressing their deep concern that millions of people are still systematically deprived of 
fundamental human rights simply because they are poor.   </footnote>) the 
Special Rapporteur has sent 29 communications to Governments and, at the time this report was 
finalized, had received 13 replies.  The report on communications sent during the period under 
review is in addendum 1.   
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also sent a letter to the Secretariat of the South Asian Association 
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in connection with a ministerial meeting that was held on 
11 May 2006 in Dhaka to discuss issues of trafficking.  The Special Rapporteur recalled that any 
action aimed at combating trafficking in persons should be based on human rights principles and 
requested that the SAARC Secretariat share with member States the Recommended Principles 
and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.<footnote name="1">1. On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, 
on 25 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur issued a public statement which highlighted 
various forms of violence against women, including trafficking in human beings, and expressed

<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>16. Forced marriages take place in many social, political, cultural, economic and legal 
contexts around the world.  In this report, the Special Rapporteur aims to identify when such 
forced marriages exist and when they have been carried out in the context of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children.  The Special Rapporteur also examines the possible 
causes and consequences of forced marriage in the context of human trafficking and addresses 
the demand for forced marriage.  Finally, she offers recommendations to States and non-State 
actors on ways to prevent trafficking in persons through or for the purpose of forced marriages, 
discourage the demand for such marriages, protect and assist the victims, and establish legal and 
prosecutorial measures to combat forced marriages in the context of trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Definition of trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>17. In 2000, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (the Palermo Protocol) set out minimum international standards for the 
prevention and combat of trafficking in persons for different forms of exploitation.  According to 
article 3: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(a) &#8216;Trafficking in persons&#8217; shall mean the recruitment, transportation, 
transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other 
forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a 
position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve 
the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of 
exploitation.  Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the 
prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, 
slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(b) The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended 
exploitation &#8230; shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in paragraph (a) have 
been used; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child 
for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered &#8216;trafficking in persons&#8217; even if this 
does not involve any of the means set forth in paragraph (a); 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(d) &#8216;Child&#8217; shall mean any person under 18 years of age.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>18. UNODC stated in its response to the questionnaire that a case of forced marriage is a case 
of trafficking in persons when the elements of the crime of trafficking - act, means, and purpose 
of exploitation - as described in article 3 of the Palermo Protocol are present. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Nature and forms of forced marriage 
</b></p>
<p>19. Before considering these elements, it is necessary to define what amounts to a forced 
marriage.  The 1964 Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and  </p>
<p>Registration of Marriages (Convention on Consent to Marriage) provides that &#8220;[n]o marriage </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/23 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>shall be legally entered into without the full and free consent of both parties, such consent to be 
expressed by them in person after due publicity and in the presence of the authority competent to 
solemnize the marriage and of witnesses, as prescribed by law&#8221; (art. 1 (1)).  Moreover, the 1995 
Beijing Platform for Action urges Governments to &#8220;[e]nact and strictly enforce laws to ensure 
that marriage is only entered into with the free and full consent of the intending spouses&#8221; 
(para. 274 (e)).  Emphasis is on the full and free consent of the parties to the marriage, as also 
reflected in, inter alia, article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
article 16 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>20. Moreover, national legislation on marriages also focuses on the equal rights of men and 
women to marry and to do so legally and of their own free will.  Absence of such full and free 
consent will, in many jurisdictions, constitute a ground to have the marriage declared null and 
void.  In addition, in many jurisdictions, including Afghanistan, Austria, Ghana, Norway and 
Serbia, forced marriage is considered by the respective criminal codes as a crime in its own right.  
In other countries, including Algeria, Belarus, Canada, Colombia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, 
Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Mauritius, Moldova and the United Kingdom, despite not 
having a specific provision criminalizing a forced marriage, an act of forced marriage may be 
subject to criminal proceedings under other related crimes including trafficking in human beings, 
sexual exploitation, abduction, prostitution and rape. 
</p>
<p>21. Article 16 (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women sets out parameters for national prohibitions of child marriage by recognizing 
that a marriage of a child should not be permitted nor have legal effect.  The Convention on the 
Rights of the Child contains several articles that are pertinent to the marriage of a child.  
According to article 3, States parties have a positive obligation to ensure that the best interests of 
a child are always a primary consideration - beyond the mere protection against discrimination of 
the girl child.  Since children are, by definition, incapable of consent or of exercising the right of 
refusal, child marriage is forced marriage, and as such violates fundamental human rights 
standards and must therefore be strictly prohibited. 
</p>
<p>22. The practice of child marriage of girls is, according to many observers, the socially 
legitimized institutionalization of sexual abuse and marital rape, sometimes of very young girls,<b>3</b> 
which has serious physical, psychological and health consequences for the girls involved.  These 
marriages result in a high incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, 
disabilities such as fistulas, and death as a result of premature childbirth. 
</p>
<p>23. The 1990 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child requires States parties 
to prohibit child marriage and to adopt legislation &#8220;to specify the minimum age of marriage to 
be 18 years&#8221; (art. 21 (2)).

</p>
<p>24. In his 2006 in-depth study on all forms of violence against women, the Secretary-General 
stated that &#8220;[a] forced marriage is one that lacks the free and valid consent of at least one of the 
parties.  In its most extreme form, forced marriage can involve threatening behaviour, abduction, 
imprisonment, physical violence, rape, and, in some cases, murder&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1, para. 122). 
</p>
<p>25. The Governments of, for example, Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway and the 
United Kingdom distinguish arranged marriages from forced marriages in that in an arranged 
marriage the parents/families take a leading role in arranging the marriage, but the decision 
whether to consent to the arrangement remains with the individuals getting married.  The 
distinction is said to rest in the right to choose a partner, the ability to say no, and the supposition 
that the marriage is not entered into under duress.  In addition, several Governments, including 
the United Kingdom, describe arranged marriage as a tradition existing within many 
communities and many countries for a long time.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that in some cases the difference between an 
arranged and a forced marriage is tenuous.  Arranged marriages have been defined as &#8220;a form of 
social construction that informs the girl from a young age of her expected familial duties and her 
understanding of what constitutes bringing &#8216;shame&#8217; upon the family.  If a young woman is bodily 
kidnapped the force is obvious but when a marriage is &#8216;arranged&#8217; by her relatives&#8217; trickery and 
stealth, she does not realize, often until it is too late, that an arranged and forced marriage 
amounts to much the same thing&#8221;.<b>5</b>  A marriage imposed on a woman not by explicit force, but 
by subjecting her to relentless pressure and/or manipulation, often by telling her that her refusal 
of a suitor will harm her family&#8217;s standing in the community, can also be understood as forced. 
</p>
<p>27. The responses to the questionnaire on forced marriage, informed the Special Rapporteur 
that the main victims of forced marriages are women and girls.  The French NGO, 
Mouvement fran&#231;ais pour le planning familial stated in its response that boys are also concerned 
by forced marriages, but that this is rare.  Other respondents, such as the Serbian NGO, 
ASTRA-Anti-Trafficking Action, mentioned that child marriages in some rare cases also may 
involve male children.  Also, the United Kingdom Forced Marriage Unit stated in its 2005 
report that &#8220;there is evidence to suggest that as many as 15 per cent of victims are male&#8221;.<b>6</b>

<p>UNICEF concluded in a recent report that while boys under 18 years of age are affected by early 
marriage, this is an issue that impacts upon girls in far larger numbers and with more intensity.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The different kinds of forced marriage listed include:  to settle debt (Afghanistan); to 
receive dowry payment (Tanzania); to further cultural/economic interests, e.g. forced marriages 
initiated by landlords or local commanders who overrule girls/women and parents (Afghanistan); 
to gain control over daughters&#8217; lives by sending daughters back to the home country to marry 
local men (United Kingdom, United States of America, France, Austria and Switzerland); of 
girls to men from overseas in order for them to obtain residence permits as husbands 
(United Kingdom, Germany); to display status, e.g. bride wealth (Kenya); as inheritance when a 
widow is forced to marry a dead husband&#8217;s brother, or a widower marries a dead wife&#8217;s younger 
sister without her consent (Africa); in <i>trokosi</i> or <i>devadasi</i>, when young girls are forcibly married 
to a local god, represented by a priest (Ghana and India); after abduction or kidnapping 
(Afghanistan, Ghana, Serbia among the Roma people); to any willing groom, often men with 
disability or of lower class, to a girl who is impregnated while living at home by a male relative 
(Kenya); to &#8220;protect&#8221; a girl&#8217;s virginity and counteract promiscuity (Kenya); as compensation 
when men of one extended family have killed a man of another extended family (Afghanistan); 
to relieve poverty and for economic gain (Zambia); and to facilitate female genital mutilation 
(Ethiopia).  Moreover, polygamous marriages were also described as constituting forced 
marriages.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was also informed about cases of trafficking in 
girls to fill the gap caused by the practice of female foeticide in certain parts of India, including 
Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Hryana.<b>7</b> 
29. The often criminal and hidden nature of forced marriages, combined with the fact that 
most forced marriages take place in closed families, groups, communities or societies, makes it 
particularly difficult to compile reliable statistics on how many women and girls are subjected to 
forced marriages of any kind every year.  The Government of The former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia and the IOM office in Afghanistan, for example, concluded in their responses that 
although forced marriages are common in these countries, no specific data are available. 
</p>
<p>30. Some statistics do exist, however.  The Government of the United Kingdom reported that 
its Forced Marriage Unit handles about 250-300 cases a year of British nationals, mostly 
involving girls and women between 13 and 30 years of age, forced into marriage.<b>8</b>  Likewise, the 
Government of Austria noted that in 2005, a total of 46 persons were affected or threatened by 
forced marriage in Austria.  The Ashiana Network reported that a growing number of young 
women, especially 16 to 24-year-olds, are threatened with physical, emotional and sexual 
violence before being forced to marry mainly strangers in their parents&#8217; homelands.  From 
April 2005 to March 2006 the organization advised 79 women who were threatened with forced 
marriage.

<p><b>D.  Forced marriage as a reason for or as a result of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>31. Forced marriage has, in fact, been recognized as a form of human trafficking.  Forced 
marriage can be used as a method of recruitment for the purpose of trafficking in persons,<b>9</b> and 
may be a result of trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>32. At a regional level, for example, article 1 (5) of the 2002 SAARC Convention on 
Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution states that 
&#8220;&#8216;[p]ersons subjected to trafficking&#8217; means women and children victimized or forced into 
prostitution by the traffickers by deception, threat, coercion, kidnapping, sale, fraudulent 
marriage, child marriage, or any other unlawful means&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. The United Nations Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery recognized 
forced marriage as a form of contemporary slavery, trafficking and sexual exploitation (see 
E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/31).  In addition, article 1 of the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition 
of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956 states that 
States parties shall abolish or abandon:   
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;  
</p>
<p> &#8220;(c) Any institution or practice whereby:   
</p>
<p>(i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in 
marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her 
parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or  
</p>
<p>(ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to 
transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or  
</p>
<p>(iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by 
another person; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(d) Any institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age 
of 18 years, is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to 
another person, whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or 
young person or of his labour.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>34. Various Governments and organizations provided the Special Rapporteur with examples 
of different cases of forced marriage which have been recognized as taking place in the context 
of trafficking in persons.  The Government of Israel, for example, described how the Ministry of 
the Interior and the Police recently identified several isolated instances of procurers who had 
filed requests for family reunification with women from the former Soviet Union.  The 
relationships were of very short or almost no duration and there was a significant age difference 
between the partners.  It was suspected that the purpose behind such requests was to bring these 
                                                 
</p>

<p>consequences, to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-third session (E/CN.4/1997/47). </p>

</p>
<p>women to Israel for the purpose of prostitution.  The State of Israel is aware of approximately 
four or five such cases.  Moreover, the Government reported that &#8220;Israeli men, often 
handicapped, marry women from poor countries in order to have them work as service providers.  
The women consent in the hope that this will enable them to break the cycle of poverty&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. In addition, the Government of Mexico reported that cases of forced marriages that led to 
trafficking in persons for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation had been detected in 
several states/municipalities of the country.  Data indicate that some families traffic their minor 
daughters to be married to older men with economic resources.  The girls are too young to be 
able to make a decision, and in some cases the consent is given by the family.  The Iraqi NGO, 
SOITM Foundation reported that owing to the current situation in Iraq, a large number of Iraqi 
women were being recruited by sex traffickers and that some who had been taken to the Gulf 
States as wives were later used in the local prostitution industry. 
</p>
<p>36. Moreover, there is evidence that adolescent females have been trafficked over 
international borders between polygamous communities in the United States and Canada to enter 
into arranged polygamous marriages.<b>10</b>  A 2005 Canadian report on polygamy challenged the 
idea that &#8220;women who participate in polygamy actively consent to this, given the social isolation 
and religious indoctrination to which they have been subjected throughout their lives&#8221;.<b>11</b>  
Polygamy could, therefore, be seen in certain contexts as akin to a forced marriage and thus akin 
to slavery and bondage, when women and girls are married without their free and full consent. 
</p>
<p>37. The NGO La Strada in Moldova informed the Special Rapporteur that in the 
years 2002-2004, it registered two cases of forced marriage for the purpose of 
trafficking in human beings:  in one case the victim &#8220;married&#8221; a United States citizen, and 
the other case involved a Moldovan citizen in Germany.  In addition, the Serbian NGO 
ASTRA-Anti-Trafficking Action reported that in its work it had come across women who had 
been forced into marriage with a pimp following their sexual exploitation.  The marriages had 
been concluded to conceal a criminal offence, eliminate a potential witness or misrepresent the 
situation of the woman.  The ASTRA legal team is currently seeking to annul the forced 
marriage of a victim to her trafficker.  A Norwegian research report of 2004 concluded that a 
large number of women trafficked to Oslo for prostitution originally arrived in Norway through 
marriage with a Norwegian man.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E. Forced marriage in the context of trafficking  
in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>38. There is a clear recognition in United Nations and regional agreements, as well as in 
national legislation, that many women and girls around the world live under conditions where,

</p>
<p>owing to harmful patriarchal, traditional, customary and/or religious practices, they cannot fully 
exercise their human rights to marry or refuse marriage; to full sexual autonomy; to refuse 
childbearing; to leave partners, including abusive partners, while retaining custody of their 
children, and to do so safely and without legal, economic, social, political and cultural 
repercussions. 
</p>
<p>39. The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right of children to health and 
to be protected from all forms of physical and mental violence, including sexual abuse, sexual 
exploitation, harmful traditional practices, abduction, sale and trafficking for all forms of 
exploitation.  Moreover, child marriages of girls also have a serious impact on their Convention 
right to education.  Child marriage almost always brings an abrupt halt to the girl&#8217;s education.  
Researchers conclude that &#8220;girls who marry young are more likely to be illiterate and to have no 
experience of formal education&#8221;.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>40. Many countries, including Afghanistan, Estonia, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Moldova, 
the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia, still have national marriage legislation whereby 
one (generally the female) or both parties may be married before reaching 18 years of age, with 
parental/guardian consent, or with the consent of a public authority after suitability for marriage 
has been determined. 
</p>
<p>41. Another consequence of forced marriage in the context of trafficking in persons is that 
victims of forced marriages may also become victims of &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;.  Although both 
women and men can be the victims of forced marriage, the honour of a family is tied primarily to 
the status of the woman, leaving her much more vulnerable to persuasion and coercion into a 
union to which she objects.<b>14</b>  Many NGOs that work specifically to prevent and combat crimes 
of &#8220;honour&#8221; against women and girls, such as the Lilith Project of Eaves Housing for Women 
(United Kingdom), note that there are links between forced marriages and violence committed 
against women in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221;.  So-called &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;, an ancient practice 
sanctioned by culture rather than religion, are rooted in a complex code that allows a man to kill 
or abuse a female relative or partner for suspected or actual &#8220;immoral behaviour&#8221;.<b>15</b>  According 
to the response of the Government of the Philippines, the most common form of forced marriage 
takes place mainly in the provinces when a man impregnates or has sexual relations with a 
woman and her family forces the man to marry her to protect the dignity, honour and reputation 
of the woman and the family in the community.

</p>
<p>42. In its general recommendation No. 21 CEDAW states that &#8220;polygamy is practised in a 
number of countries.  Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman&#8217;s right to equality with men, 
and can have such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that 
such marriages ought to be discouraged and prohibited.  The Committee notes with concern that 
some States parties, whose constitutions guarantee equal rights, permit polygamous marriage in 
accordance with personal or customary law.  This violates the constitutional rights of women, 
and breaches the provisions of article 5 (a) of the Convention&#8221; (para. 14).  Furthermore, 
paragraph 39 states that States parties should require registration of all marriages, inter alia to 
ensure the prohibition of polygamy. 
</p>
<p>43. Persons trafficked to be forced into marriage also often become victims of physical, 
sexual and psychological abuse not only by their husbands, but by relatives of their spouses, 
especially members of his household, and sometimes, if victims resist the marriage or attempt to 
flee once it has been formalized, they are subject to abuse, ostracism, or even lethal violence, by 
members of their own families.<b>16</b>  The power and control directed at victims of forced marriage 
by their in-laws reinforces the spouse&#8217;s domination and traps victims in conditions of domestic 
and sexual servitude, or even enslavement. 
</p>
<p>44. Trafficking for the purpose of forced marriage may also take place in situations of armed 
conflict where women are recruited, transported, and forced to act as &#8220;wives&#8221; of soldiers.  In 
these contexts, and under conditions of extreme violence and deprivation, women and girls are 
subjected to, inter alia, ongoing rape and domestic servitude.  In May 2004, the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone entered a new count of &#8220;Crimes against Humanity - Other Inhumane Acts (Forced 
Marriage)&#8221; into its statute.  This amendment, which allows for the prosecution of &#8220;forced 
marriage&#8221;, followed the widespread coercing of women into forced marriages by men fighting 
on both sides of the armed conflict in Sierra Leone.  The Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (TRC) identified forced marriage as sexual slavery, denounced certain aspects of 
customary marriage practised in Sierra Leone, and pointed out that the country was failing to 
comply with its international obligations in this regard.  TRC further noted its agreement with 
scholars who argued that the extreme violence that women suffered during the conflict did not 
arise solely out of the conditions of the war, but was directly linked to the violence experienced 
by women during peacetime in Sierra Leone.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>45. Forced marriage, in itself a form of violence against women, further engenders 
gender-based violence, as described by CEDAW:  forced marriages and other violent and 
coercive practices may &#8220;justify gender-based violence as a form of protection or control of

</p>
<p>women&#8221;.  This violence deprives women (and girls) of their equal enjoyment, exercise and 
knowledge of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and keeps them in subordinate 
roles.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>F. Protection of victims of forced marriage in the context of 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>46. Part II of the Palermo Protocol provides States with an obligation to provide assistance 
and protection to trafficked persons.  Persons subject to forced marriage, when such marriage has 
taken place in a trafficking context, are entitled to this assistance in addition to any provided to 
them as victims of forced marriage.  They should not be treated as criminals. 
</p>
<p>47. In accordance with the Palermo Protocol, such assistance should include protection of the 
privacy and identity of the victims, including, inter alia, by making legal proceedings relating to 
such trafficking confidential (art. 6 (1)).  Trafficked persons must moreover be provided with 
information on relevant court and administrative proceedings (art. 6 (2) (a)) and assistance to 
enable their views and concerns to be presented and considered at appropriate stages of 
criminal proceedings against offenders, in a manner not prejudicial to the rights of the defence 
(art. 6 (2) (b)).  States parties shall also consider implementing measures to provide for the 
physical, psychological and social recovery of victims, including in appropriate cases, in 
cooperation with non-governmental organizations, other relevant organizations and other 
elements of civil society, and, in particular, the provision of, inter alia, appropriate housing, 
education and care (art. 6 (3)).  States parties shall ensure that their legislation provides victims 
the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered (art. 6 (6)).  Any measures to 
prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children, must safeguard 
the rights of victims under international law, in particular under the 1951 Convention and 
the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, including their right to protection against 
refoulement (art. 14 (1)). 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur was informed that protection and assistance provided to women 
subjected to forced marriages was either provided to them directly as victims of forced marriage 
(in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom) or, for example, also as victims of trafficking in 
persons when a forced marriage, having been carried out in a trafficking context, was found to 
have taken place (in Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Germany, Indonesia, 
Italy and Serbia). 
</p>
<p><b>G. The demand for forced marriage in the context of trafficking 
in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>49. In order to eradicate forced marriages in the context of trafficking in persons, especially 
women and girls, it is essential to target the demand for exploitation of the prostitution of others 
or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  General recommendation No. 19, para. 11. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/23 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>slavery, and servitude of mainly women and girls.  A complete legal prohibition on the demand 
for forced marriages would function as a deterrent to those who acquire and use the most 
vulnerable and powerless women and girls for forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>50. The Palermo Protocol addresses demand in its article 9 (5), which provides that States 
parties &#8220;shall adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or 
cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the 
demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that 
leads to trafficking&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. Moreover, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action encourages States to &#8220;[t]ake appropriate 
measures to address the root factors, including external factors, that encourage trafficking in 
women and girls for prostitution and other forms of commercialized sex, forced marriages and 
forced labour in order to eliminate trafficking in women, including by strengthening existing 
legislation with a view to providing better protection of the rights of women and girls and to 
punishing the perpetrators, through both criminal and civil measures&#8221; (para. 131 (b)).  Also, in 
resolution 49/2 of 11 March 2005, entitled &#8220;Eliminating demand for trafficked women and girls 
for all forms of exploitation&#8221;, the Commission on the Status of Women stated that it was 
&#8220;[c]onvinced that eliminating the demand for trafficked women and girls for all forms of 
exploitation, including for sexual exploitation, is a key element to combating trafficking&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>52. Since the entering into force of the Palermo Protocol, several newly negotiated regional 
agreements and action plans have included articles focusing on measures to discourage the 
demand for the exploitation that promotes human trafficking, especially of women and children.  
For example, under article 6 of the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings, States parties are obliged to adopt or strengthen legislative, 
administrative, educational, social, cultural or other measures, including research on best 
practices, methods and strategies; raising awareness of the responsibility and important role of 
media and civil society in identifying the demand; information campaigns involving, as 
appropriate, inter alia, public authorities and policymakers; and preventive measures, including 
educational programmes for boys and girls that stress the unacceptable nature of discrimination 
based on sex and its disastrous consequences, the importance of gender equality and the dignity 
and integrity of every human being. 
</p>
<p>53. In addition, the European Union draft action plan to fight trafficking in human beings 
states that all European Union institutions and member States &#8220;should promote gender-specific 
prevention strategies as a key element to combat trafficking in women and girls.  This includes 
implementing gender equality principles and eliminating the demand for all forms of 
exploitation, including sexual exploitation and domestic labour exploitation&#8221;.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>54. Some countries have put in place awareness-raising or prosecution mechanisms that 
address demand.  For example, in Sweden, as described in the 2004 and 2005 annual report of 
the Swedish National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings, legislation targeting the 
demand for women and girls for prostitution by prohibiting the purchase of sexual services 
&#8220;continues to function as a barrier against the establishment of traffickers in Sweden&#8221;.  The 
Swedish legislation that prohibits the purchase of sexual services also functions as a deterrent for 
those men who would seek women and children for sexual exploitation.  There is evidence that 
the number of buyers has decreased by 75-80 per cent since the coming into force of this 
legislation in 1999.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>55. According to the NGO Women in Need Development Consortium (WINIDECO), 
perpetrators of forced marriage in Kenya are reported to the relevant authorities and charged in 
court.  Also, in 2004 in Burkina Faso, where one in three girls is married before the age of 18, 
the Government has addressed the problem of child marriage through education programmes that 
include addressing the tradition of male demand for young brides.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>56. There is a high risk of trafficking of women and girls in cases where marriage-brokering 
agencies are involved.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur refers to her first report, 
(E/CN.4/2005/71), in which she highlighted a concern about reports regarding marketing of 
women and children via the Internet or in the guise of marriage-brokering services and pen pal 
clubs as factors fostering the demand for the sexual exploitation that promotes human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>57. The marriage-marketing trade feeds on unrealistic and contradictory expectations about 
marital relationships.<b>22</b>  Moreover, as stated in paragraph 14 of CEDAW general 
recommendation No. 21, poverty and unemployment increase opportunities for trafficking in 
women.  In addition to established forms of trafficking there are new forms of sexual 
exploitation, such as organized marriages between women from developing countries and 
foreign nationals.  These practices are incompatible with the equal enjoyment of rights by 
women and with respect for their rights and dignity.  There is an unequal balance of power that 
puts women at special risk of violence and abuse, particularly when it is the man who is paying 
money to marry the woman concerned. 
</p>
<p>58. Moreover, marriages instigated by the Internet and mail-order bride agencies often 
become forced marriages as women are not free to leave them because of their dependence on 
their husbands for legal immigration status, their isolation from their families and friends, their 
economic dependence on their husbands and their fear of their husbands especially since many

</p>
<p>men who seek marriage to women through these agencies have a history of violence against 
women.  For example, the Indonesian NGO, the Health and Humanity Foundation reported that 
the most common forms of forced marriages in Indonesia are bride-order marriages and marriage 
with minors for debt bondage.

<p>59. In her report, the Special Rapporteur also made reference to a case of a woman who was 
awarded compensatory and punitive damages in a lawsuit against an international marriage 
broker who had failed to inform her of a law that would have enabled her to escape her abusive 
marriage without fear of automatic deportation.  The Special Rapporteur referred to that case as a 
victory for those trying to combat trafficking in persons.  This case sheds light on the dangers 
involved in the use of such marriage agencies. 
</p>
<p>60. Countries such as the Philippines have adopted specific legislation in this regard.  
According to article 4 of the 2003 Philippines Anti-Trafficking Law, Republic Act 9208, it is 
unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to &#8220;offer or contract marriage, real or simulated, for 
the purpose of acquiring, buying, offering, selling, or trading them [sic] to engage in prostitution, 
pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labour or slavery, involuntary servitude or debt 
bondage&#8221;.

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The phenomenon of forced marriages of women and girls in the context of 
trafficking in persons is widespread, is devastating for its victims and has a serious impact 
on women&#8217;s status in those societies where it occurs. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>To successfully combat forced marriages in the context of trafficking in persons, 
States must, in accordance with existing international agreements, put into place measures 
that prevent women and children from becoming victims of forced marriages, including 
measures that discourage the demand.  States are obliged to ensure the safety of victims 
and their access to adequate and appropriate assistance.  Finally, States are required to 
adopt legislation to criminalize forced marriages in the context of trafficking in persons 
and prosecute those responsible, while safeguarding the rights of the victims. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prevention of forced marriage in the context of trafficking in persons,  
especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Measures to prevent and combat forced marriages be included in national 
action plans that focus on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and, 
similarly, in national action plans on violence against women and girls; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) States establish special units and/or working groups, such as the Forced 
Marriages Unit of the United Kingdom, within law enforcement agencies or other 
appropriate public authorities.  These agencies should be responsible for investigating 
and/or prosecuting cases of forced marriage in the context of trafficking in persons.  In 
collaboration with NGOs and organizations in civil society, these agencies could also be 
responsible for collecting and publicizing information on forced marriages; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b> (c) States adopt marriage legislation that stipulates a minimum statutory age for 
marriage of 18 years of age, and ensure that the legislation applies equally to women and 
men.  Such legislation should be compatible with international human rights standards and 
the best interests of children must be a primary consideration; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) States amend their immigration legislation so that victims of forced 
marriages are not dependent upon their spouses for legal immigration status but can 
obtain residence permits independently of their continued relation to their husbands.  
Governments should recognize forced marriage, especially in the context of trafficking in 
persons, as a condition giving rise to a claim of asylum based on gender-related violence 
and other forms of human rights violations, and ensure that the women and girls 
concerned are not deported; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) States ensure that key actors such as law enforcement personnel, judges and 
prosecutors, diplomatic and consular staff and immigration authorities are trained in the 
legal, economic, cultural, social and other aspects of forced marriage in the context of 
trafficking in persons, in how to identify, assist and protect victims, and in rigorous 
prosecution of the perpetrators; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) States develop and conduct public awareness campaigns relating to the 
nature and harm of forced marriages in the context of trafficking in persons.  Such 
campaigns could target the public, community leaders, teachers, health-care personnel and 
others, as well as women and girls vulnerable to forced marriages, and those who demand 
women and girls for the purpose of forced marriages; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) States ensure that persons holding dual nationality, who are more vulnerable 
to forced marriage in the name of &#8220;protecting their individual ethnicity and tradition&#8221;, are 
made aware of the laws on marriages of the countries in which they live and that forced 
marriage is a form of violence and may also be a means or an end to human trafficking in 
which the victim may be confined to a lifetime of exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Traditional, religious or cultural practices or domestic laws and policies 
should not be used to justify violations of international human rights norms and standards.  
Thus, customs, whether religious, cultural or traditional, should not be invoked to 
legitimize forced marriages of any kind.  Such marriages are inconsistent with 
international legal principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) States ensure that gender-disaggregated data on the incidence of forced 
marriages internationally, regionally and nationally are collected, reported and compared 
as part of crime, gender equality and migration statistics; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Measures that discourage the demand 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) In order to deter those who provide the demand for women and girls under 
18 years of age for forced marriages, States put into place different preventive measures as 
well as legislation that criminalizes the demand for forced marriages, especially in the 
context of trafficking in persons, including the demand for so-called mail-order or Internet 
brides; </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/23

</p>
<p><b> (k) The marriage-marketing trade be closely monitored and rigorous protection 
mechanisms established for the persons concerned.  The Special Rapporteur also urges 
States to draft, adopt and implement legislation such as the law in the Philippines that 
outlaws the activities of marriage brokers, and investigate networks and individuals that 
organize trafficking in women and girls for the purpose of forced marriages; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) States ensure that men who apply for visas for a foreign spouse undergo 
background and criminal-record checks, and that the issuing of such visas be monitored in 
order to identify men who have a history of serial forced or broker-facilitated marriages.  
In some countries, non-governmental organizations and immigration authorities have 
reported that a number of men who apply for visas for a foreign spouse have a long and 
documented history of violence against women.  Also, they may have applied for more than 
one such visa.  Women who entered the country as the spouses of these men have in many 
cases ended up in shelters for battered women, and in some cases been deported.23 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protection and assistance of victims of forced marriage in the context of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) States ensure that all girls are given equal access to education and 
educational institutions, and enforce their right to education through mandatory measures 
as well as through scholarships and tuition programmes, trust funds and other measures 
that facilitate their education.  This move for literacy should include legal and economic 
literacy, which should be regarded as an important step in supporting not only the 
returning victims of forced marriage, but also act as a catalyst for preventing the offence of 
forced marriage; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) States consider simplifying the nullification process for a forced marriage, 
develop measures that enable victims of forced marriage, including in the context of 
trafficking in persons, to sue perpetrators under the civil law for damages and, where 
necessary, extend limitation periods for civil litigation and criminal prosecution of forced 
marriages; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) States support public authorities and non-governmental and 
community-based organizations that already assist victims of domestic violence and sexual 
assault, including immigrant women and children, and establish more facilities to protect 
and assist victims of trafficking, including safe shelters that provide services such as 
security, housing, legal advice, employment, education, health care, childcare and 
relocation assistance for women and girls fleeing actual or threatened forced marriages.  
These shelters should, together with appropriate consular and other authorities, assist in 
the safe repatriation of those who have undergone forced marriages abroad, if desired;

<p><b>Legislation and prosecution of forced marriage in the context of trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) States include in their criminal-law provisions a specific offence of &#8220;forced 
marriage&#8221;, with penalties reflecting the seriousness of the crime.  Such legal provisions 
should criminalize those who seek and procure women and girls for forced marriage, those 
who aid and abet the contracting of such marriages, as well as those who profit from the 
exploitation of the trafficked persons subjected to such marriages; 
 (q) Criminal provisions, such as those pertaining to rape, sexual abuse and 
battering, also be invoked when prosecuting perpetrators of forced marriages because 
victims of forced marriages often suffer regular sexual, physical and other bodily and 
psychological violations committed by their spouses; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (r) States must ensure that children under 18 years of age are not allowed to 
marry as this is inconsistent with international human rights norms and standards, that 
harmful traditional practices such as dowry and bride-price are made illegal, and that 
marriage by proxy, including over the telephone, and polygamy are strictly prohibited in 
law and policy.24
