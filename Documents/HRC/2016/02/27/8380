<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
submits the present report in accordance with Human Rights Council resolutions 7/22 and 
16/2. In the report, she focuses on national and local planning for the implementation of the 
rights to water and to sanitation.  
</p>
<p>2. Having a vision and the corresponding political will to transform that vision into 
reality are fundamental first steps to the realization of the rights to water and to sanitation. 
As the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) observed in the <i>Human 
Development Report 2006</i> on water: &#8220;The obvious starting point for a drive towards 
universal access to water and sanitation is political will, broadly defined as the resolve to 
put the issue at the centre of the national agenda.&#8221;1 The preparation and adoption of 
actionable strategies and plans is a manifestation of that vision and can set out how a State 
intends to realize the rights to water and to sanitation.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur engaged in a wide consultative process, including two 
multi-stakeholder expert consultations where participants discussed the different phases of 
planning and how human rights can strengthen that process, as well as questions of 
financing.2 The Special Rapporteur also received numerous written contributions. The in-
depth discussions and varied perspectives have provided her with valuable guidance in 
preparing the present report and she is grateful to all those who contributed with their time 
and expertise. Several of the examples cited in this report were obtained through this 
consultative process.3  
</p>
<p><b> II. Setting the scene 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Why planning matters 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur advocates for planning that goes beyond superficial 
statements of intent to specific commitments backed by necessary political support, strong 
institutions, and human and financial resources. Too often, plans of action are narrowly 
understood as a piece of paper, rather than a process towards better protection of human 
rights. If understood as a process, good planning can have transformative impacts for the 
water and sanitation sectors as well as for the enjoyment of these rights. In the present 
report, the Special Rapporteur explores various facets of successful planning exercises.  
</p>
<p>5. Planning processes in line with human rights contributes to ensuring a coherent 
approach that accords sufficient priority to water and sanitation, helps to ensure more 
sustainable results, and strengthens accountability. A clearly articulated vision has the 
advantage of serving as a firm foundation for prioritizing funding to the sector, both within 
the domestic budget as well as through international assistance. This vision can inspire 
confidence that funds can be absorbed and spent in line with the stated goals.

</i></p>

 2  The second consultation was held in Lisbon, organized by the Centre For Women&#8217;s Global 
</p>
<p>Leadership at Rutgers University.  
 3 The Special Rapporteur relied on examples as described to her by relevant stakeholders; however, 
</p>
<p>replication or endorsement of such practices would require further verification. </p>


<p>6. National planning provides opportunities to ensure more coordinated and consistent 
responses to broader concerns such as climate change and water scarcity. Good planning 
will also identify and address incompatibilities with human rights as well as overlaps and 
gaps in laws and policies. Successful planning is based on broad participation, which 
further contributes to effective implementation and sustainability. Effective national 
planning frequently leads to improved data on water and sanitation as well as to clarified 
responsibilities for more efficient and effective management of water and sanitation, thus 
contributing to enhanced accountability.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Realization of the human rights to water and to sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>7. The rights to water and to sanitation are guaranteed under international human rights 
law and States must take measures towards the progressive realization of these rights. This 
requires concrete and targeted steps to the maximum of their available resources. States are 
required to move towards the goal of full realization as expeditiously and effectively as 
possible, within the framework of international cooperation and assistance, where needed. 
Certain aspects of these rights are immediate obligations, including the requirement to 
guarantee them without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>8. The normative content of the rights to water and to sanitation provides the standard 
to be achieved in terms of the following criteria:4 
</p>
<p>(a)<i> Availability. </i>The human right to water is limited to personal and domestic 
uses and foresees a supply for each person that must be sufficient for these purposes. 
Likewise, a sufficient number of sanitation facilities must be available; 
</p>
<p>(b) <i>Quality. </i>Water must be safe for consumption and other uses and not threaten 
human health. Sanitation facilities must be hygienically and technically safe to use. To 
ensure hygiene, access to water for cleansing and hand washing after use is essential; 
</p>
<p>(c) <i>Acceptability.</i> Sanitation facilities, in particular, must be culturally 
acceptable. This will often require gender-specific facilities, constructed in a way that 
ensures privacy and dignity;  
</p>
<p>(d) <i>Accessibility.</i> Water and sanitation services must be accessible to everyone in 
the household or its vicinity on a continuous basis, as well as in schools, health-care 
facilities and other public institutions and places. Physical security must not be threatened 
during access to facilities; 
</p>
<p>(e)<i> Affordability.</i> Access to sanitation and water must not compromise the ability 
to pay for other essential necessities guaranteed by human rights, such as food, housing and 
health care. 
</p>
<p>9. These criteria reflect the need for a holistic, comprehensive, and coherent approach 
to fully realize the rights to water and to sanitation for all.  
</p>
<p>  
 4 For a detailed explanation of these criteria, see Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, para. 12, and the report of the independent 
expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
(A/HRC/12/24 and Corr.1), paras. 69 ff. </p>


<p><b> C. Relevant frameworks for planning 
</b></p>
<p>10. The call for strategies and plans of action regarding human rights and/or water and 
sanitation is not new.  
</p>
<p>11. In the area of human rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
adopted on 25 June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, highlighted the 
importance of national plans of action as tools for the promotion and protection of human 
rights.5 Apart from these generic national human rights action plans, which several States 
have developed, others have put into place sectoral plans addressing specific human rights 
concerns and aspects, such as human trafficking, racism, child rights and social inclusion. 
Notably, the Human Rights Council and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights have emphasized the importance of national plans of action for the realization of the 
rights to water and to sanitation.6  
</p>
<p>12. In the context of water and sanitation specifically, a number of planning exercises 
are relevant, ranging from short- to long-term planning. Here, strategies are understood to 
set out the general framework, often covering development more broadly and setting the 
tone for policy development. Such strategies are longer term and should be in place before 
a plan of action is developed. In turn, action plans are based on these strategies. They cover 
only water and/or sanitation, and are more specific, short term and action oriented, 
including the detailed activities to implement the overall strategy. These are often 
developed at the national level.  
</p>
<p>13. Since water and sanitation service provision is often the responsibility of the local 
authorities, planning at the local level is equally relevant. In some States, subnational or 
local government is further responsible for policymaking in the field of water and 
sanitation. In Germany, for example, federal law7 provides the general framework for water 
management and water and sanitation service provision, while specifics are provided for at 
the subnational level (the <i>L&#228;nder</i>).8 Within this legal framework, municipalities maintain 
the competence for the specific arrangements. The exact determination of what proportion 
of planning is to take place at the national and local levels will depend on the country&#8217;s 
legal and administrative system, in particular the extent of decentralization. In many cases, 
at a minimum, the overall strategy and framework will be set out at the national level, while 
the specific activities to implement this strategy will be planned locally.  
</p>
<p>14. Many countries already have a national strategy and/or plan of action specifically 
devoted to water and/or sanitation, although water is more often addressed than sanitation. 
Indeed, the Global Annual Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water found that almost 
one third of the reporting countries did not have a sanitation policy in place covering urban 
and rural areas.9 The need for sound national planning processes is reiterated by the 
initiative entitled &#8220;Sustainable sanitation: the five-year drive to 2015&#8221;.10 Similarly, the 
Sanitation and Water for All initiative, an international partnership of national 
Governments, donors, civil society organizations and others, emphasizes the critical role of

<p>national planning. It seeks to galvanize political commitment to increase access to water 
and sanitation and, inter alia, provides capacity-building support for strong national 
processes that rely on improved data and analysis of the sanitation and water supply sectors 
for decision-making.11 For example, this initiative catalysed the preparation of The Ghana 
Compact: Sanitation and Water for All &#8211; A Global Framework for Action, in which Ghana 
commits to an annual allocation of $350 million towards water and sanitation 
improvements and up to 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product for hygiene education, 
including hand washing and Community-led Total Sanitation.12 
</p>
<p>15. Along with the provision of water and sanitation services, water resource 
management should be considered. The Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development called on all States to develop integrated water resources 
management plans by 2005.13 The Global Water Partnership defines this approach as &#8220;a 
process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and 
related resources in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an 
equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital eco-systems&#8221;.14 
Integrating human rights into this process would, inter alia, stress the prioritization of basic 
human needs in the allocation of water. The National Water Sector Development Strategy 
of the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, demonstrates this approach, stating that 
&#8220;allocation of water for basic human needs in adequate quantity and acceptable quality will 
receive highest priority&#8221;.15 
</p>
<p>16. Moreover, many developing countries have a development strategy, which is 
frequently based on the Millennium Development Goals or driven by poverty reduction 
strategy processes. Water and sanitation should be accorded priority in these broader 
national development strategies. While development strategies have long been perceived as 
suffering from a &#8220;blind spot&#8221; with respect to water and in particular sanitation,16 more 
recent surveys indicate that many such strategies cover water and/or sanitation.17 Some 
countries, such as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in its National Development Plan 
(2006-2011), have clearly made water and sanitation a national priority.18 
</p>
<p>17. The realization of the rights to water and to sanitation should be considered from the 
outset, in the planning exercise that determines the general framework at the national level. 
Hence, coherent planning will require integration of the human rights to water and to 
sanitation into existing strategies that cover related policy fields and development more 
broadly. For instance, since the rights to water and to sanitation relate to all spheres of life, 
plans in the field of education or health should cover access to (sex-segregated) water and

<p>sanitation in schools and hospitals. Poverty reduction strategies and national development 
plans should also have specific action envisaged on water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>18. Specific strategies and plans for water and sanitation will often also be essential to 
ensure that these issues are accorded sufficient priority and that their specificities are taken 
into account. These will need to be linked to broader plans and strategies in related sectors 
to ensure a coherent approach. A sole focus on mainstreaming would bear the risk of 
diluting the issue and limiting it to rhetorical repackaging. Moreover, it has also been found 
that strong sectoral planning influences donor prioritization19 and thus can help to increase 
funding to the sectors. Often overlooked, formulating a specific strategy on sanitation, as 
has been done in Bangladesh,20 has been shown in many cases to significantly contribute to 
prioritization of the issue. 
</p>
<p>19. Existing strong strategies and/or plans for the water and sanitation sectors should be 
re-examined, revised and fully aligned with human rights standards and principles. Often, 
such strategies already implicitly include human rights principles such as non-
discrimination &#8211; while not necessarily couched in the language of human rights &#8211; and can 
be built upon. Where no such planning exists, or where sanitation and water do not enjoy 
sufficient priority, the development of a new strategy and/or plan based on the human rights 
to water and to sanitation will be necessary.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Phases of planning  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Assessment and diagnosis 
</b></p>
<p>20. The development of a strategy and plan for the implementation of the rights to water 
and to sanitation must be based on a robust situational analysis that enables States to know 
where they stand both in terms of outcomes as well as inputs to the sectors, including on the 
status of the realization of the rights to water and to sanitation, on access to safe and 
affordable water and sanitation, and on funding flows to existing activities, resources and 
institutional capacities. 
</p>
<p>21. Bangladesh, for example, is currently in the process of carrying out an assessment 
regarding the status of sanitation in the country. A national sanitation conference entitled 
BanglaSan took place in January 2011 and gathered together about 700 representatives of 
government, non-governmental organizations, experts, elected representatives and 
professionals. The Government of Bangladesh committed to a carry out a national 
sanitation census to identify gaps and prepare an action plan that includes the necessary 
allocations.21  
</p>
<p>22. The normative content of the rights to water and to sanitation is a good basis for 
such an assessment. Analysing the current situation will require a detailed understanding of 
access, and will need to go beyond currently reported information, for example, in the 
framework of the monitoring of the Millennium Development Goals. Often, existing 
information from censuses, demographic surveys and samples is not as detailed, targeted 
and disaggregated as would be required for a thorough assessment based on human rights

<p>criteria and indicators. Inadequate data can therefore be a serious constraint, underscoring 
the need for improvement and capacity-strengthening in that area. 
</p>
<p>23. However, better use could be made of data already gathered. At the global level, the 
WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for the Water and Sanitation Sector, 
responsible for monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals target on 
water and sanitation, has started to develop new targets and indicators in line with human 
rights criteria. This process seeks to consider, inter alia<i>,</i> to what extent data gathered 
through existing surveys could be disaggregated to address prohibited grounds of 
discrimination. At the same time, the Joint Monitoring Programme is strengthening 
data collection for other relevant indicators, such as water quality.  
</p>
<p>24. Non-discrimination is a core concept in human rights law, and in this regard, the 
assessment must pay particular attention to marginalized and vulnerable groups to 
determine their levels of access and specific barriers they may face. Such an assessment 
must analyse why people do not have access, identifying existing gaps, exclusions, barriers 
and constraints. Only when the discriminatory impact of laws and policies is identified can 
adequate responses be designed to address the root causes for the lack of access. 
</p>
<p>25. The Performance Assessment System project developed by the Center for 
Environmental Planning and Technology University in Gujarat, India, seeks to assess the 
coverage, quality and service levels in water and sanitation in urban areas of the states of 
Gujarat and Maharashtra. The project focuses particularly on developing better information 
on reaching poor households, in particular in slum areas, and has developed methods of 
spatial analysis for monitoring equity in service provision.22 
</p>
<p>26. In terms of assessing inputs to the sectors, States should undertake a mapping of 
policies, programmes and activities already in place, determine what resources have been 
allocated, and identify the actors, including different service providers, involved. This 
includes assessing whether existing processes are non-discriminatory and participatory, and 
ensuring that accountability mechanisms are in place. Such a mapping should assess who is 
targeted by existing policies and which population groups might be left out. Where this 
review finds that existing policies or strategies do not fully address all dimensions of or are 
incompatible with the human rights to water and to sanitation, they need to be repealed, 
amended or changed to meet human rights requirements. Assessing the existing 
institutional and financial capacities helps to identify constraints, bottlenecks and 
weaknesses as well as successful interventions that drive the realization of the rights to 
water and to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>27. At the global level, the UN-Water Global Annual Assessment of Sanitation and 
Drinking-Water provides information on inputs to the sectors, including policy formulation, 
institutional arrangements and the allocation of resources seeking to identity drivers and 
bottlenecks in improving access. Notably, its 2011 questionnaire also includes attention to 
human rights concerns. The Country Status Overview reports developed by the Water and 
Sanitation Program of the World Bank provide another tool for situational analysis and 
diagnosis at the country level. The African Ministers&#8217; Council on Water has commissioned 
the production of these overviews for most sub-Saharan African countries, and similar 
efforts are underway in Latin American and Asian countries. 
</p>

<p><b> B. Target setting 
</b></p>
<p>28. National plans should set targets for progress in achieving access to water and 
sanitation, which provide the basis for accountability. Ultimately, international human 
rights law requires that States aim for universal coverage within time frames tailored to the 
country situation. Target setting must be undertaken with reference to an objective 
assessment of national priorities and resource constraints &#8211; going to the maximum of a 
State&#8217;s available resources. In this regard, some countries present notable examples. For 
instance, Sri Lanka aims for universal access to water and sanitation by 2020,23 while Nepal 
aims to achieve universal access to both by 2017.24 Such targets should utilize human rights 
criteria of availability, quality, acceptability, accessibility and affordability and provide 
specific definitions of each. 
</p>
<p>29. The ultimate goal of universal coverage should be broken down into more specific 
time-bound targets and benchmarks to be achieved in shorter time periods. A firm time 
frame for targets to be reached and activities required to achieve these targets are essential 
to determining concrete steps to be taken and to enabling people to hold the Government 
accountable for these targets. 
</p>
<p>30. The Economic Commission for Europe Protocol on Water and Health includes 
detailed provisions on target setting. It stipulates in article 6, paragraph 2, that States parties 
&#8220;shall each establish and publish national and/or local targets for the standards and levels of 
performance that need to be achieved or maintained for a high level of protection against 
water-related disease&#8221; covering different parameters, including water quality, levels of 
performance, and the occurrence and quality of discharges. States that have set detailed 
targets tailored to their country situation include the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, 
Slovakia, and Switzerland.25 
</p>
<p>31. Progressive realization also implies that States must move beyond minimum 
standards towards gradually achieving higher levels of service. States must balance short-, 
medium- and long-term measures to ensure sustainable service provision at a universal 
level, while giving priority to realizing a basic level of service for everyone before 
improving service levels for those already served. The Nepalese National Water Plan 
mentioned above is a good example, as it aims at universal access to basic service levels by 
2017, and then seeks to improve these service levels to medium or high standards by 
2027.26 
</p>
<p>32. Targets must be ambitious, but realistic. In some cases, targets are based on trends in 
access. For instance, one might examine the percentage of the population that gained access 
in the past decade, and then set a target which mirrors this rate of access. However, this 
approach does not take into account the maximum of available resources and may therefore 
be too low from a human rights perspective, especially in the context of historic 
underfunding of the water and sanitation sectors. Target setting is not just a technical or 
bureaucratic matter, but a political process relating to the decision of whether resources to 
the sectors must be increased to meet human rights standards. In other instances, targets 
have been set that are too high and thus unrealistic. Institutions will not be accountable if 
targets set are manifestly unachievable, thus taking on an aspirational nature. Targets must

<p>therefore be based on a realistic assessment of resources and capacity. It is essential to 
predict the costs of the requirements to meet a given target, that is, to calculate the 
necessary expenditures as well as anticipate the revenue realistically. Moreover, planners 
not only should consider the availability of actual and potential financial resources, but they 
should also develop plans to ensure that there is capacity to absorb these resources and 
ensure proper expenditure. 
</p>
<p>33. The Brazilian experience in scenario-building provides an interesting example of a 
method that can be used, inter alia, to set targets. It relies on a broad-based participatory 
process as well as consultation with technical specialists. The stakeholders and experts are 
asked to estimate what targets would be realistic to achieve in a given time frame (until 
2030), first based on existing trends regarding a number of indicators, but also adjusted to 
an increase in the budget. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Formulation and implementation of appropriate measures  
</b></p>
<p>34. States would then need to formulate and design the necessary measures to calculate 
what actions are required to meet these targets in terms of financial, human, institutional 
and other resources. Human rights law does not prescribe the specific measures that States 
should take, but provides a framework for formulation and implementation. It stipulates the 
goals to reach and issues to be considered to ensure that service provision meets human 
rights standards, while the specific and most appropriate measures depend on the 
circumstances in each particular State.  
</p>
<p>35. States must ultimately ensure that all people under their jurisdiction have access to 
sufficient, safe, acceptable and affordable water and sanitation services. While a water and 
sanitation strategy may adopt the overall framework, plans should be action oriented and 
list the measures to be adopted as specifically as possible. For instance, with regard to the 
affordability of service provision, States must, among other measures, design a tariff 
structure that considers the needs of all people, including those in poverty; designate an 
institution responsible for setting tariffs, regulating service providers and monitoring 
affordability; adopt supplementary social policies if necessary; consider operation and 
maintenance as well as connection costs in the case of networked supply, but also 
individual contributions for other forms of services; and set standards and safeguards for 
disconnections due to non-payment. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Monitoring and evaluation 
</b></p>
<p>36. From the outset, strategies and plans must include built-in arrangements for 
monitoring and evaluation. States must monitor whether the envisaged steps and activities 
have been taken and to what extent human rights have been integrated. They must assess 
progress and identify shortcomings and remaining challenges. Periodic reports on progress 
on the implementation of the plan are one way to enable monitoring. Based on the 
evaluation of the steps taken, subsequent changes and corrections to the plan should be 
undertaken. 
</p>
<p>37. States should monitor whether the set targets have been reached within the 
envisaged time frame. To enable monitoring of the realization of the rights to water and to 
sanitation, States should develop relevant indicators, taking into account human rights 
criteria. These indicators can relate, for example, to reduction of the time spent in collecting 
water, improvement of water quality and increases in the percentage of treatment of 
wastewater. Such indicators should be designed not only to measure the outcome in terms 
of access, but also to capture the progress made and Government efforts. Moreover, data </p>


<p>must be disaggregated according to prohibited grounds of discrimination to capture whether 
the specific targets set for marginalized and vulnerable populations have been reached.  
</p>
<p>38. Monitoring must be carried out by State institutions, but external actors should be 
able to examine critically public monitoring processes, reports and data sets, which requires 
full transparency regarding these processes. Civil society organizations and communities 
themselves should be involved in monitoring and evaluation activities related to their water 
and sanitation services. In some countries, such as Argentina and Portugal, regulatory 
institutions play a significant role in monitoring service provision, while in others, such as 
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, national human rights institutions have developed extensive 
monitoring programmes regarding the realization of the right to water. Slum Dwellers 
International encourages data collection by local communities in order to ensure that data is 
accurate and relevant to the community.27 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Success factors 
</b></p>
<p>39. The success of planning is as much about the process of the development of the plan 
as about the actual plan and the activities that flow from it. Successful planning includes a 
number of factors explored below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Sound legal frameworks based on human rights and access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>40. Water and sanitation strategies and plans must be anchored in a strong legal 
framework. First, this requires a review of existing legislation to detect gaps and to assess 
whether it is in line with the full enjoyment of the rights to water and to sanitation. This 
relates to the legal framework for water and sanitation specifically, but also to legislation 
that may have an indirect impact on it, such as criminal, child protection, urban planning or 
inheritance laws. Where legislation is inconsistent, it must be repealed, amended or 
adapted. Laws and regulations should include clear standards for service delivery covering 
the normative content of the rights, so as to provide the basis for accountability by allowing 
people to base claims on legally binding entitlements. For instance, South African 
regulations provide very clear standards for basic water supply, referring to a minimum 
quantity of 25 litres per person per day, at a minimum flow rate of not less than 10 litres per 
minute, within 200 metres of a household.28  
</p>
<p>41. Moreover, legislation must prohibit discrimination and should provide for 
participatory processes. Water and sanitation laws should also clearly designate institutional 
roles and responsibilities. Water and sanitation should be claimable human rights, ensuring 
access to justice and other accountability mechanisms. Access to justice requires not only 
the existence of courts and a legal system, but also awareness of the law and rights and 
opportunities to claim them. Measures must be put in place to overcome obstacles in access 
to justice such as prohibitive costs, language requirements, needs of representation and 
geographic location of the courts, as well as legal aid.

<p><b> B. Strong institutions and clear designation of responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p>42. The success of planning largely depends on the institutions and actors involved. 
Strong institutions will support the political vision of the plan and its implementation. 
</p>
<p>43. Responsibilities in the water and sanitation sectors are often horizontally fragmented 
among different ministries and departments and vertically fragmented between the 
national/central and local levels. This reality makes coordination between different sectors, 
such as health, education, agriculture and social welfare, and at different levels of 
Government, including municipalities and regions, essential. The roles and responsibilities 
of these different institutions should be defined clearly in planning and all of these 
stakeholders should be involved in the process of elaborating and implementing the plan. 
Where local governments are responsible for delivering services, it is essential that they are 
involved in planning from the beginning. Moreover, civil society must also be involved in 
the planning process, as should the private sector where relevant. Finally, while donors and 
international organizations will often take part, it must be ensured that the process is 
country-driven. To gain authority and legitimacy, the plan should be endorsed at the highest 
political level. 
</p>
<p>44. In Kenya, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation has been implementing reforms in the 
sector since 2004 based on the new Water Act of 2002, with the support of the German 
Agency for Technical Cooperation (now known as the German Agency for International 
Cooperation). The Ministry retains responsibility for policy formulation and sector 
coordination. It has delegated regulation, pro-poor financing, investment planning and 
development, and service provision to the Water Services Regulatory Board, the Water 
Services Trust Fund, Water Services Boards and water service providers, respectively. This 
institutional set-up is explicitly laid out in the Water Act and the clear designation of roles 
and responsibilities across the national, regional and local level provides the basis for 
accountable institutions.29 
</p>
<p>45. Corruption in the water and sanitation sectors seriously undermines the functioning 
of institutions. Often, the most affected are people living in poverty - corruption perpetuates 
poverty by reducing efficiency, and undermines the rule of law and democracy. It can occur 
at all levels, regardless of whether services are managed by public or private providers.30 
There are valuable measures that Governments can undertake to prevent corruption. For 
instance, the Integrity Pact developed by Transparency International is a tool aimed to help 
Governments, private companies and civil society prevent corruption in public 
contracting.31    
</p>
<p><b> 1. Coordination to overcome fragmentation 
</b></p>
<p>46. To start planning for the implementation of the rights to water and to sanitation, 
Governments need to identify and designate the responsible ministry or ministries and 
department(s). Often, a range of institutions are responsible for different aspects, including 
the departments of health, infrastructure, environment, education, agriculture and water

<p>resources. Moreover, different entities may be involved in the regulation of the water and 
sanitation sectors. For instance, regulating water quality may rest with the department of 
health or environment, while responsibility for regulation of tariffs may lie elsewhere. Yet 
another ministry might be responsible for implementing social policies necessary to ensure 
affordability for certain parts of the population. The plan should therefore clearly allocate 
responsibilities and spell out which actor is to undertake which activity as well as provide 
for coordination among ministries. Apart from the relevant line ministries, strengthening 
cooperation with planning and finance ministries is crucial. The experience of the 
Sanitation and Water for All initiative has shown that the involvement of finance ministers 
makes a significant difference in ensuring adequate budgetary support to realizing the rights 
to water and to sanitation. For instance, in Chad, the initiative helped to bring together the 
Ministers of Finance and Water. Their discussions on the need for a sound sanitation 
strategy resulted in the disaggregation of the previously consolidated budget line for water 
and sanitation in order to better track investments in sanitation.32 
</p>
<p>47. To ensure coordination, Governments may wish to appoint a focal point or create a 
steering committee or task force. The Colombo Declaration, adopted at the fourth South 
Asian Conference on Sanitation in April 2011, explicitly calls on countries &#8220;to establish 
<b>one national body </b>with responsibility for coordinating sanitation and hygiene, involving 
all stakeholders including, but not limited to, those responsible for finance, health, public 
health, environment, water, education, gender and local government at national, subnational 
and local levels&#8221;.33 Such a coordination body needs backing from the highest political level 
as well as a clear mandate. To avoid a disjuncture between the different phases of planning, 
it is essential that the same institutions are involved throughout the entire planning cycle.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Decentralization and the role of local authorities 
</b></p>
<p>48. In many States, service provision is decentralized and rests with the local authorities. 
This does not in any way reduce the State&#8217;s human rights obligations. As part of the State, 
local governments themselves are bound by human rights law. At the same time, minimum 
standards based on human rights criteria must be set at the national level in order to ensure 
coherence and countrywide compliance with human rights. States must ensure that local 
authorities have the necessary financial, human and other resources to effectively discharge 
their duties.34 The national Government has the obligation to regulate the activities of local 
governments, to monitor and control their performance in order to ensure that they comply 
with international human rights obligations.35 Clear lines of responsibility of the different 
levels of government are crucial to avoid confusion, gaps and inefficiency.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Involvement of non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>49. Often, a range of actors is involved in actual service delivery. While, in many 
instances, municipalities act as service providers, they may also delegate service provision 
to non-State actors, including companies and non-governmental organizations. In yet other 
instances, informal service provision prevails, with a range of different actors involved who 
fill a gap, but have not been formally mandated by the State authorities to provide services. 
Moreover, there is a great variety in the types of services provided, ranging from networked

<p>supply to small-scale sanitation solutions. These different set-ups have significant 
implications for planning and change the nature of activities to be designated to the 
different actors involved.  
</p>
<p>50. States must ensure that the involvement of non-State actors does not result in human 
rights violations. They need to regulate service providers to ensure that they carry out their 
activities in line with human rights standards and principles. Thus, when service provision 
is delegated, the role of the State shifts to that of a regulator, without prejudice to the equal 
significance of regulation in the case of public service provision. The State must create the 
enabling environment, outline which actors are responsible for service provision in which 
area, plan for its role as regulator and foresee the necessary resources for regulatory 
measures.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. The role of donors and development partners 
</b></p>
<p>51. Any national strategy and plan must be owned by the country. Processes that are 
entirely externally driven can circumvent democratic procedures and often result in merely 
cosmetic strategies and plans, which are not sustainable and often do not correspond to the 
people&#8217;s needs and aspirations. There is, however, a significant role for donors and 
development partners in the planning process. For instance, they can facilitate coordination 
and support capacity-building and institutional strengthening, including at the local level. 
These measures will help institutions to fulfil their responsibilities and to be accountable to 
the population.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Ensuring adequate financing 
</b></p>
<p>52. Successful planning and its implementation depend on adequate and predictable 
financing. Without the necessary financial resources, planning and target setting is 
meaningless. The relationship between the plan and the budget is therefore of enormous 
significance. States should determine the budgetary implications of the foreseen activities 
and allocate sufficient financial and human resources to implement them. Adequate 
financing relates not only to service provision, but also to the costs of regulatory measures, 
strengthening institutional capacity as well as the planning exercise itself. Adequate 
financing and capacity-building is particularly pertinent for local authorities in the context 
of decentralization. Ensuring resources for the local level can include allocations from the 
central Government, as well as support for the revenue-raising authority of local authorities.  
</p>
<p>53. The work of the institutions involved, at all levels, and the coordination body should 
be adequately staffed both in terms of numbers and expertise. Likewise, resources should 
be available to carry out participatory processes and to adopt measures to ensure 
transparency. 
</p>
<p>54. In the end, the financing system must be one that enables plans and strategies to be 
implemented, with States using the maximum of available resources for the realization of 
the rights to water and to sanitation, including in times of economic crisis. Adequate 
financing must ensure that water and sanitation systems are sustainable, and that services 
are affordable to everyone. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Overview on financing in the sectors 
</b></p>
<p>55. Financing in the water and sanitation sectors is very complex; determining whether 
it is adequate requires a full picture of the different sources. Broadly speaking, the revenue 
can consist of &#8220;tariffs, taxes and transfers&#8221;. On the expenditure side, it is essential to look at 
capital investments as well as operation and maintenance. Revenues and expenditures are </p>


<p>split between the national and local levels of Government, depending on the designation of 
revenue-raising authority and responsibilities for implementation. 
</p>
<p>56. Tariffs make up an important component in financing water and sanitation services. 
However, other individual contributions must also be considered. As far as piped water and 
sewerage systems are concerned, connection fees are common, and when relying on other 
forms of sanitation, such as pit latrines, the hardware as well as operation and maintenance 
- such as pit-emptying and disposal of faecal sludge - are commonly paid for by the users. 
</p>
<p>57. The human rights framework makes the extent to which revenue may be raised from 
tariffs dependent on what is affordable for the users. Subsidies play a crucial role in 
ensuring affordability when needed. Income support measures are one type of subsidy 
related to welfare systems and social assistance programmes. Some countries, such as 
Chile, use such general subsidies that operate on a means-testing basis. Tariff adjustment 
measures such as cross-subsidies can be incorporated into the tariff structure to lower the 
tariffs paid by low-income households for water or sewerage service provision, but only 
function if there is a sufficient number of better-off and paying households.  
</p>
<p>58. To gain a complete and reliable understanding of available financing, budget 
projections need to include anticipated revenue received from water tariffs and other 
charges for water and sanitation services. If revenue from tariffs does not cover all related 
costs, funds will need to come out of the general budgets at the national, subnational and/or 
local levels. General revenue is relevant both for capital investments and for subsidies that 
are not contained within the tariff system.  
</p>
<p>59. Often budgets are allocated along administrative lines corresponding to different 
ministries and departments. Due to the fragmented nature of responsibilities for water and 
sanitation, it is difficult to obtain a complete picture of resources for the sectors when these 
are combined with other budgets such as health. Moreover, in particular for rural sanitation, 
&#8220;off-budget&#8221; allocations are very common.36  
</p>
<p>60. A functional classification of the national budget would help to overcome some 
challenges. Such a classification would include all budgeting items that are going into the 
water and sanitation sectors across the different ministries and departments. In Nepal, civil 
society advocacy has been successful in securing a separate budget line for sanitation.37 A 
consolidated budget goes a step further by bringing in items that are not part of the central 
operating budget, such as the budget of separate, self-sustaining entities, for instance the 
regulatory authorities in some countries; budgets of subnational governments; and donor 
contributions, and thus provides a complete picture.  
</p>
<p>61. The same classification and comprehensiveness would be necessary for the local 
budget. This will often include transfers from the national to the local level. These transfers 
can take the form of conditional grants or block grants. Conditional grants are to be spent 
for specific purposes (for example water infrastructure), whereas block (or unconditional) 
grants are not intended to be used for a specific sector or project, but local government may 
decide to spend it on water and sanitation. Such transfers from the national to the local level 
should take account of regional disparities in terms of resources. If the national 
Government adopts a system of transfers, in accordance with human rights criteria it must 
ensure non-discriminatory distribution, including making additional resources available to 
regions with disadvantaged populations. Without such specific attention, Government 
transfers might widen regional differences and perpetuate discrimination. Furthermore, it is 
</p>
<p>  
 36 UN-Water and WHO, <i>GLAAS</i> <i>2010</i> (note 9 above), p. 43. 
 37 WaterAid, <i>Budget Advocacy for the Water and Sanitation Sector in Nepal: A Primer for Civil Society 
</i></p>
<p><i>Organizations</i> (2010), p. 37. </p>


<p>also crucial to ensure that such transfers are well targeted and used at the local level to 
support access to water and sanitation by those who are the most disadvantaged and 
neglected, with no access to services, rather than only improving service for those already 
connected. However, criteria for targeting funds have not yet been developed in many 
countries, and if they exist they are not necessarily applied consistently. Some countries, 
such as Cambodia and Mongolia, present notable exceptions, in particular in relation to 
urban water supply.38 In the United States of America, the Rural Development agency run 
by the Rural Development agency of the Department of Agriculture makes loans and grants 
to small municipalities. Consideration is given to the maximum amount that a community 
can afford while maintaining reasonable user fees in determining the appropriate mix 
between loans and grants.39 
</p>
<p>62. Finally, international assistance often contributes to financing with external transfers. 
Donor policies must integrate the human rights to water and to sanitation and support national 
priorities regarding water and sanitation, as well as targets to reduce disparities in access. For 
instance, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation has prioritized 
water and sanitation, launching a Water and Sanitation Fund of one billion Euros in 
2009, with the specific purpose of contributing to the realization of the human right to water 
and improving policies and planning processes.40 Generally, international assistance 
contributes to financing at the national level (which can then be transferred to the local level), 
but in some countries local governments are also authorized to receive international grants 
and loans directly. While this may open up new opportunities, it may also reinforce the risk of 
disparity between municipalities.41 It also increases the need for capacity-strengthening at the 
local level in dealing with public and private funding institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Allocation to the maximum of available resources 
</b></p>
<p>63. Strategies and plans must be developed taking into account the overall expenditure 
framework, since planning will not achieve its stated goals if it is not situated within the 
context of available resources. The projected costs of planned activities must be 
determined. In deciding on the appropriate measures, policymakers, with the participation 
of all concerned stakeholders and communities, should consider innovative approaches and 
solutions that can bring the envisaged results, while being less expensive than conventional 
approaches and technologies. For instance, Community-led Total Sanitation has achieved 
impressive results in increasing access to sanitation as a low-cost solution.42 
</p>
<p>64. Determining the costs of service provision should cover not only capital 
expenditures for infrastructure, but also costs associated with the life cycle of the system, 
including operation and maintenance, labour and managerial costs. Additionally, 
expenditure for on-site sanitation should be taken into account, but as it occurs mostly at 
the household level, it is difficult to quantify. UNDP is undertaking interesting work on 
costing, such as its development of the Millennium Development Goals needs assessment 
model. This model, which integrates the rights to water and to sanitation, provides a 
framework for national Governments to assess the costs of reaching the water and 
sanitation targets over the period to 2015.

<p>65. The obligation to fulfil economic, social and cultural rights requires taking steps to 
the maximum of available resources. There has been much recent scholarship and a number 
of tools have been developed on assessing whether States are deploying the maximum of 
available resources towards guaranteeing human rights. One approach is to compare current 
budget allocations to past efforts to evaluate whether efforts have progressed, stagnated or 
regressed. A decrease would prima facie raise concerns. If past allocations to the sectors are 
evidently insufficient, a slight incremental increase based on yearly adjustments may not be 
sufficient, and a reallocation of funds would need to be considered. Another approach is a 
comparison between similarly situated countries. Such tools are not meant to provide 
definite answers on the use of maximum available resources, but can be used to prompt 
further inquiries. A decrease in the budget could be justified, for instance, when resources 
are used more efficiently and allocated to the most vulnerable and marginalized, or when 
economic conditions change, as long as the decrease is based on the most careful 
consideration and can be justified by reference to the totality of rights.  
</p>
<p>66. Budget allocations should be made based on the projected costs of envisaged 
activities that go to the maximum of what is attainable with the given resources, to realize 
the plan. Necessary resources must be allocated to the appropriate authorities that are 
intended to carry out the activities, for instance when delegated to the local level. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Expenditure tracking 
</b></p>
<p>67. Apart from assessing budget allocations from a human rights perspective, it is also 
essential to track expenditures, that is, determine whether the allocated budget has been 
utilized. If the projected budget has not been spent, this can indicate capacity problems. 
Such under-expenditure could be justified, though, with efficiency gains, that is, when the 
envisaged results have been achieved with fewer resources. Likewise, it will be important 
to track whether the resources have been spent in line with the priorities identified in the 
plan, and where this is not the case, to ascertain the reasons. These could relate to lack of 
capacity to spend resources, corrupt practices or other explanations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Participation and transparency 
</b></p>
<p>68. Any plan for the realization of the rights to water and to sanitation must be 
developed through a participatory and transparent process. Systematic participation is 
crucial in every phase of the planning cycle, from diagnosis through target setting and the 
formulation of responses and implementation to monitoring and evaluation. Sanitation, in 
particular, cannot just be delivered, but requires behavioural change, which can be achieved 
only through the active involvement of interested beneficiaries. Opportunities for 
participation, including community needs assessments, must be established as early as 
possible.  
</p>
<p>69. Participation must be active, free and meaningful. It must go beyond mere 
information-sharing and superficial consultation, and involve people in decision-making, 
providing real opportunities to influence the planning process. The organization of a truly 
participatory process is challenging. Different mechanisms and approaches will be required, 
including consultations with various stakeholders, public meetings and hearings as well as 
the opportunity to submit written comments and feedback.  
</p>
<p>70. Groups that should have opportunities to participate include civil society 
organizations, community-based organizations, national human rights institutions, 
academia and research institutions, the private sector and above all the communities and 
people concerned themselves, with a special emphasis on women&#8217;s input. Disadvantaged 
and at-risk people and communities must be represented, to ensure that participation is not 
only for a few well-established non-governmental organizations or local elites. Meetings </p>


<p>should reach out to people at all levels of society, taking into account constraints that might 
prevent them from attending. This would mean organizing meetings close to where people 
live, or work, in all regions of the country, organizing meetings during hours when people 
are available, using local languages, organizing parent- and child-friendly meetings, using 
organizations of which people are already members as platforms for undertaking such 
meetings and other measures, among other channels. The National Human Development 
Initiative launched in Morocco in 2005 provides an example of a participatory, bottom-up 
and integrated approach. It resulted in the formal and real involvement of communities, 
civil society at the local level, and the integration of all local political, economic and social 
agents in a single process.43 
</p>
<p>71. Certain parts of the planning process will require technical expertise. However, these 
inputs must be balanced with the needs and preferences of people across the country, taking 
into account local solutions. The authorities leading the planning process must be 
accountable for seriously considering the various contributions and designing and 
implementing the necessary measures conducive to ensuring the rights to water and to 
sanitation for everyone.  
</p>
<p>72. Transparency and access to information are essential for enabling participation. 
Relevant information and drafts of the plan should be made publicly available. 
Transparency is also needed regarding existing policies and measures. Only when, for 
instance, current priorities in the allocation of resources are understood can these be 
scrutinized and assessed for eventual necessary changes. Information should be widely 
disseminated and made available in all relevant languages via multiple channels to ensure 
accessibility. This can include websites, but also local radio, billboards and information in 
the local press. In India, for instance, right to information legislation44 has had a significant 
impact on improving transparency by providing a tool to seek information and demand 
accountability from governments.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>73. Access to water and sanitation is characterized by great disparities, which often 
amount to discrimination prohibited by human rights law.45 To overcome existing 
discrimination, States must develop specific strategies to correct the situation of those who 
face that discrimination. Without this specific focus, interventions in water and sanitation 
tend to improve access only or primarily for those who are relatively easy to reach, and risk 
reinforcing existing inequalities. 
</p>
<p>74. The overall targets on increasing access to water and sanitation must therefore be 
complemented by targets to reduce inequalities. As a first step, this requires States to 
identify vulnerable and marginalized populations, patterns of discrimination, and their 
underlying structural causes. In terms of access to water and sanitation, groups and 
individuals who have been identified as potentially vulnerable or marginalized include, 
inter alia, women, children, inhabitants of rural and deprived urban areas and others living 
in poverty, nomadic and traveller communities, refugees, migrants, people belonging to

<p>discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights, para. 7. Discrimination can be understood as 
&#8220;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is directly or 
indirectly based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination and which has the intention or effect of 
nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing&#8221; of human rights. </p>


<p>ethnic or racial minorities, elderly people, indigenous groups, persons living with 
disabilities, people living in water-scarce regions and persons living with HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>75. Not all prohibited grounds of discrimination will be relevant in all States. In the 
process of identifying groups and individuals who are disadvantaged, States need to survey 
the population based on these grounds and investigate further when they find that certain 
groups are discriminated against. While, for instance, gender-based discrimination or 
disparities between formal and informal settlements will be a common issue in many 
countries, identifying and addressing other forms of discrimination will require a more 
contextualized approach. 
</p>
<p>76. For example, the planning process for the Rights-based Development Strategy 2006-
2013 of the Kiseljak municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed at the identification of 
development priorities in terms of human rights, and included an assessment of the water 
infrastructure in the municipality. As the assessment showed that the situation was most 
severe in the Hrastovi settlement, inhabited mostly by Roma, the municipality prioritized 
improving the infrastructure there.46 
</p>
<p>77. Based on their assessments, States must specifically monitor progress within the 
identified populations that are likely to be discriminated against in order to address 
systematic exclusion. They must develop tailored interventions for their specific 
circumstances, including potentially setting separate targets for these groups. Specific 
strategies to reach those most in need will be necessary to overcome legal, economic, 
physical, institutional, cultural, linguistic and other barriers. 
</p>
<p>78. The Zambian Devolution Trust Fund, for example, conducted a baseline study47 
collecting data on water and sanitation disaggregated by, among other things, urban and 
rural area and income level. Based on these findings, Zambia specifically targets low-
income areas through the promotion of low-cost technology, such as water kiosks with the 
tariffs set at the lowest band. Complementary to cross-subsidization through the tariff 
structure, the construction of infrastructure in urban low-income areas is financed through 
the Trust Fund.48  
</p>
<p>79. In their monitoring activities, States must specifically pay attention and report on the 
measures taken to reach the most disadvantaged and excluded. They must also include 
information on the programmes and resources specifically devoted to these purposes; that 
is, disaggregated data is not only necessary at the level of outcome, but likewise in 
measuring Government efforts, for instance, to determine whether resources have been 
increased to reach people living in slums. The Tanzania Water and Sanitation Network 
monitors equity in the sector through annually published equity reports focusing on the 
inclusion, accountability, participation and sustainability of policies. It found considerable 
equity fault lines in the water sector of the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, a gap 
between access in rural and urban areas and disproportionately high budgets for urban 
services.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations: how the human rights 
framework helps to improve planning 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Providing a framework for prioritization  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The full realization of human rights can require complex trade-offs that are 
even more difficult in situations of economic crisis. Having a plan or a vision guided 
by a human rights framework helps authorities to prioritize the realization of human 
rights above other considerations. Yet, a human rights framework provides no single 
answer on how to set priorities in a case where not all can be reached at the same time 
&#8211; for instance the distribution of resources between neglected remote rural areas and 
deprived urban slum areas. What human rights standards and principles call for is 
that such allocation decisions are not based solely on a cost-utility analysis, but are the 
result of a democratic, participatory and non-discriminatory process. In this regard: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States must mainstream the human rights to water and to sanitation into 
existing strategies in other fields in order to ensure coherent planning; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States must also develop specific strategies and plans for the water and 
sanitation sectors to ensure that these issues are accorded sufficient priority and that 
their specificities are taken into account; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Where strategies and/or plans for the water and sanitation sectors are 
already in place, States should re-examine these, and revise and align them with 
human rights standards and principles as necessary; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) States must first aim at basic access for everyone and then move 
progressively towards higher levels of service; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States must devise specific strategies to address discrimination and reach 
the most disadvantaged. They must identify vulnerable and marginalized populations, 
patterns of discrimination, and their underlying structural causes by, inter alia, 
collecting disaggregated data. They must set specific targets to reduce inequalities in 
access, develop tailored interventions for specific circumstances and specifically 
monitor progress for these groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Donor policies should support these national priorities, moving from 
basic access to higher levels of service and reducing disparities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Where transfers from the national to the local level are made, national 
Governments must adopt a system of transfers that ensures equitable distribution and 
makes additional resources available to regions with disadvantaged populations and 
prioritizes those without access. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Providing a framework for ambitious, but realistic planning 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Human rights law provides a framework for ambitious, but realistic planning. 
While the ultimate goal must be universal coverage, the notion of progressive 
realization tailors this goal to the country situation and allows for the time frame that 
proves to be realistic in a given context. States must go to the maximum of available 
resources in the realization of the rights to water and to sanitation, turning to 
international assistance where needed. Progressive realization also implies gradually 
higher levels of service. In line with this: </b></p>


<p><b>(a) States must base the development of a strategy and plan for the 
implementation of the rights to water and to sanitation on a robust situational analysis 
of the current status in the realization of these rights based on the normative criteria 
of availability, quality, acceptability, accessibility and affordability. They must pay 
particular attention to marginalized and vulnerable groups to determine their levels 
of access, specific barriers they may face in gaining access and the underlying reasons 
behind those barriers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States should also undertake an assessment of existing policies, 
programmes and activities, determine what resources are allocated, and identify the 
actors involved and assess their capacity;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States should set clear targets, in line with human rights standards, that 
are based on a realistic assessment of resources and capacity; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) States should formulate and design the necessary measures to meet the 
set targets;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States must ensure financing to the maximum of available resources for 
the implementation of the rights to water and to sanitation. Adequate financing must 
ensure that water and sanitation systems are sustainable, while services are affordable 
to everyone; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) States should determine the budgetary implications of the envisaged 
activities and allocate sufficient financial and human resources to implement those 
activities, including resources for regulatory activities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Ensuring sustainability  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The human rights framework requires a coherent and comprehensive 
approach to planning that emphasizes the underlying structural causes and systemic 
biases for the lack of access to water and sanitation. It requires considering how laws, 
social norms, traditional practices and institutional structures and actions affect 
access. As such, the human rights framework helps to not only cure the symptoms, 
that is, the lack of access, but aims at addressing the underlying reasons, leading to 
more sustainable results. In this regard: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should ensure the sustainability of investments by not only 
focusing on infrastructure, but also ensuring operation and maintenance, the 
institutional and managerial structure, including regulation, and structural measures, 
including increasing capacity; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Strategies and plans must be developed through a participatory and 
inclusive process ensuring, in particular, that disadvantaged, marginalized and 
vulnerable people and communities are represented. Participation must go beyond 
mere information sharing and superficial consultation, and provide real opportunities 
for influence throughout the planning process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States must ensure transparency throughout the planning process, 
making relevant information, including on existing policies and measures, and expert 
advice on available technical options, as well as drafts of the plan, publicly available in 
all relevant languages via multiple channels to ensure accessibility. </b></p>


<p><b> D. Emphasizing accountability 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The human rights framework puts a strong emphasis on accountability. Legal 
frameworks provide the basis for accountability by allowing people to base their 
claims on legally binding entitlements. These should be complemented by targets 
backed by relevant and reliable data and reflecting State commitment for which 
Governments can be held accountable. In this regard: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States must review existing legislation to detect gaps and to assess 
whether the existing legislative framework is in line with the rights to water and to 
sanitation. Where legislation is found to be inconsistent, it must be repealed, amended 
or adapted to meet human rights standards and principles;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Laws and regulations should provide clear definitions of standards for 
service delivery, covering the normative dimensions of availability, quality, 
acceptability, accessibility and affordability;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States should clearly identify and designate the ministry or ministries 
and department(s) responsible for the planning process and implementation, 
including a coordination body; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Where service provision is decentralized, the State must set minimum 
standards at the national level in order to ensure coherence and countrywide 
compliance with human rights. As part of the State, local authorities are also bound 
by human rights law. States must regulate the activities of local governments, and 
monitor and control their performance in order to ensure that they comply with 
international human rights obligations. Moreover, States must ensure that these 
authorities have the necessary financial, human and other resources to effectively 
discharge their responsibilities. Clear allocation of responsibilities between levels of 
government is crucial;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) International organizations and donor agencies should support strong 
national planning processes through initiatives, such as Sanitation and Water for All, 
that help to overcome capacity constraints, but should not drive the process. They 
should support the coordination process, capacity-building and institutional 
strengthening, including at the local level, to ensure that institutions can properly 
fulfil their responsibilities and are accountable to the population, including with 
regard to preventing and fighting corruption;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) States should build arrangements for monitoring and evaluation into the 
strategy and plan from the outset;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) To enable monitoring, States should develop indicators reflecting the 
human rights criteria of the availability, quality, acceptability, accessibility and 
affordability of water and sanitation. Such indicators should be designed not only to 
measure the outcome in terms of access figures, but also capture the progress made and 
Government efforts. States should make better use of existing data and, where lack of 
relevant and reliable data provides a constraint, States should strengthen their capacity; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States must put into place mechanisms and remedies to hold the relevant 
actors accountable for following the plan and achieving the targets it has set; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States must implement measures to overcome obstacles in access to 
justice, such as prohibitive costs, language requirements, requirements of 
representation and geographic location of the courts and other mechanisms. 
</b></p>
