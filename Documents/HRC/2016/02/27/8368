<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh session from 2 
to 13 May 2011. The review of Papua New Guinea was held at the 16th meeting on 11 May 
</p><p>2011. The delegation of Papua New Guinea was headed by Robert G. Aisi, Ambassador 
and Permanent Representative of Papua New Guinea at the United Nations. At its 17th 
meeting, held on 13 May 2011, the Working Group adopted the report of Papua New 
Guinea.  
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Papua New Guinea: Cameroon, Maldives and 
Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Papua New Guinea: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/PNG/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Ireland, Latvia, 
Norway, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland was transmitted to Papua New Guinea through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Papua New Guinea stated that its UPR report was part of its obligations under 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human Rights Council resolution 5/1. The report, 
it added, outlined the human rights situation in the country in a frank manner, described 
how the various human rights treaties to which it was party were being implemented, noted 
achievements and best practices, and highlighted challenges and constraints that Papua 
New Guinea faced. 
</p>
<p>6. Papua New Guinea then described the consultative process engaged in the 
preparation of the report. It was highlighted that an inter-agency committee had been 
formed, which included: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department 
of Community Development (co-Chairs), the Department of Justice and Attorney General, 
the Department of National Planning and Rural Development, the Department of Finance, 
the Department of Labour and Industrial Relations, the Ombudsman Commission, the 
Correctional Services, the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission, the Supreme 
Court, the University of Papua New Guinea and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>7. Papua New Guinea added that a smaller subgroup from the inter-agency committee, 
the National UPR Taskforce, had been tasked to compile inputs from stakeholders and 
prepare the UPR report.  </p>


<p>8. It was then highlighted that a rigorous consultation process had been undertaken 
with stakeholders throughout the country, which included: Government departments and 
agencies, non-governmental organizations, churches, civil society, academia, community 
leaders, youth representatives and other relevant stakeholders. The Taskforce had organized 
four regional consultations, which had engaged stakeholders at the provincial, district and 
local levels. The consultation undertaken had been open, transparent and inclusive. 
</p>
<p>9. Papua New Guinea declared that, like other countries, it was faced with human 
rights issues and challenges. It considered that most of those challenges could be attributed, 
inter alia, to the country&#8217;s current stage of development; cultural diversity, which although 
not an excuse was a very distinct feature of the country; lack of basic health-care, education 
and other services; and inaccessibility to government services. 
</p>
<p>10. Papua New Guinea stated further that while it agreed that Governments must take 
ownership and provide leadership in addressing human rights issues, one of the most 
effective ways to accomplish that was to work with the United Nations, the donor 
community, the private sector and civil society stakeholders  
</p>
<p>11. Papua New Guinea then explained that it considered the UPR process and the 
presentation of its report to the Human Rights Council as part of its efforts to garner the 
collective support of the international community to address human rights issues in the 
country. It added that the recent visit of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment signalled the country&#8217;s willingness to be 
open and frank in dealing with the challenges it faced. 
</p>
<p>12. Papua New Guinea affirmed that its National Constitution accorded all persons 
living in the country the basic rights and freedoms espoused by the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. It noted that the country had ratified most United Nations human rights 
conventions. It explained that the delay in ratification of certain instruments should be 
attributed to the country&#8217;s lack of resources and capacity constraints. 
</p>
<p>13. It was added that the country had put in place the necessary laws and institutional 
mechanisms to address human rights issues, but that it was experiencing an increase in 
human rights challenges, such as sorcery-related killings and the use of affordable mobile 
telephones services and access to Internet to commit human rights violations. Papua New 
Guinea recognized the need to review existing laws to address those fast-evolving 
phenomena. 
</p>
<p>14. It was then highlighted that the country had put in place relevant laws to deal with 
issues such as domestic and sexual violence and child and youth protection. Relevant 
institutions were being set up to address human rights issues and complement ongoing 
work. The ongoing process to establish a national human rights commission was given as 
an example and it was affirmed that, with all aspects of structure, finance and other aspects 
resolved, the commission should begin to operate in 2012. 
</p>
<p>15. It was stated, moreover, that other critical challenges to be addressed included 
improvements in correctional services and rehabilitation, the empowerment of women in 
politics and business, gender equality, lack of an appropriate legal framework, lack of 
capacity, access to legal and justice services, lack of basic services, health- and education-
related issues, infrastructural developments, HIV/AIDS, climate change and cultural 
diversity. 
</p>
<p>16. Papua New Guinea stated further that the current economic situation would change 
significantly due to the development of the multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas project 
in the country. Aided by that important economic project, the country would experience 
unprecedented economic growth and development and, by 2020, the projected gross 
domestic product would be about US$ 24 billion. </p>


<p>17. Papua New Guinea added that the greatest challenge would be the translation of that 
economic growth into tangible benefits to address the development challenges facing the 
country, such as the improvement of vital infrastructure networks, the provision of basic 
education and health services and the improvement of the standard of living for the 
majority of the population.  
</p>
<p>18. It was acknowledged that socio-economic development had not been impressive, as 
demonstrated by the high illiteracy rate, the lack of basic education, health services and 
infrastructure, and increased lawlessness. Additionally, the country was far behind in its 
human development indicators, ranking 145th of 177 countries (in the human development 
index published in 2008). The scenario posed significant challenges to the country&#8217;s ability 
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 
</p>
<p>19. Papua New Guinea stated that, in its efforts to address those and other challenges, it 
had undertaken important initiatives such as, among others, the establishment of the Papua 
New Guinea human rights commission, the establishment of the Law and Justice Sector 
Program, the National Land Development Program and the National Policy on Disability. It 
was added that those important initiatives required support and assistance through 
partnerships with the international community.  
</p>
<p>20. Finally, the delegation of Papua New Guinea declared that it was prepared to engage 
in frank and open discussions on the human rights situation in the country. The hope was 
expressed that, through the interactive dialogue, constructive ideas could be discussed on 
how to address human rights challenges facing the country.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 36 delegations made statements. The delegation of 
Papua New Guinea was thanked for its frank presentation of the report, for its responses to 
questions and for the country&#8217;s constructive engagement in the universal periodic review 
process. Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the 
present report.  
</p>
<p>22.<b> </b>Australia commended Papua New Guinea for its efforts to strengthen the rule of law 
and justice institutions and for its progress towards attaining greater gender equality in the 
justice system and access to justice. It noted the success of the &#8220;Let&#8217;s Look Out for 
Moresby&#8221; programme and encouraged Papua New Guinea to address the concerns of the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture following his visit. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23<b>. </b>Switzerland praised the efforts of Papua New Guinea to bridge certain legislative 
gaps in the field of human rights protection and encouraged it to continue those initiatives. 
It expressed concern over the situation of women and the excessive use of force by security 
forces, notably cases of torture. It highlighted that the last execution had taken place in 
1954. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24.<b> </b>Indonesia fully supported the efforts of Papua New Guinea to raise the standard of 
living of its population. It encouraged the Government to ensure that the stipulations of the 
conventions to which Papua New Guinea was a party were fully incorporated into domestic 
law. Indonesia encouraged the country&#8217;s efforts to ensure that women and girls who were 
victims of violence had access to immediate and effective means of redress and protection. 
Indonesia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25.<b> </b>Nicaragua welcomed the transparency of Papua New Guinea in preparing the 
national report. It noted the long-term vision of plans and policies for development and 
poverty alleviation, particularly regarding the participation of women and the reintegration 
of detainees into society. It invited Papua New Guinea to take advantage of the </p>


<p>contributions made during the UPR to facilitate its National Strategic Plan &#8211; Papua New 
Guinea Vision 2050. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>26.<b> </b>Algeria noted that Papua New Guinea was a young country, emerging from the long 
and complex night of colonialism and, like Algeria, had the moral duty to be constantly 
engaged in decolonization. It noted that despite the country&#8217;s natural resource wealth, 
guaranteeing economic and social rights continued to be a challenge, notably the rights to 
food, to health, to housing and to access to drinking water and sanitation. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27.<b> </b>Slovenia welcomed the adoption of the equality and participation bill, the Sexual 
Offences and Crimes against Children Act, and the launch of the National Policy on 
Disability. It was concerned at the persistence of domestic violence and gender 
discrimination, and at reports of abuse of power by the police. Slovenia regretted delays in 
ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities and that education was neither free nor 
compulsory. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28.<b> </b>The Czech Republic noted with concern that only a small percentage of the 
population was registered at birth, which might negatively impact on the legal status of 
women. It was also concerned at the torture and systematic beatings of detainees upon 
arrest, or within the first hours of detention, and at the fact that those who attempted to 
escape from prisons were often tortured and disabled upon recapture. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29.<b> </b>Malaysia commended Papua New Guinea for its commitment to socio-economic 
development, as demonstrated by its Vision 2050 plan. It shared the view that progress in 
poverty eradication, infrastructure development, economic growth and human resource 
development contributed to the fulfilment of human rights. It noted challenges regarding 
unemployment, violence against women and girls, HIV/AIDS, the administration of justice 
and the rule of law. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30.<b> </b>Slovakia welcomed the inclusion of new offences, such as marital rape, in the 
Criminal Code. It acknowledged the challenges faced by Papua New Guinea due to 
environmental threats resulting from climate change and natural disasters. It noted that, in 
2010, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women had called on 
Papua New Guinea to strengthen its efforts to provide a discrimination- and violence-free 
educational environment. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31.<b> </b>Brazil regretted that the national report of Papua New Guinea had been submitted 
late and asked that information be provided about the difficulties encountered in its 
preparation. It commended the revision of criminal legislation on rape and greater 
protection for women. It noted a need for further efforts to combat the abuse and 
discrimination of women. It recognized the country&#8217;s initiatives towards a national 
education policy and expressed concern over violence against children and child 
prostitution. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32.<b> </b>Germany asked how the Government ensured the application of the 2003 law to 
protect persons affected by HIV/AIDS from discrimination. It noted that the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture had indicated that police beatings often reached the 
level of torture as defined in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Germany also noted that the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women had expressed concern at reports of brutal 
torture and killings of women and girls, especially elderly women, accused of witchcraft. 
Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33.<b> </b>Thailand welcomed the steps taken towards the establishment of a national human 
rights institution, noting that once established, the institution could join the Asia Pacific </p>


<p>Forum of National Human Rights Institutions. It was concerned that poverty, and certain 
traditional values and cultures, placed women and children in vulnerable positions. It noted 
a need to ensure that the local village system of court justice met international human rights 
standards. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34.<b> </b>China noted that Papua New Guinea actively promoted women&#8217;s participation in the 
decision-making process and protected children&#8217;s rights. It commended the country&#8217;s 
efforts to improve medical and health services, to reduce infant and maternal mortality and 
to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. China called on the international community to provide 
Papua New Guinea with the necessary assistance. China made a recommendation.   
</p>
<p>35.<b> </b>Maldives stated that it was important that the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review understand that Papua New Guinea, like Maldives, faced enormous 
challenges because of its size, geography and capacity constraints. Noting that the projected 
gross domestic product of Papua New Guinea would nearly double by 2020, it stated that 
business projects should be people-centred, and executed with respect for human rights and 
caution because of their environmental risk. Such projects, in the opinion of Maldives, had 
the potential to further enhance the promotion of human rights. Maldives made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36.<b> </b>Papua New Guinea highlighted that the country understood that the question of 
awareness was an issue that had to be addressed, and which had emerged in the regional 
consultations undertaken in the preparation of the national report.  
</p>
<p>37. Regarding questions raised concerning law enforcement agencies, it was explained 
that the issue had been raised many times and that a policy was currently being examined 
that would hold perpetrators responsible. It was added that those were discussions that 
needed to be undertaken. Moreover, a need for training and awareness programmes within 
the various law enforcement agencies existed. Papua New Guinea added that the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture had been instructive, and the 
recommendations made were being reviewed.  
</p>
<p>38. In response to comments and recommendations made during the interactive 
dialogue, with respect to questions raised regarding the death penalty, it was pointed out 
that the death penalty was currently a part of the country&#8217;s laws and that only at such a time 
when Parliament repealed or amended the law would that law cease to be applicable. Courts 
had invoked the death penalty in some cases. However, in all of those cases, the penalty had 
been commuted to a life sentence through an appeal to the Supreme Court. It was explained 
that it would, therefore, be slightly erroneous to state that a moratorium existed, if such a 
statement was taken to imply that the death penalty had not been invoked. Nevertheless, 
there had been much debate on the issue and that was a discussion that had to be undertaken 
within the communities. 
</p>
<p>39. As for birth registration, it was clarified that the Department of Community 
Development had undertaken a role in addressing the issue. In that regard, it was stated that 
once again there was a need for greater awareness on the part of parents and communities 
to take the necessary steps to register births. 
</p>
<p>40. Regarding domestic violence, Papua New Guinea stated that the issue had been 
addressed, and underscored that such acts were criminal offences. It further stated that 
domestic violence was another matter that required the awareness of law enforcement 
agencies to ensure that those adequately treated the issue as a crime.  
</p>
<p>41. Papua New Guinea added that the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was being seriously considered and that consultations 
had already taken place. </p>


<p>42. Papua New Guinea then provided information on action taken regarding HIV/AIDS, 
explaining that the stigmatization of persons with the disease had been criminalized nearly 
a decade ago. It was added that in recent times there had been a slight drop in the rates of 
HIV/AIDS as a result of awareness-raising and the provision of antiretroviral medication to 
persons with HIV. 
</p>
<p>43. On sorcery, Papua New Guinea acknowledged that it had been a major issue but 
reiterated that the country&#8217;s great diversity was a challenge and called on the international 
community to assist the country to address that reality. It recalled that the legislation 
concerning the matter was currently under review, and provided details of the process, 
which was being conducted by the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission.  
</p>
<p>44. Regarding questions on education, it was highlighted that the issue was also being 
addressed and that the economic projects described should have a positive impact in that 
area. It was explained that one of the issues that should be kept in mind was that 400 of the 
800 languages that existed in the country were used in the elementary schools. 
</p>
<p>45.<b> </b>Morocco welcomed the ambitious vision of the Government for the country&#8217;s 
development over a period of 40 years. It asked for more information on the project, 
notably the necessary budget, as well as on possible assistance that could be accorded from 
the international community. Morocco reiterated its appeal to the international community 
to provide Papua New Guinea with all necessary assistance in order to face its challenges 
and ultimately guarantee the full realization of human rights. Morocco made a 
recommendation.  
</p>
<p>46.<b> </b>Japan expressed concern at the proliferation of domestic and sexual violence against 
women and children as well as human trafficking and forced labour, while it took positive 
note of the adoption of the National Strategic Plan 2010-2050 on women and gender 
development. It also noted the launch of a national disability policy based on CRPD. Japan 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47.<b> </b>The Republic of Korea expressed the belief that the ratification of CRPD should 
follow the adoption of recent measures such as the 2009 National Policy on Disability and 
the National Advisory Committee on Disability. It commended the Government for 
undertaking initiatives for the promotion of human rights in spite of environmental threats. 
It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>48.<b> </b>Poland appreciated the adoption of numerous policies, plans and programmes in the 
framework of the National Strategic Plan &#8211; Papua New Guinea Vision 2050, although it 
noted with concern that human rights infrastructures and legislation were not yet fully 
developed. Poland was concerned at the persistence of harmful practices affecting women 
and girls and insufficient anti-discriminatory legislation. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49.<b> </b>France noted with satisfaction that the death penalty had not been applied in Papua 
New Guinea since 1954. It highlighted that the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture had noted grave dysfunctions in the penitentiary system in May 2010. It asked about 
progress made in establishing a national human rights institution and shared the concerns 
expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the 
persistence of discrimination against women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50.<b> </b>Norway welcomed the recent commitment by Papua New Guinea to halt 
deforestation, a step that would help protect the indigenous habitat and ecosystem, but it 
was concerned at reports that the 2010 amendment to the Environment Act undermined the 
rights of indigenous communities regarding their customary lands. Norway wished to see 
reports on measures taken by the Government to fight sexual abuse. Norway made 
recommendations.    </p>


<p>51.<b> </b>Hungary commended Papua New Guinea for the enactment of the Lakautim Pikinini 
Act, which was aimed at providing all children in the country with wider protection. It 
asked for information on measures taken to ensure the rights of persons internally displaced 
because of natural disasters. Hungary expressed concern that the current legal framework 
resulted in the creation of three categories of refugees and that informally adopted children 
were forced to work long hours and deprived of education and medical treatment. Hungary 
made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>52.<b> </b>The United States of America was concerned about widespread violence against 
women and girls; underrepresentation of women and non-Melanesians in the Parliament; 
public corruption; human trafficking, including women and children subjected to forced 
prostitution and involuntary domestic servitude; police misconduct, including excessive use 
of force; severe abuse of detainees; and very poor conditions of prisons. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53.<b> </b>Canada welcomed the Government&#8217;s consideration of the establishment of an 
independent human rights commission and the adoption of the National Strategic 
Plan - Papua New Guinea Vision 2050 to address low social and economic indicators. It 
was, however, concerned at ongoing discrimination and violence against women and 
children, including sexual violence, as well as persistent police and intertribal violence and 
impunity, poor prison conditions and abuse of detainees. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54.<b> </b>Mexico welcomed legislative measures taken in the areas of health, child protection 
and persons with disabilities. It also welcomed the existence of the Ombudsman 
Commission and hoped that the initiative to create a human rights commission would 
succeed. It asked about the vulnerability of indigenous peoples to natural disasters. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55.<b> </b>Spain asked about measures taken to improve access to sanitation and drinking 
water in view of epidemics of cholera and tuberculosis and the high incidence of 
HIV/AIDS. Additionally, noting that Parliament had recently rejected a draft law aimed at 
reserving a certain number of seats for women, it asked about action taken to guarantee 
gender equality. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56.<b> </b>Chile congratulated Papua New Guinea for the wide consultation process undertaken 
in the preparation of the national report and for the future establishment, in 2012, of a 
human rights commission, in conformity with the principles relating to the status of 
national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). It 
noted the challenges faced by Papua New Guinea in the areas of socio-economic 
development and the environment, and highlighted the creation of a Government authority 
to evaluate the consequences of climate change and development. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Regarding the creation of the human rights commission, Papua New Guinea 
explained that draft legislation had been proposed and was currently under review, although 
there had been some delays. However, the delegation conveyed that the commitment to 
establish this overdue and vital body was there. 
</p>
<p>58. On question regarding the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Papua New Guinea explained that it had 
presented its report in May 2009 and that currently it was working on creating a framework 
whereby the Government would attempt to address various issues, including legislation. 
The commitment to protecting the rights of women, the rights of children and, in short, the 
rights of all, was guaranteed in the Constitution under the provision relating to equality. 
However it was a question of implementation. </p>


<p>59. In relation to the Environment Act, it was explained that the Act was currently 
before the courts and the constitutionality of it was being challenged. 
</p>
<p>60. On issues regarding trafficking in persons, Papua New Guinea explained that action 
was being taken to address the issue. Papua New Guinea had been consulting with various 
countries on the issue. 
</p>
<p>61. On the issue of corruption, the delegation noted that there was widespread 
community awareness of the issue and it needed to be addressed. The staff of the 
Ombudsman Commission, created under the Constitution as a body independent from the 
Government, were working with the Government to address many of the issues that arose 
as a result of corruption. It was added that there was a national anti-corruption strategy and 
that Papua New Guinea had signed the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p>62. The call for civil society to be included in the way forward after the UPR 
consultations was noted and it was reiterated that civil society had been consulted. The 
delegation noted that, for many issues, it was imperative that all of society and all of 
Government were involved in consultations.  
</p>
<p>63. As for questions raised on the increase in the representation of women in Parliament, 
it was stated that the issue was before Parliament and that it was to be examined that week. 
The delegation noted, however, that Papua New Guinea had three levels of government and 
that the provincial and local levels already had mandatory provisions within relevant laws 
that applied, and that women were serving at those levels of government.  
</p>
<p>64.<b> </b>The Holy See noted that about 800 tribes with diverse languages and cultural 
traditions made Papua New Guinea a true mosaic of peaceful coexistence and respect. It 
congratulated the efforts made to conserve and protect the identity of those groups and to 
ensure the freedom of religion and expression. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65.<b> </b>Cuba noted that, despite its wealth of important natural resources, Papua New 
Guinea faced challenges in areas such as the improvement of infrastructure, education and 
health services, and standard of living. The situation was made worse by the global 
financial crisis and the unjust economic order. Cuba highlighted the basic education policy 
and National Health Plan of Papua New Guinea. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66.<b> </b>Argentina welcomed the 2010-2050 National Strategic Plan and asked about results 
achieved to date regarding the advancement of women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67.<b> </b>New Zealand was deeply concerned about the extremely high rate of maternal 
mortality and morbidity, and stated that violence was a serious problem for women and 
girls in Papua New Guinea. It was also concerned about sexual and physical attacks on 
women, a lack of accountability for perpetrators of such abuses, possible moves to curtail 
the powers of the Ombudsman, and inhuman treatment and torture in prisons. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68.<b> </b>South Africa appreciated that the national report had set out the challenges faced by 
Papua New Guinea in ensuring the effective enjoyment of all human rights by its 
population. Those challenges included reporting to treaty bodies and a lack of capacity to 
fully implement various policies. It encouraged the international community to provide 
Papua New Guinea with the technical assistance required to overcome those challenges. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69.<b> </b>Costa Rica noted the call by Papua New Guinea for technical assistance and 
encouraged the country to make use of all available tools to obtain such assistance. Costa 
Rica congratulated the country for action taken regarding sexual and domestic violence and 
for its commitment to ratify the core human rights instruments. It recognized the country&#8217;s </p>


<p>challenges and expressed concern at the impact of climate change and environmental 
degradation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70.<b> </b>The United Kingdom was concerned at the alarming reports of police abuse and 
urged Papua New Guinea to end impunity for such abuses. It requested further information 
on the Government&#8217;s response to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture following his visit. It also noted a deeply rooted negative perception of women and 
the increase in reports of sorcery-related crime. It made recommendations. 
</p>
