<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism was established by the Commission on 
Human Rights in its resolution 2005/80.  The resolution calls upon the Special Rapporteur to 
&#8220;make concrete recommendations on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism&#8221; and to &#8220;identify, exchange and promote best 
practices on measures to counter terrorism that respect human rights and fundamental 
freedoms&#8221; (paras. 14 (a) and (c), respectively).  To that end, the Special Rapporteur, whose 
mandate has been assumed by the Human Rights Council, pursuant to General Assembly 
resolution 60/251, is undertaking a series of comprehensive thematic and country/region-specific 
studies.  As part of this series of studies, Australia&#8217;s counter-terrorism legislation and practice 
has been considered with a view to identifying the compliance of these with human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>2. This study was undertaken through an interactive written process.<b>1</b>  The Special 
Rapporteur identified a list of preliminary questions, which was provided to the Government of 
Australia, the academic community in Australia, as well as non-governmental organizations.  
Based upon information provided in response to those questions, further supplementary 
questions were presented to the Government of Australia.  All information provided was used to 
assist in the preparation of this report, an advance draft of which was given to the Government 
for comment.  The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of Australia for 
its assistance in the conduct of this study, as well as those within civil society who provided him 
with information and submissions.   
</p>
<p>3. Chapter I sets out an overview of Australia&#8217;s counter-terrorism framework, its legislation, 
and broader issues of legislative reform and human rights protection.  Chapter II includes the 
means by which terrorism is characterized under Australian law, focusing upon the means by 
which it acts upon the listing of entities by the Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions 
Committee, and the legislative definitions of terrorist acts and terrorist organizations.  Chapter III 
is dedicated to the issues of incitement and sedition.  Chapters IV and V contain analyses of 
investigative, detention and control measures under Australian law, including powers of the 
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and the new regimes for preventive detention and 
control orders.  Chapter VI sets out issues relating to immigration, border control and refugee 
status.  Chapter VII contains the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and observations. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  AUSTRALIA&#8217;S COUNTER-TERRORISM FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>4. Australia is a party to 11 of the 12 extant terrorism-related conventions, and a signatory 
to the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism.  Australia has reported that it is committed to accession to the Convention on the 
Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, with the Law and Justice Legislation 
Amendment (Marking of Plastic Explosives) Bill 2006 having been recently introduced.  
Following the release of an exposure Bill in December 2005, Australia has also introduced the 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 for the purpose of 
implementing key aspects of the Revised Financial Action Task Force 40 Recommendations 
(adoption of which was urged by the Security Council in its resolution 1617 (2005), para. 7). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Australia&#8217;s domestic law on counter-terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>5. The obligations under the conventions to which Australia is party have been implemented 
into domestic law through various Acts and Regulations of the Australian Commonwealth and 
States.<b>2</b>  Australia&#8217;s counter-terrorism framework is set out within those and various other items 
of legislation, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Legislation amending the Crimes Act 1914 and the Criminal Code Act 1995 for 
the purposes of strengthening powers of law enforcement authorities, establishing terrorism 
offences, addressing issues of bail and parole with respect to those offences, and establishing 
procedures for preventative detention and control orders;<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p> (b) Legislation amending the Passports Act 1938, and dealing with various other 
aspects relating to border security;<b>4</b> and 
</p>
<p> (c) Legislation setting out, and extending, the jurisdiction and powers of the 
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), and concerning national security 
information.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Bilateral and regional relations 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Government of Australia has concluded 12 bilateral memoranda of understanding on 
counter-terrorism with Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Fiji, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, 
Indonesia, India, Timor-Leste, Brunei Darussalam, Pakistan and Afghanistan - aimed at 
supporting practical, operational-level cooperation.  In May 2005, the Government of Australia 
announced a regional counter-terrorism assistance package totalling $40.3 million over four 
years aimed at the development of counter-terrorism legal frameworks and measures to improve 
border-control and maritime security.  Australia&#8217;s initiative and leadership in the region is to be 
applauded.  The Government reports that these initiatives are being adopted in a way that does 
not reduce its development assistance budget.  The Special Rapporteur takes the opportunity to 
note that counter-terrorism assistance should not replace, but rather supplement, development 
assistance.  This is important since the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, 
adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 2006 in the annex to its resolution 60/288, 
welcomes initiatives to eradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth, to reinforce 
development, to reduce marginalization and to promote the rule of law, human rights and good 
governance. 
</p>
<p>7. Many from civil society within Australia have questioned the need for legislative reform 
since 11 September 2001.  Australia has itself reported that &#8220;extensive and effective legislation&#8221; 
was already in place before 2001.<b>6</b>  It appears, however, that legislative reform was at least 
necessary to bring Australia into compliance with Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) and 
with the work of the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee (see chapter II below).  
Australia&#8217;s Security Legislation Review Committee recently reported that it was satisfied that 
separate security legislation, in addition to general criminal law, was necessary in Australia.<b>7</b>  
The Government of Australia advises that its national response seeks to recognize that 
contemporary terrorism is generally an international phenomenon that is not confined by national 
borders. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>8. In the case of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005, it appears that the federal 
Government had not intended to release the Bill for public consultation prior to its introduction 
to Parliament.  The Bill was instead leaked by the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital 
Territory.<b>8</b>  The initial timetable set by the Government had forecast that the Bill would be 
introduced into Parliament, debated and passed in a short period of time.  This schedule was 
adjusted so that the Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation 
Committee on 3 November 2005 for inquiry and report by 28 November 2005.  The Committee 
advertised the inquiry in the <i>Australian</i> newspaper on Saturday, 5 November 2005 and 
submissions were called for by Friday, 11 November 2005.<b>9</b>  The Committee held three public 
hearings, in Sydney only, on 14, 17 and 18 November 2005.  Civil society has complained that 
this was a highly truncated period for public consultation, although the Committee received 
294 submissions.  The Bill was introduced as an urgent amendment because the Government of 
Australia had received specific intelligence and police information which it reports gave cause 
for serious concern about a potential terrorist threat.  This information was provided to the 
Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for Homeland Security.  In light of the 
concerns the Special Rapporteur has with various aspects of law enacted under the 
Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005, however, and as considered below, it is regrettable that a more 
thorough level of public consultation was not undertaken.  States should endeavour to consult 
widely when enacting counter-terrorism legislation that may limit the rights and freedoms of 
those within its territory.  Because of the potentially profound impact of counter-terrorism 
legislation on human rights and fundamental freedoms, it is particularly important that 
Governments seek to secure the broadest possible political and popular support for such 
legislation. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Human rights protection in Australia 
</b></p>
<p>9. States have a duty to protect their societies and to take effective measures to combat 
terrorism.  States are also obliged, by reason of their international obligations and as emphasized 
within various documents of the United Nations, including resolutions of the Security Council, to 
counter terrorism in a manner that is consistent with international human rights law.<b>10</b>  As stated 
in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (part IV) effective counter-terrorism 
measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and 
mutually reinforcing ones.  The defence of human rights is essential to the fulfilment of all 
aspects of a global counter-terrorism strategy. 
</p>
<p>10. It is of concern to the Special Rapporteur, in that regard, that Australia does not have 
domestic human rights legislation capable of guarding against undue limits being placed upon 
the rights and freedoms of individuals - although he notes with encouragement that the 
Australian Capital Territory has such legislation and that other Australian states are looking to do 
the same.  Although the Government of Australia points to a robust constitutional structure and 
framework of legislation capable of protecting human rights and prohibiting discrimination, this 
is an outstanding matter that has been previously raised by the Human Rights Committee in its 
observations on Australia&#8217;s reports under the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR).<b>11</b>  The Special Rapporteur identifies in this report a number of areas in which </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>the rights and freedoms of those in Australia have been, or may be, limited in the pursuit of 
countering terrorism.  It is therefore essential that there be means of dealing with potential 
excesses, and the Special Rapporteur urges Australia to move towards enacting federal 
legislation implementing the Covenant and providing remedial mechanisms for the protection of 
rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Victims of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>11. It is disappointing to note that the federal Government of Australia, although active in 
providing assistance to victims in the immediate aftermath of the Bali bombings of 2002 and 
2004, has not introduced any national mechanisms for the compensation of victims of 
terrorism.<b>12</b>  An effective global strategy to counter international terrorism must focus upon 
supporting the victims of terrorist acts, including the provision of adequate and readily accessible 
compensation.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE CLASSIFICATION OF &#8220;TERRORISM&#8221;, TERRORIST 
ENTITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>12. Although the term &#8220;terrorism&#8221; is not defined in Australian law, part 5.3 of the Criminal 
Code Act 1995 instead sets out a range of offences related to a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221; (as defined by 
sect. 100.1 (1) of the Act).  The Act makes it an offence to engage in a terrorist act; provide or 
receive training connected with terrorist acts; possess things connected with terrorist acts; collect 
or make documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts; and other acts done in preparation for, or 
planning, terrorist acts.  An organization engaged in a terrorist act can be listed by the 
Attorney-General as a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;, with a further range of offences linked to such 
organizations (considered later).  Section 100.1 (1) of the Criminal Code defines a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221; 
as follows: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(1) In this Part: 
</p>
<p>  <b><i>terrorist act</i></b>  means an action or threat of action where: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(a) the action falls within subsection (2) and does not fall within 
subsection (3); and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(b) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a 
political, religious or ideological cause; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(c) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(i) coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the 
Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or of part of 
a State, Territory or foreign country; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(ii) intimidating the public or a section of the public. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(2) Action falls within this subsection if it: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(a) causes serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(b) causes serious damage to property; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(c) causes a person&#8217;s death; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(d) endangers a person&#8217;s life, other than the life of the person taking the 
action; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(e) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the 
public; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(f) seriously interferes with, seriously disrupts, or destroys, an electronic 
system including, but not limited to: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(i) an information system; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(ii) a telecommunications system; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(iii) a financial system; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(iv) a system used for the delivery of essential government services; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(v) a system used for, or by, an essential public utility; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(vi) a system used for, or by, a transport system. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(3) Action falls within this subsection if it: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(a) is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(b) is not intended: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(i) to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(ii) to cause a person&#8217;s death; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(iii) to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the 
action; or 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(iv) to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a 
section of the public.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>13. Security Council resolution 1566 (2004) calls upon all States to cooperate fully in the 
fight against terrorism and, in doing so, to prevent and punish acts that have the following three 
cumulative characteristics: </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> (a) Acts, including against civilians, committed with the intention of causing death or 
serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages; and 
 (b) Irrespective of whether motivated by considerations of a political, philosophical, 
ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature, also committed for the purpose of 
provoking a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, 
intimidating a population, or compelling a government or an international organization to do or 
to abstain from doing any act; and 
</p>
<p> (c) Such acts constituting offences within the scope of and as defined in the 
international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism. 
</p>
<p>14. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, this cumulative characterization represents the 
type of conduct that should be acted against when States respond to calls to suppress 
international terrorism.<b>14</b>  As to the third cumulative element, that &#8220;terrorist&#8221; conduct must 
comprise acts constituting offences within existing terrorism-related conventions, there is a 
qualification to be made.  Where a State is responding to an international call to suppress 
terrorism, this third cumulative element is essential in determining what type of conduct is to be 
suppressed.  States may, however, feel compelled to implement additional counter-terrorist 
measures according to regional or domestic threats.  Where there is evidence that a State must 
respond to domestic or regional terrorist threats, it may therefore have genuine reasons to 
proscribe acts that fall outside the scope of offences under the universal terrorism-related 
conventions.  This is permissible, in the view of the Special Rapporteur, so long as strictly 
necessary and provided that the definition or proscription complies with the requirements of 
legality (accessibility, precision, applicability to counter-terrorism alone, non-discrimination and 
non-retroactivity).<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that Australia&#8217;s definition of a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221; goes 
beyond the Security Council&#8217;s characterization: 
</p>
<p> (a) By including acts the commission of which go beyond an intention of 
causing death or serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages (see sections 100.1 (3) (b) (iii) 
and 100.1 (3) (b) (iv)); and  
</p>
<p> (b) By including acts not defined in the international conventions and protocols 
relating to terrorism (see sections 100.1 (2) (b), (d), (e) and (f)). 
</p>
<p>16. The latter aspects of Australia&#8217;s definition of &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; clearly include criminal 
activity, such as the interference with an information system with the intent to create a 
serious risk to the safety of the public (through the combination of sections 100.1 (2) (f) (1) 
and 100.1 (3) (b) (iv)).  The Special Rapporteur takes the view, however, that although it is 
permissible to criminalize such conduct it should not be brought within a framework of 
legislation intended to counter international terrorism unless that conduct is accompanied by an 
intention to cause death or serious bodily injury.  The Government of Australia reports that 
Australia has been identified by jihadist groups as a terrorist target and that authorities consider </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>that a terrorist attack within Australia could well occur, possibly without notice, thus assessing 
the level of alert as &#8220;medium&#8221; (a terrorist act could occur).  To go beyond the cumulative 
restrictions of resolution 1566 (2004), however, there must be a rational link between threats 
faced by Australia and the types of conduct proscribed in its legislation that go beyond 
proscriptions within the universal terrorism-related conventions.  Australia must clearly 
distinguish terrorist conduct from ordinary criminal conduct. 
</p>
<p>17. It is also relevant to note that the definition of a terrorist act includes not just action on 
the part of a person, but also a &#8220;threat of action&#8221; (sect. 101.1 (1)).  The Special Rapporteur calls 
for caution in this respect, in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of legality. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Listing of terrorists and associated entities 
</b></p>
<p>18. As a Member State of the United Nations, Australia has various obligations to freeze the 
assets of entities listed by the Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee.  
Australia has implemented those obligations under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 
and the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealings with Assets) Regulations 2002.  
Section 18 of the Act operates such that where the Sanctions Committee lists a person or entity 
under its procedures, that person or entity is automatically proscribed under Australian law and 
added to a Consolidated List maintained by Australia&#8217;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(DFAT). 
</p>
<p>19. The listing of an individual or entity does not itself establish a criminal offence (i.e. it is 
not an offence to be on the list).  Certain acts done in relation to such entities are, however, 
criminalized.  Once an individual or entity is listed on the DFAT Consolidated List, it becomes a 
criminal offence under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 to either deal with their assets 
(sect. 20) or to make available assets (sect. 21), directly or indirectly, to them.  It is encouraging 
to see that some legislative safeguards exist so that holders of assets are not liable for actions 
done in good faith and without negligence (sect. 24), and that compensation is available for 
persons wrongly affected (sect. 25).  These safeguards recognize that the impact of listing can be 
significant for both the listed person or entity and those that may engage in conduct with such a 
person or entity.  In light of the potentially serious consequences of listing, the Special 
Rapporteur urges Australia to periodically review the means by which it maintains such lists. 
</p>
<p>20. States are placed in a position of having to comply with various resolutions of the 
Security Council concerning entities listed by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee 
(see, in particular, Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000), 1373 (2001), 
1390 (2002) and 1617 (2005)) and, to that end, Australia has opted to implement an automatic 
response to such listings.  The Special Rapporteur notes that the procedures of the Sanctions 
Committee have been criticized by members of the United Nations as failing to comply with due 
process, and that the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs is currently undertaking a review of 
all Security Council Sanctions Committee procedures.<b>16</b>  Some of the pertinent issues are 
discussed in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2006 report to the General Assembly (A/61/267, 
paras. 30-41) and he urges Australia and other States to remain aware of these issues. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Listing of &#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>21. Additional to the listing process of the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, 
Australia has taken steps to allow it to deal with &#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221;.  Although separate 
from the Sanctions Committee process, all 19 organizations currently listed in Australian law as 
a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221; are also listed by the Committee.  The listing of a &#8220;terrorist 
organization&#8221; may occur as a result of a judicial finding to that effect consequent to a 
prosecution of a person or entity for a terrorist offence.  More commonly, the Criminal Code 
Act 1995 and the Criminal Code Regulations 2002 provide for the domestic listing of an 
organization.  For this to occur, the Attorney-General must be satisfied on reasonable grounds 
that the organization is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or 
fostering the doing of a terrorist act, or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (see division 102A 
of the Criminal Code Act 1995.). 
</p>
<p>22. The effect of a listing under this process is more significant than a designation based 
upon a Sanctions Committee listing.  It is an offence to be a member of, or associate with, such 
organizations (sects. 102.3 and 102.8 of the Criminal Code).  It is an offence to direct the 
activities of, recruit persons into, receive training from or provide training to, receive funds from 
or make funds available to, or provide support or resources to a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221; (see 
sects. 102.2, 102.4, 102.5, 102.6 and 102.7, respectively).  Penalties for these offences can be up 
to 25 years&#8217; imprisonment.  This listing process is subject to various political safeguards, 
including giving notice to the Leader of the Opposition, the ability for a listed organization to 
seek de-listing, and review of listings by a Parliamentary Joint Committee.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes Australia&#8217;s decision to create a supplementary designation 
process that is capable of listing terrorist organizations under domestic law.  In the view of the 
Special Rapporteur, however, it is problematic that an organization can be listed based upon an 
ordinary, rather than criminal, standard of proof, with severe criminal penalties flowing from 
such a listing.  The Special Rapporteur notes that the Security Legislation Review Committee 
has recommended reform of the process of proscription to meet the requirements of 
administrative law.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INCITEMENT AND SEDITION 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 added to offences under Australian law, including 
the proscription of sedition under a new section 80.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, which had 
previously been provided for under sections 24A to 24F of the Crimes Act 1914. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Incitement to terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>25. It is an offence under section 80.2 for a person to urge a group(s) to use force or violence 
against another group(s).  Although extended geographical jurisdiction applies for offences 
under division 80, the conduct just described is only an offence if it would threaten the peace, 
order and good government of Australia (contrast sect. 80.4 with sect. 80.2 (5) (b)).  Although 
section 80.2 will capture some aspects of the incitement to terrorism, however, it will not </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>encompass incitement by individuals, of individuals, nor will it capture the incitement of terrorist 
acts against individuals or organizations, or of transboundary acts of terrorism.  Indeed, the 
Government of Australia has reported that these provisions were not intended to cover 
incitement to terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur reminds Australia that the Security Council has called on States, 
under paragraph 1 of its resolution 1624 (2005), to suppress the incitement to terrorism and that 
article 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires States to 
proscribe any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
hostility or violence.  Australia has a reservation to article 20 (2) to the effect that it has retained 
the right not to introduce legislation impacting upon the freedom of expression.  The Special 
Rapporteur nevertheless calls upon Australia to consider expanding its proscription of sedition to 
encompass incitement to terrorism and the advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.  In doing so, he expresses his view 
that article 5 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism represents a 
best practice in defining the proscription of the incitement to terrorism.<b>18</b>  Although this is a 
regional instrument, the proscription in article 5 was the result of careful negotiation.  It 
establishes incitement as a primary offence, rather than reacting to past events or treating the 
inciting person as a secondary party to the principal terrorist act.  This proactive approach is 
encouraged by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Terrorism Prevention Branch and 
resolutions of the Security Council.<b>19</b>  Although article 5 uses a somewhat odd title of &#8220;public 
provocation to commit a terrorist offence&#8221; instead of &#8220;incitement to terrorism&#8221;, the three 
elements of the offence under article 5 are properly confined to:  an act of communication; 
a subjective intention on the part of the person to incite terrorism; and an additional objective 
danger that the person&#8217;s conduct will incite terrorism.  The latter objective requirement separates 
the incitement to terrorism from more vague notions such as &#8220;glorification&#8221; of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>27. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, article 5 of the European Convention is compliant 
with articles 15, 19 and 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It is 
sufficiently precise, confined to the countering of terrorism, and is non-discriminatory and 
non-retroactive.  It contains additional safeguards by requiring parties to establish the public 
provocation to commit a terrorist offence as a criminal offence, when committed unlawfully and 
intentionally.  By proscribing only &#8220;unlawful&#8221; incitement, the proscription preserves any 
applicable criminal law defences (which might exclude, for example, an act of incitement 
undertaken as a result of duress).  The requirement of intention contained in article 5, 
paragraph 2, reaffirms the subjective element within the definition of public provocation to 
commit a terrorist offence and, in the view of the Special Rapporteur, requires the act of 
communication to be intentional also. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Link with proscribed &#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>28. Legislative reforms have captured some elements of the Security Council&#8217;s call for the 
suppression of the incitement to terrorism.  Advocating the commission of a terrorist act 
(whether or not it has occurred or will occur) is one of the grounds upon which the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Attorney-General may list a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221; (see chap. II above).  The Special 
Rapporteur agrees that there is a legitimate need to suppress the incitement of international 
terrorism.  In defining &#8220;advocacy&#8221;, however, section 102.1 (1A) (c) of the Criminal Code Act 
1995 includes what might be described as the glorification of terrorism.  The Special Rapporteur 
considers that this definition lacks sufficient precision and has the potential to cover statements 
which, in a very generalized or abstract way, somehow support, justify or condone terrorism.  
Effective judicial guarantees should accompany any measures related to the designation of 
entities as &#8220;terrorist organizations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Sedition and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 creates offences where a person urges another to 
engage in conduct intended to assist an organization or country either at war with Australia, or 
engaged in hostilities against Australian forces (see section 80.2 (7) and (8) of the Criminal 
Code).  Although this may not be the intention of the legislative amendment, the extraterritorial 
application of these &#8220;Category D&#8221; offences (see section 15.4 of the Criminal Code) means that 
commanders of enemy forces overseas who order their troops to attack Australian forces may be 
liable for prosecution for sedition under Australian law.  Under international humanitarian law, 
however, combatants lawfully participating in armed conflict are entitled to immunity and 
prisoner-of-war status upon capture.  Although Australia reports that there is no intention for 
these provisions to interfere with international humanitarian law, the possibility exists and the 
Special Rapporteur urges Australia to bring these laws in compliance with international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  INVESTIGATIVE AND INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING POWERS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Search and seizure 
</b></p>
<p>30. Schedule 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 extends the powers of the Australian 
Federal Police to stop, question and search persons in certain situations, including the ability to 
conduct random searches where the Attorney-General has declared an area or place to be a 
&#8220;specified security zone&#8221; (new sects. 3UA to 3UK of the Crimes Act 1914).  These powers are 
triggered only where a terrorist act has occurred or where they would assist in preventing a 
terrorist act, with the exercise of them subject to judicial review and investigation by the 
Commonwealth Ombudsman.  The Attorney-General is obliged to revoke a declaration where he 
or she is satisfied that there is no longer a threat of terrorism, or that the aftermath of an attack no 
longer requires it.  Once made, however, a declaration has a life of 28 days and may thus have a 
considerable impact upon the liberty and security of individuals.  In the absence of mechanisms 
requiring the Attorney-General to consciously decide whether to extend a declaration, the 
Special Rapporteur is of the view that this period imposes a potentially unnecessary or 
disproportionate interference upon liberty and security.  To guard against this, he urges Australia 
to consider shortening the life of declarations.  The Special Rapporteur further urges Australia to 
ensure that this mechanism is not used to suppress the right of persons to express political 
opinions through lawful demonstrations. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Security Agency powers of questioning 
</b></p>
<p>31. In 2003, the powers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) were 
enhanced by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 
2003, which added Division III to Part III of the original Act (see appendix II).  These powers 
have been extended for a further 10 years as a consequence of the recent passage of the 
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment Act 2006.  The definition 
of politically motivated violence, within the investigative jurisdiction of ASIO, was expanded to 
include terrorism offences (see section 4 of the principal Act).  ASIO, which is responsible for 
the gathering of intelligence about terrorist threats to Australia, was given the power to detain 
and question terrorist suspects, and non-suspects, who may have information on terrorist 
activities.  The Act requires a person to provide information and answer questions where a 
warrant for questioning is issued (sects. 34D and 34G).  Since this overrides the internationally 
recognized privilege against self-incrimination, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged to see that 
measures are in place so that the use of information provided at ASIO hearings is restricted to the 
gathering of intelligence.  Such information is accordingly subject to &#8220;use immunity&#8221;, which 
means that the information may not be used in criminal proceedings against the person 
(sect. 34 (G) (9)). 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that concerns have been raised about the 
potential &#8220;derivative use&#8221; of such information.  That is, concern has been raised that information 
provided at an ASIO hearing may steer police officers who are present at the hearing towards a 
particular line of inquiry that would not otherwise have been pursued, and that evidence obtained 
through that line of inquiry might be used in criminal proceedings against the person giving the 
information.  The Federal Court of Australia ruled, in <i>A. v. Boulton</i> (2004) 136 FCR 420, that 
there is no derivative use immunity in respect of compulsory hearings before the Australian 
Crime Commission and it therefore appears that members of the police present during ASIO 
hearings are in a position to use information provided during those hearings in order to further 
their own investigations.  In the context of Australia&#8217;s common-law jurisdiction, the Special 
Rapporteur takes the view that police officers should not be present at ASIO hearings or, in the 
alternative, that derivative use immunity should be provided for within the ASIO Act.  A clear 
demarcation should exist and be maintained between intelligence gathering and criminal 
investigations. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  AML/CTF Bill 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 contains 
provisions which have caused the public and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation 
Committee to make recommendations.  The Committee has also recommended that a privacy 
impact assessment of the Bill be undertaken.  Given the powers to be enacted under the 
legislation, it has been recommended that the Privacy Commissioner and/or the Human Rights 
and Equal Opportunity Commission be empowered to conduct regular audits of practices for the 
purpose of determining compliance with the law.  To prevent any possible discriminatory 
application of the powers under the Bill, it has also been further recommended that protection 
against liability not include liability under Federal and State anti-discrimination statutes.  The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the adoption of these three recommendations. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p><b>V.  POWERS OF DETENTION AND CONTROL 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Reversal of onus for the granting of bail 
</b></p>
<p>34. Australia reports that, up to the end of April 2006, 26 persons were charged with various 
terrorism offences (3 have pleaded guilty or been convicted, 4 have been committed for trial, 
and 19 are awaiting committal for trial).  Of those persons, only four have been granted bail.  It 
appears that this is a reflection of the operation of a new section 15AA of the Crimes Act 1914, 
which prevents a bail authority from granting bail to a person charged with, or convicted of, 
certain terrorism and other offences unless the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional 
circumstances exist to justify bail.  This not only reverses the burden of establishing the need for 
detention, but places the very high threshold of requiring an accused or convicted person to 
establish &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221;.  The Special Rapporteur notes that article 9, paragraph 3, 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides, in part, that:  &#8220;It shall not be 
the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody.&#8221;  This properly places 
the burden upon the State to establish the need for the detention of an accused person to 
continue.  Where there are essential reasons, such as the suppression of evidence or the 
commission of further offences, bail may be refused and a person remanded in custody.  The 
Special Rapporteur takes the view, however, that the classification of an act as a terrorist offence 
in domestic law should not result in automatic denial of bail, nor in the reversal of onus.  Each 
case must be assessed on its merits, with the burden upon the State for establishing reasons for 
detention. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Conditions of detention while on remand 
</b></p>
<p>35. All persons charged with terrorism offences to date, at least in New South Wales under 
its Department of Corrective Services AA &amp; Category 5 Inmates Management Regime, have 
been classified as &#8220;AA&#8221; inmates.  Such inmates are remanded in maximum-security prisons, 
normally reserved for inmates convicted of serious offences.  Each remand prisoner should be 
the subject of an individual risk assessment, with appropriate avenues available for the remanded 
person to seek an independent review of the classification.  The Special Rapporteur reminds 
Australia that article 10 (2) (a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
paragraphs 8 (b) and 85 (1) of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners require untried prisoners to be kept separate, and treated differently, from convicted 
prisoners.<b>20</b>  The Special Rapporteur notes that, upon ratification of ICCPR, Australia lodged a 
reservation whereby it provided that &#8220;the principle of segregation is accepted as an objective to 
be achieved progressively&#8221;, rather than immediately.  The classification of persons charged with 
terrorism offences as &#8220;AA&#8221; inmates is a recent practice.  The Special Rapporteur would have 
expected the progressive achievement of the principle of segregation to be evidenced within 
Australia&#8217;s practices arising since ratification of the Covenant, and he therefore expresses regret 
that this practice has developed. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur makes a related observation concerning the segregation of 
persons <i>convicted</i> of terrorism offences.  He is aware of general concerns that such persons may 
need to be segregated from the rest of the prison population in order to prevent the recruitment </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>by those persons of inmates into a terrorist organization.  The Special Rapporteur observes that 
such segregation might be permissible, but only when strictly necessary and if the person has 
been convicted of a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; offence in respect of which a proper definition of terrorism has 
been applied. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Control orders 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 established &#8220;control orders&#8221; under a new 
Division 104 to the Criminal Code Act 1995.  A control order is one that imposes obligations on 
a person, under section 104.1, for the purpose of protecting the public from a terrorist act 
(including, for example, house arrest, the attachment to a person of an electronic tracking device, 
and various limitations upon where a person may go and who he or she may meet).  The range of 
conditions that may be imposed are set out in section 104.5.  It is a criminal offence to 
contravene the terms of a control order, rendering the person liable to imprisonment for up to 
five years (see section 104.27).  Control orders can be no longer than 12 months, but can be 
renewed for subsequent periods of up to 12 months, with no limit on the number of possible 
renewals (sect. 104.5 (1) (f) and (2)).  The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption by 
Australia of measures capable of protecting the public which fall short of actual detention.  He 
urges Australia to ensure that the imposition of obligations upon the subject of a control order 
are proportionate, are only imposed for as long as strictly necessary, particularly having regard to 
the fact that control orders are issued based upon the non-criminal standard of proof on the 
balance of probabilities (sect. 104.4).  The imposition of controls upon any person must not 
cumulate so as to be tantamount to detention.  The Special Rapporteur notes in this regard that 
house arrest is a possible imposition under a control order (sect. 104.5 (3) (a) and (c)).  Since this 
is a form of detention, the Special Rapporteur reminds Australia that house arrest (like any form 
of detention) is only permissible during the course of a criminal investigation; while awaiting 
trial or during a trial; or as an alternative to a custodial sentence (while on parole, for example).  
Australia should similarly ensure that control orders do not unduly interfere with the rights to 
family life, employment and education. 
</p>
<p>38. Australian citizen Jack Thomas was in August 2006 made subject to a control order, with 
curfew and reporting conditions imposed under that order.  These conditions, by themselves, do 
not appear to unduly restrict Mr. Thomas&#8217;s freedom of movement if the allegation that he is 
likely to commit a terrorist act is correct.  The Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, that 
there appears to be limited evidence upon which the control order was made.  The imposition of 
a control order should never substitute for criminal proceedings and the Special Rapporteur 
expresses concern that the order imposed against Thomas came just days after a state Court of 
Appeal quashed a terrorist financing conviction against him.  Where criminal proceedings cannot 
be brought, or a conviction maintained, a control order might (depending on the facts and the 
conditions of that order) be justifiable where new information or the urgency of a situation call 
for action to prevent the commission of a terrorist act.  Transparency and due process must 
always be maintained in such cases, with the order regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains 
necessary. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>39. Control orders are made by a two-step process.  An interim control order is made 
ex parte.  The person to whom the order applies will then be provided with notice of the order 
and will be entitled to appear at a confirmation hearing and contest the order.  During a 
confirmation hearing, and for the purpose of protecting information likely to prejudice national 
security, persons made subject to a control order will only be entitled to a summary of the 
grounds upon which the order was made by the Court (see section 104.5 (2A) of the 
Criminal Code).  This restriction applies to an appeal against, or review of, a decision made at a 
confirmation hearing.  It is notable in this regard that control orders were also introduced in the 
United Kingdom under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (UK), and in very similar terms to 
the regime under Australian law.  Recent judicial decisions in the United Kingdom have 
considered the British control-order regime and found it to be incompatible with the right to a 
fair hearing and article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms (liberty of the person) because the regime prevents disclosure of certain 
information upon which control orders are sought and made.<b>21</b>  The Special Rapporteur likewise 
urges Australia to reconsider the means by which sensitive information is protected so that such 
protection would be compatible with the right to a fair hearing. 
</p>
<p>40. A further issue of concern relating to control orders is the potential for their use contrary 
to the <i>ne bis in idem</i> principle (that a person should not be tried or punished twice for the same 
offence).  It is an offence, by way of example, for a person to receive or provide training 
connected with a terrorist act.  Upon completion of sentence, it is conceivable that a person 
convicted of such an offence (because of the conviction) may thereafter be made the subject of a 
control order, including conditions of house arrest.  The Special Rapporteur urges Australia to 
ensure that control orders are not imposed in a manner that would offend the <i>ne bis in idem</i> 
principle. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Investigative detention 
</b></p>
<p>41. The general rules on arrest and detention for Commonwealth offences is set out within 
the Crimes Act 1914.  Where a person is arrested for a Commonwealth offence, they may be 
detained for a reasonable period (but no more than four hours) for the purpose of investigating 
whether the person committed that or any other Commonwealth offence, having regard to the 
number and complexity of matters being investigated and discounting time for things such as 
transportation, consultation with counsel, the receipt of medical attention, or for the reasonable 
time involved in making and disposing of an application to extend the investigation period 
(sect. 23 (C) (2), (4), (6) and (7)).  Where a person is arrested for a serious Commonwealth 
offence (punishable by imprisonment exceeding 12 months) an application for an extension of 
the investigation period may be made to a judicial officer who may then extend the investigation 
on prescribed grounds, but for no more than a total period of eight hours from the time of arrest 
(sect. 23 (D) (1), (2), (5) and (6)). 
</p>
<p>42. The latter provisions were amended by the Anti-Terrorism Act 2004 in respect of 
terrorism offences (terrorist activities using explosives or lethal devices, or involving &#8220;terrorist 
acts&#8221; - see chapter II above).  In respect of all such offences, a judicial officer may extend a 
precharge investigation period for up to 20 hours (sect. 23D (7) of the Crimes Act 1914). </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Preventive detention  
</b></p>
<p>43. The Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 established &#8220;preventive-detention orders&#8221; (PDOs) 
under a new Division 105 to the Criminal Code Act 1995.  Preventive-detention orders may be 
issued in two situations.  The first is where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person 
will commit an imminent terrorist act (or is in possession of materials for that purpose, or has 
done something in pursuit of that purpose) <i>and</i> the person&#8217;s detention would substantially assist 
in preventing a terrorist act from occurring <i>and</i> detaining the person is reasonably necessary for 
the latter purpose (sect. 105.4 (4) and (5)).  A person may also be made subject to a PDO if a 
terrorist act has occurred within the last 28 days <i>and</i> the person&#8217;s detention is necessary to 
preserve relevant evidence <i>and</i> detaining the person is reasonably necessary for the latter 
purpose (sect. 105.4 (6)). 
</p>
<p>44. The normal period that a person may be detained under a PDO is no more than 24 hours, 
and only one PDO can be issued against any person relating to any one event (sects. 105.8 (5), 
105.6 and 105.10 (5)).  In limited circumstances, a &#8220;continued preventive-detention order&#8221; can 
see a person detained for up to 48 hours, upon extension by a judicial officer (sect. 105.12).  A 
PDO can be accompanied by a &#8220;prohibited contact order&#8221;, on terms issued by the court, although 
the right to contact one&#8217;s lawyer is specifically preserved (see sections 105.15 to 105.17, 
and 105.34). 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur again expresses concern over the potential use, in the making of 
preventive-detention orders, of secret information and reiterates his comments in the context of 
control orders about the use of such information being potentially contrary to the right to a fair 
trial (see sections 105.7 (2A), 105.8 (6A), 105.11 (3A) and 105.12 (6A)). 
</p>
<p><b>Security Agency powers of detention  
</b></p>
<p>46. As noted in chapter IV, the powers of ASIO have been enhanced to allow it to detain and 
question terrorist suspects, and non-suspects who may have information on terrorist activities.  
The Act introduced powers to detain and question for up to 168 hours (7 days) continuously 
(sect. 34SC).  Before questioning and detention can take place:  (a) the Director-General of 
ASIO must obtain the consent of the Attorney-General to seek a warrant for questioning and 
detention; and (b) an &#8220;issuing authority&#8221; must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for 
believing that such questioning and detention will substantially assist the collection of 
intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence (see sections 34D, 34E, 34F 
and 34G).  Upon execution of the warrant, a person taken into custody must be brought before a 
&#8220;prescribed authority&#8221; for the questioning to be conducted (sect. 34H).  An &#8220;issuing authority&#8221; is 
a federal magistrate or judge appointed by the Minister of Justice as an issuing authority.  A 
&#8220;prescribed authority&#8221; is a person, also appointed by the Minister, who has served as a judge in 
one or more superior courts for a period of five years and no longer holds a commission as a 
judge of a superior court (sect. 34B (1)).  
</p><p>47. Although a detained person may make a complaint at any time to the Inspector-General 
of Security Intelligence, a detained person has no right to seek a judicial review of the validity, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>or terms, of an issuing authority&#8217;s warrant.  A detained person has no right to be brought before 
any judicial body other than a prescribed authority.  The absence of these rights is of grave 
concern to the Special Rapporteur, offending the right to a fair hearing and the right to have the 
legality of one&#8217;s detention determined by an independent and competent authority. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE STATUS 
</b></p>
<p>48. Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) imposed obligations upon States impacting upon 
immigration and refugee status.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Measures to prevent the transboundary movement of terrorists 
</b></p>
<p>49. Paragraph 2 (g) of resolution 1373 (2001) requires States to prevent the movement of 
terrorists through effective border controls and measures to secure the integrity of identity papers 
and travel documents.  Australia implements various measures in an effort to achieve these 
requirements.  All non-Australian citizens, except New Zealanders and other limited categories 
of persons, must hold a visa before being able to enter and remain in Australia.  The visa 
application process includes checks against a person&#8217;s identity and criminal history.  Australia 
also deploys Airline Liaison Officers at key hub international airports.  The Department of 
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) regulates the movement of people across 
Australia&#8217;s borders, requiring both citizens and non-citizens to be able to identify themselves.  
DIMA staff at all airports are trained in document examination and have access to sophisticated 
examination equipment. 
</p>
<p>50. Two measures relating to border control raise the potential for concern.  The first is the 
Advance Passenger Processing (APP) system, obliging all international flights into Australia to 
provide a list, in advance, of passengers and crew for inbound flights.  The advantage of this 
system is that it allows Australia to verify the authority of passengers and crew to arrive in 
Australia before boarding a flight or international cruise ship.  It allows DIMA to issue boarding 
directives to airlines and cruise companies that may prevent the boarding of passengers and crew 
who do not have permission to travel to Australia.  The second feature is a database used by 
DIMA to store details about people and travel documents of immigration concern to Australia.   
</p>
<p>51. As part of a layered approach intended to prevent the transboundary movement of 
terrorists, and of others involved in criminal activity, the latter measures seem rational and, 
according to authorities, are very effective.  Notwithstanding this, the Special Rapporteur has 
two concerns about the latter measures.  The first is that the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees, as well as article 12, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, guarantees to every person the right to leave any country, including one&#8217;s own country.  
States should be cautious of implementing measures that may effectively prevent persons from 
exercising this right, particularly in the context of those fleeing persecution in their own country 
with an intention to seek refugee status elsewhere.  The ability to leave is essential to the 
operation of the framework safeguarding the rights of refugees. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur also urges Australia to ensure that these measures are used in an 
appropriate manner and that adequate safeguards are implemented to prevent use of the measures 
in contravention of the principle of non-discrimination or in breach of the right to privacy.  The 
use of indicator clusters to profile potential suspects is, in principle, a permissible means of </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>investigation and law enforcement activity.  As defined by the Australian Customs Service, 
profiling is &#8220;a filtering process involving a single or cluster of indicators that, when grouped 
together, present the characteristics of a high-risk passenger or consignment&#8221;.<b>22</b>  However, when 
one of the indicators on which profiling is based is a person&#8217;s ethnic or national origin, this raises 
the question of the conformity of such profiling with the principle of non-discrimination.   
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur agrees with the view of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination that even measures designed to counter terrorism must conform to this 
fundamental principle.  At the conclusion of its sixty-first session in August 2003, the 
Committee demanded that &#8220;States and international organizations ensure that measures taken in 
the struggle against terrorism do not discriminate in purpose or effect on grounds of race, colour, 
descent, or national or ethnic origin&#8221;.<b>23</b>  In the view of the Special Rapporteur, this is equally 
applicable to the profiling of persons based upon their religion. 
</p>
<p>54. The limits of profiling in the context of countering terrorism was recently considered by 
the House of Lords in <i>Gillan and Another v. Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and 
Another</i> ([2006] UKHL 12).  The case concerned sections 44 and 45 of the Terrorism Act 2000 
(UK), which authorize police to search members of the public without having to have any 
grounds to suspect wrongdoing on the part of the person.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that profiling or similar devices:  must strictly 
comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination; be subject to 
close judicial scrutiny; and should be periodically reviewed.<b>24</b>  He urges Australia to ensure that 
border security measures comply with these requirements.  The permissible limits of profiling is 
a matter to be further considered by the Special Rapporteur within a thematic study to be 
presented in his general report (A/HRC/4/26) to the fourth session of the Human Rights Council.  
The Special Rapporteur urges Australia and other States to remain aware of this issue. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>56. In paragraph 3 (f) of its resolution 1373 (2001) the Security Council calls upon States 
members of the United Nations to take measures to ensure that refugee status is not granted to 
asylum-seekers who have planned, facilitated or participated in the commission of terrorist acts.  
Paragraph 3 (g) calls on States members to ensure that refugee status is not abused by 
perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist acts.  The words of both provisions require 
such measures must be in conformity with international standards of human rights. 
</p>
<p>57. Australia undertakes character and security checks as part of the application process for 
refugee status.  Non-citizens of Australia who arrive in Australia without a valid visa, other than 
New Zealanders, are interviewed by DIMA staff to determine whether to allow or refuse entry 
into Australia.  Where such a person applies for protection, the record of entry interview is 
forwarded to a senior DIMA official for an assessment of whether the person prima facie 
engages Australia&#8217;s obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  Where 
that is not the case, the person will be refused immigration clearance and detained until he or she 
can be reasonably removed from Australia.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>58. Where a person is so detained, the Special Rapporteur urges Australia to ensure that it 
complies with articles 9 and 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  He 
notes the Views by the Human Rights Committee in <i>A v. Australia</i> (Communication 560/1993) 
that, in order to avoid a characterization of arbitrariness, detention should not continue beyond 
the period for which there is appropriate justification.  In that case, the author&#8217;s detention as a 
non-citizen without an entry permit continued, in mandatory terms, until he was removed or 
granted a permit.  The Committee was critical that Australia had failed to demonstrate that 
alternative and less intrusive measures were available.  In <i>C v. Australia </i>(Communication 
900/1999), the Committee took the view that a double violation of article 9, paragraphs (1) and 
(4), had taken place.  The Human Rights Committee has noted its concern over Australia&#8217;s 
mandatory detention regime and has, in its concluding observations on Australia&#8217;s reports under 
article 40 of the Covenant, urged Australia to reconsider the regime with a view to instituting 
alternative mechanisms of maintaining an orderly immigration process.<b>25</b>  Despite this, DIMA 
notes on its website that, as at 2 June 2006, 811 people were in immigration detention, including 
75 in &#8220;residence determination arrangements&#8221; in the community.<b>26</b>  The Refugee Council of 
Australia reports, as at 31 December 2004, that of those in immigration detention more 
than 200 persons had been held in detention for longer than 24 months.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>59. It is of grave concern to the Special Rapporteur that a person may be indefinitely detained 
under the Migration Act 1958 and that the High Court of Australia has ruled that the mandatory 
and indefinite detention of unlawful non-citizens under the Act is valid, provided that this occurs 
for the purpose of removing or deporting the non-citizen from Australia.<b>28</b>  The Special 
Rapporteur also notes that mistakes can and have occurred.  He records that assets frozen as a 
result of an entity&#8217;s listing under the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealings with 
Assets) Regulations 2002 had to be unfrozen after it was established that the entity had no 
terrorist connections, although this occurred in a timely manner.<b>29</b>  He further notes that a 
Kuwaiti refugee applicant was detained for two years between 1997 and 1999 based upon an 
incorrect assessment by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation that he was a national 
security risk.<b>30</b>  It should be noted that the applicant was subsequently awarded compensation for 
wrongful imprisonment, and that ASIO security certificates are subject to judicial review under 
paragraph 75 (v) of the Constitution of Australia and section 39B of the Judiciary Act.  
Notwithstanding this, the Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned that Australian law allows a 
person to be held in detention for such a long period of time, potentially indefinitely. 
</p>
<p>60. Reflecting article 1F of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, an application 
for a protection visa may be refused under section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 where an 
applicant declares an involvement in the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, 
crimes against the peace, or serious non-political crimes (or where there are reasons for believing 
that this is the case).  Similarly, article 33, paragraph 2, of the Convention provides an exception 
to the application of the non-refoulement principle within the framework of the Convention (but 
not in respect of general human rights treaties such as article 7 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights in the case of refugees that are a danger to the security of the State, or 
who have been convicted of a particularly serious crime and who are a danger to the community, 
reflected within Australian domestic law under section 501 (6) (d) (v) of the Migration Act.  
Australia reports that all offences established by the counter-terrorism instruments to which it is </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>a party are considered serious non-political offences.  This implies that an adverse character 
assessment would be made under section 501 (6) of the Migration Act 1958.  The Special 
Rapporteur cautions that not all offences under the terrorism-related conventions are serious 
offences.  The Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, 
for example, calls on States to establish jurisdiction over acts that may or do jeopardize the 
safety of a civil aircraft, or of persons or property therein, or which jeopardize good order and 
discipline on board.  While this certainly would capture conduct of a terrorist nature, the 
description of acts over which States must establish jurisdiction is very broad and likely also to 
include conduct with no bearing at all on terrorism.<b>31</b>  The Special Rapporteur reminds Australia 
that the cumulative characterization of acts to be suppressed when countering terrorism, as 
discussed in chapter II above, is thus important.  He also recalls that the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has issued guidelines in which it has 
emphasized that article 1F of the Refugee Convention is only triggered in extreme circumstances 
by activity which attacks the very basis of the international community&#8217;s coexistence.<b>32</b>  Such 
activity, state the Guidelines, must have an international dimension.  In the view of the Special 
Rapporteur, this reinforces the need to ensure that only acts possessing the characteristics 
identified in Security Council resolution 1566 (2004) should result in an adverse character 
assessment for the purpose of the Migration Act 1958. 
</p>
<p>61. Where an application for refugee status is refused, the applicant may seek a merits review 
of that decision by either the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, 
depending on the basis for refusal.  Under section 501 (3) of the Migration Act 1958, the 
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs may personally decide to refuse a protection 
visa, with such decisions capable of judicial review under section 476 (1) (c) of the Migration 
Act and section 75 (v) of the Constitution.  This will be the case where the Minister reasonably 
suspects that the person does not pass the character test under the Act and that the refusal or 
cancellation is in the national interest.  The term &#8220;national interest&#8221; is not defined within the Act.  
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his comments in the preceding paragraph concerning the 
characterization of terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Return and transfer of persons 
</b></p>
<p>62. Although not restricted to counter-terrorism, the Special Rapporteur notes with grave 
concern that the Migration Act 1958 does not prohibit the return of an alien to a place where they 
would be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.  He notes that the Minister for Immigration and 
Multicultural Affairs may, if he or she considers it to be in the public interest, intervene and 
substitute a more favourable decision than the Refugee Review Tribunal (sect. 417).  It is of 
some reassurance that the Minister has published guidelines identifying Australia&#8217;s obligations 
under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as relevant to the 
exercise of the latter discretion.  It is of concern to the Special Rapporteur, however, that the 
latter guidelines are not binding and the latter discretion non-compellable and non-reviewable.  
The principle of non-refoulement is an absolute one and must be adhered to in order to avoid the 
extradition, expulsion, deportation, or other forms of transfer of persons to territories or secret 
locations in which they may face a risk of torture or ill-treatment.<b>33</b> </p>

<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Australia for its assistance 
in the conduct of this study, as well as those within civil society who provided him with 
information and submissions.  This study has identified some good practices in the area of 
human rights compliance when countering terrorism, although there is room for 
improvement in many of those practices.  Some matters, in the view of the Special 
Rapporteur, require urgent attention. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages Australia to continue work towards accession 
to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection and 
the adoption of the Financial Action Task Force recommendations on the suppression of 
terrorist financing.  On the latter subject, the introduction of the Anti-Money Laundering 
and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 has prompted recommendations which, in the 
view of the Special Rapporteur, should be acted upon.  He notes that Australia has signed 
the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism and that it is a party to all other universal terrorism-related conventions.  While 
Australia is to be commended for its leadership in seeking to strengthen counter-terrorism 
in the Asia-Pacific region, it must ensure that the mechanisms it assists other States to 
adopt are in compliance with international obligations, in particular human rights, refugee, 
and humanitarian law.  The Special Rapporteur further urges Australia to ensure that this 
assistance does not occur at the expense of development assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes the speed with which recent counter-terrorism 
legislation has been passed in Australia.  He urges Australia, and all States, to avoid this 
situation.  Because of the potentially profound implications of counter-terrorism 
legislation, it is particularly important that Governments seek to secure the broadest 
possible political and popular support for such legislation.  This is particularly relevant in 
Australia, which has no federal human rights legislation capable of guarding against undue 
limits being placed upon the rights and freedoms of individuals.  Given that this study 
identifies a number of actual and potential human rights violations within Australia&#8217;s 
counter-terrorism regime, the Special Rapporteur urges Australia to move towards 
enacting federal legislation implementing the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and providing remedial mechanisms for the protection of rights and freedoms.  He 
also urges Australia to introduce national measures for the compensation of the victims of 
terrorist acts. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The definition of the term &#8220;terrorist act&#8221; in the Criminal Code Act 1995, in the view 
of the Special Rapporteur, goes beyond the characterization set out in Security Council 
resolution 1566 (2004) of conduct to be suppressed in the fight against international 
terrorism.  He thus urges Australia to carefully reconsider its definition of the term, and 
urges caution concerning the current reference in the Criminal Code to the &#8220;threat&#8221; of 
certain action.  As to the listing of terrorists and associated entities, it is worthy to note that 
Australia has formulated certain safeguards.  He urges the periodic review of the means by 
which such lists are maintained, particularly in light of the existing problems with the 
procedures of the 1267 Sanctions Committee.  The Special Rapporteur notes Australia&#8217;s </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b>initiative to create a supplementary designation process for terrorist organizations, 
although he expresses concern that the process is triggered by a civil standard of proof, 
despite the fact that such designation may result in severe criminal penalties. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> As to the incitement to terrorism, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that 
Australian law is not adequate in proscribing such conduct.  He reminds Australia, in that 
regard, of the Security Council&#8217;s recommendations in its resolution 1624 (2005) and of 
article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
notwithstanding its reservation to the latter provision.  He also takes the view that the 
definition of &#8220;advocacy&#8221; of terrorism, in section 102.1 (1A) (c) of the Criminal Code Act 1995, is overly broad and insufficiently precise.  He further notes that the extraterritorial 
application of section 80.2 (7) and (8) of the Criminal Code has the potential to conflict with 
international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> Under the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 the powers of the Australian Federal 
Police have been extended to include the ability to conduct random searches where the 
Attorney-General has declared an area or place to be a &#8220;specified security zone&#8221;.  Although 
certain safeguards against abuse of these powers exist, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
view that the 28-day life of such declarations imposes a potentially unnecessary or 
disproportionate interference upon liberty and security.  He urges Australia to consider 
shortening the life of declarations and to ensure that this measure is not capable of use to 
restrict the ability of persons to undertake lawful demonstrations. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes the expanded investigative powers of the Australian 
Security Intelligence Organisation.  He supports the accompanying use immunity for 
information obtained during ASIO compulsory interrogation hearings.  He takes the view, 
however, that police officers should not be present at ASIO hearings or, in the alternative, 
that derivative use immunity should be provided for.  A clear demarcation should exist and 
be maintained between intelligence gathering and criminal investigations.   
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> There are various matters of concern with powers of detention and control in 
Australia.  The Special Rapporteur takes the view that new bail provisions applying to 
those charged with terrorism offences are incompatible with article 9 (3) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The Special Rapporteur would also 
have expected Australia&#8217;s progressive achievement of the principle of segregation of 
accused persons from convicted persons under article 10, paragraph 2 (a) of the Covenant, 
to be reflected within Australia&#8217;s practices arising since its ratification of the Covenant.   
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Special Rapporteur commends Australia&#8217;s adoption, through the control order 
regime, of measures capable of protecting the public while avoiding detention.  He urges 
vigilance in ensuring that control orders impose obligations that are necessary and 
proportionate, and notes in that regard that house arrest, which constitutes a form of 
detention, is only permissible during the course of a criminal investigation, while awaiting 
trial, during trial, or as an alternative to a custodial sentence.  He also urges Australia to 
reconsider the means by which it protects sensitive information so as to guarantee the right 
to a fair trial.  Control orders should not be used in a manner contrary to the <i>ne bis in idem</i> 
principle.  As with control orders, Australia&#8217;s preventive-detention orders need to be 
obtained in a manner that guarantees the right to a fair trial. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>72.<b> Australia adopts a multilayered approach to prevent the movement of terrorists and 
secure the integrity of documentation.  The Special Rapporteur urges Australia to ensure 
that its system of pre-boarding authorization does not deny the ability of persons to 
exercise their right to leave any country, particularly in the context of those fleeing 
persecution in their own country.  He further reminds Australia that border security 
measures should never be used to undertake racial profiling.  In the context of other, 
permissible, profiling measures he urges Australia to ensure that these are implemented in 
a manner that comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and 
non-discrimination, that they be subject to judicial scrutiny, and be periodically reviewed.  
The Special Rapporteur further reminds Australia that the detention of rejected refugee 
applicants must be in compliance with articles 9 and 10 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights.  He expresses grave concern that the Migration Act 1958 allows 
a person to be held in custody indefinitely and that the Act does not prohibit the return of 
aliens to a place where they would be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.  The Special 
Rapporteur reminds Australia of the need to comply with the principle of non-refoulement.
