The Company announced its 2009 guidance for Western Goldfields’ Mesquite Mine 
in  California.  In  2009,  the  Company  expects  to  incur  $68.0  to  $72.0  million  in 
operating costs to place and process approximately 155,000 recoverable ounces of 
gold on the leach pad, resulting in a cost per recoverable ounce placed(1) of $430 to 
$450  per  ounce  for  the  year.  At  the  end  of  2008,  Western  Goldfields  had 
approximately  55,000  recoverable  ounces  of  inventory  on  the  leach  pad  which  is
- 2 -
estimated to increase to approximately 65,000 ounces at the end of 2009. Due to 
the  timing  of  leach  pad  recoveries  and  the  impact  of  inventory  adjustments,  the 
Company  forecasts  production  and  sales  to  be  between  140,000  and  150,000 
ounces at cost of sales per ounce(2) of  $530 to $540. As higher cost leach pad gold 
inventory at December 31, 2008 is planned to be replaced by lower cost inventory 
at December 31, 2009, the planned cost of sales(3) for 2009 includes approximately 
$11 million from the expected reduction in the value of leach pad gold inventory. 
These costs were included in work in process inventory at December 31, 2008 and 
therefore do not affect 2009 operating cash flow.  Operating cash flow is expected 
to be $40 - $45 million for 2009 assuming a gold price of $850 per ounce. Western 
Goldfields  expects  production  and  sales  to  grow  again  in  2010  to  approximately 
175,000 ounces with total operating costs remaining similar to 2009 at $68 to $72 
million, thus reducing the cost of sales per ounce(2) in 2010 to approximately $400.
While total operating costs are expected to remain consistent on a quarterly basis 
from $16.5 to $18.5 million, higher stripping ratios and lower grades result in lower 
ounces  placed  and  lower  production  in  the  first  three  quarters  of  2009. 
Approximately  50%  of  the  recoverable  ounces  placed  in  2009  are  forecast  to  be 
placed  in  the  fourth  quarter.  Production  in  each  of  the  first  three  quarters  is 
expected  to  be  33,000  to  38,000  ounces  before  increasing  to  38,000  to  43,000 
ounces in the fourth quarter. The cost of sales per ounce(2) in the first three quarters 
of the year are forecast to be $595 to $605 and include approximately $4 million per 
quarter  of  costs  from  the  expected  reduction  in  the  value  of  leach  pad  gold 
inventory  quarter  to  quarter.  The  fourth  quarter  cost  of  sales  per  ounce(2)  are 
expected decline to $365 to $375 and include approximately a $1 million reduction 
to  cost  of  sales(3)  from  the  expected  increase  in  the  value  of  leach  pad  gold 
inventory during the fourth quarter. The inventory related costs do not impact the 
Company’s cash flow in the respective quarters.

19, 2009.
