Santiago, Chile. August 24, 2016.- Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) (NYSE:
SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM-B, SQM-A) reported today earnings for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 of US$141.6 million (US$0.54 per ADR), a decrease from
US$154.9 million (US$0.59 per ADR) for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Gross
Margin(2) reached US$260.5 million (29.6% of revenues) for the six months ended June 30,
2016, lower than US$295.2 million (33.9% of revenues) recorded for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Revenues totaled US$881.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
representing an increase of 1.1% compared to US$871.8 million reported for the six
months ended June 30, 2015.
The Company also announced earnings for the second quarter of 2016, reporting net
income of US$83.1 million (US$0.32 per ADR) compared to US$83.2 million (US$0.32 per
ADR) for the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 reached
US$146.9 million; lower than the US$164.6 million recorded for the second quarter of 2015.
Revenues totaled US$489.6 million, an increase of approximately 1.1% compared to the
second quarter of 2015, when revenues amounted to US$484.2 million.
SQM’s Chief Executive Officer, Patricio de Solminihac, stated, “During the first half of 2016
we saw higher volumes of potassium chloride, iodine, lithium and specialty plant nutrients.
These higher sales volumes were in line with our expectations as were the market trends
in general: higher prices in lithium, the continued downward trend in iodine prices and
lower average prices of potassium products.”
“In the fertilizer markets, potassium chloride sales volumes for the first six months of 2016
were up over 14% when compared to the same period last year. We expect the sales
volumes for 2016 to be at least 20% stronger than the sales volumes that we saw last year.
Following the closure of potassium chloride contracts between other potash producers
and China, we have seen some slight price recovery recently, and hope that this trend will
continue during the remainder of 2016.”
“Pricing in the specialty plant nutrition business line has been more stable than in the
potassium chloride and potassium sulfate business line, but we did see a slight decrease
of almost 4% during the first half of the year, mainly as a result of lower potassium chloride
prices. These lower prices were mostly offset by higher sales volumes, specifically related
to our water soluble products, a market where we still expect to see market growth during
2016.”
“Our sales volumes of iodine continue to grow, as proof, in the second quarter we
reported the strongest sales volumes we have seen in years. However, we do not expect
the downward price pressure to soften in the near future.”
He went on to say, “We continue to believe in the solar salts(3) market, but due to some
delays in concentrated solar power plant projects, it is estimated that solar salt sales
volumes during 2016 will not reach the 70,000MT that we had originally anticipated. We
believe that the majority of these sales volumes will be delayed.”
Mr. de Solminihac concluded by saying, “The lithium market continues to demand more
supply from major players. In response to this need, our sales volumes grew over 30%
during the first half of this year when compared with 2015. We expect our sales volumes
will surpass our original expectations, and we could see sales volumes increase 25%
when compared to sales volumes seen last year. These higher volumes will be further
emphasized by the higher prices of both lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. In other
lithium news, we continue to move forward with our partner Lithium Americas on the
feasibility study related to the Caucharí-Olaroz lithium project in Argentina. We are pleased
to announce that we now expect production capacity could reach 50,000MT. This capacity
will be brought to the market in two stages of 25,000MT each, and as originally planned, we
are anticipating that construction will begin during the first half of 2017.”

Sales volumes for this business line increased slightly during the first half of 2016; sales
volumes of water soluble products outweighed those of field fertilizers. As a result, our
product mix has become more favorable, with more sales of value-added products. Prices
in this business line decreased as a result of the pressure related to lower prices in the
potassium chloride market; we have seen prices in the specialty plant nutrition business
line dropped almost 7% compared to the first quarter of this year.
We expect to see continued growth in the water soluble market, and we are well positioned
to satisfy this growing demand.
SPN gross profit(4) accounted for approximately 32% of SQM’s consolidated gross margin
for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Iodine and Derivatives
Revenues from sales of iodine and derivatives during the six months ended June 30, 2016
totaled US$118.6 million, a decrease of 14.8% compared to US$139.2 million reported for
the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Iodine and derivatives revenues for the second quarter of 2016 amounted to US$60.3

Lower iodine revenues were the result of lower prices. We continue to see a downward
trend in iodine pricing, and during the second quarter of 2016, average prices reached
US$23/kilogram, a decrease of almost 5% compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Sales volumes for the second quarter of 2016 were up over 12% compared to the second
quarter of 2015, and increased approximately 8% compared to the first quarter of this year.
While we expect the second quarter to be our strongest quarter in terms of sales volumes,
we expect to sell approximately 9,500 MT of iodine and derivatives in 2016. We maintain
our view that global iodine demand growth will be around 2% for this year.
Gross profit for the Iodine and Derivatives segment accounted for approximately 8% of
SQM’s consolidated gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Lithium and Derivatives
Revenues for lithium and derivatives totaled US$192.8 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2016, an increase of 92.1% compared to US$100.4 million recorded for the
six months ended June 30, 2015.
Revenues for lithium and derivatives during the second quarter of 2016 increased 119.9%
compared to the second quarter of 2015. Total revenues amounted to US$113.9 million
during the second quarter of 2016, compared to US$51.8 million in the second quarter of

The significant increase in revenues from sales of lithium during the first half of 2016 was
the result of both higher sales volumes and significantly higher prices. Average prices for
this business line increased close to 30% compared to the first quarter of 2016.
We continue to see very strong demand in the lithium market, primarily driven by batteries,
and we estimate that global demand growth for this year could exceed 10% compared to
2015. Future pricing in this market will depend on new supply that enters the market.
During 2016, we expect to see additional supply from Argentina and Australia;
furthermore, we expect to increase our own sales volumes over 25% this year when
compared to 2015.
Looking more long-term, we continue to move forward with our plans to develop the
Caucharí-Olaroz lithium project in Argentina. This project will bring a total capacity of
50,000MT to the market; we hope to begin construction during the first half of 2017.
Gross profit for the Lithium and Derivatives segment accounted for approximately 47% of
SQM’s consolidated gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Potassium: Potassium Chloride & Potassium Sulfate (MOP & SOP)
Potassium chloride and potassium sulfate revenues for the six months ended June 30,
2016 totaled US$181.6 million, a 17.6% decrease compared to the six months ended June
30, 2015, when revenues amounted to US$220.4 million.
Potassium chloride and potassium sulfate revenues decreased 26.6% in the second
quarter of 2016, reaching US$97.3 million, compared to US$132.5 million for the second

Revenues in the potassium chloride and potassium sulfate business line were impacted
by potassium chloride prices. Average prices from the potassium chloride and potassium
sulfate business line fell approximately 29%, reaching US$260/MT during the second
quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015. However, the average price
for potassium chloride fell to just below US$240/MT. Following the closure of contracts
between other potash producers and China, we have seen some price recovery in recent
months, and we expect an increase in average prices of potassium chloride during the
second half of the year.
Sales volumes increased over 14% during the second half of 2016 when compared to the
same period last year. Second quarter volumes were the highest quarterly volumes seen
during the past two years. We expect sales volumes in 2016 to increase over 20%
compared to sales volumes seen last year.
Current estimates for global potash demand in 2016 range between 58 and 59 million tons,
which is higher than the 2015 figure.
Gross profit for potassium chloride and potassium sulfate accounted for approximately
10% of SQM’s consolidated gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Industrial Chemicals
Industrial chemicals revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 reached US$30.5
million, 41.8% lower than US$52.5 million recorded for the six months ended June 30,
2015.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2016 totaled US$13.6 million, a decrease of 51.5%

Lower revenues in the industrial chemicals business line were the result of lower sales
volumes, sales volumes decreased approximately 45% mainly explained by the fact that
we did not have sales of solar salts during the first half of 2016. We have signed contracts
for approximately 70,000MT of solar salts which we expected to deliver in 2016, we now
believe that the majority of these deliveries could be delayed until 2017.
Gross profit for the Industrial Chemicals segment accounted for approximately 3% of
SQM’s consolidated gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Other Commodity Fertilizers & Other Income
Revenues from sales of other commodity fertilizers and other income reached US$25.8
million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, higher than the US$24.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015.
Financial Information
Capital Expenditures
After several years of significant investment, we have reached the capacity levels that we
set out to achieve. Capex for 2016 is expected to reach approximately US$150 million, and
the majority of these expenses will be related to maintenance.
With respect to the potassium nitrate expansion we announced earlier this year, we have
begun the design of the new plant, and we expect to begin construction in 2017. This plant
will use part of the productive assets at the Pedro de Valdivia site, which will allow the
Company to significantly reduce the total investment required for this project. We expect
the total investment required for this new plant will be approximately US$140 million; these
amounts should be reflected in the 2017 and 2018 capex. Production is expected to begin
in mid-2018.
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses totaled US$40.8 million (4.6% of revenues) for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to US$44.5 million (5.1% of revenues) recorded during the
six months ended June 30, 2015.
Net Financial Expenses
Net financial expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were US$25.8 million,
compared to US$29.0 million recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense reached US$57.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
representing an effective tax rate of 28.7%, compared to an income tax expense of
US$55.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The Chilean corporate tax rate
was 24.0% during the 2016 period and 22.5% during the 2015 period.
Other
The EBITDA(5) margin was approximately 39% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
EBITDA margin for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was approximately 37%.
Notes:
1)Net income refers to the comprehensive income attributable to controlling interests.
2)
3)
Gross margin corresponds to consolidated revenues less total costs, including depreciation
and amortization and excluding administrative expenses.
Solar salts are a mix of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate used for thermal energy
storage.
A significant portion of SQM’s costs of goods sold are costs related to common productive
processes (mining. crushing. leaching. etc.) which are distributed among the different final
products. To estimate gross profit by business line in both periods covered by this report, the
Company employed similar criteria on the allocation of common costs to the different business
areas. This gross margin distribution should be used only as a general and approximated
reference of the margins by business line.
EBITDA = gross profit - administrative expenses + depreciation and amortization. EBITDA
margin = EBITDA/revenues.
