CAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS REGARDING ESTIMATES OF
MEASURED, INDICATED AND INFERRED RESOURCES AND PROVEN AND PROBABLE
RESERVES
International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (“we”, “us”, “our,” “ITH” or the “Company”) is a mineral
exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. As used
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve”
and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with
Canadian National Instrument 43-101—Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-
101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”)—CIM Definition
Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as
amended. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7 (“SEC Industry Guide 7”). Under SEC Industry
Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the
three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate
reserves, and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate
governmental authority. In addition, the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”,
“indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in and required to be
disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7
and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the
SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral deposit in these
categories will ever be converted into reserves.
“Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great
uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all, or any part,
of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian
rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-
feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any
part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable.
Disclosure of “contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian
regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does
not constitute “reserves” by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to
unit measures. Accordingly, information contained in this report and the documents
incorporated by reference herein contain descriptions of our mineral deposits that may not be
comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and
disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.
The term “mineralized material” as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, although
permissible under SEC Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC Industry Guide 7
standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed
or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves”. Investors are cautioned not to
assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into
reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
CAUTIONARY NOTE TO ALL INVESTORS CONCERNING ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS THAT
INCLUDE INFERRED RESOURCES
The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests in an advanced stage
exploration project in Alaska referred to as the Livengood Gold Project (the “Livengood Gold
Project” or the “Project”). Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have no demonstrated
economic viability. The preliminary assessments on the Project are preliminary in nature and
include “inferred mineral resources” that have a great amount of uncertainty as to their
existence, and are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. It cannot be
assumed that all, or any part, of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher
category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis
of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies. There is no certainty that such inferred mineral resources
at the Project will ever be realized. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of
an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements or information within
the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning
anticipated results and developments in the operations of the Company in future periods,
planned exploration activities, the adequacy of the Company’s financial resources and other
events or conditions that may occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are frequently,
but not always, identified by words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,”
“estimates,” “potential,” “possible” and similar expressions, or statements that events,
conditions or results “will,” “may,” “could” or “should” (or the negative and grammatical
variations of any of these terms) occur or be achieved. These forward looking statements may
include, but are not limited to, statements concerning:
the potential for opportunities to improve the economics of the Livengood Gold Project by reducing
·
certain capital and operating costs;
· the potential for higher head grades at the Project;
the Company’s ability to potentially include the results of the optimization process in a new or updated
·
feasibility study or any future financial analysis of the Project;
the Company’s ability to carry forward and incorporate into future engineering studies of the Project
·
updated mine design, production schedule, and recovery concepts identified during the optimization
process;
the potential for the Company to carry out an engineering phase that will evaluate and optimize the
·
Project configuration and capital and operating expenses, including determining the optimum scale for
the Project;
the Company’s future cash requirements, the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations as they
·
come due (including payment of the derivative liability due in January 2017), and the Company’s
ability to be able to raise the necessary funds to continue operations on acceptable terms, if at all;
the proceeds from any sale of the claims related to the derivative liability being sufficient to satisfy the
·
payment due in January 2017;
the Company’s strategies and objectives, both generally and specifically in respect of the Livengood
·
Gold Project;
the Company’s belief that there are no known environmental issues that are anticipated to materially
·
impact the Company’s ability to conduct mining operations at the Project;
·the potential for the expansion of the estimated resources at the Livengood Gold Project;
·the potential for a production decision concerning, and any production at, the Livengood Gold Project;
the potential for cost savings due to the high gravity gold concentration component of some of the
·
Livengood Gold Project mineralization;
the sequence of decisions regarding the timing and costs of development programs with respect to,
·
and the issuance of the necessary permits and authorizations required for, the Livengood Gold Project;
·the Company’s estimates of the quality and quantity of the resources at the Livengood Gold Project;
the timing and cost of any future exploration programs at the Livengood Gold Project, and the timing of
·
the receipt of results therefrom; and
future general business and economic conditions, including changes in the price of gold and the
·
overall sentiment of the markets for public equity.
Such forward-looking statements reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future
events and are subject to certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Many factors could cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements, including, among others:
·the demand for, and level and volatility of the price of, gold;
· general business and economic conditions;
·government regulation and proposed legislation (and changes thereto or interpretations thereof);
defects in title to claims, or the ability to obtain surface rights, either of which could affect the
·
Company’s property rights and claims;
conditions in the financial markets generally, the overall sentiment of the markets for public equity,
·
interest rates and currency rates;
the Company’s ability to secure the necessary services and supplies on favorable terms in connection
·
with its programs at the Livengood Gold Project and other activities;
the Company’s ability to attract and retain key staff, particularly in connection with the permitting and
·
development of any mine at the Livengood Gold Project;
the accuracy of the Company’s resource estimates (including with respect to size and grade) and the
·
geological, operational and price assumptions on which these are based;
the timing of the ability to commence and complete planned work programs at the Livengood Gold
·
Project;
the timing of the receipt of and the terms of the consents, permits and authorizations necessary to carry
·
out exploration and development programs at the Livengood Gold Project and the Company’s ability to
comply with such terms on a safe and cost-effective basis;
the ongoing relations of the Company with the lessors of its property interests and applicable
·
regulatory agencies;
the metallurgy and recovery characteristics of samples from certain of the Company’s mineral
·
properties and whether such characteristics are reflective of the deposit as a whole; and
the continued development of and potential construction of any mine at the Livengood Gold Project
·
property not requiring consents, approvals, authorizations or permits that are materially different from
those identified by the Company.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein.
This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company’s forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently
uncertain, and actual achievements of the Company or other future events or conditions may
differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks,
uncertainties and other factors, including without limitation those discussed in Part I, Item 1A,
Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which
are incorporated herein by reference, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report
and the Company’s other reports filed with the SEC.
The Company’s forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are
based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management as of the date of this report.
The Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if
circumstances or management’s beliefs, expectations or opinions should change, except as
required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not attribute undue certainty
to or place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
(Expressed in US dollars – Unaudited)
1. GENERAL INFORMATION, NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY RISK
International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (“ITH” or the "Company") is incorporated under the laws of
British Columbia, Canada. The Company’s head office address is 2300-1177 West Hastings
Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. consists of ITH and its wholly owned subsidiaries Tower Hill
Mines, Inc. (“TH Alaska”) (an Alaska corporation), Tower Hill Mines (US) LLC (“TH US”) (a
Colorado limited liability company), Livengood Placers, Inc. (“LPI”) (a Nevada corporation), and
813034 Alberta Ltd. (an Alberta corporation). The Company is in the business of acquiring,
exploring and evaluating mineral properties, and either joint venturing or developing these
properties further or disposing of them when the evaluation is completed. At June 30, 2016, the
Company was in the exploration stage and controls a 100% interest in its Livengood Gold
Project in Alaska, U.S.A.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a
going-concern basis, which presumes the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the
normal course of business for the foreseeable future.
The Company will require significant additional financing to continue its operations in
connection with advancing activities at the Livengood Gold Project, to make the Additional
Payment due on January 12, 2017 (see Note 6) and for the development of any mine that may be
determined to be built at the Livengood Gold Project. There is no assurance that the Company
will be able to obtain the additional financing required on acceptable terms, if at all.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s estimate of the amount of the Additional Payment is
$14,700,000, which significantly exceeds the Company’s available cash resources, and therefore
the Company will be required to obtain significant additional financing on or before January 12,
2017 in order to be able to make this payment.
Should the Company be unable to make the Additional Payment, the Company will have 30 days
to remedy the event of default. Should the default not be remedied, the Company may be
required to deliver the underlying claims, which are not part of the project’s gold resource but
are part of the 75 square mile Livengood land package, into a trust in order for them to be sold.
Should the proceeds from sale not be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding amount of the
Additional Payment, the beneficiaries will have recourse against the Company for any shortfall.
The Company considers it highly likely that the proceeds from any such sale, should it prove
necessary, would be sufficient to satisfy the amount of the Additional Payment.
In addition, any significant delays in the issuance of required permits for the ongoing work at the
Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected results in connection with the ongoing work, could
result in the Company being required to raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts. The
Company’s review of its financing options includes pursuing a strategic alliance to assist in
further development, permitting and future construction costs.
Despite the Company’s success to date in raising significant equity financing to fund its
operations, there is significant uncertainty that the Company will be able to secure any
additional financing in the current or future equity markets. The amount of funds to be raised
and the terms of any proposed equity financing that may be undertaken will be negotiated by
management as opportunities to raise funds arise. Specific plans related to the use of proceeds
will be devised once financing has been completed and management knows what funds will be
available for these purposes. Due to this uncertainty, if the Company is unable to secure
additional financing, it will be required to reduce all discretionary activities at the Project to
preserve its working capital to fund anticipated non-discretionary expenditures beyond the 2016
fiscal year.
2.BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”)
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial
statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015 as filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company’s
management these financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position at June 30, 2016 and
the results of its operations for the six months then ended.  Operating results for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending December 31, 2016. The 2015 year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited
financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. These
judgments, estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on
management’s experience and knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances. While
management believes the estimates to be reasonable, actual results could differ from those
estimates and could impact future results of operations and cash flows.
On August 4, 2016, the Board approved these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements.
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ITH and its wholly owned
subsidiaries TH Alaska, TH US, LPI and 813034 Alberta Ltd. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.
3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these
financial instruments.
Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified into one of three levels in the fair
value hierarchy according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
·Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or
·
indirectly; and
·Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Livengood Gold Project Property
The Livengood property is located in the Tintina gold belt approximately 113 kilometers (70
miles) northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The property consists of land leased from the Alaska
Mental Health Trust, a number of smaller private mineral leases, Alaska state mining claims
purchased or located by the Company and patented ground held by the Company.
Details of the leases are as follows:
a lease of the Alaska Mental Health Trust mineral rights having a term beginning July 1, 2004 and
extending 19 years until June 30, 2023, subject to further extensions beyond June 30, 2023 by either
commercial production or payment of an advance minimum royalty equal to 125% of the amount paid
in year 19 and diligent pursuit of development. The lease requires minimum work expenditures and
advance minimum royalties (all of which minimum royalties are recoverable from production royalties)
which escalate annually with inflation. A net smelter return (“NSR”) production royalty of between
a)2.5% and 5.0% (depending upon the price of gold) is payable to the lessor with respect to the lands
subject to this lease. In addition, an NSR production royalty of l% is payable to the lessor with respect
to the unpatented federal mining claims subject to the lease described in b) below and an NSR
production royalty of between 0.5% and 1.0% (depending upon the price of gold) is payable to the
lessor with respect to the lands acquired by the Company as a result of the purchase of Livengood
Placers, Inc. in December 2011. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and from the inception
of this lease the Company has paid $326,776 and $2,302,666, respectively.

b)
a lease of federal unpatented lode mining claims having an initial term of ten years commencing on
April 21, 2003 and continuing for so long thereafter as advance minimum royalties are paid and
mining related activities, including exploration, continue on the property or on adjacent properties
controlled by the Company. The lease requires an advance minimum royalty of $50,000 on or before
each anniversary date (all of which minimum royalties are recoverable from production royalties). An
NSR production royalty of between 2% and 3% (depending on the price of gold) is payable to the
lessors. The Company may purchase 1% of the royalty for $1,000,000. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and from the inception of this lease the Company has paid $50,000 and $630,000,
respectively.
c)
a lease of patented lode mining claims having an initial term of ten years commencing January 18,
2007, and continuing for so long thereafter as advance minimum royalties are paid. The lease
requires an advance minimum royalty of $20,000 on or before each anniversary date through January
18, 2017 and $25,000 on or before each subsequent anniversary (all of which minimum royalties are
recoverable from production royalties). An NSR production royalty of 3% is payable to the lessors.
The Company may purchase all interests of the lessors in the leased property (including the
production royalty) for $1,000,000 (less all minimum and production royalties paid to the date of
purchase), of which $500,000 is payable in cash over four years following the closing of the purchase
and the balance of $500,000 is payable by way of the 3% NSR production royalty. During the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and from the inception of this lease the Company has paid $20,000 and
$165,000, respectively.
a lease of unpatented federal lode mining and federal unpatented placer claims having an initial term
of ten years commencing on March 28, 2007, and continuing for so long thereafter as advance
minimum royalties are paid and mining related activities, including exploration, continue on the
property or on adjacent properties controlled by the Company. The lease requires an advance
d)
minimum royalty of $15,000 on or before each anniversary date (all of which minimum royalties are
recoverable from production royalties). The Company is required to pay the lessor the sum of
$250,000 upon making a positive production decision, payable $125,000 within 120 days of the
decision and $125,000 within a year of the decision (all of which are recoverable from production
royalties). An NSR production royalty of 2% is payable to the lessor. The Company may purchase all
of the interest of the lessor in the leased property (including the production royalty) for $1,000,000.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and from the inception of this lease the Company has
paid $15,000 and $113,000, respectively.
Title to mineral properties
The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a detailed and time-consuming process. The
Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest.
Although the Company has taken every reasonable precaution to ensure that legal title to its
properties is properly recorded in the name of the Company, there can be no assurance that
such title will ultimately be secured.

DERIVATIVE LIABILITY
During 2011, the Company acquired certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the
Livengood Gold Project located near Fairbanks, Alaska. The aggregate consideration for the
claims and rights was $13,500,000 in cash plus an additional payment based on the five-year
average daily gold price (“Average Gold Price”) from the date of the acquisition (“Additional
Payment”). The Additional Payment will equal $23,148 for every dollar that the Average Gold
Price exceeds $720 per troy ounce. If the Average Gold Price is less than $720, there will be no
additional consideration due.
At initial recognition on December 13, 2011 the derivative liability was valued at $23,100,000. The
key assumption used in the valuation of the derivative is the estimate of the future Average Gold
Price. The estimate of the future Average Gold Price was determined using a forward curve on
future gold prices as published by the CME Group. Using this forward curve, the Company
estimated an Average Gold Price based on actual gold prices to June 30, 2016 and projected
gold prices from June 30, 2016 to the end of the five year period in December 2016 of $1,355 per
ounce of gold.
The fair value of the derivative liability and the estimated Average Gold Price are as follows:

of the Company’s capital stock that may be made issuable pursuant to options granted under
the 2006 Plan may not exceed 10% of the number of issued shares of the Company at the time of
the granting of the options. Options granted under the 2006 Plan will have a maximum term of
ten years. The exercise price of options granted under the 2006 Plan shall be fixed in
compliance with the applicable provisions of the TSX Company Manual in force at the time of
grant and, in any event, shall not be less than the closing price of the Company’s common
shares on the TSX on the trading day immediately preceding the day on which the option is
granted, or such other price as may be agreed to by the Company and accepted by the Toronto
Stock Exchange. Options granted under the 2006 Plan vest immediately, unless otherwise
determined by the directors at the date of grant.

9.COMMITMENTS
The following table discloses, as of June 30, 2016, the Company’s contractual obligations
including anticipated mineral property payments and work commitments. Under the terms of the
Company’s mineral property purchase agreements, mineral leases and the terms of the
unpatented mineral claims held by it, the Company is required to make certain scheduled
acquisition payments, incur certain levels of expenditures, make lease or advance royalty
payments, make payments to government authorities and incur assessment work expenditures
as summarized in the table below in order to maintain and preserve the Company’s interests in
the related mineral properties. If the Company is unable or unwilling to make any such payments
or incur any such expenditure, it is likely that the Company would lose or forfeit its rights to
acquire or hold the related mineral properties. The following table assumes that the Company
retains the rights to all of its current mineral properties, but does not exercise any lease
purchase or royalty buyout options:

The amount payable on January 12, 2017 of $14,700,000 represents the fair value of the Company’s
derivative liability as at June 30, 2016 and will be revalued at each subsequent reporting period. See
Note 6.
Does not include required work expenditures, as it is assumed that the required expenditure level is
significantly below the level of work that will actually be carried out by the Company. Does not
include potential royalties that may be payable (other than annual minimum royalty payments). See
Note 4.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
The Company incurred a net loss of $2,068,850 for the three month period ended June 30, 2016,
compared to a net loss of $2,048,868 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015.
Mineral property expenditures increased $351,450 to $1,179,662 for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 from $828,212 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the
Company moving forward with a multi-phase metallurgical test work program and limiting field
activities to continuation of critical environmental baseline studies.
Excluding share-based payments, investor relations expense decreased to $27,424 during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $55,994 during the three months ended June
30, 2015 as the Company continues its efforts to lower travel and marketing costs.
Consulting and professional fees were $112,613 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $186,470 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease of $73,857 is
primarily due to the Company negotiating lower rates in 2016 for various third party-provided
professional fees such as legal and accounting fees.
Share-based payment charges
Share-based payment charges for the three month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were
allocated as follows:
Expense category:  June 30, 2016  June 30, 2015 
 
 $ 3,588
Consulting
 
Investor relations
   1,005

Share-based payment charges were $15,644 during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $92,279 during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease of $76,635 in
share-based payment charges during the period was mainly the result of a reduction in the fair
value of options granted in 2015 as compared to 2014.
Most other expense categories reflected moderate decreases period over period reflecting the
Company’s efforts to reduce spending.
Other items amounted to a loss of $61,227 during the three month period ended June 30, 2016
compared to a loss of $198,091 during the three month period ended June 30, 2015. Total other
loss resulted from the unrealized loss on the revaluation of the derivative liability of $100,000.
This unrealized loss was caused by the increase in the price per ounce of gold during the three
month period ended June 30, 2016 and is compared to an unrealized loss of $100,000 during the
three month period ended June 30, 2015. The Company had a foreign exchange gain of $2,098
during the three month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $131,360 during the
three month period ended June 30, 2015 as a result of the impact of exchange rates on certain of
the Company’s U.S. dollar cash balances. The average exchange rate during the three month
period ended June 30, 2016 was C$1 to US$0.7761 compared to C$1 to US$0.8132 for the three
month period ended June 30, 2015.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
The Company incurred a net loss of $4,556,306 for the six month period ended June 30, 2016,
compared to a net loss of $2,685,363 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015.
Mineral property expenditures increased $746,625 to $1,976,167 for the six months ended June
30, 2016 from $1,229,542 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the Company
moving forward with a multi-phase metallurgical test work program and limiting field activities to
continuation of critical environmental baseline studies. Consulting and professional fees for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $155,348 from the six month period ended June
30, 2015 as the Company negotiated lower rates in 2016 for various third party-provided
professional fees such as legal and accounting fees.
Excluding share-based payments, investor relations expense decreased to $44,900 during the
six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $75,041 during the six months ended June 30,
2015 as the Company continues its efforts to lower travel and marketing costs.
Share-based payment charges
Share-based payment charges for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were
allocated as follows:
Expense category:  June 30, 2016  June 30, 2015 
 $ 18,154

 $ 76,295
$ 74,065
    18,039
    269,887
  $ 361,991
Share-based payment charges were $76,295 during the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $361,991 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease of $285,696 in
share-based payment charges during the period was primarily the result of a reduction in the fair
value of options granted in 2015 as compared to 2014. The Company granted no options during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2,135,200 during the six months ended June
30, 2015.
Remaining other expense categories reflected moderate decreases period over period reflecting
the Company’s efforts to reduce spending.
Other items amounted to a loss of $878,269 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016
compared to a gain of $720,520 during the six month period ended June 30, 2015. Total other
loss resulted from the unrealized loss on the revaluation of the derivative liability of $800,000.
This unrealized loss was caused by the increase in the price per ounce of gold during the six
month period ended June 30, 2016 and is compared to an unrealized gain of $100,000 during the
six month period ended June 30, 2015. The Company had a foreign exchange loss of $121,764
during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to a foreign exchange gain of
$570,895 during the six month period ended June 30, 2015. The average exchange rate during
the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was C$1 to US$0.7518 compared to C$1 to US$0.8095
for the six month period ended June 30, 2015.
17
Liquidity Risk and Capital Resources
The Company has no revenue generating operations from which it can internally generate
funds. To date, the Company’s ongoing operations have been predominantly financed through
sale of its equity securities by way of private placements and the subsequent exercise of share
purchase and broker warrants and options issued in connection with such private placements.
However, the exercise of warrants/options is dependent primarily on the market price and
overall market liquidity of the Company’s securities at or near the expiry date of such
warrants/options (over which the Company has no control) and therefore there can be no
guarantee that any existing warrants/options will be exercised. There are currently no warrants
outstanding.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,888,471 compared to
$6,493,486 at December 31, 2015. The decrease of approximately $3.6 million resulted mainly
from expenditures on the Livengood Gold Project of approximately $3.9 million offset by a
positive foreign currency translation impact of approximately $0.3 million. The Company
continues to utilize its cash resources to pursue opportunities identified in the September 2013
Study and subsequently identified by the Company, to fund environmental activities required for
preservation of baseline database and future permitting as well as to complete corporate
administrative requirements.
The Company had no cash flows from investing activities or financing activities during the six
month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $11,901,129 compared to
working capital of $6,169,233 at December 31, 2015. The negative working capital is mainly the
result of the reclassification of the contingent derivative payment to a current liability. The
Company expects that it will operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, but believes the current
cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for it to complete its anticipated 2016 work plan at
the Livengood Gold Project and continue to operate until at least June 30, 2017. To advance the
Livengood Gold Project towards permitting and development, the Company anticipates
maintaining certain essential development activities for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2016. These essential activities include maintaining environmental baseline data that in its
absence could materially delay future permitting of the Livengood Gold Project.
The Company will require significant additional financing to continue its operations (including
general and administrative expenses) in connection with advancing activities at the Livengood
Gold Project, the contingent payment due in January 2017 and the development of any mine that
may be determined to be built at the Livengood Gold Project, and there is no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain the additional financing required on acceptable terms, if at all. As
at June 30, 2016, the Company’s estimate of the amount of the contingent payment is
$14,700,000. This contingent payment, which is due in January 2017, significantly exceeds the
Company’s available cash resources, and therefore the Company will be required to secure
significant additional financing on or before January 2017 in order to be able to make this
payment. See Note 1 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements for the period ended June 30, 2016. In addition, any significant delays in the
issuance of required permits for the ongoing work at the Livengood Gold Project, or unexpected
results in connection with the ongoing work, could result in the Company being required to
raise additional funds to advance permitting efforts. The Company’s review of its financing
options includes pursuing a future strategic alliance to assist in further development, permitting
and future construction costs.
Despite the Company’s success to date in raising significant equity financing to fund its
operations, there is significant uncertainty that the Company will be able to secure any
additional financing in the current or future equity markets. See “Risk Factors – We will require
additional financing to fund exploration and, if warranted, development and production. Failure
to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operation and could cast uncertainty on our ability to continue as a going concern” in
Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. The quantity of funds to be raised and the terms of any proposed equity financing that
may be undertaken will be negotiated by management as opportunities to raise funds arise.
Specific plans related to the use of proceeds will be devised once financing has been completed
and management knows what funds will be available for these purposes. Due to this uncertainty,
if the Company is unable to secure additional financing, it will be required to reduce all
discretionary activities at the Project to preserve its working capital to fund anticipated non-
discretionary expenditures during and beyond the 2016 fiscal year.
Other than cash held by its subsidiaries for their immediate operating needs in the United
States, all of the Company’s cash reserves are on deposit with a major Canadian chartered
bank. The Company does not believe that the credit, liquidity or market risks with respect
thereto have increased as a result of the current market conditions.
18
Contractual Obligations
The following table discloses, as of June 30, 2016, the Company’s contractual obligations
including anticipated mineral property payments and work commitments. Under the terms of the
Company’s mineral property purchase agreements, mineral leases and the terms of the
unpatented mineral claims held by it, the Company is required to make certain scheduled
acquisition payments, incur certain levels of expenditures, make lease or advance royalty
payments, make payments to government authorities and incur assessment work expenditures
as summarized in the table below in order to maintain and preserve the Company’s interests in
the related mineral properties. If the Company is unable or unwilling to make any such payments
or incur any such expenditure, it is likely that the Company would lose or forfeit its rights to
acquire or hold the related mineral properties. The following table assumes that the Company
retains the rights to all of its current mineral properties, but does not exercise any lease
purchase or royalty buyout options:

The amount payable on January 12, 2017 of $14,700,000 represents the fair value of the Company’s
derivative liability as at June 30, 2016 and will be revalued at each subsequent reporting period.
Does not include required work expenditures, as it is assumed that the required expenditure level is
significantly below the level of work that will actually be carried out by the Company. Does not
include potential royalties that may be payable (other than annual minimum royalty payments).
Other – Related Party Transactions
In December 2011, in accordance with a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the
“Agreement”) between the Company, Alaska/Nevada Gold Mines, Ltd. (“AN Gold Mines”) and
the Heflinger Group, the Company acquired certain mining claims and related rights in the
vicinity of the Livengood Gold Project located near Fairbanks, Alaska. The Company’s
derivative liability, as described in Note 6 of the financial statements for the period ended June
30, 2016, represents the remaining consideration for the purchase of these claims and related
rights and is payable in January 2017. Under the Agreement, the payment is due 70% to AN Gold
Mines and 30% to the Heflinger Group.
Mr. Hanneman was appointed Chief Operating Officer of the Company on March 26, 2015. Mr.
Hanneman is a partner of the general partner, as well as a limited partner, of AN Gold Mines and
holds an 11.9% net interest in AN Gold Mines.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
Environmental Regulations
The operations of the Company may in the future be affected from time to time in varying
degrees by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future removal and site
restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the
Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Company’s policy is to meet or, if possible,
surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and
economically feasible measures.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders
The Company has been a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in recent years and expects to continue to be a PFIC in the future.  Current
and prospective U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of PFIC classification and the U.S. federal tax treatment of PFICs.  Additional
information on this matter is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, under “Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Certain U.S. Federal
Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders.”

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Not applicable.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of June 30, 2016, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).
Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted to the
SEC under the Exchange Act: (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that
allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures, however well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the
system will be met and is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgement in
designing, implementing and evaluating controls and procedures and the assumptions used in
identifying the likelihood of future events.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a
subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to
disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These
reporting requirement are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines
under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by
the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). During the six
month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries were not subject to
regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section
1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
