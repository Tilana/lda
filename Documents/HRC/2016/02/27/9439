<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 2/102 
and provides an update on recent activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the protection and promotion of human rights while countering terrorism.   
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner addresses the protection and promotion of all human rights, as 
well as effective counter-terrorism measures, as complementary and mutually reinforcing 
objectives which must be pursued together as part of States&#8217; duty to protect.  The report outlines 
the position of the High Commissioner in relation to specific human rights concerns which arise 
in international cooperation in countering terrorism, notably those related to the detention and 
transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activity; procedural obligations; and individual 
sanctions against terrorist suspects.  The report concludes with the identification of a number of 
practical challenges related to judicial cooperation in the context of counter-terrorism.

</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of [her] activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.  On the current issue of the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, a comprehensive annual 
report (E/CN.4/2006/94) was submitted to the sixty-second session of the Commission on 
Human Rights pursuant to its resolution 2005/80.  The information in the report remains 
relevant, and is complemented by the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the 
General Assembly (A/61/353) pursuant to resolution 60/158.  The Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights understands decision 2/102 as preserving the previous 
annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the Council.  The 
current report to the Human Rights Council accordingly addresses developments in respect of 
the protection of human rights while countering terrorism over the last year. 
</p>
<p>2. I continue to address the protection and promotion of all human rights, as well as 
effective counter-terrorism measures, as complementary and mutually reinforcing objectives 
which must be pursued together as part of States&#8217; duty to protect.  In this context, my Office has 
concentrated on enhancing the protection of human rights and the rule of law in the context of 
terrorism and counter-terrorism, notably by strengthening the capacity of security, intelligence 
and law enforcement agencies to better integrate human rights standards in their work; 
promoting the human rights of victims of terrorism; and addressing the conditions conducive to 
exploitation by terrorists. 
</p>
<p>3. The achievement of these goals is central to the effective implementation of the 
United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006, which situates human rights as the fundamental basis of 
the fight against terrorism and emphasizes that States must ensure that any measure taken to 
combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular human 
rights law.  My Office is hosting a number of expert meetings and seminars to help clarify and 
better define Member States&#8217; human rights obligations in relation to counter-terrorism; 
producing tools to assist practitioners; providing technical assistance to Member States, upon 
their request, in developing human rights-compliant counter-terrorism legislation and policies; 
and supporting relevant United Nations mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>4. In the current reporting period, I have continued to examine specific challenges to the 
protection of human rights in the context of terrorism, notably challenges to international 
cooperation and the rule of law in counter-terrorism and human rights.  In recent years, terrorism 
and counter-terrorism measures have had a major impact on the administration of justice in 
countries throughout the world.  Domestic and foreign policies have been shaped by States&#8217; 
responses to the threats posed by terrorism.  States have a duty to protect those within their 
jurisdiction against terrorist attacks and there is a clear public interest in supporting effective 
counter-terrorism measures.  However, these measures must be taken within the framework of 
international human rights law.  Practices such as &#8220;irregular&#8221; transfers of persons suspected of 
involvement in terrorist activities, the detention of individuals without due process, the use of 
interrogation methods that are impermissible under international law, and the use of secret 
evidence and evidence obtained by torture, are of serious concern.  The purpose of the present </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>report is to further clarify the nature and scope of States&#8217; obligations in relation to 
non-refoulement in cases involving a real risk of torture, as well as other human rights abuses; 
address the human rights implications of targeted sanctions against individuals suspected of 
terrorist activity; and identify some of the practical challenges to effective judicial cooperation in 
relation to counter-terrorism, including issues related to the use of intelligence information, 
exchange of evidence, and information-sharing. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RECENT ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>5. In November 2006, my Office and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) jointly 
organized a Workshop on Human Rights and International Cooperation in Counter-Terrorism.  
The meeting was hosted by the Government of Liechtenstein, with participation by the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs, the Prosecutor-General and the Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein 
to the United Nations in New York.  Approximately 50 people attended the workshop lasting 
two and a half days.  Discussions took place under the Chatham House Rule (confidentiality of 
meetings facilitates free speech)  and provided an opportunity for security experts and legal 
advisers from ministries of the interior, justice, defence and foreign affairs in various OSCE 
participating States, as well as human rights and international law experts, to engage in an open 
and constructive dialogue on human rights challenges that Governments, and others, currently 
are facing in countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>6. Key objectives of the workshop were to identify and discuss international human rights 
obligations and commitments of OSCE participating States in the field of international 
cooperation in matters related to combating terrorism and to assist States in ensuring that 
measures taken to counter terrorism comply with their obligations under international human 
rights law.  The workshop focused on issues related to the transfer of individuals suspected of 
terrorist activity, including the principle of non-refoulement, procedural guarantees and due 
process in the context of transferring individuals.  Participants also discussed issues related to 
exchange of evidence and information-sharing, as well as individual sanctions such as asset 
freezing and the human rights implications of national and international listing mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>7. In the present report, I address some of the issues raised at the expert workshop and 
identify a number of challenges for further consideration.  Other regions would benefit from a 
similar analysis of regional case law and practice. 
</p>
<p><b>III. HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
IN COUNTER-TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Non-refoulement 
</b></p>
<p>8. As part of its efforts to counter terrorism, a State may legitimately detain persons 
suspected of terrorist activity.  I note with concern, however, that in some cases individuals 
suspected of involvement in terrorist activity have been detained and transferred in a manner 
which takes place outside the practical reach of established national and international legal 
frameworks.  Where any measure involves the deprivation of an individual&#8217;s liberty, compliance 
with international and regional human rights law related to liberty and security of persons, the 
right to recognition before the law and the right to due process is essential. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. I continue to be concerned by the use by some States of diplomatic assurances, 
memoranda of understanding, and other forms of diplomatic agreement to justify the return or 
irregular transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activity to countries where they may face a 
real risk of torture or other serious human rights abuse.  There is well-established case law and 
evidence to demonstrate that such arrangements do not work as they do not provide adequate 
protection against torture and ill-treatment.  Diplomatic assurances do not nullify the obligation 
of non-refoulement, which requires that States refrain from returning an individual to a territory 
where there is a real risk of ill-treatment.  In most cases, assurances are concluded between 
States which are party to binding international and regional treaties which prohibit torture and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and refoulement to such practices.  Ad hoc 
agreements concluded outside the international human rights legal framework threaten to weaken 
this system and erode the human rights principles in which it is firmly grounded.  Efforts should 
focus on the full implementation of international human rights obligations through existing 
structures, notably through the establishment of systems of regular visits, by independent 
international and national bodies, of places where people are deprived of their liberty.  Under 
States&#8217; international human rights obligations, States must take active measures to investigate 
allegations where there is credible information that individuals are being transported by or 
through a State&#8217;s jurisdiction to a place where they face a real risk of torture. 
10. The principle of non-refoulement is recognized explicitly in article 33, paragraph 1, of 
the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and in article 3 of the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as in 
article 16 of the newly adopted International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance.  It is also reflected in article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Human Rights Committee has interpreted to include an 
obligation on States not to expose individuals to &#8220;the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of their extradition, 
expulsion or refoulement&#8221;<b>1</b> and, at regional level, in article 3 of the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>11. A Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights reaffirmed the unqualified 
nature of the prohibition on refoulement in its decision in <i>Chahal v. The United Kingdom</i>, 
noting that the prohibition is absolute and is not subject to exceptions, even in cases where State 
security is at stake.<b>2</b>  In the context of counter-terrorism, however, the absolute nature of the 
prohibition is under challenge.  For example, certain Governments currently are seeking to test 
the absolute nature of the legal prohibition on refoulement as set out in <i>Chahal</i> through 
their interventions as third parties before the European Court of Human Rights in

expelled, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3) 
in the receiving country.&#8221;  See also Louise Arbour, &#8220;In our name and on our behalf&#8221;, 
<i>International and Comparative Law Quarterly,</i> vol. 55, No. 511 (2006), p. 517, footnote 15. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>Ramzy v. the Netherlands</i> (application No. 25424/05), a case involving a complaint under 
article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The applicant argues that, if removed 
from the Netherlands to Algeria, he will be exposed to a real risk of torture or ill-treatment at the 
hands of the Algerian authorities.  The interveners argue that, even if such a risk exists, the 
principle of non-refoulement should be balanced against the security interests of the State. 
</p>
<p>12. I recall the well-established principle in international law which provides that, where 
there is a real risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in a 
receiving State, the prohibition of refoulement is absolute and may not be subject to any 
derogation, qualification or limitation.  The principle is often considered a procedural rule which 
is implicit in, and complements, the general prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment.  However, the obligation also applies in cases involving 
other serious human rights violations.  For example, the Human Rights Committee has stated 
that article 2 of ICCPR, which requires that States parties respect and ensure the Covenant rights 
for all persons in their territory and all persons under their control, &#8220;entails an obligation not to 
extradite, deport, expel or otherwise remove a person from their territory, where there are 
substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of irreparable harm, such as that 
contemplated by articles 6 and 7 of the Covenant, either in the country to which removal is to be 
effected or in any country to which the person may subsequently be removed&#8221;.<b>3</b>  While the 
Committee does not define which violations may amount to &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221;, at a minimum 
this would include arbitrary deprivation of the right to life and enforced disappearances, in 
addition to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Exposure to a 
manifestly unfair trial may similarly amount to such harm.  Similarly, regional human rights 
courts as well as national courts have accepted the applicability of non-refoulement in relation to 
the European Convention on Human Rights provisions on torture and other ill-treatment (art. 3) 
and flagrant denial of justice (art. 6).  There is also evidence to suggest that the protection 
afforded under article 6 of the European Convention extends to the practice of plea bargaining as 
this may compromise the right to a fair trial.  Although not yet in force, the European Union 
Charter of Fundamental Rights reflects the practice of the European Court of Human Rights and 
provides that &#8220;[n]o one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serous 
risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment&#8221; (art. 19 (2)). 
</p>
<p>13. The transfer of an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism may have other 
serious human rights implications.  For example, the transfer and detention of an individual 
inevitably poses a direct threat to the family life of that individual, notably because family 
members are often effectively prevented from contact and dependants may be deprived of their 
source of livelihood.  From the perspective of international human rights law, the extent to which 
the obligation of non-refoulement applies in relation to transfers which may involve a risk of 
human rights violations such as the right to family life is not yet clear.  I will continue to reflect 
on the scope of the principle of non-refoulement in the context of counter-terrorism. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the risk assessment for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment in individual cases, I note with concern that the different standards 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31, para. 12. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>applied at national level by States may be an impediment to the consistent application of 
non-refoulement in the context of counter-terrorism.  Article 3 of the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires &#8220;substantial grounds 
for believing that [the individual] would be in danger of being subjected to torture&#8221; which, 
according to Committee against Torture, requires &#8220;grounds that go beyond mere theory or 
suspicion&#8221;.<b>4</b>  The Human Rights Committee has stated that the non-refoulement obligation arises 
&#8220;where there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of irreparable harm&#8221;,<b>5</b> 
while the European Court of Human Rights requires &#8220;substantial grounds ... for believing that an 
individual would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to article 3&#8221;.<b>6</b>  At the 
national level, however, some Member States have applied a lower standard in assessing the risk, 
for example by requiring that the risk of torture or ill-treatment be &#8220;more likely than not&#8221;.  All 
States should ensure that legislation at national level in relation to torture is consistent with the 
Convention against Torture, including appropriate penalties, in order to meet their obligations 
under international law to prevent and eliminate torture in all its forms. 
</p>
<p>15. The Committee against Torture has provided some guidance on the evaluation of risk of 
torture, an assessment which should seek to establish whether the individual concerned would be 
at personal risk of torture in the country to which he or she would be returned.  According to the 
Committee, &#8220;the existence of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violation of human 
rights in a country does not of itself constitute sufficient grounds for determining whether the 
person in question would be at risk of being subjected to torture upon return to that country&#8221;, 
&#8220;nor does the absence of such a situation mean that a person cannot be considered at risk of 
being subjected to torture&#8221;.<b>7</b>  An assessment must take place on a case-by-case basis, on grounds 
that go beyond mere theory or suspicion.  For both practical and legal reasons, in cases related to 
the transfer of individuals from one country to another, the burden of proof should remain with 
the transferring State to produce relevant information about the risk of torture and ill-treatment in 
the receiving country. 
</p>
<p>16. Above all, national counter-terrorism strategies should seek to prevent acts of terrorism, 
prosecute those responsible for such criminal acts, and promote and protect human rights and the 
rule of law.  In this regard I underscore the importance of respect for the principle of <i>aut dedere 
aut iudicare</i> (&#8220;extradite or prosecute&#8221;).  While recognizing the significant challenges faced by 
States in dealing with individuals suspected of terrorist activity who remain within their 
jurisdiction, wherever possible such individuals should be prosecuted under national criminal 
legislation.  From a security and law enforcement perspective, the most effective 
counter-terrorism strategies involve efforts by the State to allow individuals suspected of

<p>

</p>
<p>terrorism to remain in the country for the purposes of intelligence-gathering and monitoring, 
while adhering strictly to human rights and the rule of law.  In any case, States must respect the 
principle of non-refoulement as vital to ensuring the prevention of torture. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Procedural obligations 
</b></p>
<p>17. States have an obligation to conduct any transfer of detainees in a manner which is 
transparent and consistent with human rights and the rule of law, including the right to respect 
for a person&#8217;s inherent dignity, the right of everyone to recognition before the law and the right 
to due process.  The international human rights legal framework requires that any deprivation of 
liberty be based upon grounds and procedures established by law, that detainees be informed of 
the reasons for the detention and promptly notified of the charges against them, and that they be 
provided with access to legal counsel.  In addition, prompt and effective oversight of detention 
by a judicial officer must be ensured to verify the legality of the detention and to protect other 
fundamental rights of the detainee.  Even in states of emergency, minimum access to legal 
counsel and prescribed reasonable limits upon the length of preventative detention remain 
mandatory.  Moreover, national authorities have an obligation to prevent human rights abuses 
and to actively investigate and prosecute any allegation of practices which may involve the 
transfer or detention of individuals in a manner inconsistent with international law. 
</p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Committee has held that denying individuals contact with family and 
others violates the States&#8217; obligation under ICCPR to treat prisoners with humanity.  It has also 
stressed the importance of provisions requiring that detainees should be held in places that are 
publicly recognized and that there must be proper registration of the names of detainees and 
places of detention.  The prohibition against unacknowledged detention, taking of hostages or 
abductions, and enforced disappearance is absolute.  The seriousness of these violations is 
reflected in the newly adopted International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, article 2 of which defines an enforced disappearance as &#8220;the arrest, 
detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty committed by agents of the State 
or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the 
State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the 
fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection 
of the law&#8221;.  The Convention affirms the right of a victim to know the truth about the 
circumstances of an enforced disappearance and the fate of the disappeared person, and the right 
to freedom to seek, receive and impart information to this end.  It provides that each State party 
should take appropriate measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence 
under its criminal law.  Furthermore, the widespread or systematic practice of enforced 
disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and 
shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law. 
</p>
<p>19. Procedural challenges related to the obligation of non-refoulement may also arise in the 
context of immigration and refugee law.  For example, in some States concerns have been raised 
with regard to the possible misuse and abuse of refugee and immigration procedures by 
individuals suspected of terrorist activity, while others have expressed concerns related to the 
right of an individual to appeal against a denial of refugee status. 
</p>
<p>20. In this regard, reference should be made to the flexibilities built in to the framework of 
international human rights law and international refugee law, which contains a number of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provisions for guarding against abuses.  For example, article 14, paragraph 2, of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights states that the right to seek and enjoy asylum &#8220;may not be invoked 
in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to 
the purposes and principles of the United Nations&#8221;.  Similarly, article 33, paragraph 2, of the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees limits the ambit of the rule against refoulement where &#8220;there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in 
which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgement of a particularly serious crime, 
constitutes a danger to the community of that country&#8221;.  Where a person has already been 
granted refugee status, that status may be cancelled where there is new evidence which, had it 
been available at the time that the refugee application was considered, would have led to a 
refusal of status.  Moreover, the obligations under the Refugee Convention do not apply to the 
country of refuge where the exclusion clauses under article 1F of the Convention are applicable.  
In particular, article 1F (b) of the Convention relates to the commission by the applicant of 
serious non-political crimes, which may include acts of terrorism, prior to the person&#8217;s admission 
to the country of refuge.  States should make every effort to ensure the scrupulous application of 
the provisions reflected in articles 1F and 33 (2), paragraph 2, of the Convention.  Even in these 
cases, however, the human rights prohibition against refoulement continues to apply. 
</p>
<p>21. All States have a positive obligation to ensure that their territory is not used to transfer 
persons to places where they are likely to be subjected to torture, including taking all practical 
steps to determine whether foreign movements through its territory involve such practices 
whether are grounds so to believe.  However, there are a number of practical challenges in this 
regard facing States whose territory is used to facilitate the transfer of an individual terrorism 
suspect.  For example, what procedures should a State impose as a minimum obligation to satisfy 
these positive obligations and ensure that it is not complicit in the practice of &#8220;irregular&#8221; 
transfers? 
</p>
<p>22. At a minimum, States must ensure that any transfer of persons from one territory to 
another are undertaken pursuant to a prescription by law and within the framework of 
international law.  In addition, judicial oversight and review must be available prior to any 
transfer, and investigations must be undertaken in response to credible allegations of rendition 
involving a real risk of torture.  In any event, an assessment of all the circumstances should be 
made, including the prior practice on the part of the transiting State; the origin and destination of 
the transiting aircraft or vehicle; the preparedness or otherwise of the transiting State to share 
information and/or provide assurances; and, in the case of aircraft, the status of the aircraft under 
article 4 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Individual sanctions 
</b></p>
<p>23. Targeted sanctions against individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity may 
be an effective tool in States&#8217; efforts to combat terrorism.  For example, the freezing of an 
individual&#8217;s financial assets or the imposition of a travel ban may be important means for 
tracking, and even preventing, terrorist activity.  However, the current international regime of 
sanctions against individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity poses a number of 
serious challenges to human rights.  The human rights implications of national and international 
listing mechanisms for terrorist organizations and individuals suspected of terrorist activity,</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>including listings at United Nations and regional levels leading to asset freezing, merit particular 
consideration in light of the severe consequences an individual listing can have for the 
individual, as well as his or her family and community. 
</p>
<p>24. The current system of targeted sanctions against selected persons or non-State entities 
includes general anti-terrorism measures under Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) and 
al-Qaeda/Taliban sanctions under Security Council resolution 1267 (1999).  The listing of a 
person or an entity under Security Council resolution 1267 (1999), and subsequent resolutions 
including resolution 1390 (2002), entails a duty on all Member States to adopt a number of 
sanctions measures against listed individuals and entities, including travel bans and assets 
freezing.  Decisions on whether to place an individual or entity on the sanctions list are made 
by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) 
(the 1267 Committee) on the basis of information provided by a Member State, and delisting 
can only occur with the unanimous consent of Committee members or by a decision of the 
Security Council.  At regional level, the Council of the European Union has established a system 
of individual sanctions through the adoption of detailed Common Positions and Regulations, for 
the implementation of Security Council listings. 
</p>
<p>25. While the system of targeted sanctions represents an important improvement over the 
former system of comprehensive sanctions, it nonetheless continues to pose a number of serious 
human rights concerns related to the lack of transparency and due process in listing and delisting 
procedures.  For example, at present, there is no mechanism for reviewing the accuracy of the 
information behind a sanctions committee listing or the necessity for, and proportionality of, 
sanctions adopted, nor does the individual affected have a right of access to an independent 
review body at the international level.  The only recourse for review of individuals and entities 
that may be wrongly listed, for example, is for the individual or entity to approach the 
Security Council through their State of nationality or residence.  While a full consideration of 
these human rights concerns is beyond the scope of this paper, in brief, they include questions 
related to: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <i>Respect for due process rights</i>:  Individuals affected by a United Nations listing 
procedure effectively are essentially denied the right to a fair hearing; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <i>Standards of proof and evidence</i> <i>in listing procedures</i>:  While targeted sanctions 
against individuals clearly have a punitive character, there is no uniformity in relation 
to evidentiary standards and procedures; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <i>Notification</i>:  Member States are responsible for informing their nationals that they 
have been listed, but often this does not happen.  Individuals have a right to know the 
reasons behind a listing decision, as well as the procedures available for challenging a 
decision; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <i>Time period</i> <i>of individual sanctions</i>:  Individual listings normally do not include an 
&#8220;end date&#8221; to the listing, which may result in a temporary freeze of assets becoming 
permanent.  The longer an individual is on a list, the more punitive the effect will be; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <i>Accessibility</i>:  Only States have standing in the current United Nations sanctions 
regime, which assumes that the State will act on behalf of the individual.  In practice, 
often this does not happen and individuals are effectively excluded from a process 
which may have a direct punitive impact on them; and 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <i>Remedies</i>:  There is a lack of consideration to remedies available to individuals whose 
human rights have been violated in the sanctions process. 
</p>
<p>26. These concerns were reflected in the World Summit Outcome Document 
(see General Assembly resolution 60/1), which calls upon the Security Council, with the support 
of the Secretary-General, &#8220;to ensure that fair and clear procedures exist for placing individuals 
and entities on sanctions lists and removing them, as well as for granting humanitarian 
exemptions&#8221;.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Pursuant to this mandate, which was enshrined in paragraph 109 of General Assembly 
resolution 60/1, the Secretary-General tasked the Office of Legal Affairs - in close cooperation 
with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Department of Political 
Affairs - with beginning an interdepartmental process to develop proposals and guidelines that 
would be available for the consideration of the Security Council.<b>9</b>  On the basis of this process, 
the Secretary-General drafted a non-paper, setting out his views concerning the listing and 
delisting of individuals and entities on sanctions lists, which he sent to the members of the 
Security Council for their consideration.  On 22 June 2006, the Security Council held an open 
thematic debate on &#8220;Strengthening international law:  rule of law and maintenance of 
international peace and security&#8221;.  In a statement in the framework of this debate, the Legal 
Counsel referred to the Secretary-General&#8217;s non-paper, stating that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the non-paper, the minimum standards required to ensure that the 
procedures are fair and transparent would include the following four basic elements: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;First, a person against whom measures have been taken by the Council has the 
right to be informed of those measures and to know the case against him or her as 
soon as and to the extent possible.  The notification should include a statement of 
the case and information as to how requests for review and exemptions may be 
made.  An adequate statement of the case requires the prior determination of clear 
criteria for listing. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Various initiatives to follow up on the Outcome Document are ongoing.  For example, in 
</p>
<p>March 2006, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, together with other like-minded States, 
circulated an analytical report commissioned from the Watson Institute for International Studies, 
entitled &#8220;Strengthening targeted sanctions through fair and clear procedures&#8221;.  The Council of 
Europe also commissioned a report by Iain Cameron, entitled &#8220;The ECHR, due process and 
UN Security Council counter-terrorism sanctions&#8221;.

</b>  Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of decisions from the 2005 
</p>
<p>World Summit Outcome for action by the Secretary-General (A/60/430 of 25 October 2005), 
para. 20. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, such a person has the right to be heard, via submissions in writing, 
within a reasonable time by the relevant decision-making body.  That right should 
include the ability to directly access the decision-making body, possibly through a 
focal point in the Secretariat, as well as the right to be assisted or represented by 
counsel.  Time limits should be set for the consideration of the case. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirdly, such a person has the right to review by an effective review mechanism.  
The effectiveness of that mechanism will depend on its impartiality, degree of 
independence and ability to provide an effective remedy, including the lifting of 
the measure and/or, under specific conditions to be determined, compensation. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourthly, the Security Council should, possibly through its Committees, 
periodically review on its own initiative targeted individual sanctions, especially 
the freezing of assets, in order to mitigate the risk of violating the right to 
property and related human rights.  The frequency of such review should be 
proportionate to the rights and interests involved.  The non-paper indicates also 
that those elements would apply mutatis mutandis in respect of entities.&#8221;<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Some improvements have been made recently to the procedures related to the 
United Nations targeted sanctions regime.  In November 2006, the 1267 Committee produced 
revised standards which apply to new listings including a requirement on designating States to 
provide more detailed information about individuals and entities to be listed, as well as detailed 
statements of cases.  Nonetheless, the targeted sanctions regime continues to pose a number of 
serious human rights challenges, notably due to the fact that the process does not provide an 
opportunity for affected individuals to be informed that such measures are being taken against 
them or to make submissions, nor does it provide a process for individuals to challenge their 
listing.  In December 2006 the Security Council adopted resolution 1730 (2006) with a view to 
addressing these concerns.  Resolution 1730 establishes new &#8220;delisting procedures&#8221; as well as a 
focal point within the Secretariat to serve as a liaison between the designating country and 
receive delisting requests.  While the High Commissioner welcomes this first step towards 
ensuring fair and clear procedures for placing individuals and entities on Security Council 
sanctions lists and for removing them, the measures taken so far are far from being a 
comprehensive solution to the problem. 
</p>
<p>29. Human rights concerns such as those outlined above have prompted a number of 
challenges to the individual listings procedures before national and regional courts.<b>11</b>  The most 
recent of these involved a challenge before the European Court of First Instance by the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Organisation des Modjahedines du peuple d&#8217;Iran,<b>12</b> a group which originally was listed as a 
terrorist organization by the Secretary of State for the Home Department of the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 28 March 2001, under the Terrorism Act 2000.  The 
organization brought two unsuccessful actions against this order, including a request for judicial 
review before the High Court and an appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission 
(POAC).  In 2002, the EU Council adopted Common Position 2002/340/CFSP, with an updated 
list including the applicant organization.  The applicant lodged an application at the Court of 
First Instance, asking the Court inter alia to annul the relevant Common Position and related 
decisions, and declare the Common Position and decisions to be inapplicable. 
</p>
<p>30. CFI considered arguments related to infringements of the right to a fair hearing, to the 
obligation to state reasons for a listing decision, and to the right to effective legal protection.  
The Court found that neither the Regulation nor the Common Position provide for notification of 
the evidence adduced or for a hearing of the parties concerned, either before or together with the 
initial decision to freeze funds or, in the context of subsequent decisions.  The applicant had not 
been apprised of the specific evidence against it, and was therefore not in a position to make 
known its views on the matter or avail itself of the right of action before the Court.  Neither the 
written pleadings of the parties nor the file produced before the Court enabled it to determine 
with certainty, after the close of the oral procedure, the grounds on which the original listing 
decision was based.  The Court concluded that the decision did not contain a sufficient statement 
of reasons and that the applicant&#8217;s right to a fair hearing was not observed.  The Court declared 
that it was not in a position to review the lawfulness of the decision, and annulled the decision 
insofar as it concerned the applicant. 
</p>
<p>31. While the decision of the Court of First Instance involved a challenge to an individual 
sanction process at regional level, the Court&#8217;s reasoning illustrates the fundamental importance 
of due process rights in the context of counter-terrorism, in particular the right to a fair hearing 
and independent review of individual sanctions against persons suspected of terrorist activity.  
Improvements to the current United Nations sanctions regime have been made, however, further 
improvements are necessary in order to ensure a listing process which is transparent, based on 
clear criteria, and with an appropriate, explicit, and uniformly applied standard of evidence, as 
well as an effective, accessible and independent mechanism of review for individuals and 
concerned States.  At a minimum, the standards required to ensure fair and clear procedures must 
include the right of an individual to be informed of the measures taken and to know the case 
against him or her as soon as, and to the extent possible, without thwarting the purpose of the 
sanctions regimes; the right of such a person to be heard within a reasonable time by the relevant 
decision-making body; the right to effective review by a competent, independent review 
mechanism; the right of such a person to counsel with respect to all proceedings; and the right of 
such a person to an effective remedy.

</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>I recall in the report above the importance of placing human rights at the core of 
international cooperation in counter-terrorism and the obligation of all States to ensure 
that measures taken to combat terrorism comply with their obligations under international 
human rights law, in particular the right to recognition before the law, due process, and 
non-refoulement.  Compliance with international human rights standards is essential 
where any counter-terrorism measure involves the deprivation of an individual&#8217;s liberty.  
In particular, States must ensure that any transfer of persons from one territory to another 
is undertaken pursuant to a prescription by law and within the framework of international 
law.</b> 
</p>
<p>33. <b>International cooperation is vital to ensuring respect for human rights standards in 
relation to sanctions against individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity.  
With regard to the United Nations sanctions regime, further improvements are needed to 
ensure a listing process which is transparent, based on clear criteria, and with an 
appropriate, explicit, and uniformly applied standard of evidence, as well as an effective, 
accessible and independent mechanism of review for individuals and concerned States.  
Fair and clear procedures must include the right of an individual to be informed of the 
measures taken and to know the case against him or her; the right of such a person to be 
heard within a reasonable time by the relevant decision-making body; the right to effective 
review by a competent, independent review mechanism; the right of such a person to 
representation with respect to all proceedings; and the right of such a person to an effective 
remedy.</b> 
</p>
<p>34. <b>Further challenges to human rights in the context of counter-terrorism include 
issues related to judicial cooperation, such as questions related to the gathering of 
information by one State at the request of another; the transfer of information from one 
jurisdiction to another; judicial proceedings involving evidence gathered abroad; and the 
use of intelligence information in judicial proceedings.  Practical hurdles to effective 
judicial cooperation in counter-terrorism include issues related to the impact of the origins 
of intelligence information on its admissibility as evidence; differences in the definition of 
the elements of crime between jurisdictions, as well as &#8220;dual criminality&#8221; concerns; 
procedures for gathering evidence, in particular where interrogation of witnesses or 
suspects is coercive and amounts to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; 
unlawful interferences with privacy with respect to interception, search, seizure and 
surveillance; the right to remedy for violation of human rights in the context of evidence 
gathering and information-sharing; the transfer and/or admissibility of evidence gathered 
by unlawful means; the principle of legality in relation to the definition of terrorist 
offences; the protection of witnesses; and questions related to the burden of proof in 
criminal proceedings.  My Office will continue to reflect on these issues with a view to 
assisting States in strengthening the effectiveness of mutual legal assistance, respect for 
human rights and upholding the rule of law in effectively countering terrorism.</b>
