<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/29 on the rights of the child, the Human Rights Council decided to 
dedicate, at a minimum, an annual full-day meeting to discuss different specific themes on 
the rights of the child, including the identification of challenges in the realization of the 
rights of the child. In its resolution 16/12 on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
children working and/or living on the street, the Council decided to focus its next annual 
full-day meeting on children and the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>2. The annual full-day meeting on children and the administration of justice took place 
on 8 March 2012, and was aimed at raising awareness about the situation faced by children 
in conflict and in contact with the law, reaffirming existing standards and commitments 
undertaken by States Members of the United Nations, and highlighting good practices and 
lessons learned from work undertaken by different actors, as well as identifying key 
challenges and recommending a way forward. The full-day meeting consisted of two 
panels: the morning panel, which focused on children in the judicial process, worrying 
trends and good practices, and the afternoon panel, which was devoted to the protection and 
realization of the rights of children deprived of liberty and children of incarcerated parents. 
</p>
<p>3. At the full-day meeting, a panellist who had been in conflict with the law as a 
juvenile shared his views about deprivation of liberty and suggested ways to help youth in 
conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p>4. The organization of the meeting was a joint effort by the Permanent Mission of 
Uruguay in Geneva (on behalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries) 
and the Permanent Mission of Denmark (on behalf of the European Union), with the 
support of Austria, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice 
and a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the NGO Group for 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Quaker United Nations Office. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Children in the judicial process: worrying trends and best 
practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks and statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>5. The morning panel was moderated by the President of the Human Rights Council. 
The High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the panel, followed by presentations by 
Antonio Caparros Linares, a panellist who had been in conflict with the law as a juvenile; 
Susan Bissell, Chief of the Child Protection Section and Associate Director of the 
Programme Division at UNICEF in New York; Jorge Cardona Llorens, member of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and professor of public international law at the 
University of Valencia; Julia Sloth-Nielsen, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of 
Western Cape and member of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare 
of the Child; Constance de La Vega, professor and Director of the Frank C. Newman 
International Human Rights Clinic at the University of San Francisco; and Renate Winter, 
judge at the Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  
</p>
<p>6. In her opening statement, the High Commissioner for Human Rights said the theme 
of children and the administration of justice focused on the harsh reality of millions of 
children who were in conflict with the law. Their rights were often violated from the first 
contact they have with the justice system. She referred to articles 37 and 40 of the </p>


<p>Convention of the Rights of the Child as well as the numerous international standards and 
norms in the field of juvenile justice, including general comment No. 10 (2007) of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, which provide clear guidelines for States to establish 
juvenile justice systems in compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
Those entail the use of alternative measures, such as diversion and restorative justice, and 
options to respond to children in conflict with the law effectively. 
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner stated that one alarming concern was a growing public 
perception that juvenile delinquency was increasing. Such a perception, not grounded upon 
evidence but based on media reports of a few serious cases, influenced the political 
discourse and too often led to the adoption of legislation on the treatment of young 
offenders that weakened children&#8217;s rights. In particular, she expressed concern at the trend 
towards lowering the minimum age of criminal responsibility and stressed the need to 
maintain the age of 12 as the absolute minimum, concurring with the Committee in urging 
countries with a higher minimum age of criminal responsibility not to lower it, and 
applauding those who set it at a higher age, such as 14 or 16. She said that in certain 
countries, children may spend months or even years in pretrial detention, which constituted 
a serious violation of article 37 (b) of Convention of the Rights of the Child. Concerning 
forms of legalized violence against children, such as capital punishment, life imprisonment 
without parole and corporal punishment as a sentence for a crime, the High Commissioner 
stated that they were clear violations of the rights of the child.   
</p>
<p>8. Antonio Caparros Linares, who had been in conflict with the law as a juvenile, 
explained that his childhood and adolescence had been unstable and that he had been 
involved with groups that initiated him into substance use, which led him to enter into 
conflict with the law. He indicated that the relationship with his family and those who loved 
him had been very affected by his behavior. He explained that he had committed his first 
offence when he was 16 and spent several years in a rehabilitation center. He made 
extensive reference to the time he had spent in Centro Reeducativo La Villa, in Villena, 
Alicante, Spain, run by Fundaci&#243;n Diagrama Intervenci&#243;n Psicosocial, where he received 
help and was made to see the consequences of his behaviour and the impact of his actions 
on his loved ones. At the centre he participated in workshops on construction and 
gardening, which helped him obtain a job afterwards. He thanked the Human Rights 
Council for seriously considering the situation of juveniles in difficult situations and 
helping them in their social reintegration.  
</p>
<p>9. Susan Bissell, Chief of the Child Protection Section and Associate Director, of the 
Programme Division at UNICEF in New York, explained that &#8213;justice for children&#8214; 
referred to policies and programmes that aimed to ensure that children were better served 
and protected when they came into contact with justice systems&#8212;as victims/survivors, 
witnesses and alleged perpetrators, or for other reasons where judicial intervention is 
needed, for example, regarding their care, custody or protection. She explained that justice 
for children went beyond juvenile justice&#8212;beyond children in conflict with the law&#8212;to 
include all children in contact with any justice system, for whatever reason. She 
emphasized that that was an important shift, as it recognized that children did engage with 
legal systems for many reasons. She indicated that UNICEF placed justice for children 
within the overarching child protection systems approach, which actualized a protective 
environment. A child protection system was comprised of a set of laws, policies, 
regulations and services that were organized to prevent and respond to protection-related 
risks&#8212;the risks of violence, abuse and exploitation. Such a system pushed the justice-for-
children agenda to recognize that a child might be in contact with the law for different 
reasons, and that those different reasons might apply to the same child. A child who was on 
the street might also be suffering from mental health difficulties and might also be a 
migrant child. Approaching children holistically was an important part of a child protection </p>


<p>system. Placing justice for children within that context allowed for both prevention and 
comprehensive responses, such as easy access to all services.  
</p>
<p>10. Ms. Bissel indicated that more than 1 million children were in detention, more than 
2 million children in residential care, and 1.2 million children were trafficked yearly. Of the 
estimated 215 million international migrants in the world, it was estimated that some 33 
million (15 per cent) were under the age of 20. Tens of thousands of children currently 
formed part of various armed forces and armed groups in at least 16 countries. She 
concluded by saying that one of the principal issues in the area of justice for children was to 
look at preventive and supportive responses for children who were at risk. 
</p>
<p>11. Jorge Cardona Llorens, a member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
professor of public international law at the University of Valencia, said there were public 
perceptions of increased juvenile violence and delinquency which were not based on real 
data. Real data on juvenile delinquency would dismantle the myths and the fears that 
children were committing serious crimes. He mentioned the trend of criminalizing young 
people, including calls for increasing sanctions and lowering the minimum age of criminal 
responsibility. He stressed the need for juvenile justice policies to be based on real data and 
not on sensational opinions that circulated through the media. He stated that situations 
and/or behaviours which were not violations of penal law should not be criminalized and 
that the principle of legality had to be applied with strict compliance. Children in irregular 
situations, in need of protection, and children working and/or living on the street should not 
be criminalized solely because of their situations.   
</p>
<p>12. According to Mr. Cardona Llorens, specialized justice systems for children should 
be based on the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and should use new 
approaches and alternative measures; they should be adapted to young people. Judicial 
proceedings and incarceration should be used only in extreme cases, and instead States 
should resort to other measures, such as mediation between victims and offenders or 
community-based approaches, and provide appropriate training for professionals dealing 
with children. He stated that children must not be treated worse than adults in the juvenile 
justice system, but that unfortunately in many countries the juvenile justice system did not 
have the same procedural guarantees as adults. The main objective of the juvenile justice 
system should be to promote the child&#8217;s reintegration in society. 
</p>
<p>13. Julia Sloth-Nielsen, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of the Western 
Cape and member of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the 
Child, said that on the African continent the majority of children grew up under the 
umbrella of customary law systems, with justice administered by elders and chiefs. She 
indicated that important gains had been made in a number of countries regarding the special 
needs of child victims and witnesses, including hearing children&#8217;s voices; establishing 
child-friendly methods for giving testimony; and reinforcing the right to privacy of child 
victims and witnesses. In addition, the diversion of children away from formal justice 
processes and alternatives to custodial sentencing and detention as desired objectives had 
become internationally recognized, and domesticated in a large number of legal 
frameworks (including, in the African continent, Malawi, Botswana, South Africa, Kenya 
and Lesotho).   
</p>
<p>14. Experience and research showed a prevailing insensitivity to the child&#8217;s right to 
dignity, privacy, prompt assistance, information in a language and format that the child 
understands, and conclusion of the matter in a time frame appropriate to the child&#8217;s age and 
maturity. Furthermore, despite evidence-based international guidance in relation to the 
treatment of children in conflict with the law, the situation on the ground remained dire: 
there was often a very large gap between the law and practice, with children being mixed 
with adults in the justice system, failing to secure due process guarantees such as prompt 
legal assistance, and being unnecessarily deprived of their liberty. She concluded by saying </p>


<p>that the political will of States to bring international instruments to life and make their 
implementation a reality was a key element in promoting and protecting the rights of the 
child. 
</p>
<p>15. According to Constance de la Vega, Professor and Director of the International 
Human Rights Clinic at the University of San Francisco, the two most inhuman sentences 
that were still imposed on juvenile offenders were the death penalty and life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole. International standards clearly prohibited these sentences 
for children. A great deal of progress had been made on eradicating the death penalty and in 
practice only one country, the Islamic Republic of Iran, reportedly executed juvenile 
offenders in 2010 and 2011, down from three countries in 2009.  
</p>
<p>16. Ms. de la Vega pointed out that while 13 countries had laws allowing the sentence of 
life imprisonment without the possibility of release to be imposed on juvenile offenders, 
this was practiced only in the United States, where over 2,500 juvenile offenders were 
serving life imprisonment without parole for crimes committed when they were under 18. 
In addition to the death penalty and life imprisonment without the possibility of release, 
juvenile offenders faced the possibility of being sentenced to corporal punishment in at 
least 42 countries. These practices include caning, flogging, stoning and amputation. The 
Committee on the Rights of the Child repeatedly emphasized that those sentences violated 
international law, and had expressed concern about such sentencing of children. Several 
States were considering draft legislation that would prohibit sentencing children to corporal 
punishment, while some had adopted such legislation recently. For instance, Pakistan 
adopted in 2000 the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, which prohibited corporal 
punishment in the penal system. Ms. de la Vega urged the Council to continue to address 
those issues both through the thematic procedures and country procedures, including the 
universal periodic review. She hoped that with such continued attention the almost 
universal compliance with the specific prohibitions against extreme sentencing of juveniles 
would become universal.  
</p>
<p>17. Renate Winter, a judge at the Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra 
Leone, said that bringing a child into contact with the juvenile system had consequences 
and it was important to decide whether that contact was indeed needed. The most important 
issue for the justice system dealing with a child was that of proportionality and how it was 
balanced with appropriate responses to an act of the child. She indicated that alternative 
measures to deal with conflict were needed and that many times restorative justice rested on 
a triangle composed of the victim, the offender and the community. Restorative juvenile 
justice could be used in all phases of a child&#8217;s contact with the judicial system: before, 
during and after. Although many said that the development of alternative measures had 
serious financial implications, some alternative measures, such as receiving a warning by 
the police, community service or giving the child a particular responsibility, had no 
financial costs. What was needed to implement juvenile justice systems were alternatives to 
court proceedings, sentencing and punishment, as well as training and capacity-building for 
all those involved in the justice system.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the interactive discussion, the following delegations spoke: European Union, 
Australia, Qatar, Thailand, Pakistan (on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation), 
Paraguay, Mauritania (on behalf of the Arab Group), Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Austria, Sri Lanka, Uruguay (on behalf of the Latin American and 
Caribbean Group), Hungary, Poland, Ireland, France, India, Honduras, Namibia, Nepal, 
Saudi Arabia, Belgium, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. The following NGOs also </p>


<p>took the floor: International Juvenile Justice Observatory1, Amnesty International, Human 
Rights Advocates and the Consortium for Street Children. 
</p>
<p>19. Issues raised during the interactive dialogue included the need to abolish the death 
penalty and life imprisonment without parole for those who committed crimes while under 
the age of 18 and apply the best interests of the child in all circumstances affecting them. 
Reference was made to ensuring the proportionality of a sentence to the offence committed 
and the importance of raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12 years, 
where it is lower, in accordance with international guidelines. Many speakers referred to the 
positive impact of the promotion of alternative measures to detention, such as community 
service, and the fact that the juvenile justice system should be oriented to the reintegration 
of the offender with his family and in society. It was also noted that the lack of birth 
certificates and age determination processes put children at risk of being treated as adults 
and that that could lead to human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>20. Public awareness-raising, national capacity-building, creating a culture of respect for 
children, and supporting the family could contribute to the promotion and protection of the 
rights of the child. Prevention of juvenile delinquency was a priority, as was the training of 
judges and judicial personnel. Some speakers referred to poverty, family breakdown and 
economic difficulties as causes leading children to become involved in criminal activities 
and in conflict with the law. It was important to invest in education and rehabilitation 
programmes. Repressive systems were not appropriate for juvenile offenders, and 
imprisonment should be used only as a last resort.  
</p>
<p>21. The International Juvenile Justice Observatory requested the United Nations to work 
on a global report on mental health of juveniles in contact with the criminal justice system. 
Amnesty International called on the Human Rights Council to ensure universal compliance 
with the universal prohibition of imposing death sentences on juvenile offenders. Human 
Rights Advocates requested that juveniles serving life in prison be given a chance to be 
heard by a parole board, and called upon States to commute life sentences to other 
sentences. The Consortium for Street Children indicated that street children were often 
victims of violence, police brutality and round-ups and called upon States to repeal 
legislation prohibiting begging, loitering, vagrancy and running away. They emphasized 
that children in street situations should not be criminalized, a recommendation that was also 
presented in the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on children working 
and/or living on the street (A/HRC/19/35) recently presented to the Council. 
</p>
<p>22. A number of questions were posed by States: What preventive measures would be 
crucial for lowering the number of children in conflict with the law? What measures could 
the Human Rights Council take to ensure that the imposition of the death penalty and life 
imprisonment on children was ended once and for all? How to ensure that such inhuman 
sentences become a thing of the past? What measures could States take to ensure that there 
was no violence in closed institutions and that rehabilitation really served its intended 
purpose? What were the costs of diversion compared to the costs of sending children to 
prison? How would a juvenile offender deal with the stigma of having been in prison? What 
could help in overcoming social prejudices? How to ensure the rendering of the necessary 
legal and psychological assistance for young victims, young witnesses and their families 
after crime? What were good practices in disseminating juvenile justice principles? What 
could be the role of the international community in supporting the reform of national 
juvenile justice systems to ensure respect for the rights of the child?

<p><b> C. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>Mr. Caparros Linares referred to the important role that schools have in 
prevention and in teaching young people not to consume drugs. He also referred to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>important supportive role played by educators in centres where young people in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict with the law were held, particularly in teaching them self-esteem, discipline, 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue, and providing at the same time the psychosocial support they needed with 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect, dignity and affection. 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>Ms. Bissell stressed the importance of taking a holistic approach to justice for 
children, interlinking justice systems with social and educational systems. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>referred to birth registration as a fundamental aspect of a child protection system. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Birth registration and age determination were essential to ensure the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; there were currently 220 million children under the age of 5, particularly in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the South, who did not have birth certificates. She also said that a critical part of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>child protection work done by UNICEF was family strengthening and support as part 
</b></p>
<p><b>of its prevention strategies</b>&#8212;<b>early detection of vulnerability in families was critical to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen social protection measures. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>Mr. Cardona Llorens said that many States asked for guidance on how to 
respect the rights of the child in juvenile justice and that it was important to think 
</b></p>
<p><b>about restorative justice. Specialized justice systems for children should be based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and should use new 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches and alternative measures. Juvenile justice systems should be adapted to 
</b></p>
<p><b>young people and should steer them away from criminal proceedings for small crimes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judicial proceedings and incarceration should be used only in serious cases, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>instead States should resort to other measures, such as mediation between victims and 
</b></p>
<p><b>offenders or community-based approaches. It was necessary to think about new 
</b></p>
<p><b>realities; children were clearly showing qualitative and quantitative reduction in 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;traditional&#8221; offences. New forms of offen<b>ces were emerging, such as cybercrime and 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes committed in families, which judicial systems were generally not well prepared 
</b></p>
<p><b>to deal with. 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>Ms. Sloth-Nielsen said that introducing a floor of basic social security 
protection was the most important measure to prevent children from falling into 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability due to extreme poverty. The identification of children most at risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>social exclusion was also an important preventive measure, as those children were 
</b></p>
<p><b>disproportionately represented in all forms of detention centres. She indicated that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>biggest progress in juvenile justice had been made in terms of legislative reform. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>role of international cooperation was vital to developing capacity and sound justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems worldwide. There was also a wealth of academic, practical and programmatic 
</b></p>
<p><b>information available which would be useful to adapt</b>&#8212;<b>much on restorative justice, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but also educational programmes</b>&#8212;<b>and encouraged international cooperation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhancing justice systems for children.  
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>Ms. de la Vega said preventive measures were needed to protect children from 
childhood onwards, particularly from abuse by parents. It was important to have 
</b></p>
<p><b>support for psychological problems as well. Children with psychological problems or 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffering from abuse were more likely to be sentenced to extreme punishments. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Legislative reform was a requirement to ensure that extreme penalties could not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>applied to minors. A prohibition of extreme penalties should not only be applied at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>federal level, but also at the level of states, provinces and regions in the case of federal 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems. When the death penalty is abolished the option must not be to sentence 
</b></p>
<p><b>children to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  </b></p>


<p>28. <b>Ms. Winter referred to the principles of the entrance door (avoiding detention 
as much as possible) and of the exit door (using probational parole as soon as possible 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to the greatest extent possible). In most countries, recidivism of children in 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention was as high as 80 per cent. Where diversion mechanisms were used there 
</b></p>
<p><b>was a maximum rate of recidivism of 20 per cent. The costs of diversion were much 
</b></p>
<p><b>lower than the cost of maintaining prisons, which, taking into account the costs 
</b></p>
<p><b>associated with employees, food and education, would amount to the cost of a four-
</b></p>
<p><b>star hotel. Once the child came out of prison costs were also involved, as most likely 
</b></p>
<p><b>that child would need to be on social welfare. Inappropriate and stigmatizing 
</b></p>
<p><b>language relating to children could easily be avoided, and such language adaptation 
</b></p>
<p><b>was cost free. Stigmatizing a child, even if by language, was harmful to the child. Ms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Winter pointed out that States could address the Interagency Panel on Juvenile 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice for technical assistance, if necessary.   
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Children deprived of liberty and children of incarcerated 
parents: protection and realization of their rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks and statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>29. The afternoon panel was moderated by the President of the Human Rights Council, 
and focused on children deprived of liberty and children of incarcerated parents. 
Introductory remarks were made by Sandeep Chawla, Deputy Executive Director of the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Panellists included: Marta Santos Pais, Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against children; Rani D. Shankardass, 
Secretary-General of the Penal Reform and Justice Association&#8211;India; Luis Pedernera, 
Latin American and Caribbean Network for the Defence of the Rights of Boys, Girls and 
Adolescents; Dainius Puras, Head and Professor of the Centre of Child Psychiatry and 
Social Pediatrics at Vilnius University; and Abdul Manaff Kemokai, Executive Director of 
Defence for Children International, Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>30. Mr. Chawla said that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime had at the core 
of its mandate the promotion of efficient, fair and humane criminal justice systems that 
protect the vulnerable and respect human rights. A common challenge faced by many 
countries was the lack of data and statistics available on children in contact and in conflict 
with the law, which, in fact, was a prerequisite for the development of sound policies and 
programmes aimed at promoting justice for children. In many countries, the legal and 
policy framework was simply inadequate to deal with children in contact with the law as 
alleged offenders, victims or witnesses. Moreover, criminal justice systems in many 
countries did not provide for mechanisms and institutions to enable children to benefit from 
diversion and alternative measures, leading to overreliance on deprivation of liberty of 
children in trouble with the law. It was estimated that over 1 million children worldwide 
were deprived of liberty, and not much was known about the profile of children in 
detention. Most of those children were charged with petty crimes and very few had 
committed violent offences. Many had been rounded up for homelessness and vagrancy and 
had committed no offence at all. The vast majority of children in trouble with the law never 
met with a lawyer prior to their trial. 
</p>
<p>31. Mr. Chawla emphasized that the consequences of violating children&#8217;s rights in the 
administration of justice could not be underestimated. Such violations seriously pre-empted 
the development and the ability of the child to grow into a functioning adult. The promotion 
and protection of children&#8217;s rights in the administration of justice was a matter of priority 
that could no longer be neglected by States and societies. It was also an obligation 
undertaken by countries ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In addition, a </p>


<p>number of United Nations international standards and norms in crime prevention and 
criminal justice offered guidance to States on how that should be done. The panellist 
referred, inter alia, to the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration 
of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules, 1985), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of 
Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (the Havana Rules, 1990) and the United Nations 
Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines, 1990). He 
concluded by stating that violations of children&#8217;s rights in the administration of justice 
called for a multifaceted response. Although States had the primary responsibility, the role 
of non-State actors was also essential. The international community had also a key role to 
play in this regard. 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Santos Pais, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence 
against children, said that a juvenile justice system framed by the rights of the child was 
critical for the prevention of incidents of violence against children; unfortunately, juvenile 
justice remained an area where children&#8217;s rights were often put at risk and where violence 
remained a serious challenge. Thousands of children were still deprived of liberty, not as a 
measure of last resort, and in many cases were awaiting trial for endless periods of time. A 
large proportion of those children were held for minor offences, detained in inhuman 
conditions, without education and vocational training and/or options for a genuine 
rehabilitation. Countless children endured violence and humiliating treatment by staff in 
detention centres, as a form of control, discipline or punishment; they risked torture, rape 
and abuse, including when placed in facilities with adults. It remained difficult to access 
data on the numbers of children deprived of liberty and on the reasons that led to their 
placement in detention centres or in care institutions.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Representative noted that, similarly, there was a lack of independent 
mechanisms to safeguard children&#8217;s rights in the justice system and to address any 
complaints presented by child victims, which led to a culture of impunity and tolerance of 
violence. She referred to the Expert Consultation on the prevention of and responses to 
violence against children within the juvenile justice system and shared some 
recommendations from the meeting. It was critical to promote strong and cohesive national 
child protection systems to prevent the involvement of children in the criminal justice 
system, and to secure children&#8217;s protection from violence. It was necessary to minimize the 
cases of children in contact with the juvenile justice system. Similarly, it was urgent to set 
the minimum age of criminal responsibility in line with international standards, and it was 
vital to reduce the use of deprivation of liberty to truly as a measure of last resort and for 
the shortest period of time. Banning all forms of inhuman sentencing was of utmost 
urgency, and investing in restorative justice, diversion mechanisms and alternatives to 
deprivation of liberty was a critical component of that process.  
</p>
<p>34. Ms. Shankardass, Secretary-General of the Penal Reform and Justice Association&#8211;
India, said that the issue of children of incarcerated parents was a universal one, yet it had 
been universally neglected. The State had obligations to children of incarcerated parents 
because it had interfered with their family life by separating the children from their parents. 
In South Asia, home to one fifth of the world&#8217;s population, the most basic quantitative 
information about children who had parents in prison was lacking. The only obtainable 
figure was that of children accompanying mothers to a prison on any given day when the 
statistics were recorded in the registers. She explained that the lack of an all-inclusive 
socioeconomic development in the South Asian region acutely affected the delivery of 
human rights for those &#8213;left behind&#8214;. Families of incarcerated persons were usually poor 
and powerless, with neither the means nor the know-how to address the issue of rights. 
National acts and international documents relating to child rights existed in each of the 
countries of South Asia, but the special category &#8213;children of incarcerated parents&#8214; was 
conspicuous by its absence in the criminal justice system. The effects of parental 
incarceration on children should be addressed by bringing the subject onto the national </p>


<p>agenda, tackling the absence of data and reconsidering incarceration of women in the light 
of the damage it brought to families. She concluded by stating that children of prisoners 
were not offenders and their development as children may not be hindered under any 
circumstances.  
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Pedernera, Latin American and Caribbean Network for the Defence of the 
Rights of Boys, Girls and Adolescents, said that Latin America and the Caribbean 
continued to be the most unequal region in the world and that the inequality was getting 
worse every year. Boys, girls and adolescents were the poorest of the region and also the 
most criminalized. There was a trend of accusing children of threatening security, which 
was leading to lowering the age of criminal responsibility in the region. Very little had been 
done to ensure that the Convention on the Rights of the Child became a reality in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. While deprivation of liberty should be used as a measure of 
last resort, it continued to be the most usual penalty. He raised a number of serious 
concerns for the region, including the fact that it included places where children were still 
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment and where torture and ill-treatment still 
prevailed. Plans had not been developed to handle the trauma of children who were victims 
of torture and ill-treatment. He also referred to the situation of children in residential care, 
who were not part of the juvenile justice system, but did suffer deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>36. Mr. Puras, Head and Professor of the Centre of Child Psychiatry and Social 
Pediatrics at Vilnius University, focused on how modern public health interventions could 
be effective in protecting the rights of children in detention, thus increasing their chances 
for a healthy development. He said that States needed to make investments in health that 
were based on the combination of a human rights-based approach and a child-centred 
orientation. Children in the juvenile justice system were extremely vulnerable to health 
issues, and had often unmet physical, developmental and mental health needs. In this 
regard, high rates of physical injuries, tuberculosis, dental problems, sexually transmitted 
diseases and HIV, as well as other problems relating to reproductive health, needed 
particular attention. High rates of suicide attempts and suicides among children deprived of 
liberty indicated the vulnerability of that group of adolescents and the urgent need to 
address the mental health and emotional well-being of those children in an adequate way.   
</p>
<p>37. Mr. Puras reiterated that children in detention may have different emotional, 
behavioural and mental disorders. Sometimes they may need psychotropic medications, but 
the main focus should always be on a wide spectrum of psychosocial interventions based on 
respecting their dignity. He indicated that one of the most important components was what 
mental health professionals called therapeutic environment, which was a powerful 
alternative to replace the culture of violence and mistrust and may help troubled children to 
understand the rules of non-violent relations and the consequences of appropriate or 
inappropriate behaviour. Investment in good mental health and emotional well-being was 
an important component in breaking vicious circles of violence, social exclusion, 
intolerance and hopelessness. In general, any institutional placement of children, whether 
for those in conflict with the law or for any other reason, could become a place for systemic 
violations of child rights if basic human rights principles were not observed. Mental health 
services for children could be effective only if basic human rights principles enshrined in 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child were fully respected. He concluded by recalling 
three words that had been chosen by the Committee on the Rights of the Child as a title for 
the event commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Convention: &#8213;Dignity, 
Development and Dialogue&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>38. Mr. Kemokai, Executive Director of Defence for Children International, Sierra 
Leone, said that under the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the 
essential aim of the treatment of child offenders was the child&#8217;s reintegration into the 
family as well as his or her social rehabilitation. He explained that rehabilitation was the </p>


<p>process of helping child offenders become law abiding and behave in conformity with the 
norms and values of society. Reintegration was the process of taking back children from the 
street or institutions to their families and communities. Rehabilitation required positive 
psychological and physical changes in the child. Achieving the offender&#8217;s reconciliation 
with the victim was a crucial milestone in the process of rehabilitation and reintegration of 
a child offender. In many cultures in Africa, traditional or cultural methods of rehabilitation 
included traditional ceremonies that were performed to cleanse the offence and ask for 
forgiveness. He explained that reintegration was more difficult when a child had been taken 
out of his or her home because the link and trust with the family had been broken. Juvenile 
justice should examine not only the crime committed by the child but also the broader 
social and economic injustices within the family and society that were crucial for 
prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</p>
<p>39. Mr. Kemokai stated that child reintegration required a competent facilitator, able to 
facilitate the child&#8217;s access to social services and provide continuing psychological support. 
In playing such role it was advisable for the social worker to fully involve the child and 
family if available. The family could also require support to be able to keep the child. An 
important component of a child&#8217;s reintegration was to address the underlying problems that 
led to the delinquency of the child, which could include neglect, deprivation, poverty, abuse 
and/or social exclusion. He concluded by stating that the child and family should be given 
the opportunity to play an active role throughout the process of rehabilitation and 
reintegration. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>40. During the interactive dialogue, the following delegations spoke: Norway, United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Mauritania (on behalf of the Arab Group), 
United States of America, Switzerland, Brazil, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Germany, 
Argentina, Armenia, Slovenia, Turkey, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uruguay, 
Indonesia, China, Republic of Korea, Tunisia, Georgia, Chile, Cuba, Russian Federation, 
Morocco, Portugal and Maldives. The International Labour Organization also took the 
floor. The following NGOs also intervened: Friends World Committee for Consultation &#8211; 
Quakers2, Union of Arab Jurists3 and Defence for Children International. 
</p>
<p>41. During the discussion concern was expressed by some countries about the overuse 
of deprivation of liberty, including pretrial detention, and the fact that youth of colour were 
at disproportionate risk of being in contact/in conflict with the justice system. Reference 
was also made to the millions of children around the world that were affected by the 
incarceration of their parents and the fact that parental absence due to incarceration could 
leave lasting consequences on the physical and emotional well-being of children, especially 
young children and toddlers. Several speakers emphasized that juvenile justice systems had 
to be adapted to children&#8217;s needs and had to ensure the participation of the child. States 
provided examples of what they were doing in respect of juvenile justice in complying with 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>42. Speakers made reference to efforts made to establish restorative justice systems, as 
well as the need for wide-ranging programmes at the level of prevention. The importance of 
</p>
<p>  
 2  Joint statement with the International Catholic Child Bureau, the International Baby Food Action 
</p>
<p>Network and SOS Children&#8217;s Villages International. 
 3  Joint Statement with the International Organization for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, Arab Lawyers Union, General Arab Women Federation, North-South XXI, the 
United Towns Agency for North-South Cooperation, and the International Educational Development. </p>


<p>diversion measures as well as alternatives to detention that built on reconciliation, 
restoration and reintegration of juveniles was repeatedly mentioned. In some countries, 
alternative measures, such as warnings, parental supervision and reduction of leisure time, 
were applied to juvenile offenders. Some speakers mentioned the role of the media in 
avoiding or developing discriminatory stereotypes against children who had committed 
crimes, and stressed the importance of awareness-raising campaigns. Speakers also referred 
to the efforts being made in their countries in favour of reintegration rather than punitive 
strategies. Some States indicated the importance of looking at root causes, as sometimes 
offences committed by a child were the result of a whole set of problems, including 
extreme poverty. One State expressed concern at the increase in children involved in gang 
violence. 
</p>
<p>43. The Friends World Committee for Consultation-Quakers welcomed the increasing 
attention given to the rights and needs of children of incarcerated parents and mentioned the 
implications of that situation for children&#8217;s well-being, asking what additional guidance 
was needed in relation to children of incarcerated parents. Defence for Children 
International said that despite the need to end the detention of child migrants, many 
children remained in immigration detention centres in unacceptable circumstances, 
resulting in mental and physical health concerns, social isolation and educational 
disadvantage. The International Labour Organization called on States to ratify ILO 
Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour and drew attention to the World Day 
against Child Labour 2012 (12 June) on human rights and social justice in connection with 
child labour. 
</p>
<p>44. The afternoon session was rich in questions posed to the panellists, both by States 
and NGOs. Speakers asked panellists to highlight examples of best practices in the area of 
the administration of justice for children; examples of policies that were suitable to prevent 
and eliminate all forms of violence against children deprived of liberty; and examples 
where restorative justice and other non-formal responses from the justice system had a 
beneficial impact on the numbers of youth under 18 in custody. Other questions included 
how to overcome the problem of discriminatory stereotypes; what was the best way for 
children to participate in the judicial procedure in order to guarantee their best interests; and 
how to tackle the root causes of the behaviours and/or events that bring children in conflict 
with the law. 
</p>
<p>45. Other questions asked were: whether the number of children in conflict with the law 
could be reduced by promoting education and awareness-raising campaigns; whether good 
practices in awareness-raising and training to prevent violence and abuse of children could 
be shared; how international mechanisms could support effectively efforts made by States 
in the area of children and the administration of justice; how to strike a balance between the 
lack of resources in the administration of justice and the importance of providing child-
friendly correctional facilities; how the right to education could be guaranteed for child 
detainees; what additional guidance was needed for children of incarcerated parents; what 
health effects, particularly as regards mental health, children experienced when a parent 
was in prison; and what support should be given to children leaving prisons after having 
lived with incarcerated parents and to children of incarcerated parents outside. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>Mr. Chawla emphasized that one of the main problems was the lack of data 
concerning children in conflict with the law. He referred to the current tendency to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopt punitive approaches when dealing with child delinquency and the need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen crime prevention policies, as investing in prevention was far more cost-</b></p>


<p><b>effective. He stressed that the primary purpose of a juvenile justice system should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rehabilitation and the reintegration of the child. States had to shift from a punitive 
</b></p>
<p><b>to a child-sensitive approach. Conditions of detention and access to services for 
</b></p>
<p><b>children deprived of liberty had to be improved. There was a need for a multifaceted 
</b></p>
<p><b>response and coordination between the criminal justice system and social welfare, 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and public health institutions, as well as coordination among the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international organizations. The only way to know what were the best practices in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>area was to have better data and information on the number of children in conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the law, so programming could be enriched.  
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>Ms. Santos Pais said that juvenile justice could not be perceived as a second-
class justice system for youth in conflict and that it had not been designed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalize or to punish children. Most of the children who were in the criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice system should not be there in the first place, and prevention and alternative 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures should be the priority. Strong legislation was needed to give children the 
</b></p>
<p><b>confidence that the system was appropriate and able to deal with them in the best 
</b></p>
<p><b>way. She stressed that in order to fight impunity, strong accountability systems were 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed, together with independent monitoring mechanisms, ombuds for children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need to change social perceptions. Capacity-building for law enforcement and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethical guidance on the role of the media was indispensable. She explained that there 
</b></p>
<p><b>was also a need for resources, and that this should be perceived as an investment, not 
</b></p>
<p><b>as expenditure. Finally, problems could not be solved without taking </b>young people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>views and recommendations into consideration. Concerning children of incarcerated 
</b></p>
<p><b>parents, she said that they were not offenders and should not be punished implicitly. 
</b></p>
<p><b>She said they were stigmatized, ill perceived by society, bullied, pressured to hide their 
</b></p>
<p><b>story and isolated, all of which could have emotional consequences. It was important 
</b></p>
<p><b>to work with the extended family and community professionals to promote the 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusion of those children in school and sports. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>Ms. Shankardass referred to prisons as an uncivilized way of punishment. 
More research on individuals inside institutions and those released after being in 
</b></p>
<p><b>prisons would show how uncivilized that punishment was. Concerning guidelines for 
</b></p>
<p><b>children of incarcerated parents, she indicated that she could not suggest any, given 
</b></p>
<p><b>that those children should not be in prison. To facilitate their development, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>incarceration of mothers should be avoided, as they were not dangerous criminals. 
</b></p>
<p><b>She said that the possibility of creating a child-friendly atmosphere in a prison was 
</b></p>
<p><b>very slim. The regime of a prison was not healthy for a child. Children did not belong 
</b></p>
<p><b>in prisons, and more research was required to know how those left outside could come 
</b></p>
<p><b>to terms with being left without a parent.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>Mr. Pedernera said working from the State level more proactively and ending 
the criminalization of children was essential. He said that in order to prevent the 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory treatment of children by the press, in certain Latin American 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries they had established observation centres for the media, which monitored 
</b></p>
<p><b>such discriminatory coverage. Police officers needed to be trained to deal with 
</b></p>
<p><b>children. Best practices in the educational sphere for children deprived of liberty 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved ensuring that children continued to go to school outside of prison. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning children of incarcerated parents, he stressed that children were not 
</b></p>
<p><b>deprived of liberty but were in prison because of their parents. It was important for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>child to be able to have opportunities to get out of the prison and reduce his or her 
</b></p>
<p><b>distance from the outside world. Completely closed institutions for children that 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided all services within their walls should not be encouraged. They needed to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>able to leave and interact in the public sphere. The distance between the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children left outside and those inside institutions should be minimized as much as 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible. He reiterated that deprivation of liberty for children was a bad response; it </b></p>


<p><b>was expensive and generated more crime. He emphasized, like other panellists, that 
</b></p>
<p><b>children deprived of liberty had about a 70 per cent chance of committing recurring 
</b></p>
<p><b>offenses, while the recidivism rate of those who received other types of sanctions that 
</b></p>
<p><b>did not include deprivation of liberty was only 20 per cent.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Mr. Puras explained that, from a public health perspective, there were many 
best practices at the level of primary and secondary prevention, such as the training of 
</b></p>
<p><b>parents on non-violent disciplining methods of children, so the cycle of violence could 
</b></p>
<p><b>be broken. He also mentioned the importance of prevention of bullying in schools. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>said that political will was needed to increase social investment in secondary 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention to lower the number of children deprived of liberty</b>&#8212;<b>not only the 1 million 
</b></p>
<p><b>in detention, but also the 2 million deprived of liberty in other types of institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning the children of incarcerated parents, he stressed that the effects of 
</b></p>
<p><b>separation in early childhood were harmful and that this was backed not only by 
</b></p>
<p><b>social science, but also by neuroscience. He said that the worst case scenario was when 
</b></p>
<p><b>a mother was imprisoned and her baby was placed in institutional care. Extensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidence and studies had shown that the mental health and emotional well-being of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the child would be harmed if he or she was put in institutional care and separated 
</b></p>
<p><b>from the mother at a young age.  
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Mr. Kemokai referred to the reintegration of children who had been in prison 
with their parents. He said that, most often, it was young babies or children under 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>years of age who were allowed to remain with their mothers in prison. It was 
</b></p>
<p><b>uncommon to find older children or children living in prison with their fathers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, at a certain age, children had to leave the prison and the State had the 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility to find an appropriate person to care for that child. In Sierra Leone, 
</b></p>
<p><b>grandmothers or aunts were the ones often targeted to provide support for the child 
</b></p>
<p><b>when he or she was taken from the mother in prison. Follow-up was required with 
</b></p>
<p><b>social workers so that the family could be assisted in providing the child with support 
</b></p>
<p><b>and </b>the child&#8217;s<b> progress integrating into school and the community could be followed. 
</b></p>
