</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation noted that during the last four years, Ecuador had made efforts 
towards reaffirming its commitment towards human rights, peace and democratic stability. 
In 2008, a new Constitution gave rise to a new model of State and development. The nation 
had recovered its trust in the democratic system, a fundamental prerequisite for the 
enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Constitution established that, in addition to being a State of rights and justice, 
Ecuador was an intercultural and multi-ethnic State, in which different groups of people 
and ethnic nationalities lived in an environment of mutual respect and solidarity. It 
established the paradigm of &#8220;<i>sumak kawsay</i>&#8221;, or &#8220;good living&#8221;, a concept originating from 
the peoples of the Andean region, which was rooted in the comprehensive development of 
all the citizens, peoples and nationalities of Ecuador without any form of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>7. Ecuador considered that it could demonstrate that it had moved from theory t 
practice in the fulfilment of human rights. Ecuador referred in particular to its efforts to 
combat poverty through sovereign economic policies. In response to social movements, the 
Government had declared illegitimate part of its public external debt, which had made it 
possible to increase its investment in production, roads and energy. Ecuador had also made 
important efforts with regard to the culture of tax payments, which had resulted in the 
collection of more taxes. Those efforts had resulted in a significant reduction of </p>


<p>unemployment and underemployment; and increased investment for education, health, 
housing, social security, environment, social inclusion and other areas. 
</p>
<p>8. Ecuador was currently a pioneer in the implementation of public policies of new 
collective rights, such as the fundamental right to water and the recognition of the rights of 
nature in the Constitution. In that regard, Ecuador had taken preventive measures and had 
restricted activities which could lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of 
ecosystems or the permanent alteration of natural cycles. 
</p>
<p>9. Ecuador had also taken significant steps to securing the right to food. The 
Constitution established the principle of food sovereignty and the rights of all persons and 
groups to have access to healthy, sufficient and nutritious food. More than half a million 
children had thus benefited through child development services. 
</p>
<p>10. The incidence of child labour had also decreased and child labour in garbage areas 
had been eradicated. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to the situation of economic, social and cultural rights, Ecuador noted 
that it had taken affirmative action to incorporate into the public sector persons who were 
part of priority groups, such as persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, Afro-
Ecuadorians and Montubio people, and women. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government had eliminated recruitment by hour, recruitment through 
intermediaries, and other forms of labour conditions that were considered a form of slavery. 
Ecuador was committed to decreasing the rate of unemployment and underemployment. 
The percentage of workers with social security affiliation had also grown in 2011. 
</p>
<p>13. As regards education, the Constitution established that education would be 
mandatory up to the secondary level and free up to the third university level. Ecuador had 
also significantly increased its spending on education. 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the right to health, Ecuador had established it as right to be fulfilled 
by the State, closely linked with the enjoyment of other rights, such as the right to water, 
food, education, physical education, work, social security, a good environment and other 
rights that formed the basis of good living. 
</p>
<p>15. As regards the right to housing, Ecuador had also made significant efforts. As at 
June 2011, 70.<footnote name="4">2. The Congo referred to international human rights instruments ratified by Ecuador; 
the strengthening of its constitutional framework and national mechanisms to protect 
human rights; the incorporation of a system of social rehabilitation for persons deprived of 
liberty and the improvement of the penitentiary system. 
</footnote> per cent of families had their own house. Housing bonuses had also been 
provided between 2008 and 2010 to improve the population&#8217;s living conditions. 
</p>
<p>16. On the subject of civil and political rights, Ecuador reported on initiatives to 
encourage a more active participation of the population in decision-making, and 
accountability mechanisms to combat corruption in all public and private sectors. For the 
first time, Ecuador had granted the right to vote to Ecuadorians living abroad, to persons 
deprived of their liberty and to members of the armed forces and police, and had lowered 
the minimum voting age to 16. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to the right to freedom of expression, Ecuador guaranteed to its 
inhabitants the right to free, intercultural, inclusive, diverse and participative 
communication in all areas of social interaction. It also guaranteed the right to information 
of quality without any censorship. The right of access to and use of radio frequencies and 
public televisions, private or communal, was also guaranteed in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>18. Ecuador made reference to reforms to the Criminal Code undertaken in 2009, such 
as the inclusion of the crime of genocide, in conformity with the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, as well as other reforms. 
</p>
<p>19. Ecuador further reported on progress made in the implementation of 
recommendations formulated during its first review in 2008 (A/HRC/8/20). </p>


<p>20. Concerning the penitentiary reform, improvement of conditions of persons deprived 
of their liberty and follow-up mechanisms (recommendations 1, 4 and 5), Ecuador made 
reference to provisions in the new Constitution establishing a comprehensive social 
rehabilitation system. Ecuador was receiving advisory services from the Centre of 
Excellence on Prison Reform and Drug Demand Reduction(launched by the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime), as well as from the National School of Penitentiary 
Administration of France. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the provision of human rights training to police forces 
(recommendation 2), that had been established in the Constitution and was ongoing. 
</p>
<p>22. The Constitution established the implementation of policies for the progressive 
eradication of child labour and provided special protection against other types of labour or 
economic exploitation (recommendation 3). 
</p>
<p>23. Concerning the mainstreaming of gender (recommendation 6), Ecuador had 
established a policy of incorporating a gender perspective into all public policies, 
programmes and projects. 
</p>
<p>24. Regarding discrimination on the grounds of sexual and gender identity 
(recommendation 7), Ecuador implemented measures to combat violations of human rights 
in respect of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and transvestite 
community. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to the eradication of gender-based violence and domestic violence 
(recommendation 8), Ecuador referred to provisions in the Constitution, as well as the 
setting up of a specialized body of judges to tackle those issues. 
</p>
<p>26. Regarding the reform of the judiciary (recommendation 9), Ecuador reported on a 
consultation and referendum held in 2011, and the implementation of a permanent training 
programme for government officials. 
</p>
<p>27. On trafficking in persons (recommendation 10), Ecuador reported that the national 
plan had been updated in December 2010. 
</p>
<p>28. Information on the important efforts made by Ecuador with regard to groups in 
situations of vulnerability and in need of priority attention was also provided. Reference 
was made to national efforts to combat poverty and extreme poverty, the human 
development bonus and credit programmes and the attention to persons with disabilities, 
children and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>29. The delegation further noted that the Constitution recognized the rights of asylum 
seekers and refugees, establishing important principles for their protection. It noted that 
Ecuador had been recognized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) as the country in Latin America with the highest rate of acceptance of 
refugees. 
</p>
<p>30. To conclude, the delegation indicated that Ecuador saw itself as a plurinational and 
intercultural State and therefore had placed emphasis on the rights of indigenous peoples, 
Afro-Ecuadorians and Montubio people. 
</p>

</p>

Constitution. Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>53. Ecuador thanked delegations for the generous comments made. It noted that the 
definition of a policy for the promotion and protection of human rights was the vital pillar 
that shaped the new Constitution. Ecuador was currently focused on generating conditions 
for &#8220;good living&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. The delegation indicated that persons deprived of their liberty were considered a 
priority group for State action. The budget had been increased and new detention centres to 
address overcrowding had been built. In addition, priority attention had been given to 
children who were living in the prisons with their mothers. Ecuador was also investing in

not stigmatized verbally or physically, nor had any equipment been confiscated. Ecuador 
was indeed trying to develop the work of journalists, guaranteeing the freedom of the press 
and the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>57. On the law on contempt, Ecuador noted that the current Criminal Code dated back to 
1938. For that reason, it had presented to the Assembly a new integral code. The code not 
only included new crimes, in accordance with the current needs of Ecuadorian society, but 
also established more efficient processes. With regard to the law on contempt in the new 
Criminal Code, Ecuador indicated that it had eliminated that law in the new legislation that 
was being promulgated. 
</p>
<p>58. On the issue of children of refugees, Ecuador noted that it was a pioneer and a model

fully integrated in the economy and the society. The country provided significant resources 
for the refugee population and was grateful for the assistance of the international 
community to UNHCR. Ecuador had been publicly recognized by UNHCR for its support 
and assistance to the refugee population.

</p>

treatment. Myanmar made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Nicaragua commended Ecuador for its National Plan for Good Living, and its shared 
vision to recognize the citizen as a subject of rights and centre of human development. It 
wished to be informed about actions being taken to address inequalities in the society. 
Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>80. In response to comments made by various delegations, Ecuador recalled that it 
considered the right to human development to be one of the key human rights guaranteed 
under government policies, at the heart of which was its successful <i>buen vivir </i>(good living) 
plan. Its poverty-reduction policy had been successful, leading to a sharp decrease in 
poverty between 2006 and 2011. 
</p>
<p>81. Regarding the comments made by Nicaragua, Ecuador emphasized that the 
inequality gap had narrowed, as recognized by the Economic Commission for Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Child labour had also been reduced and was no longer 
dependent on the economic cycle. Ecuador had grown accustomed to inequality, poverty 
and exclusion in the past, but the Plan for Good Living was helping to bring a previously 
ignored sector of the population to the forefront of public policy. 
</p>
<p>82. Turning to universal citizenship and migration policies, the delegation noted that the 
2008 Constitution recognized and protected the rights of migrants and their families. The 
right to migration had been established, and a person with migrant status could not be 
deemed illegal. Less restrictive policies on human mobility had been introduced, such as 
allowing foreign nationals to enter the country without a visa for 90 days, with their full 
rights guaranteed during their stay. The State had a duty to ensure that Ecuadorians living 
abroad enjoyed their rights. Those living abroad for economic reasons had been a 
Government priority, with special institutions established to cater for the needs of 
Ecuadorian migrants abroad, including ensuring they received social security benefits while 
overseas. Meanwhile, many Ecuadorians had returned home since the economic upturn. 
</p>
<p>83. With regard to comments on prior consultation with indigenous peoples, Ecuador 
had ratified International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, and the 2008 Constitution 
included prior consultation with indigenous peoples. The Constitution provided for 
indigenous communities to receive a share of development project profits and 
compensation where appropriate. Furthermore, the courts had stipulated how prior 
consultations should take place, requiring the participation of and dialogue with indigenous 
authorities, and the conducting of cultural, environmental and social impact studies prior to 
oil or mining projects. 
</p>
<p>84. With respect to the comment on preventing organized violent groups from 
establishing themselves in Ecuador, the delegation recalled that when violent situations had 
arisen in neighbouring countries, Ecuador had helped those countries while taking steps to 
prevent such problems occurring in its country. No organized groups were carrying out 
violent activities in Ecuador, but when they had occasionally entered Ecuador, the 
Government had detained, prosecuted or returned those responsible to their countries of 
origin. 
</p>
<p>85. There was a misperception that many people were currently held in prison for 
violent social protests, but the delegation stressed that only one person, an alleged student 
leader, had been prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned for a violent attack on the Vice-
Rector of the country&#8217;s main university. The delegation said that the 1938 Criminal Code 
was under review, since the crime of &#8220;sabotage&#8221;, as such violent acts were known under the 
Code, referred solely to paralysis of public services. </p>


<p>86. With regard to the issue raised by Hungary relating to the treatment of persons 
deprived of their liberty, the delegation clarified that convicted persons were always held 
separate from those awaiting trial.

<p>136. <b>The recommendations below did not enjoy the support of Ecuador which 
provided comments:</b> 
</p>
<p> 136.1. <b>Reform legislation regarding freedom of expression with a view to 
bringing it in conformity with international standards and those of the Inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>American Commission on Human Rights (Switzerland);</b> 
 The Ecuadorian State has signed and ratified the American Convention on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (Pact of San Jos&#233;), which clearly establishes the mandatory compliance of the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights&#8217; decisions, granting the latter the possibility 
to interpret and apply the norms of the previously mentioned Convention. For that 
reason, respectful as we are of our international obligations, we cannot accept to 
reform our legal framework in accordance with standards from the Inter-American 
Commission of Human Rights, when it is the Court, not the Commission, which has 
judicial competency over this matter. 
</p>
<p> 136.2. <b>Eliminate laws that criminalize opinion and accept visit requests 
from the OAS and the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Expression (United States of America);</b> 
 In Ecuador, there are no laws that &#8220;criminalize opinion&#8221;. As a consequence, we 
</p>
<p>cannot eliminate inexistent laws. It is important to mention that no requests from </p>


<p>Special Rapporteurs have been denied, both from the UN and the OAS. On the 
contrary, Ecuador maintains standing invitations for all Special Rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p> 136.3. <b>Establish clear consultation procedures in order to implement the 
right to free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples as contained in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Constitution (Germany);</b> 
 The Constitution of the Ecuadorian State establishes consultation as a right of all 
</p>
<p>Ecuadorians, but particularly for communities, peoples and nationalities, a previous, 
free and informed consultation, but not their consent. Additionally, it is necessary to 
indicate that Ecuador recognizes the existence of indigenous peoples living in 
voluntary isolation, with the consequent obligation of guaranteeing their lives, of 
respecting and making others respect their self-determination and will to remain in 
isolation, and defend the validity of their rights, which turns unviable obtaining their 
consent. 
</p>
<p>137. <b>All conclusions and/or recommendations contained in the present report reflect 
the position of the submitting State(s) and/or the State under review. They should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>be construed as endorsed by the Working Group as a whole.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Voluntary pledges and commitments 
</b></p>
<p>138. The State of Ecuador assumed the following voluntary commitments: 
</p>
<p> (a) To continue its efforts to implement a human rights information system with 
support from OHCHR; 
</p>
<p> (b) To share with the public sector and with civil society the recommendations 
and voluntary commitments from the second universal periodic review; 
</p>
<p> (c) To share the Ecuadorian experience and provide interested countries with 
assistance relating to its programmes in the field of inclusion of persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> (d) To develop monitoring mechanisms for following up the implementation of 
recommendations from the universal periodic review; 
</p>
<p> (e) To ratify communication procedures relating to human rights treaties. </p>
