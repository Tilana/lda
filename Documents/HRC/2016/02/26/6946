Development (A/HRC/4/47); 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Decides</i>: </p>
<p> (a) To act to ensure that its agenda promotes and advances sustainable development 
and the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and, in this regard, to agree on a 
programme of work that will lead to raising the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 
and 10 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, to the same level and on a par with 
all other human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the core human rights 
instruments; 
</p>
<p> (b) To endorse the road map outlined in paragraphs 52 to 54 of the report of the 
eighth session of the Working Group on the Right to Development, which would ensure that the 
criteria for the periodic evaluation of global partnerships, as identified in Millennium 
Development Goal 8, being progressively developed and refined by the Working Group with the 
support of the high-level task force, is extended to other components of Millennium 
Development Goal 8, by no later than 2009; 
</p>
<p> (c) That the above criteria, as endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as 
appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the 
implementation of the right to development;  
</p>
<p> (d) That, upon completion of the above phases, the Working Group will take 
appropriate steps for enforcing these standards, which could take various forms, including 
guidelines on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for 
consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature, through a collaborative 
process of engagement; 
</p>
<p> (e) To renew the mandate of the Working Group on the Right to Development for a 
period of two years, and that the Working Group shall convene annual sessions of five working 
days and present its reports to the Council; </p>

Development;

take all necessary measures and allocate necessary resources for the effective implementation of 
the present resolution;
