<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Sweden was held at the 11th meeting, on 
</p>
<p>26 January 2015. The delegation of Sweden was headed by Annika S&#246;der, State Secretary, 
</p>
<p>Ministry for Foreign Affairs. At its 17th meeting, held on 29 January 2015, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on Sweden. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Sweden: Argentina, Latvia and the Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Sweden: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/SWE/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/SWE/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/SWE/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Azerbaijan, Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Ecuador, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Sweden through the troika. Those 
</p>
<p>questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Sweden said that promoting and respecting human rights for all 
</p>
<p>was a core value and a central priority of the Government. Sweden appreciated that civil 
</p>
<p>society, including organizations representing indigenous peoples and national minorities, 
</p>
<p>had contributed to the preparations for the current UPR session.  
</p>
<p>6. In a statement of government policy, made in October 2014, the Prime Minister had 
</p>
<p>emphasized that racism and prejudices in society restricted people&#8217;s lives. Furthermore, he 
</p>
<p>had emphasized that there must be no place in Sweden for anti-Semitism, antiziganism, 
</p>
<p>Islamophobia or Afrophobia. The delegation explained that the fight against racism and 
</p>
<p>xenophobia involved awareness-raising, government contributions to non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, and continuing dialogue with groups subjected to racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>The Swedish police was currently carrying out an assignment to bolster its efforts to 
</p>
<p>combat hate crime.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation stated that it was essential to ensure the free exchange of opinions. 
</p>
<p>Although freedom of expression and freedom of the press were enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution of Sweden, constitutional laws also clearly regulated the content of 
</p>
<p>publications in such a case as the criminal offence of agitation against a national or ethnic 
</p>
<p>group. </p>


<p>8. The delegation stated that combating intolerance, hatred and violent extremism was 
</p>
<p>a global problem that needed to be dealt with collectively. The Government had recently 
</p>
<p>appointed a national coordinator against violent extremism.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that Sweden had a feminist government and that gender 
</p>
<p>equality was to permeate all government policies. The main tool in reaching that goal was 
</p>
<p>gender mainstreaming, as well as enhanced gender budgeting and work to combat violence 
</p>
<p>against women. 
</p>
<p>10. In 2014, Sweden had ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and 
</p>
<p>Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) and 
</p>
<p>introduced new legislation that strengthened the protection against forced marriage and 
</p>
<p>child marriage. 
</p>
<p>11. While the total pay gap between women and men had decreased by 3 percentage 
</p>
<p>points between 1994 and 2013, there was still a pay gap in Sweden of around 13 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The Government had appointed the Delegation for Gender Equality in Working Life to 
</p>
<p>investigate the different conditions for women and men and to propose actions to promote 
</p>
<p>gender equality and reduce the pay gap.  
</p>
<p>12. The delegation confirmed that the fight against all forms of discrimination, including 
</p>
<p>multiple discrimination, remained a key objective of the Government.  
</p>
<p>13. The Discrimination Act of 2009 had been amended on 1 January 2015 to include 
</p>
<p>inadequate accessibility for people with disabilities as a new form of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>14. A comprehensive strategy had been adopted in 2013 with the purpose of improving 
</p>
<p>and strengthening the situation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons 
</p>
<p>in Sweden. A committee of inquiry was currently looking into the question of whether 
</p>
<p>transgender persons should be protected by the criminal law provisions on hate crimes and 
</p>
<p>hate speech, which already covered the ground of sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>15. Strengthening the protection of national minority languages was an element in 
</p>
<p>protecting the rights of Sweden&#8217;s national minorities.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that the work aimed at eliminating discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Roma and antiziganism was a priority for the Government. The national strategy for Roma 
</p>
<p>inclusion, which had been adopted in 2012, placed special emphasis on the principle of 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination and on Roma participation and input for its implementation. A special 
</p>
<p>commission against antiziganism had been appointed.  
</p>
<p>17. The delegation reported that, in 2013, the media had exposed a police register of 
</p>
<p>over 4,000 people. According to the media, the main purpose for setting up the register had 
</p>
<p>been to map individuals on the basis of their Roma background. The investigation carried 
</p>
<p>out by the Commission on Security and Integrity Protection had concluded that the 
</p>
<p>processing of personal data by the police was against the law in several aspects. The Police 
</p>
<p>Authority had been commissioned to report to the Government in February 2015 on the 
</p>
<p>measures that had been taken to ensure that the legal framework was applied accurately and 
</p>
<p>that the required guidelines and administrative practices were in place to prevent any 
</p>
<p>discrimination. With regard to the affected individuals&#8217; entitlement to compensation, about 
</p>
<p>3,000 applications for compensation had already been approved. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation noted that since 2011, the Swedish Constitution had explicitly 
</p>
<p>recognized the Sami as a people. In 2011, Finland, Norway and Sweden had initiated 
</p>
<p>negotiations on a Nordic Sami convention.  
</p>
<p>19. In 2010, the right of the Sami Parliament to participate in municipal planning and to 
</p>
<p>monitor consideration of Sami needs, including reindeer husbandry interests in land and 
</p>
<p>water use, had been extended. Furthermore, the Minerals Act and Minerals Ordinance had </p>


<p>been amended in 2014 so as to increase Sami involvement in the process of issuing permits 
</p>
<p>for exploration for minerals.  
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the mental health challenges facing reindeer herders, notably their 
</p>
<p>increased risk of suicide, the Government had acknowledged that there was a need for more 
</p>
<p>efforts in order to reduce such risks; a number of proposals were being looked into.  
</p>
<p>21. Sweden was constantly seeking ways to strengthen the rights of the child, including 
</p>
<p>the rights of children to express their views on issues concerning them. Since October 2014, 
</p>
<p>preparatory work on the incorporation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into 
</p>
<p>Swedish legislation had been prioritized by the Government. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation explained that in 2014, approximately 7,000 unaccompanied minors 
</p>
<p>had applied for asylum in Sweden and that the best interests of the child were always to be 
</p>
<p>taken into account. The Swedish Migration Board had worked actively to trace the minors&#8217; 
</p>
<p>parents or other guardians.  
</p>
<p>23. More than 6,000 persons under the age of 18, with residence in Sweden, were 
</p>
<p>stateless. The delegation noted that the recognition of the State of Palestine would give 
</p>
<p>most of those children citizenship. Amendments to the Swedish Citizenship Act, with the 
</p>
<p>aim of reducing statelessness, would enter into force on 1 April 2015.  
</p>
<p>24. The delegation stated that, in Sweden, pretrial detention and restrictions should only 
</p>
<p>be used when necessary and proportionate. The reasons for the detention were regularly 
</p>
<p>reviewed. It was important that the length of the pretrial detention be kept as short as 
</p>
<p>possible and that only necessary restrictions be used. The Prosecution Authority and the 
</p>
<p>Prison and Probation Service were both taking steps to reduce the isolation of detainees.  
</p>
<p>25. The Government was also examining ways of improving the overall situation for 
</p>
<p>young offenders, including finding ways to ease any solitary confinement of young 
</p>
<p>detainees.  
</p>
<p>26. The delegation reported that Sweden combined strong protection of the rights of the 
</p>
<p>individual with efforts to prevent any interference with the right to privacy. The Foreign 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Act and the Signals Intelligence Act contained mechanisms for legal security 
</p>
<p>and control to ensure that the requirement of integrity protection was met.  
</p>
<p>27. The delegation stated that signals intelligence at the National Defence Radio 
</p>
<p>Establishment was conducted within the detailed framework of Swedish legislation, under 
</p>
<p>strict judicial control and with parliamentary oversight. The Government reported to 
</p>
<p>Parliament annually, through a written communication, on the signals surveillance 
</p>
<p>conducted under the Act. The system was aimed at ensuring that signals intelligence was 
</p>
<p>carried out in accordance with the national legislation protecting privacy as well as with the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>28. On the issue of investigations into alleged police misconduct, the delegation referred 
</p>
<p>to the establishment on 1 January 2015, at the national level, of the independent and 
</p>
<p>separate Department of Special Investigations, within the Swedish police.  
</p>
<p>29. The delegation reported that the Government, in its budget bill for 2015, had 
</p>
<p>announced that it intended to deliver to Parliament a systematic strategy for human rights 
</p>
<p>work in Sweden, one important aspect of which was to set out how independent monitoring 
</p>
<p>of the implementation of human rights in the country could be organized. 
</p>

<p>starting from 1 January 2013. 
</p>
<p>34. Belgium welcomed the progress made on children&#8217;s rights. It enquired whether the

<p>57. Togo noted that despite progress in the fight against discrimination, difficulties 
</p>
<p>remained regarding racism. Persons with a migrant background and Swedes of African 
</p>

</p>
<p>institutions. 
</p>
<p>61. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognized Sweden&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>prioritization of human rights. It acknowledged protections against discrimination, but 
</p>
<p>recognized outstanding challenges impacting on vulnerable groups, including the Roma, 
</p>
<p>and urged enhanced protections for stateless persons.  
</p>

</p>
<p>for judges investigating human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>63. Uzbekistan commended the national action plans, the establishment of the office of 
</p>

</p>
<p>66. Angola welcomed the measures taken to raise children&#8217;s and adolescents&#8217; awareness 
</p>
<p>about xenophobia and similar forms of intolerance. It noted Sweden&#8217;s efforts to comply 
</p>
<p>with its international commitments to protect the rights of vulnerable persons, particularly 
</p>
<p>migrants. 
</p>
<p>67. Argentina commended Sweden for its new 2014 and 2015 action plan for the 
</p>
<p>protection of children against human trafficking, sexual exploitation and sexual assault, and 
</p>
<p>for the legislative efforts made to combat discrimination.  
</p>
<p>68. Armenia lauded the ongoing measures for gender equality, alongside provisions for 
</p>
<p>children and persons with disabilities. It commended the protection of the rights of national 
</p>
<p>minorities, as well as the free exercise of the cultural and religious rights of persons of 
</p>
<p>Armenian origin living in Sweden.  
</p>
<p>69. Australia praised the consistent respect for human rights and civil liberties, 
</p>
<p>specifically the promotion of gender equality and elimination of violence against women. It 
</p>
<p>commended the inquiry commissioned in 2014 to consider a specific provision on 
</p>
<p>criminalizing torture in Swedish law.  </p>


<p>70. Austria commended Sweden&#8217;s commitment to the global advancement of human 
</p>
<p>rights. Austria remained concerned at reports of discrimination against the Sami, 
</p>
<p>particularly in relation to land rights, water and resources. It referred to concern on the part 
</p>
<p>of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at increased reports of 
</p>
<p>racially motivated hate speech and hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>71. Azerbaijan noted concerns expressed by some treaty bodies about discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and racist attitudes against Muslims, Afro-Swedes, Roma and Jews, attacks 
</p>
<p>against the places of worship of religious minorities, and the increasingly high rate of 
</p>
<p>suicide among persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>72. Replying to comments made and questions raised, Sweden stated that it had 
</p>
<p>extensive legislation in place that could be used to punish various expressions of racism, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia, religious intolerance, homophobia and transphobia. The assignment given to 
</p>
<p>the Swedish police was aimed at improving the rate of resolved hate crime cases; that report 
</p>
<p>would be followed up on. 
</p>
<p>73. The delegation stated that most penal provisions relevant to combating hate speech 
</p>
<p>and hate crime also applied to crimes committed online. 
</p>
<p>74. In response to the recent attacks against Swedish mosques, the Swedish police had

</p>
<p>hate crimes.  
</p>

</p>
<p>for permits to conduct signals intelligence. All signal intelligence that a national defence </p>


<p>radio establishment might conduct required a permit from the Foreign Intelligence Court, 
</p>
<p>whose aim it was to limit intrusions in individual privacy.  
</p>
<p>144. In closing, the Swedish delegation thanked all the delegations that had asked 
</p>
<p>questions and made recommendations. The UPR was an important opportunity to reflect on
